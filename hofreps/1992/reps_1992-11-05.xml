The Committee's change of name underscores the fact that, with the establishment of self-government in the ACT, the Federal Parliament's interest in Canberra is now directed only to issues which are of national significance and which affect the role of Canberra as the national capital. I intend to ensure through the Committee's work that this Parliament and the wider Australian community remain aware of, and interested in, the future of our national capital, especially in the lead-up to the centenary of federation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A short time ago a national survey was conducted of what Australians think of Canberra. Contrary to the image portrayed so widely by the media, most Australians are proud of their national capital and eight out of 10 think it is important that Australians should feel proud about their national capital. Essential to the design of Canberra has always been the open spaces, especially the hills, ridges and buffer zones which have been either left in, or restored to, a state which is as natural as possible. Few people would think of Canberra without also thinking about the more formal parks and gardens within the built-up areas. Some of these areas of open space are so important to the character of our bush capital that the Commonwealth has sought to retain control over the way they are protected and managed. Collectively, these areas are known as the national capital open space system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the Committee's inquiry was to examine how effectively the national capital open space system is protected and managed. The Commonwealth's interest in the future of the national capital is set out in the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988. Its policies for the national capital open space system are set out under the national capital plan and the national capital plan is implemented by the National Capital Planning Authority, either directly or through ACT Government agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though this legislative and administrative framework was put in place before ACT self-government, the same confusion and distrust which have always dogged Commonwealth-State relations in this country have begun to emerge in the ACT. Our recommendations aim to overcome this problem before it becomes any further entrenched. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The combination of Commonwealth and ACT legislation, which applies to the definition, protection and management of the national capital open space system, has created a confusing collection of categories of land under the Commonwealth's national capital plan and the ACT's territory plan. For example, what is called the national capital open space system under the national capital plan is called the metropolitan open space system under the territory plan. The Committee has recommended that the Commonwealth and ACT planning authorities clarify and resolve the inconsistencies in definitions, boundaries and permitted land use within the national capital open space system. We have asked them to make sure that the information is presented in a way which the community can understand. There is also confusion about whether the planning and environment legislation passed last year by the ACT Government applies to areas designated under the Commonwealth's national capital plan. We have recommended that this be sorted out urgently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some key areas within the national capital open space system, the NCPA is yet to specify the policies and standards according to which the land should be managed. In each case a management plan also needs to be prepared by the ACT Parks and Conservation Service to comply with these policies and standards. Detailed policies for the inner hills and the Molonglo River corridor should be completed as soon as possible and those for the Murrumbidgee River corridor in the Namadgi National Park need to be updated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, management plans for the inner hills, the Murrumbidgee River corridor, Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve and Lanyon Bowl should be finalised as a matter of priority. The Committee has also concluded that there are some areas which probably should be incorporated into the national capital open space system. We have recommended that the possibility of adding Callum Brae, the Molonglo River corridor, Castle Hill and Rob Roy Range and Tuggeranong Hill should be investigated. We also want to see the ecological values of Mount Painter, the Molonglo Gorge and Stirling Ridge better protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The protection of the national capital open space system involves co-operation between the ACT and Commonwealth Governments, and also effective liaison with the State and local governments of New South Wales. To this end the Committee has recommended that the ACT and Commonwealth Governments should be represented on the Murrumbidgee River catchment management committee. We have also recommended that the Commonwealth contribute $500,000 for management work in the Googong Dam subcatchment and that it continue to contribute to the Lake Burley Griffin catchment protection scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where guidelines have either not been set or not been met, the cause has really been a lack of will among the agencies concerned. The National Capital Planning Authority  has not been given sufficient resources to meet the responsibilities given to it by this Parliament. It is not being adequately funded to maintain existing infrastructure, let alone to improve it. So the Committee has called on the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories to ensure that this omission is quickly corrected. Moreover, the financial burden placed on the ACT Government as a result of its additional responsibilities under the national capital plan has still not been calculated accurately. The Committee has recommended that these additional costs should be identified as the management plans for the different elements of the national capital open space system are developed and that additional Commonwealth funding should then be provided on a case by case basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee found widespread pride within the local community concerning the open spaces of Canberra, although this does not mean that there is unanimity about the priorities which should be given to the various uses of the land. The open spaces provide, most importantly, for the conservation of plants and animal species but they also serve a purpose in urban design and infrastructure, forestry and rural activities. They provide a resource for research and education; they are historically and culturally significant; and they allow a variety of tourism and recreational pursuits. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Canberra care about this city. Without the support of the local community, it is unlikely that Canberra would continue to be a national capital about which most Australians want to be proud and which people from overseas admire. The need for community support has been recognised to some extent in the consultative procedures which must take place when planning proposals are being considered, but the community should be involved more closely in the implementation of the national capital plan, particularly with regard to the open spaces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has recommended that this be achieved, firstly, informally through the establishment of an organisation of friends of the national capital open space system and, secondly, formally through an advisory committee, comprising community representatives and local and Commonwealth Government planners, which would advise the board of the National Capital Planning Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all, we have made 40 recommendations in the report&mdash;more than I can cover this morning&mdash;and I urge honourable members to have a look at them. The final recommendation which I want to mention before time runs out has to do with my earlier comments about the pride which Australians have, and want to have, in their national capital. It also has to do with the fact that Canberra is a city about which we should be proud because it has qualities which are recognised around the world as unique and desirable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is of the view that a strong case could be made to have the parts of Canberra which were designed by Walter and Marion Burley Griffin, and the surrounding hills and open spaces, listed as a World Heritage site.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, such a proposal would require careful consideration by the Commonwealth and ACT governments, but the Committee believes that it is thoroughly worth investigating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If nothing else, the exercise of looking into the idea of World Heritage listing might redirect the focus of public debate about Canberra from being a forum for whingers, knockers and those who think they have something to gain by dividing the Australian community to being a chance to take stock of how successful Australia has been in transforming its bush capital into a national capital.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this report of the Joint Committee on the National Capital. I believe that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Our bush capital: protecting and managing the national capital's open spaces</EMPHASIS> will prove to be a very popular, useful and widely read document, not only in the ACT but in other States and cities throughout Australia. Although the report deals specifically with Canberra and the ACT, much of the information it contains and the issues it canvasses are of general interest and relevance to the protection and management of other areas of special significance, particularly those where environmental and conservation matters are major concerns and considerations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of Canberra's greatest natural assets is its magnificent natural landscape setting, which reflects both the past and present character and heritage of our national capital. Features such as the inner hills and Lake Burley Griffin are important aesthetic elements, but it is the open spaces, public gardens, parklands and nature reserves that make Canberra unique. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The woodland and bushland areas located within the precincts of the city and its suburbs not only protect and enhance sites of natural and cultural importance, but are habitats for native flora and fauna. The open spaces are, quite literally, the breathing spaces for the native plant and animal communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For these and other reasons, the national capital open space system is a very precious and irreplaceable asset. Fortunately, both the Commonwealth and Territory governments recognise the fact that good planning and management of the NCOSS is vital, and that responsibility, including financial responsibility, for the preservation and development of the open space system should be shared between the Commonwealth and the Territory. It is important to ensure that the correct balance is maintained between the protection, conservation and utilisation of the open space system and the future development of the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Current and future planning and management arrangements and practices must take account of long term environmental considerations, as well as reflecting community needs and expectations. The challenges involved are quite daunting, and there are several important basic requirements which must be met. Firstly, there must be effective coordination, communication and, most importantly, cooperation between the various authorities responsible for the area. Secondly, there must be adequate and appropriate legislation. Thirdly, as mentioned by the Committee Chairman, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), in his tabling speech, there must be a high level of community interest and support. This latter objective will only be achieved through community understanding and acceptance of the overall planning, management and conservation strategies, a fact which is acknowledged in the preface to the report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry into the management of nationally significant areas of open space in the ACT brought to the fore the need to distinguish between Canberra as the National Capital and Canberra as home to 300,000 Australians. Preserving the special character of our National Capital while meeting the requirements of one of the most rapidly growing regions in Australia is likely to become an increasingly complex task. The inquiry showed that achieving this task is not possible without the support of the local community. Canberra has become a national capital which is admired internationally largely as a result of the pride and commitment shown by its residents.</PARA>
<PARA>The citizens of Canberra are a vital link in the nature conservation and environment management chain. Therefore, community participation and involvement must be encouraged, from the point of view of both identifying the problems and investigating, accepting and implementing the possible solutions. Fortunately, the powers that be have recognised this need and have created opportunities for Canberra residents to share in the management and planning processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A community awareness program to increase and enhance community appreciation of Canberra Nature Park commenced early in 1988. In 1989, invitations to register interest in participating in management planning for the CNP were distributed to every household in Canberra. Almost 4,000 replies were received to these invitations. Those who had expressed their interest were provided with further information and invited to make submissions. The response was outstanding, with almost 600 submissions being received from individuals and organisations. The comments, suggestions and information contained in these submissions were duly considered, and many were incorporated into the draft management plan for the Canberra Nature Park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example of a community involvement initiative is Park Care. The Park Care program began in 1989, within the Canberra Nature Park. It has since been extended to cover all nature reserves managed by the ACT Parks and Conservation Service. More than 500 volunteers are involved. Current park care activities include woody and annual weed removal; seed collection, propagation and planting; removal of litter; and wildlife surveys. Possible future activities include trail maintenance and soil conservation works. The Joint Committee on the National Capital is another forum which provides opportunities for input from, and consultation with, local groups and individuals. The contribution made by residents of the ACT to this report has been invaluable and is greatly appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the limited time available this morning, I would also like to mention another very important aspect of this report. In chapter 3, the approach taken by the Committee in conducting this inquiry into the protection and management of the national capital's open spaces is explained. Initially, we examined the key values at stake in the NCOSS, particularly the inner hills component: how they are perceived by different groups within the community, and the issues which arise from protecting or providing for this range of values.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to receiving numerous carefully prepared and very informative submissions, the Committee also conducted public hearings, inspections and briefings. The Committee heard from a broad cross-section of interests, including recreational users, voluntary park care groups, residents, rural lessees, conservation groups, professional associations, geologists and bird watchers, as well as the organisations and authorities responsible for planning and management. The key values nominated were: ecological and nature conservation values, science and education, catchment protection, symbolism and landscape setting, cultural heritage protection, recreation and tourism, forestry, rural use, definition of urban structure and provision for urban infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maintaining these values relies on proper management and, during the inquiry, a number of serious management problems were identified which threaten the protection of these values. They included: weeds and feral and domestic animals, urban expansion and urban servicing, bushfires, grazing effects, water quality decline and recreational impacts. In chapter 7 of the report these problems and the present management strategies are briefly reviewed, and some suggestions are made on additional measures which may be appropriate, although the Committee acknowledges the fact that it is not within the scope of this inquiry to make detailed recommendations about each of these management issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention some of these problems and the Committee's recommendations for dealing with them. Not only are they particularly significant in the context of this report, but they are also very relevant to many other areas throughout Australia. In regard to these matters, the Canberra experience is by no means unique. The same lessons must be learned, and the same suggested solutions may be readily applied with considerable benefit and advantage elsewhere. One obvious example is the impact and effect of introduced and translocated flora and fauna. In some instances, exotic species may be effectively controlled by natural predators or diseases, but this is usually the exception rather than the rule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most introduced species have no natural means of control and increase rapidly, quite often with disastrous results. They compete with native plants and animals for the available resources, which are frequently very limited. Not only do exotic and pest species have the potential to reduce the diversity of native species but they may also modify and/or degrade natural landscapes and habitats and native bushland to such a significant degree that extensive and expensive rehabilitation may be required to restore devastated areas to their original condition. Some may never recover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite often the destruction that may be caused by uncontrolled and invasive exotic or pest plants is the accidental result of the actions of people who are unaware of the problems certain plant species may cause. Many of these problem plants are readily available from nurseries and other retail outlets and are planted in well cared for gardens by well intentioned citizens. Little do they realise that once these plants escape the confines of the gardens, which they are designed by nature to do, they are no longer prized botanical specimens but weeds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to emphasise that many of the concerns raised about domestic animals and their destructive impact on the environment are the result of the irresponsible, uncaring attitudes adopted by some of their owners. The animals themselves are not necessarily to blame. In addition to highlighting some of the specific problems created by these animals in the ACT, I believe the report makes a very useful contribution to the wider debate on this important environmental management issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I strongly recommend that all honourable members obtain a copy of this report and take their time to read it, because it contains a wealth of important information about issues which affect&mdash;and therefore should concern&mdash;us all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to speak today on the tabling of the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian law in Antarctica</EMPHASIS>. The report is the result of a two-year-long inquiry into the adequacy of the legal regimes that apply to the Australian Antarctic Territory and to the Heard Island and McDonald Islands Territory. The report follows on&mdash;perhaps we should call it a sequel&mdash;from the Committee's earlier examination of the legal regimes of Australia's Pacific and Indian Ocean Territories. The Committee's findings in relation to these Territories were published in the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islands in the sun</EMPHASIS> which was tabled in the House last March.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of principles enunciated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islands in the sun</EMPHASIS> find voice again in the current report. In the time available, I would like to refer to some of the key findings described in the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian law in Antarctica</EMPHASIS>. The Committee has found that there are significant shortcomings in the legal regimes of our Antarctic and subantarctic Territories. There are deficiencies in the nature and structure of the legal regimes. There are shortcomings in the way in which the law is applied and there are gaps in the extent to which the law covers important issues. We have made recommendations to overcome each of these problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of these recommendations relates to the nature and structure of the legal regimes. The Antarctic Territory, Heard Island and the McDonald Islands Territory are presently governed by a legislative brew. It includes Commonwealth laws expressed to apply to the Territories; Commonwealth laws, which can be interpreted as extending to the Territories; ordinances made by the Governor-General; criminal law of the Jervis Bay Territory; and the laws, other than criminal laws, of the ACT. Some of the problems with a legal regime of this type are immediately evident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The law is complex in origin and the true scope of the law is unclear. For example, the Committee was told that, in addition to the Commonwealth laws which specifically mention the Territory, there may be up to 170 separate Acts which could be held to extend to the Territories. Much of the body of laws is irrelevant to the Territories. Many of the laws of the ACT have no relevance to situations and circumstances likely to arise in the Antarctic Territory or the Heard and McDonald Islands Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of this shaky foundation are two other elements which further undermine the effectiveness of the current legal regime. They are, firstly, the current practice of not applying Australian laws to foreign nationals operating in Australian Antarctic Territory and, secondly, the very real practical difficulties of enforcing laws in remote and isolated environments. As described in the report, there is some confusion about whether the terms of the Antarctic Treaty constrain our enforcement agencies in applying Australian law to foreign nationals. This confusion centres on subsection 1 of article VIII of the Antarctic Treaty, the purpose of which is to ensure that scientific personnel are subject only to the jurisdiction of their own country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it has become the common view within some areas of government administration that the limitation extends to exclude all foreign nationals from the operation of foreign law. The Committee holds that that is not true. Subsection 1 of article VIII is explicit in stating that the exclusion of scientific personnel applies:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . without prejudice to the respective positions of the Contracting Parties relating to jurisdiction over all other persons in Antarctica . . .</PARA>
<PARA>We consider that it is in Australia's sovereign interests and consistent with our international obligations under the Treaty to extend and apply Australian law to foreign nationals, other than scientific personnel, in the Australian Antarctic Territory. The Government should adopt this approach as a matter of principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The misconception about Australia's ability to enforce its laws has been longstanding. In the report, we highlight a number of examples where Australian law has not been applied to foreign nationals. In particular, the Committee is concerned about the practice of not applying laws which are expressly extended to the Antarctic Territory. One example relates to the exploitation of fishing resources off the coast of the Antarctic Territory. The Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Act 1981, which implements the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, prohibits unauthorised fishing by Australian and foreign nationals in the waters adjacent to the Antarctic Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the effect of that Act has been overridden by amendments to the Commonwealth fisheries legislation, the effect of which is to regulate the fishing activities of Australian nationals but not those of foreign nationals. Not only has this action contravened the express intention of parliament, and run contrary to Australia's international treaty obligations, but it sits ill with Australia's claim to sovereignty over the Territory. Other examples are cited in the report of where administrative inaction has resulted in the non-application of laws which parliament has clearly intended to extend to the Antarctic and subantarctic Territories. The Air Navigation Act 1920 and the Civil Aviation Act 1988 are two such examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current inconsistency between legislative intent and administrative practice is totally unacceptable. Commonwealth law should be applied and enforced or, if there are good policy reasons for not applying the law in particular circumstances, then the law should be amended. Judgments about whom to exempt from Australian jurisdiction should be based on legislative decisions, not administrative inaction. These various considerations have led the Committee to conclude that the existing legal regime is overly complex, unwieldy and fails to reflect our substantial commitment to the Antarctic Territory. In short, the regime is in desperate need of reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee identified two possible approaches to reform. The first was to develop a specific code of law for the Antarctic Territory, tailored to the special circumstances of the Territory, and based on Commonwealth law and a selection of relevant State or Territory laws. The alternative was to appropriate the laws of a State or Territory while maintaining a role for the Commonwealth in overriding or modifying the body of law as required, thus ensuring that the regime is suitable for the particular circumstances of the Antarctic Territory. For reasons of cost and convenience, we consider the second approach to be more realistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To resolve the question of which body of law should be used as a basis for the new legal regime in the Antarctic Territory, the Committee used the principles outlined in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islands in the sun</EMPHASIS> that the laws of the closest mainland State or Territory should be applied to an external Territory, and decided that the laws of Tasmania should apply to the Antarctic Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee came to a similar conclusion in relation to Heard Island and McDonald Islands Territory, with one significant difference. We have recommended that the Heard Island and McDonald Islands Territory should be incorporated as a part of the State of Tasmania. In coming to this view, the Committee was mindful of the following facts: the islands are uninhabited; Australia's sovereignty over the islands is not disputed; and, unlike the Antarctic Territory, Australia is not under any international obligations in relation to the management of Heard Island or McDonald Islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I proceed to some specific gaps in the current legal regime, I would like to thank the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), who oversighted the Committee as a whole and the work that I undertook as the chair of the Subcommittee. I would like to commend the work of Grant Harrison and the Committee secretariat: Lorraine Ball, who worked with us for a long time and who now, unfortunately, has left for greener pastures; and Louise Carney, who also assisted with the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of the time, I will only be able to mention a number of particular points, but there are some specific gaps that are appropriate to mention. It is clear from the evidence presented to the Committee that the current regime is inadequate for the regulation of tourism in the Antarctic Territory and that Australia does not have the necessary infrastructure to deal with unauthorised entry to the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a new problem. It attracted the attention of the House previously, and was noted in the 1989 report of the House of Representatives Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tourism in Antarctica</EMPHASIS>. But with the ever increasing number of people visiting the Territory, it gives urgency to the need to properly protect the environment against environmental damage, pollution from tourist ships, criminal damage to property and other offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During our hearings in Hobart, the real potential for damage was illustrated by the retelling of an incident involving theft by tourists of heritage material from Macquarie Island. The regulation of tourism should be based on more than just administrative guidelines, it needs legally enforceable and internationally recognised protocols. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Towards this end, the Committee urges the Government to actively support the development of an annexe covering tourism as part of the Antarctic Treaty's protocol on environmental protection. Concern over the impact of tourism in Antarctica raises a broader issue about the protection of the wilderness values of the region. Our commitment to that is clear, and the Committee believes that Australia's obligation to the protocol and environmental protection would be best met by declaring the Antarctic Territory to be a nature reserve under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other specific matters which time does not permit me to mention. I conclude my remarks this morning with the words of Sir Douglas Mawson, which preface this report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Powerless, one was under the spell of an all-enfolding wonder.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The postscript of the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) was to be my introduction. There is no more magic a part of the world than that which this report of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian law in Antarctica</EMPHASIS>, refers to. Although I have not visited it, a relative of mine has been an expeditioner on a number of occasions, so I know a good deal of the Territory from him and from other sources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nature of this report obviously owes much to the staff of the Committee and to the honourable member for Denison. To the staff&mdash;in particular, Grant Harrison and Lorraine Ball&mdash;I extend my thanks and congratulations, as the report is a good one and follows very much in the succession of others that have been prepared in the series relating to the legal status of Australia's Territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, having defined the magic of Antarctica, I really want to spend a few moments looking at the recommendations of the Committee and express my concern that, in some respects, I do not think that the Committee has advantaged what all of us accept as the prior responsibility of this Parliament&mdash;that is, to determine the best way by which Australia can maintain its sovereignty. If we look at the nature of the Antarctic Treaty and the characteristic of successive governments in seeking to protect and preserve our relationship with Antarctica through that Treaty, we must come to the conclusion that unless we define the specific legal regimes to which those who are not members of the Antarctic Treaty must be obliged, there will obviously be difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, from the Parliament's point of view, we need to take note that not only are there some countries that do not accept Australia's sovereignty but also that there are some which protest and assert that there should be a significant alternative in the ownership and operation of Antarctica. I say to the children up there in the gallery that it is one part of the world they should read about and find out about, because it is a very special part of Australia. We are trying to define a way in which we can&mdash;for their generation and for future generations&mdash;retain that special association with the past. The honourable member for Denison referred to Sir Douglas Mawson, one of the original pioneers of Antarctic exploration. We have to look at a way in which we might be able to retain that direct association so that Australians of the future can be as proud of that Territory of Australia as we are today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to comment specifically on those areas of the report&mdash;the majority recommendations&mdash;from which I and other colleagues have dissented. We, of course, accept the vital nature of the Antarctic environment. Indeed, the protocol of environment protection to the Antarctic Treaty designates Antarctica as a natural reserve; it establishes a legal binding regime for environmental management and protection; and it identifies a number of specific areas where there is to be an extension and enhancement of present activities to warrant environmental protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the reservations we have expressed, we are not saying that the protection of the environment of Antarctica should be weakened in any way. We are saying that we are concerned that this Parliament has not allocated sufficient resources to the Antarctic Division to pursue the full ambit of scientific exploration that we see as desirable and necessary and, at the same time, to exercise the sovereignty that we claim. There are obviously problems at this time when the domestic economy is in such a mess and when the Government really is, in our view, overspending in a lot of areas, with inadequate resources going to areas of prime citizen need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to look at how we can best utilise those resources that are made available for the Antarctic Division for Australia's exercising of its responsibilities under the Antarctic Treaty and in other ways so that we can get the best value for money. The reservation that we have lodged really says that we do not think the Committee's recommendations&mdash;were they to be adopted by the Government&mdash;would give us the best value for that limited resource that is available. It is on that basis&mdash;not in any way questioning the need for environmental protection, nor the way in which the Antarctic Division is exercising its responsibility, but rather the extent to which we can get the best value for money&mdash;that it should be directed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the first recommendation with which we dissent is recommendation 10, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Australian Antarctic Territory be declared a nature reserve under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA>Our trouble with that is that it immediately establishes another area of responsibility within the Federal Government without providing the additional resources to administer that particular responsibility. It certainly is my concern, as it is with my colleagues, that if we are going to have rangers in that isolated environment under the stress of what can be severe winter conditions, then we are not really going to be able to have a duopoly of responsibility. Somebody has to be exercising absolute responsibility. For that reason we believe that whoever is head of the Australian Antarctic expeditioners on each occasion should be the person who has to accept that higher responsibility. It is not possible to have rangers or anybody else going through some other chain of command without disrupting what is the very difficult balancing act of maintaining relationships between individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not simply a matter of our saying, in our opposition to recommendation 10, that we do not think people should be protecting the environment, we are questioning whether the recommendation achieves what the Committee sought. For that reason we think it is far better to give to individual officers of the Antarctic Division the same responsibility as is given to rangers. Expeditioners could be identified specifically with that role but they should be made responsible to the Antarctic Division instead of being responsible separately to another department and another agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our second area of concern is with respect to Heard and McDonald Islands. Again our trouble there is the allocation and availability of resources. It is true that in looking at Heard and McDonald Islands we have suggested in earlier reports that responsibility should be transferred to the closest State government. In respect to Heard Island that would mean it be transferred to Western Australia. However, in this report we recommended Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our concern with this particular recommendation is that the Tasmanian Government, or for that matter any other State government, would not have the resources available to administer the island. They are remote. They are inhospitable. The only way to exercise the responsibilities that are identified in the report is by allowing the Commonwealth, and particularly the Antarctic Division, to maintain the role it now enjoys. If we are going to have to take Tasmanian officials there via the Antarctic Division then it is far better for the Antarctic Division to retain its responsibility. For that reason we oppose recommendation 11. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to declare it a nature reserve under the Tasmanian National Parks and Wildlife Act, as is recommended, then we are going to place yet another demand on public sector funds without identifiable benefit. I do not accept that that is the way to go. Equally, declaring the adjacent waters a marine reserve under the Tasmanian Act, as is also recommended, again involves duplication of resources and will cause a greater demand than available resources permit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third qualification to recommendation 11 refers to a plan of management under the Tasmanian National Parks and Wildlife Act. Again, there is no point in handing it over to the State. It is far better for that responsibility to be exercised by the Commonwealth, which under all conditions will have to provide the services to care for the people there. It is a matter of utilisation of resources that suggests that should be so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other recommendation that we oppose is recommendation 12, the acceleration of the World Heritage listing for Heard Island. My trouble really at a personal level is that I am really not happy with the way in which Lord Howe Island is being administered as an island declared under the World Heritage listing. But that has no specific bearing on this. We recognise the Government has already lodged an application for World Heritage listing and that is identified in paragraph 5.27 of the report. But there is no need to accelerate it. The important thing about the environment is how we administer it, not the label we give to it. For that reason we do not believe there is any reason to accelerate the listing. It is better to ensure that at Heard, McDonald, and in the Australian Antarctic Territory, we maintain, to the greatest degree possible, that high level of environment protection that is set out in the Antarctic Treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the report to the Government. I believe that with the exception of those three recommendations, from which my colleagues and I dissent, the report is an excellent one. But above all I commend to future generations of Australians the care and concern for what is still a very special part of this country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to join my colleagues the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) and the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) in speaking briefly on the report of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian law in Antarctica</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report follows on from a wider brief which the Committee has had throughout the life of this Parliament to examine the legal regimes which apply to the Australian Territories. I am pleased to be able to note that the Government has accepted the Committee's first report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islands in the sun</EMPHASIS>, in relation to Norfolk, Cocos (Keeling) and Christmas Islands and I would very much urge that the Government give the same favourable consideration to the recommendations contained in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia does have a very long and proud history of involvement in Antarctica. Australia's history of Antarctic exploration began in the years between 1911 and 1914 with Sir Douglas Mawson's first Australian Antarctic expedition. This was followed in 1929 by the British, Australian and New Zealand Antarctic research expedition, which also was led by Mawson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This tradition has been continued and developed over the years by the excellent work of the members of the Australian national Antarctic research expeditions. Australia currently does staff permanent bases in our Territory. In recent years Australia's international reputation has also been enhanced, I believe, by the Government's lead and initiative in relation to the banning of mining in Antarctica and the Australian sponsorship of the move to have Antarctica declared a worldwide environmental reserve so that this pristine continent is maintained for the benefit of the entire world and for future generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this report the Committee has reviewed the existing legal regimes for the Australian Antarctic Territory, Heard Island and McDonald Islands. We have concluded, as the previous speaker has indicated, that we believe the legal regimes as they currently apply to be complex, very unwieldy and certainly very much in need of urgent reform. At present the legal regime is a mix of Commonwealth law, Jervis Bay and Australian Capital Territory laws. As we have done in our previous report, the essence of the Committee's recommendations is to recommend that the law of the nearest State become the living body of law to apply in the Australian Territory. In this case it will be the law of Tasmania. This has the advantage that, rather than being a fixed piece of law which over time becomes extremely difficult to find as well as becoming increasingly out of date, by applying the law of the nearest State, in this case Tasmania, the law will develop with changing circumstances. Of course, the Commonwealth will retain the ability to select those laws which are inappropriate and to nominate those particular laws so that the law does properly reflect the very special circumstances which exist in that Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other key issue to develop is the point raised by the honourable member for Denison in relation to this conflict, I suppose, that exists between Australia's claim for sovereignty over a large part of the continent, our international obligations under the Antarctic Treaty and the fact that our sovereignty is not recognised by many other countries. What we believe should happen is that the Australian law should be enforced. We do not believe that this is in any way in conflict with our Treaty obligations but will enforce our claim to sovereignty. Our failure to enforce law in the past, we believe, has in some way diminished our claim to sovereignty. So, given that the debate is brief, I commend the recommendations in the Committee's report to the House. There was a dissenting report, as outlined by the right honourable member for New England, but essentially the Committee was as one in terms of its broad direction in relation to where the Government should be going, and I do believe that the Government would be well advised to take seriously the Committee's recommendations and act on them as urgently as possible. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian law in Antarctica</EMPHASIS>, presented by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Antarctica is unique in the world for a number of reasons. One is the fact that it is a vital part of the world food chain. Ninety per cent of the world's fresh water is frozen as ice in the Antarctic and Arctic circles. Antarctica also is vital because it provides definite evidence of the ability of human beings to exist with other animals in a very harmonious relationship. This relationship has been very valuable for science.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a unique opportunity for the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) and I, together with the previous Secretary of this Committee, Mr John Stanhope, to be able to go to Antarctica in 1991 as part of the Committee's inquiry and experience the relationships there between people and animals which are unique in the world, partly because generations of animals have not been harmed by humans. This means that their curiosity about us is as great as our curiosity about them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Antarctica also is unique in that the relationships between people of different countries have been extremely good and extremely beneficial for the whole of the world. It is there that we see the cooperation of nations and the coexistence of their people. Such cooperation has been very much in evidence, even at the height of the Cold War, between countries such as the United States and the Soviet Union. There was an example of that cooperation when a Soviet doctor visited Antarctica with a team, but he died within a couple of days of arrival and this meant that the Soviet people in Antarctica were without medical help. With the cooperation of other countries, including, I believe, China, they were able to get medical help, even though there were some very real problems between China and the Soviet Union at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first recommendation of the report deals with the application of the law to foreign nationals. I believe that it is an important recommendation because we have to recognise that foreign nationals need to be responsible. For example, we had described to us the alleged loss of an aircraft in Antarctica. The Antarctic Division claimed that it did not know anything about the loss of the aircraft. Nevertheless, there was quite a strong belief among the people in Antarctica that a Soviet aircraft had been lost one evening on a visit to a Soviet base and that a foreign national staying on an Australian base had destroyed that aircraft without authority and that no action could be taken. So the first recommendation is particularly important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important recommendation relates to the non-enforcement of Australia's obligations under the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, which is stated by the Committee to conflict with the United Nations Convention on the Laws of the Sea which provides that a coastal state has sovereign rights over the natural resources of its 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone, including seabed resources. The report states that it is a clear example of Australia choosing not to exert sovereign rights over a territory to which it has claimed sovereignty. We received evidence when we visited the area that even in a litre of seawater there can be millions of single cell plants and animals which are fed on by fish and whales. Antarctica is a vital part of the world's food chain, so I believe that that recommendation is, therefore, very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important that recommendation 3 is adopted. It relates to the activities in the Territory of non-contracting parties to the Antarctic Treaty and the application of the Air Navigation Act and the Civil Aviation Act. We heard evidence which made it quite clear that this is particularly important as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inappropriateness of the ACT laws is quite evident. If there is a fire ban in the ACT there does not need to be a fire ban in Antarctica. I believe it will be easier to adapt the law, with ordinances, to Tasmanian law, and it will be easier for the Division's lawyer to make contact with the people in Antarctica. I support the Committee's report and commend it to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I must congratulate the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and its secretariat on the production of this report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian law in Antarctica</EMPHASIS>. I also express my thanks to the Committee for allowing me and my colleague the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) to participate in the inquiry which resulted in this report. That enabled us to visit Antarctica, and that was my second visit to Antarctica. It means that I have now visited all three mainland bases&mdash;Casey, Davis and Mawson&mdash;and I have had the opportunity of visiting Heard Island. It is an amazing part of the world, and I feel very privileged to have had the opportunity of visiting all of those places. The only regret I have is the storm off Heard Island. It would have been much more pleasant if that storm had not occurred. It is the only time in my life that I have had to face up to the very strong possibility that I might not get home.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 1 is the crux of the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that . . . Australian law be extended and applied to those foreign nationals in the Australian Antarctic Territory.</PARA>
<PARA>That is consistent with the Acts of this Parliament going back to 1960 when the honourable Frederick Osborne, then Minister for Air, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has applied a complete code of law to the Australian Antarctic Territory. That law is, in our view, applicable to all persons in the Territory, and a breach of the criminal law, for example, would be punishable in an Australian court.</PARA>
<PARA>It is absolutely essential that that be the case. It has not been observed, though. The practice has been to ignore that actual law&mdash;in particular, as mentioned by my colleague, the Air Navigation Act, and the Sea Installations Act as well. The Air Navigation Act implements the provisions of the Convention of International Civil Aviation, known as the Chicago Convention. We have an obligation under Australian law to govern flights within our Territory. Quite frankly, we have not done so. It is an area that has gone by the board. I would suggest that you look at point 3.18 of our report. The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation has the jurisdiction to conduct investigations. It not only has the jurisdiction, it also has the obligation, and it has failed to do that up till now. I certainly agree totally with the recommendation that the Air Navigation Act and the Civil Aviation Act be enforced. </PARA>
<PARA>I am also very concerned about the authority of station leaders in Antarctica. At the present time they are there in isolation. One has to realise that when the last ship leaves on March 16 or thereabouts they are totally physically isolated until the next ship can get back in mid to late October. As we say in 3.62:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue of the extent of authority of the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition station leaders in the Territory is also critical in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA>It is absolutely essential that they be provided with the authority to do what needs to be done from time to time. The Committee is rightly concerned with the environmental impact of tourism. We should certainly implement recommendation 9:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that Australia . . . support the negotiation of a further annexe to the Protocol on Environment Protection to the Antarctic Treaty to cover tourism.</PARA>
<PARA>I am also concerned, as are some of my colleagues, about the possibility of having National Parks and Wildlife people overruling the Antarctic Division. I am a great admirer of the Antarctic Division and the work it does. I think that in that report perhaps we have ignored the impact of those visiting scientists and other expeditioners. It has been suggested that the Antarctic Division is light on in environmental activity, and I disagree with that entirely. There is the comment that there is an urgent need for action to preserve the historic Mawson's hut, and there is a degree of criticism of the Antarctic Division, that I think is totally unjustified. It is a question of funding. If this Parliament were to provide the funding to the Antarctic Division to restore Mawson's hut, it would be restored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I want to make is that the huskies at Mawson are going to be exported to the United States. I disagree with this entirely. I think the British option of allowing them to end their lives in Antarctica, without further breeding, is appropriate. I have actually, as has the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), cuddled these dogs. They were extremely friendly. They were wonderful. They are part of Australia's history. I believe that it is totally wrong that we should send them away. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today, I tabled the report of the Banking, Finance and Public Administration Committee on its review of those recommendations of the banking inquiry report which were directed to banks, for their implementation. The report results from a reference from the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), which the Committee received in March of this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In undertaking the review, the Committee understood its task as being to complement the formal Government response to the banking inquiry report, by assessing the progress of banks in implementing those recommendations which it was specifically their responsibility to implement.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To place the Committee's review in context, it is first worth highlighting the extent of the changes to the competitive, supervisory and consumer protection framework which will result from the Government's implementation of the major recommendations in the banking inquiry report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the major changes are the opening of further foreign banks and the allowing of foreign banks to operate as branches of their parent banks; the appointment of a second Deputy Governor for the Reserve Bank, to be the supervisor of banks; the development of a code of banking practice to govern bank and customer relations; and the prices surveillance inquiry into the credit card market. These changes represent the most significant reforms since the Campbell inquiry report of the early 1980s to the regulatory framework within which banks operate. Given this context, the Committee's expectation was that banks' implementation of the recommendations directed to them would complement the Government's response and reinforce the benefits to flow to customers over a period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The responses from banks to the review indicated the extent to which banks have been changing, as a result of the experiences of the 1980s and the scrutiny of the Committee and other forms of inquiry and review. While banks have been critical of the continuing review to which they have been subjected in recent years, I consider that it has been a valuable experience, from which banks have emerged with a more appropriate approach to face the challenges of the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the current review, the recommendations fell into four major areas: small business issues; farmers and banks; dispute resolution and mediation; and competition and consumer issues. The previous report identified a number of issues which are of concern to small business and which were revisited in the current review. The major ones I will touch on in my remarks are the availability of finance, and banks' lending practices and policies. The question of the availability of finance to small business was one the Committee had difficulty reaching firm conclusions on in the previous inquiry, because of conflicts of evidence; and the story was certainly little different in this review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is widespread anecdotal evidence of restrictions by banks of existing lending facilities to small business, and rejection of apparently sound proposals for new lending. However, available data does not indicate a pattern of bank imposed credit squeeze on small business or the farm sector. The Committee recommends that banks develop strong initiatives to provide lending to small business; that senior management of banks reinforce the message to staff to take a positive approach to lending to small business; and that the Reserve Bank develop further its data collection reporting on trends in lending to small business and to the farm sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerns remain among small businesses about their treatment by some banks. These concerns appear to arise from the failure of staff at the local level to implement bank policies and procedures. The Committee recommends that banks monitor the compliance of staff with bank policies and practices; that they report to the Reserve Bank on such compliance; and that they consult with small business organisations as part of that monitoring process. In the longer term, the inclusion of small business customers within the proposed code of banking practice will ensure adherence to good banking practice relating to that sector. As it is unclear at this stage whether small business relationships will be included in the code, the Committee has made recommendations that this occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural sector has been through one of its most difficult periods for many years. Commodity prices have been under pressure, drought has affected many areas and interest rates have been high. As a result, a process of structural adjustment is under way which will see some farmers leave the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this environment the relationship between banks and a number of rural customers has deteriorated, and banks will need to be particularly sensitive and sympathetic to the needs of rural customers during this period. To assist farmers and to assess realistically the long term prospects, the Committee recommends that farmers should have greater access to expert independent advice on farm assessment and management and financial planning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Banks need to respond innovatively to the needs of farmers. In its One Nation statement the Government made provisions for banks to assist farmers by allowing banks to undertake partial write-off of debt. Banks have not utilised these provisions, and the Committee recommends that they do so, raising any concerns about the limitations of the provisions with the Government. Just as with small business, the farming sector will benefit in the longer term from the relationship between banks and farmers being subject to the proposed code of banking practice. The Committee recommends that this occur as a matter of priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prompt and inexpensive resolution of disputes is an important issue for banks. While the proportion of bank transactions which result in disputes is very small, the damage disputes can cause to a bank's reputation and image is significant. The long running foreign currency loan disputes provide a clear example of the damage which can be caused. While progress has been made on this issue by the major banks involved&mdash;the Commonwealth Bank and Westpac&mdash;the Committee recommends they give a high priority to resolving outstanding cases on a fair basis without resort to legal technicalities. Those other banks with outstanding disputes should seek to resolve them using alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. Similarly, the Commonwealth Bank, which has a number of long term disputes in relation to borrowers in the Nyngan region, should seek to resolve them on a fair and reasonable basis without further delay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The banking industry ombudsman scheme has been one of the most important initiatives undertaken by banks in recent years to ensure cheaper and easier resolution of consumer banking disputes. The Committee's previous report recommended that the monetary limit of the scheme be increased to $200,000 and that small businesses and farmers have access to the scheme and to dispute resolution procedures therein. Banks strongly opposed any extension to the scheme, arguing that it needed time to bed down before such significant changes were considered. However, the Committee learned, fortuitously, of proposals by the banks to control the board of the scheme to limit operation of the scheme. This raised serious concerns, as one of the changes being considered would have weakened significantly the application of the `fair in all  circumstances' criterion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the pressure brought by the Committee and others, the board decided to proceed with only limited changes, and did not alter the core criteria under which the scheme operates. However, the Committee considers that the fundamentals of the scheme should be protected and recommended that: the fairness criterion should be retained; any changes to the terms of reference of the scheme should be considered only after full consultation with the scheme's council and the Ombudsman and the wider community; and all banks be urged to maintain membership of the scheme. The Committee also recommended that the extension of the monetary limit to $200,000 should proceed immediately, while an extension of the scheme to cover small business and farmers should be undertaken within two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the concern which the previous report identified in the relationship between banks and consumers is to be addressed in the proposed code of banking practice to which I have referred already. The code will create a changed environment for banks and customer relations by changing the balance of power in the relationship and placing emphasis on fairness, transparency and good banking practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee makes a number of recommendations about the matters that should be included in the code. In this report the Committee has focused on the provision of better information for consumers, to place them in a stronger position to make informed choices. Deregulation has placed a requirement on consumers to be better informed about bank products and services. Consumers need to examine critically what they are being offered by banks. To do so, they need not only better information and sources of advice, but also the questions that should be asked to enable critical analysis to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee develops in this report the concept of a report card on banks' products and services which brings together a wide range of information about particular products and services. While the Committee has not itself identified a report card, it has endeavoured, through information it has put together on banks' deposit products, to point to the type of service which can be provided to bank customers. There is an onus on interested organisations and the media to develop such comparative information. The Committee recommends an examination by the Treasurer of ways to increase the provision of comparative market information to bank customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change the House has made to the Committee's name and area of responsibility, following the previous report, to enable direct coverage of banking issues, is an important one which will have significant benefits for the Australian community over time. The Committee's review has demonstrated the value of a continued parliamentary scrutiny of the banking industry. The review has enabled pressure to be maintained on banks to address the recommendations arising from the inquiry. The Committee provides a forum for concerns about the banking industry to be aired at the parliamentary level. It also provides the opportunity for banks to inform parliament about developments in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has recommended further monitoring of issues relating to this report, and that will be an important part of the process. Given the limited time that is available, I will not proceed to detail all of those monitoring issues, but they are significant for all concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to take the opportunity to thank the members of the Committee who worked diligently through this process. It has been an extensive exercise and I pay tribute to them for their cooperation. I also pay tribute to the staff of the Committee for the excellent efforts they have provided to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to join the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) in speaking briefly to the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Checking the changes</EMPHASIS>. It is an important report. It is the second of a series which the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration is charged to bring to this Parliament, because it now has a continuing responsibility to monitor banks and the finance industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report covered a somewhat limited area in one sense, because it dealt with that very important area of bank-customer relations. What the Committee was charged to do was to examine the extent to which the banks, in relation to their customers, had implemented the recommendations of the earlier report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A pocket full of change</EMPHASIS>. The Chairman of the Committee, in making his statement, has given a general summary of the recommendations contained in the latest report. However, in the time available to me, I want to deal with two major aspects that are dealt with in the report: one in great detail; the other pointing to the future of our original interest in a topic that is now of great importance to every Australian household. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal with that matter first. In our original report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A pocket full of change</EMPHASIS>, we dealt with the matter of the pricing of credit cards. We touched on it in this recent report and drew attention to the fact that in our first report we had made two recommendations. The first recommended that the Prices Surveillance Authority be asked to inquire into the profitability of credit cards. In our original report we went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the PSA finds that profits are not excessive, the Committee recommends that SCOCAM consider deregulation of fees on credit cards.</PARA>
<PARA>At the time we completed <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Checking the changes</EMPHASIS>, the PSA report was not available to us. I think that needs to be drawn to the attention of the House. In our report we summarised the history; we also drew attention to the fact that there was a further recommendation in our original report in which we actually recommended that retailers be allowed to dual price credit cards and cash transactions, should they desire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That matter was also dealt with, as it turned out, by the Prices Surveillance Authority. We concluded the paragraphs dealing with this matter with the following statement&mdash;and I think it is important to bring this to the attention of the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Committee has a continuing interest in credit card issues as a result of the previous inquiry and its brief review of the issues in this inquiry. The Committee is keen to ensure the credit card market delivers to consumers the maximum benefits in terms of price competition and technological innovation. The Committee asks the PSA to keep it informed of progress on the credit card inquiry. In accord with that the Committee signals its intention to review the completed PSA report.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Committee proposed to do. But it is interesting to note the recommendations that have been made by the Prices Surveillance Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PSA has recommended that the restrictions on credit card issuers charging fees to consumers on credit cards should be removed. It has also recommended that the restrictions in the credit cards Acts, which prevent or discourage dual pricing, should be removed. So the concerns and direction of our original thinking have now really been confirmed by the Prices Surveillance Authority, and the Committee will now want, with the Prices Surveillance Authority, to examine the issues which it brought to public attention in its earlier inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would appear from the detail of the PSA report that there are many efficiency gains that can be achieved as a result of the changes that have been recommended by the PSA. The general costing structure that operates within the credit card system is at present clearly inefficient in ensuring that the best banking and transaction facilities are available to the community. This Parliament must play an important part and the Committee, I am sure, will wish to play a continuing significant role in bringing about change so that Australian consumers get the maximum benefit available to them from the technology now in place in this country. But its full utilisation, to the benefit not only of consumers but of the banking and finance industry, is not being delivered to the community because there are a lot of institutional things, including State legislative arrangements, which prevent the effective use of what we call the credit card system. The great tragedy for the Australian economy and Australian consumers in this regard is that we went down the track of initially introducing technological innovation through the credit card. If we had originally called it the debit card, we could then have changed its name and said that it should no longer be called a debit card&mdash;that is, a card where you draw off a positive balance in your account&mdash;but that it should be called a transaction card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks behind the piece of plastic that we call a credit card that nearly every Australian family has available to it, one discovers that in fact it is a transaction card. It gives one access to the system of the transfer of funds probably more efficient than the cash dollars and cents produced by the Australian Mint. We have to ensure that we do not put price barriers in the way of the further development of the transaction card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some countries in Europe they are streets ahead of us; in other countries they are a long way behind us. The thing is, we have the technology in place and, if only we charged its usage out in a cost-effective way, we would have a far cheaper system of transactions, using our money and our bank accounts, than we presently have. At the moment we are locked in, to a certain degree, as a consequence of our concentration on the use of credit through the card rather than the transaction facilities that are available through the use of modern technology. On some other occasion I would like to expand on the points that I have just made there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter in the report that I particularly want to bring to the attention of the House is the Committee's recommendations concerning the importance of keeping an eye on bank margins. In this regard we need to recognise that there are two important areas in relation to bank margins. One is the overall difference between the interest that banks pay to borrow money from us and the interest that they charge to enable us to borrow money from them. That is the general bank margin. In Australia our bank margins have been historically high compared with our trading partners and we have to ensure that we have a far more efficient banking system so that those general bank margins can be reduced to the level of world practice amongst our trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the risk margin. We have asked the Reserve Bank to monitor, and recommended that it should monitor, the special margins charged by banks as a price for risk when they make particular loans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a series of recommendations that deal with this whole matter of interest. I would like the House to take note of recommendations 10, 11 and 12 in our report, and to a series of other recommendations that deal with the way in which banks charge their customers above their indicator rates. We need to make sure that the public and the banking community understand the rates that are charged to them. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>I thank my friend and colleague the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) for  seconding this motion. I also acknowledge the support of people in my community, such as Mr Vic Radis, Mr Chris Peovitis, Mr Lou Ognenis, Mr Zoran Cosescki, Mr Sascha Cvetskoski, Mr Trayn Gastev, Mr Jim Naumoski, Chris Angelkov, Archie Ognenoff, Sam Adamos, John Kitins and many other people of Macedonian background. I also note that this motion is supported by a petition containing 25,000 signatures supporting the recognition of Macedonia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to set this motion in an historical and global context. The Australian Labor Party and the Australian community have always placed a high stake on being socially progressive, on being a part of the world community, with all the responsibilities occasioned by that, and on representing and caring for the less powerful, the poorer and the downtrodden in our community and in the world community. In this regard, Australia has a special responsibility to recognise the Republic of Macedonia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that Australia also takes an interest in places such as Tibet, East Timor, Cambodia and Somalia. In that respect, our obligation to Macedonia is no different. Macedonia is a small country of some two million people. Surviving in the Balkans, it is an area characterised by much violence and turbulence, both in the past and present. In Australia, and in my electorate of Stirling, there are many Macedonian Australians who deserve respect and dignity. Yesterday, the United States of America&mdash;another country noted for its caring for the less powerful and its commitment to justice&mdash;made a great step forward with the election of Mr Clinton to the presidency and Mr Gore to the vice-presidency. The time has now  come for the United States of America to also recognise Macedonia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise the question of why this is important. It is important because, as we have seen with Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Europeans are not capable of managing the dismantling of the former Yugoslavia, and they have proved that they are not capable. Thousands of lives have been lost and countryside has been destroyed because of the inability of the EEC to achieve solutions. I do not want to see this happen to Macedonia. In fact, what is happening to Bosnia at present is just a sad reflection of what could happen to Macedonia if the world community were not to take responsibility. There is a real threat that Macedonia could become a battleground involving neighbouring countries such as Greece, Bulgaria, Albania and Serbia. I would suggest to the Australian Parliament and to the Australian community that we do not want to see that happen to two million people in Macedonia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current blockade on Serbia is being used by Greece to limit fuel supplies into Macedonia. As a consequence, many in Macedonia are experiencing great hardship and there is a threat of civil unrest within Macedonia. There is also a shortage of medical supples within Macedonia. Additionally, some 60,000 to 80,000 refugees from Bosnia are now in Macedonia. Conditions in Macedonia are difficult enough without the added burden of refugees. I want to pay a tribute to President Gligorov for his efforts in keeping Macedonia operating as a civil and a liberal democracy in which justice is being pursued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The absence of recognition for Macedonia has meant that no credit has been extended to Macedonia, and that causes a considerable difficulty. I thank my colleague the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) for his recognition of that. Many countries have also recognised Macedonia, including Russia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Byeloruss, Lithuania, Croatia, Slovenia and the Philippines. In addition, some 15 countries have recognised the passports of Macedonia, including EC countries such as the UK, France and Denmark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the question of the name. Many in Australia would say that we should not recognise Macedonia or even have this debate, and I make some points in respect of this. How is it that there are some people in Australia who call for a policy of multiculturalism, but the first time a culture comes along that they do not want to recognise they want to abandon the policy of multiculturalism? There is an inherent contradiction in that. I have had many people, including some Greek people, say to me, `Oh, we must not recognise Macedonia'. I say, `You are the same people who say to me that you want a policy of multiculturalism. If it happens that a culture comes along that you do not agree with, then suddenly you want to abandon the policy of multiculturalism'. Frankly, that is blatant hypocrisy. One cannot have it both ways. The policy of multiculturalism in Australia says that, if a culture wishes to identify itself in a current and historical context as being a distinctive culture and in doing so poses no threat to the wider community, that culture can exist. That is exactly what it means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet suddenly people want to change the rules and say, `Well, I am sorry, but you people can't call yourselves Macedonians, first of all because you don't exist and, secondly, because we don't like the thought of you calling yourselves Macedonians'. There is an inherent hypocrisy in that and the Australian community understands that totally and will not accept that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that Australia is a democracy. I have been told we should not even be having this debate; that it is terrible that we should be having this debate. The answer to that is that Australia is a democracy and, thank goodness, people can stand freely in this place and speak about things in which they believe. I happen to believe in this very strongly and I am not about to be told by other people that I should not be debating this question. That is what I am elected for, and the whole Constitution of Australia is designed to protect the dignity and individuality of people like me, the honourable member for Throsby, the honourable member for St George (Mr Dubois) and the honourable member for Moore to stand here and freely express views which happen to be, in historical terms and current terms, accurate and also principled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My third issue is that for one country to tell another country what it can call itself is nothing but old fashioned imperialism. We have just rejected that; we have just put that to one side. We have seen the collapse of the Soviet Union, where people like Stalin told the Ukrainians what they could call themselves. Thank goodness, that era has gone. We now have moved into the light. We have moved into the latter part of the twentieth century, when people have stood up, breathed the fresh air of freedom and said, `I am free'. Yet suddenly in the Balkans, when two million people want to stand up and say, `I am free; I am a Macedonian', one very powerful neighbour says, `No, you are not and you cannot call yourselves Macedonians'. What are we talking about? That is just a reversion to what those old crackpots in the Kremlin used to regard as foreign policy&mdash;in other words, imperialism. We have put that to one side. But I find we have got the same creaking mentality intruding into the latter part of the twentieth century in saying to two million Macedonians, `You cannot call yourself Macedonians, because somehow we have got a copyright or a trademark on the name'. I have got news for them. This is no longer the old imperialist world that was characterised in the Cold War. The world has changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a terrible threat these Macedonians must constitute! They have 6,000 troops armed with pistols and rifles; no tanks, no air force. So it must be a terrible threat to the neighbours. What nonsense, what absolute, arrant nonsense. The people in Australia who call themselves Macedonians, I find, tend to be some of the hardest working, less well off but dinkum Australians one would ever meet. The honourable member for St George and the honourable member for Throsby have got them in their electorates and I have got them in my electorate. They are terrific people. They are the backbone of a lot of what Australia stands for. Yet we have some people in very powerful positions saying, `No, you can't call yourselves Macedonians either'. They are happy to call themselves Australian Macedonians. Some of them actually fought for this country. Some of them stood up when the hard yards had to be made and were not about to be told that they could not do this and they could not do that. That is what they are in Australia for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to emphasise that, at the end of it all, what this is about is tolerance. What this is about is the recognition of the right of people to exist and to call themselves what they want in a non-threatening way. That is what it is about. That is the whole trend of the twentieth century, through the great thinkers like Einstein, through the great thinkers in this Parliament, through the people in the Labor Party who have given us that breadth of belief in what the world is about: it is about tolerance. It is about recognising people. It is about social justice. It is about caring for others. So I say with complete conviction&mdash;and I will be supported by my colleagues in this place&mdash;that this is a very important debate. We owe a great deal to our Australian Macedonians and to the two million people in Macedonia. We owe it to them to give them dignity, to give them respect and to give them peace and a hope for the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion moved by the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards). I think it is clear that there are some very important issues surrounding this question of recognition of Macedonia, in particular the question of recognition under the name that it has chosen for itself. First of all, one has to ask why Australia should recognise Macedonia. Why should any nation recognise Macedonia? There are some very good reasons. The first and most important reason is the question of security and peace in the region of the Balkans. Anybody who has studied modern history would be aware of the enormous tensions in that region. It has been a catalyst for major conflict historically. We saw in the case of the First World War that an assassination in Sarajevo&mdash;coincidentally, the scene of bitter and terrible fighting at present&mdash;was the trigger for the mobilisation of the various armies that then fought and caused the Great War in 1914-18.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the question of commonsense. This is a commonsensical issue. Here we have a nation that exists, to all intents and purposes. It chooses to call itself Macedonia&mdash;and I shall go into the historical context in a moment&mdash;and therefore, by rights, it should be recognised as what it is: a de facto nation, self-determinant, having had the opportunity to elect its own government and eager and anxious to participate fully in world forums as an independent nation in its own right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the question of the historical validity of Macedonia calling itself Macedonia. That is a debate in which I am not an expert. I am not a historian, and I am not an expert as to whose argument is more valid than the other, but certainly some other issues arise as to whether or not another country should prohibit a country from using a name to describe itself. I will come to that in a second also. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the issue&mdash;as far as I am concerned, the major issue&mdash;of the problems in Macedonia's economy and, as a consequence of those economic problems, its ability to function as a self-determining nation in its own right. Of particular interest to us as parliamentarians and democrats is its functioning as a democratic nation with a parliamentary institution that has credibility. There is a variety of things that obviously arise from those particular issues, but most important is this question of economic development. Clearly, the survival of the Macedonian parliamentary institutions&mdash;the democratic institutions&mdash;depends on the economy performing well and providing a reasonable standard of living to its inhabitants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) and I have just returned from a visit to both Macedonia and Greece, and we are able to speak with some first-hand experience of the economic problems that are facing Macedonia at present. The principal problem is that until the disintegration of the former Yugoslav federation Macedonia sent 65 per cent of its gross domestic product to Serbia. Of course, that market has now disappeared. As a consequence, the products of Macedonia now have to find alternative markets. That in itself is a very significant economic problem to the fledgling nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second major problem is the question of the oil embargo. That embargo was, in fact, imposed on the whole of the former Yugoslav region but it now affects, principally, Serbia and Montenegro. As a consequence of the cutting off of oil supplies from Thessaloniki via the Greek and Macedonian frontiers, it is having a significant and profound effect on the Macedonian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On our visit to Skopje at the beginning of September we saw first-hand the enormous queues waiting to take advantage of the limited supplies that were trickling through into the republic and the problems that were accompanying that because of the strict rationing of fuel. As it turned out, it made our own travel arrangements very difficult indeed because, unfortunately, we were unable to travel by motor vehicle because of the lack of fuel. That meant that we had to travel by train. The train service in the region is trying to sort itself out because of the changes in terms of ownership and all the other questions of administration of the lines and the rolling stock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important aspect, which the honourable member for Stirling has already touched upon, is this important question of the participation of Macedonia in international forums. It is quite ridiculous, to all intents and purposes, to have a nation that is unable to participate in international forums simply because another nation to its south has objected. As a consequence of that nation's objection, the European Council has likewise objected to the country calling itself Macedonia. As a consequence of that, it is unable to fulfil its international obligations or to take advantage of the opportunities in the international forums to participate as a fully-fledged nation in its own right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The obvious question is&mdash;as a famous television professor used to say&mdash;why is this so? Of course, the argument has been that Macedonia is a Greek name and, therefore, because of the name's historical exclusivity to Greek culture, the Macedonian republic is unable to, or not entitled to, call itself Macedonia because the Greeks have a proprietary interest in that particular name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second question&mdash;which the honourable member for Stirling has also touched upon&mdash;is that of a potential threat. I suppose that in looking at that threat one has to bear in mind the statistics already quoted, which show that that threat represents a minuscule real threat to Greek integrity and the Greek national integrity. As a consequence, I think it can be more or less disregarded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree that there is a significant threat, as far as the Greeks are concerned, in some terms to the internal situation in Greece. I suppose that one could argue that in the Greek mono-cultural society perhaps the stimulation of Macedonian nationalism within its own frontiers would represent some sort of threat to its own stability. However, I think it is clear from the constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, and certainly the sorts of arrangements that Macedonia has conceded in its quest to become recognised as a fully-fledged nation, that that really does not represent such a threat at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue has been put to us, in fact, by Madam Souderou, who is the Greek Deputy Foreign Minister. The honourable member for McPherson and I met her in Athens and were able to talk with her at some length about the situation. She indicated that there was another concern on the part of the Greeks, and that was the fact that the Macedonian republic was being run by former communists who had historic and political links with the uprisings and the revolts from 1946 to 1949. I suppose there is validity in that because it is true, to an extent, that there are former communists, former members of the Yugoslav regime, who are in parliamentary and official positions in the new republic. I suppose that stands to reason, because they had been under communist control for so long. As a democrat and an anti-communist I would like to see that change, for obvious reasons. But that is a matter for the Macedonians themselves to determine in their own way, under their own democratic system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what was stopping the recognition of Macedonia&mdash;in the first instance, recognition of the name of Macedonia&mdash;was the European Council declaration on former Yugoslavia which said that, in relation to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it expresses its readiness to recognise that Republic within its existing borders, according to their declaration on 16 December 1991, under a name which does not include the term Macedonia.</PARA>
<PARA>To a certain extent, the prime mover towards that was the Greek Government, which was using its veto powers to ensure that recognition did not come to pass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important element in this is the United States. The honourable member for Stirling has indicated some optimism about some changes under the new regime of President Clinton and Vice-President Gore. I must say that one of my great disappointments during the presidency of President Bush was the attitude of the United States to the former Yugoslav federation. That was reflected in the statement made by James Baker early last year, when he was going to Yugoslavia, that he thought it was in the interest of the new world order to retain Yugoslavia intact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I indicate that clearly there is a substantial interest in retaining peace and security in the region. The absence of recognition for the Republic of Macedonia is a substantial impediment to its economic progress and its ability to be able to function as a democratic state. As a consequence, Australia should recognise what is in fact a de facto situation: there is an independent, self-determined nation to the north of Greece that calls itself Macedonia. Australia should recognise it as Macedonia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 7 May this year during the grievance debate, my colleague the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) and I spoke about Macedonia. We urged then that as Macedonia met all the requirements for independence and recognition Australia should move to recognise Macedonia under the name Macedonia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we are, six months later and nothing has changed. Macedonia has still not been recognised. When I spoke in May I thought the question of recognition by Australia was only days away, but Australia was waiting for Europe to take the lead. The European Community, not wanting to upset Greece, refused to recognise Macedonia. I must say that I shared the sense of shock and horror of my Macedonian friends at the European Community's decision, on 27 June 1992 in Lisbon, not to recognise the sovereignty and independence of Macedonia. It is especially appropriate that the debate occurs today, the last sitting day before I join the thousands of Australian Macedonians of the Illawarra in celebrating this weekend 20 years of existence of the Macedonian Church in the Illawarra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Macedonia meets all the requirements for independence and recognition. The only stumbling block is the name. Indeed, the Greek Government has said that it would support the independence of Macedonia provided the name was changed. I have no desire to be critical of or offensive to the Greek people or the Greek nation&mdash;some of my best friends are Greek&mdash;but I am surprised that Greece, the cradle of democracy, should seek to use its influence to deny democratic freedom to others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Republic of Macedonia has a continued commitment to international arms control; observes existing internal and external frontiers; guarantees to protect the rights of ethnic minorities; adheres to international conventions on human rights; and makes no territorial claim on any neighbouring state. The constitution of the Republic of Macedonia satisfies, and in many cases exceeds, the guarantees given to citizens in Western democracies. The Macedonian constitution guarantees to all Macedonian citizens full political, social, cultural and religious rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government of the Republic of Macedonia has a strong commitment to world peace and particularly to peace in the Balkans. The Republic of Macedonia has always promoted economic and cultural cooperation with neighbouring states and openly declares that it has no territorial pretences towards its neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a democratically held referendum on 8 September 1991, the Macedonian nation overwhelmingly voted for Macedonia to become an independent and sovereign state. More than 95 per cent of the votes were in favour of independence. It is a nonsense for Greece to claim that Macedonia has territorial claims on Greece. The Government of Macedonia has enough problems within its own borders; it does not have the ability, even if it had the will, to invade anyone. It wants to live in peace with its neighbours. Today Macedonia is a country of two million people; it has an army of 6,000 which does not have anti-tank or anti-aircraft weapons, let alone tanks or aircraft of its own. Greek army units have been moved up to the border, supposedly to defend Greece from the invasion by Macedonia. Macedonia has no intention of invading Greece, and Greece knows this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Macedonia has fulfilled, and in many cases exceeded, all the international requirements for recognition. There is absolutely no excuse for any further procrastination on the part of any country, and especially Australia, to recognise Macedonia. For example, Macedonia has a democratically elected, stable government. It has clearly defined territorial control over secure borders. It has a permanent population and it has the capacity to enter into relations with other States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the Macedonians voted overwhelmingly in favour of Macedonia becoming an independent and sovereign state. Ninety-five per cent of the population voted in favour. The constitution of Macedonia is based on the principle of parliamentary democracy and human rights. It guarantees full political, social, cultural and religious rights to all citizens of Macedonia, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Macedonian Government has time and again proven its total commitment to peace with its neighbours. It has always promoted the need for economic and cultural cooperation with its neighbouring states. It has openly declared that it has absolutely no territorial pretences towards its neighbours. The special Commission of Arbitration set up by the European Community came down strongly in favour of Macedonia being recognised as an independent and sovereign state because it had satisfied all the stipulated criteria for such recognition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The European Community has a consensus based decision-making process. Greece has insisted that the Republic of Macedonia must change its name before it will agree to recognise its independence. Macedonia will not bow to this unjust pressure, and why should it? Making Macedonia's recognition conditional on a change of name to suit others is without precedent and violates all codes of international law and practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am saddened at the behaviour of Greece. Macedonia has clearly stated that it has absolutely no territorial pretences towards its neighbours. It has stated that it is ready to sign an agreement with Greece on the inviolability of borders. Perhaps Greece is worried that the world might become more and more aware of the plight of the Macedonian minority in Greece, where many people are still being denied basic human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We welcome the fact that Australia was quick to recognise the new found freedom of independence of many countries such as Slovenia, Croatia, the Ukraine, Lithuania and Estonia. Why are we hesitating to give this same recognition to Macedonia? I know we have the desire to wait for the European Community to move before we do, but sometimes a country has to stand up and be counted. Sometimes when principles are at stake Australia can show the way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians have done that in the past. We took a lead in international affairs, for example, in regard to Antarctica. Do honourable members remember when Australia stood with France alone against the world because we wanted a world park in Antarctica? We knew we were right. The other countries argued against us. They told us we were wrong. But slowly, through pressure, through talk, through explaining our position, others started to join us. Now it is very fashionable to support the world park in Antarctica. Why do we not take the lead in recognising Macedonia? Why do we wait?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought the cultural cringe had long passed. But we are still waiting for the Europeans to show us the way. It is time we showed the Europeans the way, and the way to do that is through the recognition of Macedonia. The European Community needs to stand up to Greece. Australia can show it the way to do that. The time for delay is over. We have waited for Europe to take the lead in the recognition of Macedonia and it has not. It is time that Australia granted to Macedonia the recognition that the country so rightly deserves. </PARA>

I must say at the outset that I am somewhat ambivalent about some aspects of this particular motion, but I do want to correct something that the honourable member for Throsby said that I think is inaccurate. It ought to be understood, when we talk about the 95 per cent majority support for the independence movement, that it was actually only 95 per cent of around 75 per cent who voted. We should bear in mind the fact that the significant Albanian minority in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia did not participate, and that minority is 25 to 30 per cent. So let us be sure about the facts here. We are talking about 95 per cent of approximately 70 to 75 per cent who supported it, and those who use those statistics without putting them in that context are clearly being misleading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) said, he and I have recently been in the former Yugoslavia, and there is no doubt that it is an extremely troubled part of the world. I am pleased that President-elect Clinton in his speech last night actually mentioned the former Yugoslavia as one area that he was very concerned about, one area where his new Administration would be very active in addressing and resolving the problems. As the honourable member for Moore and I said when we came back from there, without the resolve of the United States in Bosnia and Herzegovina, for instance, to seek a solution to that problem, there would be no solution. I hope now that with President-elect Clinton coming on board in the new year we will see the United States being more proactive in that particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We found in our visit to that part of the world, and indeed in our visit to Skopje, the legacy of the years of communism. There was both social decay and physical decay evident absolutely everywhere in that particular country. We talked, sometimes with some levity, I suppose, about the hotel we stayed in, which was literally falling apart. Of course, there is an enormous challenge ahead to restore that part of the world, to restore the former Republic of Macedonia to some semblance of modernism and normality. It is an example, as we ought to recognise in this place, particularly for the sake of our colleagues, of the comprehensive failure of an ideology. Yet we still see some clinging in one way or other to the remnants of that particular ideology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are Labor politicians running around the hallways of this place wearing Clinton-Gore badges, and we heard yesterday a question in the Parliament which asked the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) whether what we saw in the United States was in some way a reversal of right wing dogma. It is not, and any understanding of American politics would lead one to believe that that is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The former Yugoslavia has a massive struggle ahead to adjust to the post-communist era. It needs the support of the world community to achieve that. There is no doubt in my mind about that. The struggle at the moment is focused, as others have said, on what is happening in Bosnia and Herzegovina. That is a matter that ought to be of great concern to all of us. I agree with the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) that there is the potential for trouble to erupt in Macedonia. There is no doubt in my mind, having been there, that what we are seeing happening in Bosnia could very easily happen in Macedonia. I acknowledge that there is real potential for that to actually happen. The situation in Macedonia is very tense, as it was when we were there, and there is an air of uncertainty about the future, as one might expect. Cyrus Vance was saying very much the same thing recently when he said that there was the potential for trouble to escalate in Macedonia as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ethnic tensions in Macedonia are very real. We ought not to play down the fact that the very substantial Albanian minority, 25 to 30 per cent of the population, is not at all convinced about the direction in which the country is going. So in a sense the honourable member for Stirling, attempting to put the situation into an Australian context, is also underplaying it or misleading us. Australian multiculturalism is so far removed in practice and in effect from what is happening in that part of the world that it is almost laughable to make the comparison. The ethnic tensions in that particular part of the world are very real and underlie the last thousand years. We cannot possibly put that into the Australian context in any very realistic way. However, I do accept, as the honourable member for Stirling is saying, that the future of the former Republic of Macedonia is very much tied now to its recognition as a nation, and there is some urgency. We heard many Macedonian politicians telling us about the urgency there was, for their future security, for their situation as a nation to be recognised. Absence of recognition is very much the reason for the present state of insecurity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the motion, as it is framed, really focuses on the central question, as has been recognised by the speakers before me, as to whether the Republic of Macedonia is entitled to call itself Macedonia. The dispute, I suppose, gives a new focus to the old question of what is in a name. In this particular situation the name is everything. It is as simple as that: in this case fundamentally the name is everything. The issues surrounding the name have been canvassed already in the debate, so I will not go over them again. But we should understand, in fairness to Greece, which of course is an important part of the world and the European Community, that the crux of the Greek opposition to the use of the name is that the name inherently is evidence of territorial ambition. Historically that has been the case as recently as the Second World War; Greece has real fears. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not arguing that the Macedonian army is going to march into Greece. It is more complicated than that because there are other alliances involved in the situation. I believe that the Greeks have a genuine concern about the use of the name, on the grounds that there has been evidence in the past of territorial ambition there. We ought not to forget or try to downplay the fact that 50 per cent of ethnographic Macedonia actually falls within the borders of Greece. I repeat that half of the region of Macedonia is actually in Greece. So the name is important and the dispute surrounding the name cannot be downplayed: it is vital; it is significant.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the problem with the name is understandable. Nations which have changed their names have done so for strategic and cultural reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are probably some grounds for uncertainty and suspicion on the part of the Greek Government in this situation. It is quite understandable that the Greeks, as an ancient people&mdash;let us recognise that&mdash;should be extremely sensitive about anything that tampers, as they see it, with their heritage. Whether these fears are real or perceived&mdash;plenty of people would say it is pure paranoia&mdash;is really not the point at all. I do not believe that the Greek position should be interpreted as denying the existence of a Macedonian state, its culture or, indeed, its language. Clearly that is not the case, because Greece has been prepared within the European Community to support Macedonia's independence but it has reservations about the use of the name. I say in this place that I share those reservations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult in politics not to be pragmatic; it is a constant temptation in this place to be pragmatic, but I believe in seeking correct solutions. I have listened carefully to debate, both in this place and in that part of the world, and I wonder whether we can vote on this issue. It seems that the way we approach these issues here is to talk about them but not to actually get to the crunch of making a decision. We should make a decision about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the honourable member for Stirling, as a senior member of the Government in this place, whether in fact a vote will be taken on this important issue. I am not persuaded at this time that the Greek concerns are of no consequence; I am sure that they are. I have benefited from my discussions on this matter, I say in fairness, with the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), who has a very good understanding of the Greek position and who strongly supports the Greek point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some believe that any recognition of the former Yugoslav republic as the independent Republic of Macedonia would actually be a threat to peace in southern Europe. In fairness, I think that is an overstatement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House urges the Government to introduce proposals to reform the Family Law Act as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA>In the paper I circulated in February, I described the present Family Law Act as a time bomb waiting to explode. I have no reason to resile from that comment. Since the circulation of the paper, I have been inundated with responses from all parts of Australia. I can only conclude that the personal trauma and misery being suffered are many times worse than I had originally thought and, therefore, the need for reform is even more acute than I described earlier. Order and stability within our society are governed by the law, but bad laws will produce disorder and instability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present Family Law Act is a bad law because it breeds instability and the law itself drives people into irresponsible and irrational actions. The Family Law Act and all the family law procedures flowing from the Act must be changed as a matter of urgency. The structure of the divorce system itself is not designed to seek out and foster goodwill. It is an adversarial system which operates on division and argument. However, more division and vitriol are the last thing that is needed in the emotionally charged environment of a family break-up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the system itself that needs to be radically overhauled. I realise that the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act has not yet reported to parliament. The report is due by 17 December and there is a great deal of interest across Australia in the recommendations that may be made by the Committee. While we are yet to learn the contents of the report, I urge both sides of politics to use the report and the tabling as an opportunity to develop new policies on the Family Law Act. In fact, I would consider it downright irresponsible if both major political parties did not radically review their family law policies before the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, we need a procedure that allows a marriage to be dissolved with dignity, fairness and equity, and that takes proper account of the emotional and physical needs of all parties&mdash;which particularly includes the children. I do not believe the Family Court fulfils such a role. I have suggested the Family Court be replaced by a divorce tribunal. That tribunal should consist of a panel of people rather than a single judge. The chairman should be a person with suitable legal qualifications, but the panel should also include the counsellors who counselled the parties prior to the proceedings, and a child psychologist or some other suitably trained person who can ensure proper consideration of the children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly critical of the Family Court counselling service. I have been told by many people that Family Court counselling often inflames an already tense situation and no report is made to the court to be considered as part of the divorce procedure. It therefore seems that the Family Court counselling is a total waste of taxpayers' money. In my view, the Family Court counselling service should be scrapped and the resources redirected into an upgraded church or community based counselling service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great deal of emotion and trauma revolves around the custody of, and access to, children. Access orders are openly and blatantly disregarded and the Family Court is either unwilling or unable to enforce its own orders. In response to a question I posed about the non-enforcement of access orders, the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the event that a matter has reached the stage that an order is sought for non-compliance, the case is referred to the counselling service of the Court. The counselling service has tested intervention programs for families which have high conflict access problems.</PARA>
<PARA>That is utter rubbish. The Attorney-General is obviously being misled. Access orders are a complete dog's breakfast and they are being widely mismanaged by the Family Court. The result is that many children are missing out on an abundance of parental love, which is freely available but is not shared with the children because of the totally inadequate administration of access orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many non-custodial parents have a burning desire to share in the parenting and nurturing of their children. Sadly, however, many children and non-custodial parents are traumatised by the enforced separation which occurs because of the custodial parent not complying with access orders. But even more insidious is the fact that a disturbing number of custodial parents are prepared to use their children as bargaining chips in disputes with their former partner. In such circumstances the Family Court appears totally insensitive to the emotional damage done to both children and parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have called for lawyers to be totally excluded from family law representation. A legal industry has grown up around the Family Law Act and the exorbitant legal costs cause widespread trauma and injustice to many reputable Australian citizens. I have publicly claimed that family law representation costs the Australian people about $2 billion per year but because the Law Society has not challenged that figure I can only assume that the real cost is probably even higher. I see no reason why non-legally trained advocates could not appear before the divorce tribunal in a similar way as they appear before the Industrial Relations Tribunal or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No commentary on the family law procedures is complete without reference to the disaster of the Child Support Agency. The Child Support Agency has no involvement in the support of children; it is merely a collection agency designed to reduce claims on the Government's social welfare budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a letter to me dated 25 June 1991 from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Evidence indicated that between 1973/74 and 1985/86 sole parents had risen from 9 percent of the population to 15 percent and, of those, the number reliant on social security entitlements from 65 percent to 85 percent. Social Security payments in the same period rose from $160 million to $1,757 million and continued to rise to $2,334 million in 1989/90. The Government firmly believes that these statistics provided no alternative other than to introduce such widespread reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ever increasing number of sole parent families, their apparent increasing poverty and the resultant growth in Government social welfare expenditure, called for a reassessment of public and private roles in providing support for these families.</PARA>
<PARA>While I accept that the sole parent benefit scheme may be financially crippling for the Government, I claim that the welfare of children is much more important than the collection of money. Therefore, in my view the Child Support Agency should be scrapped and replaced by a more appropriate structure within the divorce tribunal. If the Government has a problem with the sole parent benefit scheme it should address that matter as a policy issue and not try to fudge the problem through an unfair and inequitable collection system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Family Law Act is without doubt in very urgent need of reform and I believe that it is incumbent on both political parties to bring forward new policy proposals before the next election is held. I realise that the parliamentary committee that has been inquiring into the Family Law Act is yet to present its report to parliament, but I believe that it is incumbent on both political parties to prepare new policies so that those policies can be properly considered and understood by the voting public of Australia before they are required to go to the next election. This is such an urgent matter that it cannot be swept under the carpet and must be addressed as a major social policy by both political parties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the five minutes I have allotted to me on this very important subject, I want to commend the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr) for drawing this matter to the attention of the Parliament. I think it is long overdue and I must admit it is a subject which I have been boundary riding myself for some time because of the complexity of the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I concur entirely with the remarks made by the honourable member for Lyons. From my experience in my own office I know that the system is not working. I am sure that this motion today will be opposed strongly by some of the new class men we have in the Parliament, but in reality what we have here is a mishmash put in place by elements in society that are hell-bent on their own social engineering. I had a woman in my office the other day and she said, `Look, you have got to do something about this'. She did not understand how powerless politicians are. She explained that she and her husband had separated amicably, she had custody of the kids, she had a job, and yet her husband was being forced to make substantial payments through the Child Support Agency. She had written to the Agency and said, `I do not need this money. It is really a burden on my husband. He has remarried and really cannot afford it. I have a job and we have a very good relationship'. She was told that it was the law and she had to have it. Now she is in the position of having to channel the money back to her husband. It is a nonsense situation. In another instance a man left a very well-paid job as a railway engine driver on the Hamersley railway line, probably grossing between $70,000 and $80,000 a year, and elected to go on the dole because of the persecution he was suffering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I find with the Child Support Agency is that it is very thorough, even draconian, in chasing those people who have a desire to support their children; but if somebody does not want to, and skips town, despite the tax file number there seems to be no effort to chase these people up. Many people are simply disappearing and not meeting their obligations. The Child Support Agency is a branch of the Tax Office, and in my opinion that is quite inappropriate. I do want to support the idea of a tribunal put forward by the honourable member for Lyons. It is much more appropriate than the law&mdash;certainly the law as it is worked through the present Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my time in parliament I have developed a healthy contempt for social workers. Recently I was asked whether I knew the difference between a social worker and an economist. I can tell you the answer: a social worker destroys one life at a time. Obviously this is not true of all social workers, but it is true of the type of social worker we tend to find accumulated in departments like Health, Housing and Community Services and the Family Court. How would I best describe them? I will have to use a euphemism. You know I am prone to euphemisms, Mr Deputy Speaker. Hairy-legged Stalinists would probably be the best description: people who are determined to pursue their own ideology at the expense of the facts and at the expense of people's feelings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is beyond doubt that in the present system children are being used as pawns. The Court is allowing them to be used to manipulate people: to be used in emotional blackmail and cause untold damage. I do not think the honourable member for Lyons is going too far when he says that, if something is not done about this, murder will eventuate. I suspect that it has already eventuated in some cases. I know the trauma and the anguish that are enforced on people by the draconian workings of this law. I realise that the Parliament has got a committee bringing down some recommendations. I hope that that committee, which has deliberated for some time, brings down a report that goes to the heart of this matter, and that we can get some urgently needed reform in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Family Law Act is variously described as either a saviour or a wrecker, a step forward or a step backwards. It is unlikely that we will ever know individual members' views on the Family Law Act, and I will not presume to even hazard a guess as to what they may be. I would, however, hazard a guess that there is not one member of the House who would disagree with the proposition that the Family Law Act was, at its introduction, and still is, the most contentious piece of legislation passed in this House in the last 27-odd years. The legislation is such that its mere mention in some quarters evokes a bitter response. Indeed, that bitterness spills over into quite frightening levels of violence and even attacks on Family Court judges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My personal view is that the Family Law Act should not be repealed. However, I think that honourable members should always be mindful of the likely effects of a piece of legislation that by its very nature interferes with and alters what are seen by large sections of the community as matters within their personal domain and not that of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a piece of legislation that has the ability to sever the umbilical cord of parenthood, the ability to terminate marriage vows, possibly against the wishes of one of the parties to the marriage, or to sever rights to assets which in many cases may have been acquired through a great deal of hard work and commitment. It is a piece of legislation that by definition must touch the very core of community existence and reasons for existence. That, in my view, places quite extraordinary responsibility on both Houses of the Parliament to ensure that the trauma associated with such a piece of legislation as the Family Law Act is as far as possible minimised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The emotional impact of this Act can at the very best&mdash;and I stress `the very best'&mdash;only be minimised, as I believe it is impossible for this emotional aspect to be totally negated without removing the basic principles of the Act itself. Some honourable members are aware that I practised as a barrister and solicitor in this jurisdiction for a number of years and I therefore unapologetically say that I am well placed to discuss both the Act and its effects. It would be exceedingly difficult to do justice to this motion in an hour, let alone in five minutes. There are so many competing interests and competing players in this whole debate that I believe it would be impossible to remove the emotional overlay that is quite rightly clearly identified with the workings of the Act and the system that is generated to implement it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members are aware, there have been a number of amendments to the Act. However, I believe that the most illogical and to some extent immoral of these amendments were changes in relation to the issuing of proceedings for property settlement. Prior to the amendment of the Act in the 1980s, generally speaking, property applications could not be issued inside 12 months of separation. If my memory serves me correctly, they could not be issued except in conjunction with divorce proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, that was an appropriate course that allowed a cooling-off period for married couples who were experiencing marriage difficulties and allowed for counselling by both professionals and family and friends. The amendment to the Act whereby property applications could be issued at separation effectively destroyed that cooling-off period. The amendment to the legislation in effect meant that, if a couple separated at 12 o'clock, one party could be in a solicitor's office at 8 o'clock the next morning, an application for property settlement could be drawn up, affidavits sworn and all documentation filed with the Family Court and served on the other party during that day. Not surprisingly, chances of reconciliation were effectively destroyed with the arrival of a process server on the doorstep of the other partner. There have been some procedural changes, but it is my understanding that that situation is still applicable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I saw family units that came into my office at X point of time for a sale of a property or the purchase of a property or to draw up some wills, and I could see a very happy family unit. It used to break my heart to see that same family unit again within six months or 12 months or 18 months, and it had been destroyed. Probably the majority of couples are able to overcome that, but I think we should always be mindful that the only losers in this are the children. The children are not the ones who have acquired the assets and who are fighting over the assets. The kids did not ask to be born. The kids are there as a product of what one would presume was initially a happy relationship or a happy marriage, but at the end of the day they are the ones who suffer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that, as the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr) has said, this Family Law Act is not working. I think it is too late to wind the clock back and get rid of it, because it overcame some problems that the community recognised with the old system. I do not think we want to get back to a situation where people are jumping through windows with cameras. But by the same token some amendments are urgently needed and I urge the House to make them. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this opportunity to speak on this very important motion put forward by the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr). I am somewhat constrained in what I can say, being one of the members of the House serving on the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act. The Committee has now largely finished its deliberations and we approved the last couple of chapters in the Committee meeting of Tuesday of this week. So I can at least report to the House that the report has been prepared and will be presented according to its timetable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have to say that a lot of the comments made by honourable members in this debate are understandable. However, in essence, I think they are directed not so much at the Family Law Act as at the inevitable consequences of the breakdown of marriage. In my view, it really would not matter what sort of system were devised&mdash;be it a divorce tribunal, as proposed by the honourable member for Lyons, or much greater emphasis on the process of mediation rather than judicial determination, through changes to the counselling service&mdash;at the end of the day there will still be conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should remember that only about 3 or 5 per cent of all marriage breakdowns ends in this very traumatic conflict, which really is the issue we are canvassing today. Fortunately, although it is obviously a very stressful time, most people are able to work through the difficulties of a relationship breakdown, and in many cases they never come near the Family Court. That is the vast majority of cases, fortunately. Most people are able to resolve their own difficulties and a good number of them never darken the door of lawyers which, I would agree with honourable members, is a very good thing in relation to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But with these very difficult cases where people are diametrically opposed as to why the relationship failed, what were the wrongs and rights of the situation, and where there are conflicts over the custody of the children, I defy any man, woman or system to devise a process which can resolve these matters without, at the end of the day, a good proportion of people walking out&mdash;if they have not got what they consider to be a just outcome&mdash;saying that the system is wrong. These people will say, `It is the Family Court which has caused me this pain', or, `It is the Family Law Act which has caused me this pain', or, `It is the family law counsellor who has caused me this pain'. I do not care what system we have in place, we are still going to get those sorts of complaints. That is the reality of it. We are dealing with something which in a certain body of cases simply cannot be resolved. I think we have to understand that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having understood that, that is no excuse to say, `Everything is okay. The Family Court is doing the best it can'. There are problems with the operation of the Court and with the operation of the law. That has become quite evident through the processing of this Committee's work. We have seen many examples of people putting forward very legitimate concerns about the operation of the Court and various aspects of the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to think that the Committee has addressed those and that the recommendations that it will make will lead to a significant improvement in the evolution of this system of family law. I also have no doubt that what we have at the moment is immeasurably better than the system that operated under the old Matrimonial Causes Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Lyons mentioned, we do not want to go back to a system of having private detectives looking through keyholes trying to prove adultery or having to prove the other grounds for divorce in the fault system. That was extremely destructive. We have moved on, I believe, to a better system, but a system which still has its faults. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we can improve that system. But even if we were to adopt the proposals of the honourable member for Lyons, even if the Government were to adopt all the proposals in this Committee's report, we would still have this core of cases where people would come out of this experience feeling very bitter about the outcome. That is a fact of life, and there is nothing we can do about it. I think honourable members should bear in mind that they are dealing with things which really cannot be resolved. There are no solutions, and the system does the best it can. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Government has consistently pursued the objective of an efficient, competitive and nationally focused electricity industry as a vital adjunct to Australia's international competitiveness. In May of this year the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) released a national electricity strategy paper&mdash;some people would have seen it&mdash;which builds on reforms already achieved and provides a blueprint for the future development of this important industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centrepiece of the strategy is the formation of a national grid corporation, which was foreshadowed in the speech by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on One Nation. Structural reform of this kind provides the key to improved competition and offers major efficiency gains. This strategy also provides a range of other initiatives, including the establishment of a broadly based national electricity industry council. The Government is committed to working with the States and other key parties to realise these efficiency gains. However, our planned and coordinated approach to structural reform stands in stark contrast to that of the Opposition, which speaks about micro-economic reform but is not known to have achieved any. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the electricity industry receives scant attention in the Fightback package, a mere six lines in 600 pages. Australia is rich in primary energy resources suitable for electricity generation. Although 10.2 per cent of current electrical generation is from renewable resources, all but a statistically insignificant portion of this is from hydro-electric sources. Concerns persist in the community as to the environmental impact of hydro-electric schemes. These  environmental concerns preceded widespread public understanding and acceptance of the problems posed by the production of so-called greenhouse gases. In this context at least, it needs to be pointed out that Tasmania generates almost all electricity by hydro-power. The carbon dioxide releases of the Hydro Electric Commission of Tasmania are thus a very small proportion of the emissions of the Tasmanian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coal resources in Australia are also very diverse. Coal-fired plants dominate electricity generation in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. They also play a major role in Western Australia and South Australia. In all of those States, which currently make significant use of coal for electricity generation, the reserves of coal are large. Therefore, these States could continue to make heavy use of coal for the foreseeable future&mdash;but hopefully, I hasten to add, with the correct environmental controls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that up to 85 per cent of electricity generation in Australia is from coal, high efficiency clean coal technologies have a substantive contribution to make here in the future. Western Australia has recently debated the establishment of a new power station. The relative costs and benefits of various technologies and fuels were widely canvassed at that time. It was ultimately determined that the interests of the State would be best served by the establishment of a coal-fired power station. Western Australia has the benefit of having black coal in some quantity which causes few greenhouse gas problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gas option was rejected by the State Government for a number of reasons. The inability to ensure continuity of supply was a major factor in the decision. However, gas represents around 11 per cent of fossil fuel energy currently used in electricity generation in Australia. Vast advances are now being made in the use of gas technology in the production of power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My motion also refers to the question of renewable energy. In Australia, new renewable energy technologies are already beginning to make progress in three main areas: domestic solar water heating, passive solar house design and remote area power supply systems. In the short term, the best prospects for many renewable energy technologies appear to be in areas remote from the State electricity grids, where electricity costs are high by urban standards. Photovoltaic systems are used to meet the electricity needs of thousands of telecommunication installations, of many hundreds of isolated houses and water pumping systems and of dozens of small communities. With further research, they can be expected to meet an increasing proportion of our total energy requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main thrust of the Commonwealth Government's policy for encouraging the use of renewable sources of energy is by providing support for research. Government support for renewable energy research arises from internal allocation of resources within government funded laboratories such as the CSIRO and universities, as well as from direct funding, usually through the Energy Research and Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a highly efficient and competitive solar energy industry, which is well placed to take advantage of the successes arising from this research effort. The domestic solar water heating industry has achieved sales in excess of 300,000 units locally, and has exported systems to over 70 countries. Australia is presently the world's largest manufacturer of photovoltaic or solar cells per head of population, producing some 5 per cent of world output. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generation from sewage gases has been quite common around the world and in Australia for many years, and small scale generation using landfill gas has been widely experimented with. In fact, I am sure honourable members have experienced situations where their local councils are now considering recycling in this way, at least using the sort of fill that they can for methane production. In technological terms, the principal change now under way is the use of gas turbines for sewage and landfill gases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gas turbines promise to open the door to the exploitation of substantial amounts of gas, thanks to their reduced maintenance burdens in extended multiple-megawatt generation when compared with spark ignition or dual-fuel reciprocating engines. Generation from landfill, sewage digester and coalmine gases is of interest in terms of the control of greenhouse emissions, in that methane, their principal constituent, has a significantly greater climate forcing effect than the carbon dioxide and water vapour which result from the combustion of methane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wind turbines also offer a thoroughly demonstrated technology. Around the world, a number of prototype machines have been in service in the one-megawatt to three-megawatt range, but reliability of service may be more predictable and therefore more commercially viable with a 500-kilowatt machine. For the benefit of my friend who will follow me in this debate, I also mention the fact that the bagasse from cane fields in Queensland represents an energy resource which could be used to generate electricity. This is an area that is being investigated, and he may be intending to touch on it in his speech. Some technological developments could perhaps make very small financial improvements for the collection and transport of the bagasse to central generating plants of a size adequate for reasonable economies of scale, and for the construction of new generating plants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of Australia's use of renewable energy sources is one which is very important to me and many other members of this House, as well as to people in the Australian community generally. I am not at all supportive of the nuclear option which is now being supported by many members of the Opposition and, in fact, by the shadow Minister for energy and resources, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer). I do not believe that nuclear energy has a role in the Australian energy and electricity system, until such time as we have found a safe way to dispose of the waste by-products. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome a constructive debate on energy issues and changing priorities with regard to energy around the world, particularly in relation to Australia's energy requirements, method of energy production and power generation. But this debate cannot be conducted in abstract from the economic dimension; there is a legitimate economic requirement to provide a better standard of living for all Australians and indeed worldwide. In that context, I will remind the House of the Brundtland report. A chapter entitled `From One Earth to One World' reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Humanity has the ability to make developments sustainable&mdash;to ensure that it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The concept of sustainable development does imply limits&mdash;not absolute limits but limitations imposed by the present state of technology and social organization on environmental resources and by the ability of the biosphere to absorb the effects of human activities. But technology and social organization can be both managed and improved to make way for a new era of economic growth. . . Poverty is not only an evil in itself, but sustainable development requires meeting the basic needs of all and extending to all the opportunity to fulfil their aspirations for a better life.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a timely reminder to both sides of the House and to Australia that one cannot adopt a lock-in or lock-out position without having some knowledge of, and referring to, the economic circumstances brought on by those positions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time available, I turn specifically to the motion and point out that Auselgrid, or the national electricity grid, was first dealt with during the last couple of years&mdash;notably, at shadow Cabinet level at a meeting in Cairns, where it was adopted months ahead of the Government walking down that path. I welcome the fact that the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths)&mdash;now returned from Hong Kong&mdash;has also pursued the national electricity grid option. Its exact form and shape are still being developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I warn against creating some form of additional bureaucratic monster associated with a national electricity grid. It would add to the burden which has for too long dominated Australian electricity production and distribution in Australia. The State fiefdom, the Victorian SEC, is one particular outfit which is now very heavily in debt. It is struggling as it tries to revamp and relate to the demands of the 1990s and to its particular financial circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need exists to create a mixture of private and government owned transmission assets on the basis of maximum efficiency, thereby not adding to centralised bureaucracy, whether in the very important growth area of Far North Queensland or whether in the entirety of an interlocking grid: Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and&mdash;if the Bass Strait cable option is proceeded with&mdash;Tasmania. That would provide a bonus for Tasmania. Hydro power could be generated and brought across from Tasmania to the mainland at peak time. Likewise, base load power could be provided in reverse from the mainland to Tasmania, especially during long, hot summers when the hydro resource of Tasmania is seriously depleted. That causes great difficulties in the island State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me state very clearly that nuclear power, which is central to the motion moved by the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen), is not on the coalition's agenda. Equally, let me clarify unashamedly that the coalition stands to abolish Labor's hypocritical, totally artificial three-mine uranium policy. How can those opposite stand up in this House and argue logically for an artificial capping and say that uranium at Roxby Downs in South Australia is good uranium but uranium at Kintyre in Western Australia is bad uranium and should not be mined? What absolute absurdity!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, got a couple of things right. One was that that is an illogical policy. Those were his words, and they are absolutely correct. Labor Party members in this House are very embarrassed by the fact that they are supporting, in the name of their great icon, Bob Hawke, an illogical policy on uranium mining. It is about time they had the courage to straighten it out, once and for all. It is even precluding development in Queensland, inland from Townsville, in Western Australia and in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say very clearly that we should not instruct, from a centralised bureaucracy, which mines will proceed or not proceed. We should simply eliminate those artificial imposts, those artificial burdens and artificial restrictions, on the number of uranium mines. We should do so because at present we are simply shipping jobs from Australia to Canada. Those are precious jobs which Australians could be performing. We are giving them to Canadians and we should be ashamed of ourselves. This Government should be ashamed of itself for pursuing an illogical policy of three uranium mines. It is a policy which the former Prime Minister described as being absolutely illogical. The policy persists because this Prime Minister and this Cabinet have not got the courage to face up to the Labor Party organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does nothing for Australia's international reputation if we are seen as being prepared to allow mining in a maximum of three mines only, one of which has now been depleted, and not at other potential sites in Australia. It is not good enough to say that demand is so lacking at this time that we should not alter this policy, because demand will turn around as the next generation of nuclear reactors come on stream elsewhere in the world and that demand&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was a cheap shot from the honourable member for Hinkler.  Chernobyl was a tragedy, an absolute tragedy, but he may not be aware that more people have been killed in coal-fired power stations and in coal mining than have been killed in the operation of nuclear energy production worldwide. So let us keep it in perspective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked for a constructive debate so I will not be tempted by the interjection of the honourable member for Hinkler, other than to say that there are currently 435 commercial electricity generating nuclear reactors operating in the world. They produce about 17 per cent of the world's electricity. They have accumulated over 6,000 reactor years of commercial service. The fatality record which exists for each and every method of power generation ought to be seen in perspective. That is all I argue. They certainly shape up well when compared with other methods of power generation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That also applies in terms of the ozone layer and the world's environment generally. Its effect on skin cancer, of concern to Queenslanders and indeed to all Australians, is a whole lot better than other modes of power generation. To be fair, the honourable member for Cowan alluded to that in making her comparisons. So let us have a great deal less nonsense from Labor on its very embarrassing and illogical three mines uranium policy and let us have a constructive debate on alternative energy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of that, I note with interest the motion did refer to developing solar, wind, tide, and waste power generating technologies. Others could be added to that. Certainly tidal power has been developed over the years, notably at Laurens in France and in Scandinavia and elsewhere. It involves an enormous capital cost. Nevertheless, in many ways tidal power is one of the cleanest forms of power generation one could have, along with hydro-electric power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There needs to be a more substantial breakthrough on the problem of capital cost before tidal power systems could be better utilised here in Australia. They could be used on the west coast where the tidal variation is a great deal larger than the variation on the eastern coast of Australia. Nevertheless, it is an option which I think should be further considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the increased utilisation of wind power which has been looked at on the west coast of Tasmania and in parts of Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia. That is another way of generating clean power. But again, one cannot ignore the capital cost factor in the preparation of those alternative power sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say that this motion, in not picking up on the economic dimension, is trying to deal with energy in the abstract. It must fail on that particular count. Nuclear power is not on the coalition's agenda but a fair dinkum mining policy with regard to uranium is, and quite properly so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to second this motion. I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) for her eloquent speech. I am very pleased to support the Commonwealth-State agreement on the establishment of a national electricity grid in Australia because that is about efficiency, that is about ensuring that we do not see unnecessary capital outlays in building power stations that are not needed. In maximising the generation we have with a national grid we gain that efficiency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very proud to say that in my home State of Queensland we have one of the most efficient electricity generation systems in the world. It is a world leader. Indeed, we are very fortunate to have two of the most efficient power stations in the world: Callide B in Biloela and the giant Gladstone power station. Their efficiency levels are outstanding. In our pollution controls in regard to coal-fired power stations we are a world leader. There is a possibility&mdash;in fact, a big possibility&mdash;that we can add value by selling that sort of technology to the world, particularly to developing countries. Countries like China have very low efficiency levels and are polluting the atmosphere, and by selling them that sort of technology we can ensure that they improve their efficiency. It is sad that countries like Germany, which is supposed to be a world leader, still burn brown coal. That is a disgrace. If they use coal from Moura, in my electorate, they would have the most efficient, cleanest coal in the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely. It is as the honourable member for Cowan says. With the great resources of the Bowen Basin, Queensland is well placed to capitalise. We are already selling coal overseas&mdash;the best, most efficient and cleanest coal in the world&mdash;and, in doing so, we are reducing emissions. I think it is also necessary to re-emphasise the other alternative energies, as the honourable member for Cowan says. We have hydro-electricity and we have solar power. We need to spend more money collectively on research and development in that regard&mdash;certainly on tidal power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is an option that the Europeans use, which is crazy, called nuclear power. When the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) talked in a praiseworthy way about 435 power stations, he failed to mention that they are time bombs. Frighteningly, there are dozens of old power stations in Europe with old technology. They were built in the 1940s and 1950s&mdash;particularly in the 1950s&mdash;and they are sitting there as time bombs. There is the potential that we could have five or six Chernobyls. It is very easy to dig up the uranium and sell it; the problem is decommissioning those old power stations. We do not yet have the technology in this world to decommission them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fact now that Europeans are terrified of the effects of Chernobyl. That is why we are now able to sell over a billion dollars worth of dairy products to Asia. The Asian market knows our dairy products are clean and have not been polluted from Chernobyl. So the attitude of the Opposition on an open mines policy on uranium is irresponsible. But the Leader of the National Party said that the Opposition is not countenancing nuclear power. I would like to quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of 13 August, 1991. The Leader of the National Party said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under a Hewson government, he could see Australia building uranium-enrichment plants in South Australia and the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition is committed to go down the path of uranium enrichment.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to suggest:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . while Australia does not need them now, by the end of the decade . . . Australia may need to assess nuclear power plants.</PARA>
<PARA>But when a bit of pressure comes on he walks away. If he got his way, the only thing that would help the National Party would be his ability to count his sheep in the dark, because they would be glowing. We do not need nuclear power in Australia. We do have the most efficient and effective coal-powered fire stations in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">BHP is now tapping the methane gas in the Bowen Basin. It is doing tests to see whether it is possible to feed that back into the State electricity grid. That is not only a benefit in reducing the danger in mines and getting rid of that gas, but in adding value and putting that productive capacity back into our power generation. I would like to compliment BHP in that regard. The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) and I spent two days visiting the BHP energy reserves in the Bowen Basin at Moranbah, at Moura, at Hay Point and at Dalrymple Bay. The port of Gladstone in my electorate exports 20 million tonnes of coal per annum, and we are increasing the capacity of that port by another 10 million tonnes. Dalrymple Bay and Hay Point export about 46 million tonnes of coal. Coal is one of the most important industries to my State of Queensland.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to participate in this debate this afternoon because over a period of more than 20 years I have been advocating a multi-State power grid for Australia, firstly, in my business life, running an electrical engineering business and, secondly, as the Chairman of the Natural Resources and Environment Committee in the Victorian Parliament. I was able to present a report to the Victorian Parliament in May 1988 on electricity supply and demand for the State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that report I recommended to the State Government, then the Cain Government, that Loy Yang should not proceed at that time. The unions overruled the Government on this decision and it was one of the many stupid and costly mistakes in Victoria which are now having such an effect on the Victorian community and have led to that State's massive indebtedness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many benefits in having a national power grid in the south-eastern States of Australia, linking up Queensland, New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria, South Australia and possibly Western Australia. Some of those advantages are immediate savings of around $200m a year; reduced capital expenditure on new generating plants; lower emissions, cutting greenhouse gases; and the ability to retire older, less efficient power stations. All link States would have access to low cost generating options, there would be greater flexibility in meeting peak load needs in link States and greater use of low cost generating resources such as high quality black coal and hydro. There would be scope to manage demand on a large scale and more flexibility in plant construction programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that the Government is failing to achieve in its move towards a national south-eastern grid is competition at every level within the electricity industry. What I advocate and have advocated for many years is that there should be competition in the supply of fuel. Coal, gas, water, all of those facilities which are used for the production of electricity, should be subject to competition. If we are moving into alternative power, as was suggested by the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen), who proposed this motion, there should be competition in that field as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the generation side of it, there should also be competition between the public and private sectors. Let us remove some of the work practices that have been entrenched in the power industry over many years, which lead to excessive costs. The honourable member for Cowan would be aware of those. I see her nodding. There should be competition in the public and private sectors of the generation of electric power. There should also be competition in the transmission side of it, in the heavy transmission and high voltage transmission lines, by the public and private sectors. In the distribution at the lower voltage level, there should also be competition between public and private sector companies so that they can in fact provide the Australian community with the cheapest power in the world. In Australia we should have the cheapest energy in the world. We have got the resources, we have got the technology, but we are not making use of the capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am concerned about is the way the Government is moving on this proposal. What it is going to have is a huge bureaucracy controlling the whole power industry. It will have a bureaucracy which has been repeated in each State expanded to a Federal level. I am concerned about that. We have already got competition at the retail level, in house wiring, farm, factory and shop. Why not have competition right through every level, through the transmission, distribution, generation and fuel sectors, so that we can get the lowest possible cost of energy in this country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I advocate a national power pooling system. The national grid corporation should be the overseer of that, but public and private involvement should be included in it. It should be monitored by the Government so that there is equity and fairness in that pooling operation, but not controlled by the bureaucracy. There should be public and private participation in that pooling system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There should also be full and open competition in the national electricity market. What we need to see is competition, irrespective of who provides it, whether it be a private company supplying it through a co-generation plant or whatever. There should be participation in that open market. It should be free and open and should be able to provide electricity at the lowest cost to Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I grieve for the families and the power workers in the Latrobe Valley where for far too long their lives have been controlled and managed by management and by unions who are quite clearly not locals. Nothing demonstrates this more effectively than the 40 per cent sale of Loy Yang B to a foreign multinational. This was done to help finance a moribund Kirner government. And Kelty entered into a workplace agreement. Why? Because his mate Kirner needed the money. Any thinking Australians must ask why we did not have a public float like the Commonwealth Bank. Australian brains designed and built Loy Yang. Australians will manage and run Loy Yang, and Victorians may end up paying dearly through the meter box for this folly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is Kelty able to deliver workplace reforms for a foreign multinational and still allow the Government owned power stations to wallow in work practices and demarcation disputes that are 40 years out of date? He does not care about the future, just his mates. Clearly he is not interested in the families and workers of the Latrobe Valley. Right now their future is at the crossroads. Union members may choose to become hairy-chested and march in protest against the recently elected Government and the area may continue to be seen as Victoria's worst area for industrial disputation, or the workers may choose to take a new direction. The way is open. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years, transport divisions, workshops and other areas of the SEC have been privatised. The briquette factory and Loy Yang B have all got new or partial new owners, with sensible work practices. All have one shortfall, though: no local ownership, no local equity. Local people have been excised right out of control and investment in their local industries. What they need to do right now is to take control of their future. First, the union movement must send a signal to all investors who will bring new industries to the valley. They must offer investors world best industrial practices. We have a highly skilled work force. The runs are on the board with Loy Yang B with regard to transport, the electrical workshops, the briquette factory. Let us forget the private sector. As distinct from the APPM dispute, APM has an outstanding relationship between management and the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next, and arguably the most important, stage is to call on the State Government, when privatising sections of the power generation industry in the valley, to first demonstrate that it is in the interest of all Victorians to do so; and, secondly, to give the opportunity to the average Victorian family, and especially the families of the Latrobe Valley workers, through a public float or a management buy-out to invest their money in their industry, in their future. We owe that to Australian children and to our grandchildren. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the recent State election campaign, there was much hoo-ha about industrial relations. The union movement ran the line to its members that they would be privatised, they would have lower wages, they would be bastardised and clearly disadvantaged by a change in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a gross distortion and a gross untruth. In the Latrobe Valley, most of the unions come under a Federal award. I personally will take the responsibility of ensuring, and have acted in this place at a committee level, to ensure that my workers in that area will not be disadvantaged by what can only be called a breakthrough in the industrial relations package of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). It is a brilliant package. It first and foremost guarantees quite clearly that no worker will be worse off than he is today. No workers have to leave the industrial system unless they choose to do so. No workers have to opt out of the award unless they find it to their advantage to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I make is that, if they choose to get into a voluntary employment agreement, then they will do so at their benefit. There must be a win/win situation. We must give the people at the workplace the power to control their future; we must give that power back to them. Nothing must be more frustrating than to be controlled by the whims of the Halfpennys of this world and to be controlled from somewhere outside the workers' own area. Nothing must be more frustrating than to go out on a strike called by people in Melbourne who have not the interests of workers at heart and who have clearly demonstrated they do not have those interests at heart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I say to the union movement of Latrobe Valley, `You have a golden opportunity. Under the Howard proposition, we do not mind if you represent the workers; we do not mind if the workers represent themselves as individuals; we do not mind if they form their own organisation to represent them with management'. We are clearly going to empower them&mdash;give them the freedom of choice. But more importantly we are going to give them a situation whereby they can raise their standard of living and ensure that world best practices will take place in their backyard to guarantee the future of their children and their grandchildren. Nothing irks me more than the waffle and half-truths that come from the Labor Government in this place. To hear the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) speak, people would think doomsday is coming under a Hewson government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This type of half-truth cannot be permitted to permeate through genuine Australians. It is an outrageous proposition. I congratulate the unions where they have taken on voluntary employment agreements or work based agreements. I think the agreement that has been made with a foreign multinational in Loy Yang B is one that is excellent. Fundamentally, it takes the nonsense of demarcation out of the workplace; it takes away the nonsense of worker against worker or worker against management and puts that power generation into world best practices. That happened with the union movement under Kelty, and I congratulate him for it. I also congratulate the local union movement which entered into an agreement with a briquette factory. Together they were quite clearly able to make the tough decision. They said, `If we keep going down the road we are going on now, we will not have an industry in two years time'. They accepted the proposition that the work force would be cut from around 700 to 300 workers and gave those people a future. I congratulate them for taking the hard decision. But I treat with total contempt those people who do not understand the position and who push forward half-truths that, with a change of government, that process will not continue. In fact, the position will be freed up and enhanced to once again give the men or women who are doing the job greater job satisfaction and a contribution to their own welfare. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some years ago, we changed the rules to indicate that, as long as a foreign investment was in Australia's best interests, it could take place. Later on we changed the rules again somewhat, and I think they said that as long as the foreign investment was not against Australia's interests we might let it flow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is okay, as long as we look at the merits of each case. I wish to look at the merits of this particular takeover. Arnotts is already substantially linked with Campbell. Campbell owns between 30 and 40 per cent of Arnotts and, in fact, Arnotts invited the bid in 1985, because Arnotts was in danger of being gobbled up by the Bond Corporation. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has given an indication of his view on this already and has taken a sensible line. He says he would have to consider:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whether Arnotts is capable of taking its products to Asia on its own and developing the necessary products and technology and developing the kind of distribution network needed to open up markets, or whether they need to be associated with an international company established in these markets and already operating successfully.</PARA>
<PARA>It raises two issues: the technology or the benefits that Campbell might bring to Arnotts, and the Asian strategy, an export strategy, that Arnotts or Campbell may have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two issues are in hot dispute. I am not here to solve them but to raise them. As a general proposition, I would argue that, if a foreign company can increase Australian exports, then that is a good thing. However, if most of the earnings of those increased exports do not flow to Australians, it is of very little use, other than that there are Australians employed and that governments can tax those earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However we state the rules on foreign investment in this country, we need to constantly ask whether we are getting the best deal here. Because we have changed the rules over time too, we need to refer to the 1985 decision of the Foreign Investment Review Board. That decision is now in hot dispute because it seems that Campbell said then, when it first bought into Arnotts:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Campbell is able to market new technology breakthroughs by Arnotts throughout the world.</PARA>
<PARA>The problem is, it has not. I understand that Arnotts has developed a most important process, which makes it a world leader in the quality and efficiency by which it can manufacture its biscuits. There is nothing unusual about that. But when Arnotts asked that its new technology be used in the USA&mdash;the parent company's home&mdash;the parent company said, `No, you will not introduce that Australian technology into our American market'. I am not talking about a tit for tat situation where we take our fermentation process and run; I am simply saying that undertakings given to the Australian Government by a foreign company in 1985 appear not to have been complied with. I think that the Government today ought to revisit that statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest to the Treasurer that, if there is any sense in which a company gave the Australian Government and Australian people an undertaking in 1985 and then did not fulfil that to the full, he ought to take a hard line on it now, and say no to the further investment of Campbell in Arnotts. I am not taking a head in the sand attitude; I am simply saying that we are entitled to revisit the decision when we again need to question whether there are great benefits in this takeover for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another question in this issue relates to the ability of Arnotts or Campbell to export into Asia. Two Australian companies, Goodman Fielder Wattie and Pacific Dunlop have taken the view that they do not need to be overtaken by a foreign multinational in order to use their networks in Asia and that they can, in fact, undertake strategic alliances with other food companies. Goodman Fielder Wattie and Pacific Dunlop are now exporting in fairly large numbers to Asia by means of these strategic alliances. In other words, they are not controlled by a foreign company, but they use some foreign investment and basically work with the Asians in order to open up that market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give an indication of the size of the Asian market. Obviously, it is most important that Australians get into that market. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 23 October Florence Chong tells us:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rapidly growing Asian market is the ultimate prize for the few giants. Japan alone imports processed food valued at about $40 billion each year. Other Asian countries, led by Hong Kong with $US4.6 billion. . . spent a total of $US18.4 billion on food imports in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>She goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the total Asian food industry will grow to about $US700 billion by 2000. This compares with a projected $US36 billion for Australia's food industry.</PARA>
<PARA>We need to get into that market. Has Arnotts done as well as it might in moving into the Asian market? The evidence seems to be that it has not. Mr Bourke from Arnotts was reported as saying at an International Advertising Association lunch that, while Arnotts' initial focus would be on consolidating distribution agreements for its products in Asia, its ultimate aim was to establish joint ventures with local manufacturers&mdash;I guess along the lines that GFW and Pacific Dunlop meant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision is a difficult one. It seems to me that Arnotts has not done sufficient homework to lift its exports in Asia. I suggest that it deserves the chance to do that under its own steam, in conjunction with a minority holding by Campbell. I also suggest that Campbell not be allowed to take over Arnotts, if it is within the Commonwealth Government's powers to stop that. Campbell certainly has not proved the case, although we have more material to read. In fact, it could improve the new company's effort in exporting to Asia&mdash;given that there are other ways to do it, as other Australian companies have shown. It seems clear on the evidence that I have&mdash;even though it cannot be determined yet&mdash;that the promises made by Campbell in 1985 have not been fulfilled and are not likely to be fulfilled after 1992. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since February 1991 it has been mandatory for all cyclists to wear bicycle helmets. These helmets must comply with a mandatory standard, and it is an offence under section 65C(1)(a) of the Trade Practices Act for any company to supply helmets which do not comply with that mandatory standard. It is the legal responsibility of individual manufacturers to ensure that their helmets comply with the mandatory standard which is administered by the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs and the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In practice, manufacturers submit their helmets to Standards Australia for testing. Once the helmet has passed its test and is accredited as complying with not only the mandatory standard but also standards developed by Standards Australia, the manufacturer is able to put the Standards Australia certification mark on that helmet. This certification mark is supposed to designate that the product that bears that mark has been tested to the highest quality and safety standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to ensure the highest level of safety, the mandatory standard states quite clearly in 4.1.2:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there be nothing fitted anywhere on the helmet, whether as a component or as an accessory, which is likely to cause injury to the wearer in the event of any accident.</PARA>
<PARA>These conditions are clearly spelt out in the mandatory standard, but it has been brought to my attention that a bicycle helmet containing a battery light fixed at the rear of the helmet is on sale. It is bad enough that a helmet that clearly does not comply with the mandatory standard is freely available but that helmet, called the `headlight bicycle helmet', has clearly displayed on it the accreditation mark of Standards Australia. In other words, when any consumer walks into a store to purchase a bicycle helmet there is at least one helmet that has been brought to my attention that does not comply with the mandatory standard of safety but which displays an accreditation mark that is supposed to stand for the highest quality and safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have on two occasions now consulted Dr Michael Henderson, arguably one of Australia's leading experts in the field of safety testing. In fact, he was the first chairman of the committee that wrote the original Australian standard for lightweight general purpose helmets. It is the view of Dr Henderson, supported by other medical and technical experts, that there is the risk of the batteries located in the rear compartment of the helmet being forced into the skull of the person wearing this particular helmet if the impact from the accident was from the rear. And remember, one in 14 bicycle accidents results from impact to the back of the head. As well as this risk there is an added risk because this particular helmet does not comply with yet another clause of the Australian standard, namely, that all the components of the protective helmet, the hard casing or shell and the interior layers of foam used to absorb impact, must be permanently attached to one another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, Dr Henderson said in his assessment report of the headlight bicycle helmet:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the opinion of this consultant, the subject helmet represents a real and direct threat of injury to the user in the event of an accident. It is likely to become dislodged. It is likely to inflict scalping injury in the event of movement or dislodgment and it is likely to allow transmission of high and injurious loadings to the skull through the inbuilt batteries and associated equipment.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Henderson recommended that immediate steps be taken to alert Standards Australia and the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs. I am aware that the Bureau has been alerted to the safety risks of this helmet and it has been repeatedly contacted by Mr Frank Matich and Dr Ellen Beerworth of Mallesons Stephen Jaques on his behalf since 18 June this year. As well as urging the Bureau to investigate this serious matter, they have provided at their own expense the results of tests conducted on the helmet by Crashlab which showed that the helmet failed three of four tests. Dr Michael Henderson informed the Bureau on 1 July:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an impact over the batteries in the Headlight helmet is sooner or later inevitable and even at impact loads well below those specified in the standard, life threatening fracture of the skull will occur. `In my opinion', said Dr Henderson, `this helmet is a highly dangerous product'.</PARA>
<PARA>The Bureau did have discussions with Standards Australia and commissioned the headlight helmet to be tested by two laboratories, Crashlab and Technisearch, for withstanding load impact. But it did not commission those labs to test for the safety hazard it had been warned about, with the result that the Crash Lab report of 2 July 1992 stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further testing is required to establish the injury potential of the lighting system fitted to the helmet.</PARA>
<PARA>I am informed by Dr Beerworth that the Technisearch report was undated, was not approved by the National Association of Testing Authorities signatory, and did not comment on the likelihood of the battery component causing injury. The Bureau was informed by Dr Tony Ryan from the University of Adelaide, yet another highly respected safety expert, that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The batteries and lighting components are fitted to these helmets in such a way that they are likely to cause injury to the wearer in impacts to the rear of the helmet.</PARA>
<PARA>What did the Bureau have to say about these serious issues of product safety? It said it was not convinced that the headlight helmet did not comply with the requirements of the mandatory standard, and it was not prepared to take any further action. On 15 August 1992 yet another expert, Dr Michael Payne from Vehicle Design and Research Pty Ltd, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nothing in the papers submitted by the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs has altered my earlier conclusion that the battery pack of the Headlight helmet is likely to cause injury to the wearer in the event of an impact at the rear. The papers appear to be pre-occupied with an attempt to undermine the assessment criteria and they lose sight of the fundamental safety problem&mdash;you should not put a hard object next to the head.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, today I have taken the very serious step of naming the headlight helmet in this place because I am so concerned for the safety of the wearers of that helmet. I sincerely hope that by bringing this matter to the attention of the House today I might be able to force the Minister and the Bureau to act in the interests of those thousands of consumers at risk now and in the future. The Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) stated in a letter to Dr Beerworth on 10 September:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bureau has advised me that it is of the view that the Headlight helmet does not pose a safety risk to a level that would justify mandatory action under the Trade Practices Act 1974.</PARA>
<PARA>What will it take for the Minister and the Bureau to take action? Will it take the death or permanent impairment of a child before they act? I want to know why the Minister and the Bureau of Consumer Affairs have repeatedly failed to investigate the specific questions of safety about this helmet that they have been alerted to by some of the leading safety experts in this country. Why do they continue to allow this helmet, which clearly does not comply with the mandatory standard on three different issues, to clearly display the prestigious Standards Australia mark of quality and safety?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am now very concerned and uneasy about the accreditation process of granting the Standards Australia mark. How many other products do not comply with mandatory standards but also display the Standards Australia mark? This has very serious implications, not only for the safety of consumers but for the reputation of our exports. I am sure we will all remember the meat substitution racket and what damage that did to our reputation as an exporting nation. These are very serious issues. I am today tabling questions on notice to the Minister. On behalf of all Australian consumers I demand answers to my questions as a matter of urgency, and I assure all consumers that I will continue to pursue this matter on their behalf. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to discuss the matter of health, particularly some of those issues which affect women, in relation to our National Women's Health Policy Unit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the previous few weeks we have heard a great discussion from the Health Ministers Council in relation to the whole issue of Medicare and the role of private insurance in Australia. Indeed, to hear some of those Ministers speak, particularly the Ministers from New South Wales and Victoria, one would assume that the Federal Government does not in fact fund our private health insurance. Let me assure taxpayers, and I am sure they will grieve with me when they learn this, the private health insurance companies are in fact supported by the Australian taxpayer to the tune of $800m. Imagine what a contribution this could make to the public hospitals and the waiting lists in our community if that money were channelled directly to the public health sector and not to propping up private health insurance companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard a great deal of discussion in the last few weeks about private health insurance and other matters in relation to the United States election campaign. Indeed, health, health coverage and the issue of health insurance are included in the major changes which Clinton has said he will bring about in America, where we know that millions of people have no health cover at all. I can tell the House quite categorically of the experience of a family friend of my mother's who lives in Florida. The old lady over the road fell down, and when the ambulance arrived and discovered she did not have a particular health cover, it drove away and left her there with her broken hip. Is this the kind of private health insurance that we as Australians want or demand for our country, given that we have a program such as Medicare?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The health services which we have in this country for the health of the community in general are considerably wider than Medicare. We also have a range of services, as I have said, funded through the National Women's Health Policy Unit. While there has been a deal of discussion about the notion of women's health services, it is important to recognise that 54 per cent of voters are women, that women live longer and that women in general have the carer's role within the family for their children, their parents and their partner, should they have one. So it is important to ensure as a community that women look after their own health and they will then continue to be able to care for and look after others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in that context I raise the issue of some other services which would appear to be in jeopardy from the kind of proposal made by the Opposition. I will mention three particular kinds of services. One is the women's health centres, which provide particular and specific information and service to women in the whole area of health. The health centres are certainly about prevention and have taken up the kinds of medical problems which relate specifically to women, such as cervical cancer, Pap smears, osteoporosis, ageing and menopause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other centres currently funded are the family planning centres. They exist throughout Australia to ensure that women have choice about planning their own families and to enable them to have access to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third group I want to mention is the Nursing Mothers Association. Many people may know that the Nursing Mothers Association exists. It was founded by a Victorian woman, Marie Paton, and it has been in existence for something like 20 years. It provides small branches for women with young babies and, indeed, for fathers as well, to meet and provide support for each other. Although I am not a mother, my experience with the Nursing Mothers Association over quite a long time has shown me that it responds to the needs of families in the community. As such, they are then able to take on and reflect the needs and demands of that community. They can be different things to different people at various times, because they are small and are staffed in the main by volunteers who are quite expert on the issue of breast feeding and children's nutrition and they assist and support each other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Nursing Mothers Association has also been active in pursuing the Australian Government in relation to the whole issue of the milk supplements, which has caused great problems throughout the developed world. So it was that, on 23 October 1992, I was delighted to be able to open the branch office of the Nursing Mothers Association of Australia in Queensland. Indeed, it has been quite some time in coming. It was funded by the Federal Government, through the National Women's Health Policy Unit, to establish a base from which to continue to develop support for rural and isolated counsellors, as well as for the general operation of the Queensland branch. We also acknowledge the support from the State Labor Government, the Goss Government, in helping to assist with the provision of premises, along with the Mater Children's Hospital. Ruth Terwijn, the Queensland branch President, and her whole management team were there to welcome people and to address what are important health issues for mothers and children in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Nursing Mothers Association well exemplifies the kinds of organisations that exist in our community to support mothers and children. It is quite ironic that we hear a great deal of discussion from honourable members opposite about the whole question of family values and the role of the family. Health is very much at the heart of families and their general well-being, and it is mothers, indeed, who take the carriage of this. So it is with an enormous amount of pride that we extend congratulations to the Queensland branch President and her management team on the opening of what we know will be a wonderful branch office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It worries me and concerns those people who use the services of Nursing Mothers now and have done so in the past, those people who use the services of family planning centres, those who have been involved in women's health centres and who know and understand their vital role for Australian families, that these services should in any way be brought into jeopardy by some notion of user pays or some question of privatising any of these sorts of operations and dismantling the National Women's Health Policy Unit. I think that, at the heart of this, is the whole question of Medicare, and that we need to focus very carefully on what is actually being proposed by the Opposition, not just for us as individuals but for us as a community because, while Medicare has existed, it has kept our medical costs down in relation to our gross domestic product. The private health sector in America has not done this, and the Government there has been unable to cap these costs because of the power of that private health insurance sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of Australian taxpayers, I say, with great concern, that that $800m that goes to private health insurance companies in Australia could perhaps be better spent in upgrading and supporting what are wonderful public health hospitals throughout Australia. I urge people to consider seriously the role of groups in our community such as the Nursing Mothers Association, the family planning and the women's health centres, when they consider the kind of society we want. I urge them to recognise that it has been this Government which has provided support for those organisations in the interests of the health of all Australian families, irrespective of their income. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, like you, I spend a lot of time in my electorate travelling around and speaking to people. One particular group that I have taken a great deal of notice of recently is the small business sector. Within that small business sector, of course, I include farmers. The small business sector is really that sector of the community that employs most people. Until we do something to get the infrastructure right, to get small business back on its feet again, we are going to have a massive unemployment problem&mdash;as we have now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I carried out a business survey in my electorate because I was concerned about these people. I had many returns and with those returns I received a number of letters. I have a letter here that I would like to read to the House because I think it epitomises what small business people in our community and the general public are thinking with regard to what is wrong with Australia today. The letter says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr. Hicks,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your interest in the local business community with your Small Business Survey . . . I thought I'd drop you a line with some points that I think are relevant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I come from a long line of farming people and most of my life has been spent in this area. I have seen the fruits of my Grandfathers years of hard work with a pick and shovel battling against the elements. The thing I thought would surely lead to success in my life time in Australia was hard work. I am afraid that the way Australia is now, my idea and my ideals are wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no incentive to take the risk and put up your house and all you own to go into business now. The interest rates that have been charged in the last few years have stripped any return for hard work put in by myself and my wife into this business. The amount of extra expense and paperwork to employ people has just gotten out of hand. My wife and I and our son exist on $200 drawings per week and the lowest paid employee in our business is taking home more than us and working only 38 hours per week, being paid for public holidays, receiving 4 weeks annual leave with full pay and on top of that he gets paid an extra 17.5% for NOT working. Not to mention the superannuation being paid by us for his retirement and the workers comp in case he is injured. The question I guess I am asking is .. Who is looking after us? Where is the incentive for me? Why do this?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can't compete with the welfare system in this country. I have been advertising for a tradesman to run our workshop to reduce my workload. We also placed the vacancy with the C.E.S. They sent around some people who fitted the job description. One bloke came from near Newcastle, the C.E.S paid for the petrol for him to travel here and paid a nights accommodation for him and his wife. A brief history on him was that he was in business with another 2 partners and one partner bought out the other 2. He took the money from this and went around Australia on an extended holiday with his wife and 5 kids for 12 months. He returned home and was out of work for 12 months. We made him an offer of employment at the award rate of pay plus over award payment to reach the award plus $100 in the hand per week. A total of $430 per week to take home. The actual cost to us for wages alone was in excess of $650 per week plus super, holiday pay, plus the 17.5% plus, plus, plus. He thanked us for the offer and said he was being paid by the Government a total of $420 a week in the hand plus free medical for him and his family and a low interest subsidy home loan because he was unemployed. I can't compete with the welfare system. In effect he would be getting paid a total of $10 for 38 hours work compared to $420 a week for not working. Tell me where is the incentive for me? Is this fair? We haven't heard from him since, I don't blame him. Unfortunately if I had the choice between working for $430 a week and not working for $420, regrettably I'd be tempted not to work. Wouldn't you? Imagine the message this is sending to his kids (the eldest is around 14 or so). On top of his payments the bugger was working with his brother in law on the sly and getting $100 a day as a labourer. I give up!!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have lost a lot since my Grandfather gave up the pick and shovel and the saddest thing is that we didn't even notice it went. When he retired there was no story in the Sydney Morning Herald "Lou Henley Retires after 60 Years Farming", the front page was full that day with "Employees Strike for More Pay" or "Workers Granted 17.5% Loading". We have lost the most valuable commodity we had, THE WORK ETHIC. The Japanese now own it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Look at this country Noel, look at the mothers of new born babies leaving them in service station toilets, on the bonnet of a taxi outside a city hospital, look at the people being thrown off their farms, look at the bankruptcies, look at the despair in the business people as they face the Bank Manager, look at the record unemployment and then take a look at that bastard sitting on his butt taking $420 per week for not working. What have we done? We're buggering this country up.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where are we headed. I thought hard work would conquer all. We have taken the incentive out of it. We have taken the zest for life out of the young farmer thrown off his farm because he couldn't keep up the interest payments. We have taken the will out of the business person to employ people because the employee makes more out of the business than the owner does and works less for it. We've given over to a feeling that to succeed and be financially secure is to be frowned upon&mdash;the tall poppy syndrome reigns supreme. We have given over to where we choose not to work and we are paid well not to.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hope springs eternal. Perhaps the Member for Riverina-Darling will stand up in Parliament and read this out and the other Pollies will realise that we have the equation wrong. Instead of giving the money to people just to survive why don't we give it to that young farmer to get back onto the land so he will employ that bloke on $420 a week sitting at home. Why don't we give it to the business person facing the Bank Manager to ease his load, so instead of spending all his time struggling to stay afloat he could spend it running his business and employing people.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads me on to the alarming figures that appeared in the media yesterday showing that there has been a 20 per cent increase in the number of families with one or both of the parents unemployed&mdash;an increase of 53,600 overall on the June 1991 figure. I congratulate the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) on the concern she expressed for mothers and for women in our community, who do after all carry a great burden, particularly in rural areas where their men have to go out and work through drought and through all sorts of problems they face in the bush. They have to cheer up their menfolk as they come home dejected because the price of their stock is low and they cannot get any return. Besides that, they stand side by side with their men in trying to work the property, and that is taking a great toll on their health. It is certainly agreed that we must do all we can to assist women who are in these difficult situations&mdash;not only women in the bush but women right throughout Australia. I think the best thing we can do for women in this country is to do something about our infrastructure. We have to do something to get these many people back to work, particularly family people and breadwinners. If this Government cannot do it, I think it has to stand aside. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night in the Western Australian Parliament there was acted out a political charade that must rank as one of the cheapest political acts that any parliament of this country has ever indulged in. The Liberal Party, with the reluctant support of the National Party, moved a very serious motion. It moved that, as a result of matters arising from the Royal Commission into what is commonly called WA Inc., Julian Grill, the member for Eyre, should be expelled from the Parliament. The Liberal Party talked this motion up in the media all day Tuesday and on Wednesday. It very clearly avoided bringing the motion on in the Parliament. Its tactics appear to have been to let the matter ferment and fester in the media. When late on Wednesday night it was forced by the Premier, Carmen Lawrence, to bring on the debate&mdash;as the Premier said, this was a very serious motion of a kind never before moved in the history of the Western Australian Parliament&mdash;it was an abject failure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The young Mr Court spoke for 20 minutes of his allotted hour, and he was clearly floundering around. He spoke in the most general of generalities. To describe his attack as lacking in substance would be a total understatement. He was followed by another member who got to his feet and said that he would second the motion, and then reserved his right to speak. That was Mr Doug Shave, the member for one of the obscure suburbs there. He was followed by the member for Applecross, whose name eludes me. He jumped to his feet and was promptly told to sit down by the Liberal Party. The matter went to a vote and was defeated. It was defeated with all the independents supporting Mr Grill. Leading members of the National Party shortly afterwards approached Mr Grill and said that they thought the motion was treated with the contempt it deserved. They were quite clearly happy that it had been so soundly defeated. I am alarmed that people should be so quick to impugn character and indulge in character assassination. Often they are working on the adage that some mud will always stick. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Julian Grill is a particular friend of mine. He is without doubt the most capable Minister the Western Australian Parliament has seen in many years. That is not just my view, it is the view of many of the senior public servants who worked under him in his departments. As a measure of his integrity, I recall that when the Labor Party won power Julian was our spokesman for minerals and energy. He had a very significant share portfolio in the mining industry, and he sold the whole portfolio knowing full well that some of the shares were about to boom. One of the companies, in fact, was a company he had set up and owned. I said to him that I thought he was being hasty and that he should put his shares into escrow to distance himself from them. He said no, he felt that there would be a conflict of interest and he preferred to quit the whole lot. He did that at a considerable loss. I would say he knowingly walked away from between $5m and $7m which eventuated within six months. I wonder how many other people would have had the integrity to do that. I have asked myself the question, and I think I would have failed the test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we see that man impugned and hounded by a vexatious and ignorant media. I want to say something about the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>. I think the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>, today, is a disgrace. It is very easy to criticise this Parliament, but the fourth estate of the realm, the media, does have a very responsible part to play in the Westminster system. Through the 1980s, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> sat on its hands. Through the 1980s, when I was expressing concern about some of the actions that were taking place, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> was mute. Now it is embarking on a sanctimonious adventure, and it is reeking in its own self-righteousness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could say it is simply the paper overreacting, but I think not. Paul Murray, the editor, is a man with a profound political ambition. He wants to be the leader of the Liberal Party. His plan is that for five years he will be editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>, a monopoly institution in Western Australia. He will pontificate and fulminate; he will act most sanctimoniously and utter his platitudes in the most stained glass of attitudes. Then he will assume a position in a safe Liberal seat and hope to be the leader within a short time. That is Mr Murray's game plan, and he is prepared to sacrifice anything for his own ambition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to say something about the Royal Commission, because it has been said that the members of the Royal Commission were dishonest. I think that is quite a reasonable conclusion to draw, but there is another conclusion: they could very well be stupid. There is a lot of evidence to support that. There is yet another conclusion, and that is that the substance of the Royal Commission recommendations were written not by the commissioners but by Brian Martin, QC. I want to say a few words about Brian Martin, because I think he represents all that is despicable and distasteful about the legal profession. It is a cesspool of a profession if ever there was one. In his recommendations this man pontificates about open government. He declares that we must have a transparent government, and yet this man approached the Western Australian Government and demanded that his own remuneration be kept secret. He received $1,083,000 for his share in the Royal Commission fiasco, but he wanted this kept secret. He not only wanted it kept secret, but he wanted the Western Australian Government to pay it into a company account&mdash;which would, of course, have the effect of minimising taxation. This makes very hollow the protestations of the Royal Commission, and I want to put on the record the sort of behaviour we have had from this man who turned out to be counsel for the prosecution&mdash;this Torquemada of the twentieth century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we examine the substance of the Royal Commission report and what the Royal Commission said were facts, and if these facts generally coincide with what the original McCusker report said were facts, then I think we can assume they are. It is interesting to note that the Royal Commission uncovered nothing the McCusker report had not uncovered; it simply put different connotations on it&mdash;the very worst connotations one can think of. It was a mean-spirited document, to say the very least. When we look at what the Royal Commission actually found to be facts, we cannot then logically come to the conclusions that the Commission did in its criticism of Mr Grill in relation to the loan with Western Collieries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Grill was the Acting Minister; he was specifically excluded from all these negotiations, by both Premier Burke and Premier Dowding. I think the reason was that Burke and Dowding both knew of Grill's integrity and ability, and knew that he would not suffer any nonsense. The proposition had been put forward by the Under-Secretary&mdash;not by the Government, I stress&mdash;that the Government should forward-buy coal from Western Collieries, which was a totally owned entity of Rothwells. It was a perfectly legitimate commercial transaction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Premier Dowding called in the top legal brains in the State to assess the proposition. They said, `Yes; it is perfectly legitimate. There are absolutely no problems at all'. They needed the Acting Minister to give the authorisation to his Department to undertake the transaction, and Mr Grill did so. He arrived when the meeting was in progress, and left before it had finished. As it turns out, the Commission has not mentioned at all the leading legal people who were there giving advice. One of them, of course, is Justice Owen of the Supreme Court. That did not even rate a mention. I do not see why it should. What they did was totally proper. If it was totally proper, it must simply follow that what Mr Grill did could in no way be improper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an absolute travesty of justice that we have had some very responsible people's characters besmirched by what I can only describe as a lightweight inquiry; $30m of taxpayers' money went into a lightweight, politically motivated inquiry. Of course, it is on the record that Brian Martin, even back in his law school days, was an ardent Liberal. How the Premier could have had the stupidity to appoint him to such a position is beyond me. But when one sees some of the other appointments of the Western Australian Government, one must decide that stupidity is perhaps not uncommon.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it difficult to follow that last remark. I agree entirely with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). I address the House of Representatives today on the most important of topics, a topic which I hope transcends petty politics or any squabbling which might go on in this chamber. I am speaking of our future and that of our children, and about the precious environment in which they live. As I represent the seat of Lowe, in the inner west of Sydney, I am especially concerned, of course, with children. Our community has a large number of young families with young children, who are really doing it tough in this terrible recession. There is no doubt that economics&mdash;in particular, the recession that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) says we had to have&mdash;has a great deal to do with their plight. But this Government has not only done economic damage to Australia, it has also subjected it to environmental neglect. It is a story that is not often told, but that does need to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the inner west, we are not blessed with world famous rainforests or luxurious beaches, but we do have our parks and our reserves and we value them greatly, if only because so much of our time is spent in the concrete jungle. Indeed, we have two of the busiest thoroughfares in the country running through the inner west&mdash;Parramatta Road and the Hume Highway, or Liverpool Road. Recent studies have shown that lead levels, partly related to the thoroughfare of those two roads, amongst our children are disturbingly high. We have the Haberfield Canal in Haberfield and the Cooks River in South Strathfield which have been abused for more than a century. We have in Ashfield an industrial site, referred to as the AWA site, on which recently asbestos and chemical drums have been discovered. We have some levels of toxins in Homebush Bay just off Concord West and just off Rhodes. We have proposals to establish a medical waste dump in South Strathfield, as well as a massive truck depot on top of the last remnant of urban bushland in Greenacre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is not all bad news locally. I am pleased to report that I played a small role at least in protecting some of our local environment. A study of the Hawthorne Canal in Haberfield will soon be expedited by the New South Wales State Government with a view towards cleaning it up. The New South Wales Minister for Environment will shortly be joining me on an inspection of the AWA site in Ashfield and I will also be discussing toxins in Homebush Bay with Minister Hartcher, who I might add has brought a tremendous degree of responsiveness and dedication to his portfolio in a very short span. Also, together with local residents and local councils, our community thoroughly defeated the Greenacre truck depot scheme and the South Strathfield medical waste dump. I am also happy to have helped secure a listing in the National Estate for the Brays Bay reserve, a unique mangrove ecosystem on the foreshores of the Parramatta River in Concord. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question which now must be asked is: who is missing from this picture? The New South Wales Government has enhanced its commitment through various programs and is spending unprecedented levels of funds on cleaning up the environment. Local councils are generally diligent in their approach and all have set up recycling programs lately. Most certainly our local residents are vocal, determined and commendably active when it comes to exercising their democratic rights for the environment, and I am pleased to have been of some help to them. So the question remains: who is missing? The answer is very sad. The one level of government which is capable of setting a real environmental agenda and having us lead the world on these matters, is the Federal Government, but it is missing. When it comes to the environment Labor has been hopeless, hapless and heartless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Australian Conservation Foundation, Labor has made 104 environmental promises. Of these 104, it has broken 63 and made only partial progress on 13 others. One of the major broken promises is failure to annually report on the state of the environment to this Parliament. One wonders what it has got to hide or conceal. Do the people not deserve to be informed about what their elected Government is doing to protect our greatest gift? I know I speak for the people of the inner west when I say it is our right to know. It seems the Government is more concerned with eradicating a great part of our exploratory history&mdash;Australia's Antarctic huskies&mdash;than speaking the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that I act in line with the finest of Liberal environmental traditions. Let no-one forget that, in contrast to Labor's broken promises, designed to secure short term votes when they needed them, Liberal governments established the first environment ministry; they nominated the first five Australian listings in the World Heritage List; they enacted laws to protect Antarctica; ended whaling; introduced unleaded petrol; proclaimed the Great Barrier Reef, Kakadu and Uluru national parks; and more. For the sake of the children in the inner west of Sydney, I sincerely hope to continue this great Liberal tradition of protecting the environment, giving clean air, clean water and green spaces and preserving those for our future generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another issue which I wish to address and grieve about today and that is the issue which was raised in the private member's motion moved by the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) earlier today, which is the question of the so-called Republic of Macedonia. I say `so-called' because, as was addressed in the debate this morning, one of the key factors is whether the republic based on Skopje has indeed the right to be called Macedonia. I would very vigorously and very strongly contest that right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my mind, and to the minds of most people who have evaluated this situation, Macedonia is a name which has always been associated with Greece and with Greek culture. There is indeed a committee&mdash;the Greekness of Macedonia Committee&mdash;which I think in essence sums up the whole problem. Macedonia is a Greek name, it always has been a Greek name and I am optimistic that it will always remain a Greek name. This is a situation which goes back literally for thousands of years. Alexander the Great was in fact Alexander the Greek. Honourable members may recall that he was the son of Philip of Macedon. Macedonia has an association with the Greek heritage which dates back literally three or four thousand years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situations which were raised by the speakers this morning related, amongst others, to the question of future potential conflicts between the new republic, based on Skopje, and the Macedonian area of northern Greece.  One of the points raised seemed to be somewhat contradictory. On the one hand it was said that the new, so-called Macedonian Republic had only 6,000 members in its armed forces and very little in the way of armaments. Almost in the same breath, the honourable member for Stirling said that if something were not done soon there was a potential for this area to become a future battlefield. This point was reiterated by another speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Stirling cannot on the one hand say there is no problem because there is no army, and on the other say that there is a potential battlefield problem. Clearly, the problem is not an urgent one in terms of territorial claims, but it is a long term, future problem. Obviously, if the name `Macedonia' is usurped from the Greek community, and that is what is being proposed, then it has the potential for being misused in terms of territorial claims in the future. The proposal is completely unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Stirling also accused Greece of blocking the formation of a new republic. That is a complete distortion of the truth. Neither Greece nor, to my knowledge, any other country around the world wishes to block the formation of an independent republic. The only concern is over the name which that republic should adopt. It should not steal the name Macedonia from Greece. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member's description of Greece as using imperialist powers and his likening of Greece to the Soviet Union dictatorship were not only incorrect but, in my view, grossly offensive. The Greek Government is simply defending its right to the name Macedonia, a name which always has been, and always will be, Greek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is well known to this House that I have always supported the foundation of a truly independent republic, based on Skopje, provided it meets the appropriate requirements for independence and is a truly democratic republic&mdash;there are some questions about that at present&mdash;but I will never agree to such a republic being known as Macedonia. Macedonia is the name for the Greek area which has always been Greek and, to my mind, always will be Greek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was stated here earlier today that there need be no concerns about territorial ambitions of the new republic. I would dispute that. I seem to remember Hitler used the same statement that he had no territorial claims with regard to almost any country in Europe at one stage or another, yet of course his territorial ambitions, as became clear as time wore on, related not only to every country in Europe but pretty well to every country in the world. So mere statements that there are no territorial claims are entirely inappropriate and they have to be dismissed; they are not worth the paper they are written on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased that the debate this morning was on a private member's motion. That means that it carries no weight of law and that there was no division in this House with regard to the matter. However, I was saddened that because of the constraints of the private member's motion format I was unable to have the opportunity to participate in the debate. This is a matter of great importance. It is not just a matter of importance to Greece or the new Republic, it is a matter of great importance to everybody in that area and, indeed, to everybody concerned with world peace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the blow-up that has occurred in the area governed by the former Yugoslav Republic. We know how historically this is an area where conflict has raged interminably in many cases. We know that the potential is very strong there for this to occur again. One of the things we must be very careful not to do is to put in place a situation that has the potential to trigger off yet another conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greek Government has stated repeatedly that it has no designs whatsoever on the new republic, whatever it may be called&mdash;so long as it is not Macedonia&mdash;and I accept entirely the word of the Greek Government in this regard. It has no territorial ambitions, as far as I am aware, but we should make sure there is no potential for conflict here by usurping the Greek name `Macedonia' and giving it to a new republic based on Skopje. As I said, I am happy to see a new republic. I just do not want it to be called Macedonia, with all the problems that could cause in terms of future conflict and in terms of usurping Greek culture. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Pam and Michael Tully and three friends have set up a bat nursery in a shed in the rainforest near a colony of fruit bats, or flying foxes, that have been attacked by a deadly paralysis tick.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The flying fox colony breeds once a year. For the last two years the breeding season has coincided with an outbreak of ticks which paralyse the bats. Once bitten, the bats drop to the forest floor and, unable to move, die of starvation. Michael and any volunteers he can recruit scour the forest floor for paralysed bats. He then takes them back to the bat nursery where Pam, a nurse, kills the ticks and treats all newcomers with a serum supplied by a vet in Cairns. Baby bats are kept wrapped in cotton bunny-rugs in cribs and then bottle fed at regular intervals by volunteer foster parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pam and Michael urgently need donations of fruit and fruit juices to keep the mature bats alive and to feed the babies as they get older. This bat nursery is an inspiring example of grassroots environmental action that all Australians should be proud of and support. I urge anyone in North Queensland who has fruit to spare to contact my office. Pam would also like to hear from people who would like to foster a baby bat in their home. Fostered bats are returned to the forest at four months of age. Pam and Michael Tully, I might add, are not being paid a cent for this superb work. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now whilst it is important for the Prime Minister to reveal which senators represent which breeds&mdash;as this will certainly assist in reducing both the horrific unemployment and international debt his policies have inflicted on this country&mdash;I believe it is even more important to establish whether or not the good Senators have commenced action to remove the word `Minister' from Mr Keating's title, and replace it with the word `pork'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Institute study was funded by the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department, the equivalent of our Taxation Office.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations. Can the Minister inform the House whether the changing nature of industrial awards is resulting in any detriment to workers' minimum wages and conditions? Does the Government have plans to increase the flexibility of the system to the point where these minimum conditions could be reduced?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2729" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government, of course, is concerned to achieve increased flexibility in the industrial relations system and, particularly through the process of enterprise bargaining, to bring about a much more flexible arrangement at workplaces, to the satisfaction of employers and employees. I am pleased to say that that is progressing very well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, a fundamental aspect of our policy in that regard is that there should be no disadvantage to employees and although, in effect, the management and employees have the right, in conjunction with the unions, to rewrite the awards virtually as they see fit, so long as there is no disadvantage to the employees that, of course, is a major change in the system. It is one which stands in stark contrast to that which is proposed by the Opposition which, of course, has no such concern about disadvantage to employees. It is a matter of concern that whilst we are concerned to have that flexibility without disadvantage to employees, the Opposition policy would expose many workers to the likelihood of reduced wages and conditions of employment.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us just look at this backtracking. It most particularly relates to minimum wages that are proposed to apply to individual contracts. What the policy said when it was first released under the so-called Jobsback statement was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minimum conditions to be observed by all workplace agreements for full-time employees will be:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i) a minimum hourly wage for adults:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">&mdash;an hourly rate of not less than the base hourly minimum rate for ordinary time hours&mdash;exclusive of penalties, allowances and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">loadings&mdash;applicable to a full-time adult employee under the <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">relevant award . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That statement was generally taken to be a statement which meant that there was a base rate in the award, that the lowest classification rate would be the minimum wage. That is generally accepted to be the case, and indeed the statements that were made subsequent to the release indicated that that was the view even of honourable members opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, the Leader of the Opposition a few days later was saying that the coalition government might introduce a uniform minimum wage in the future. He was talking about a uniform minimum wage. How can you have a uniform minimum wage if, in fact, it is not of the kind that we were saying, that is, that it was the base rate in the award and not the rate, as the honourable member for Bennelong is now trying to say, which would apply to any classification? The honourable member for Bennelong has now put out a press statement trying to say that when they talked about the minimum wage, what they meant was the minimum rate which applies to any classification.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It means that there is not one minimum wage per award but that the whole structure of award wages will be carried into individual contracts.

In other words, there will be tens of thousands of minimum wages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though this means that there is more protection than with the lowest award rate, workers can still lose heaps under this policy. They would still have the loss of the 38-hour week, penalty rates, holiday leave loading, redundancy pay and public holiday pay. Despite the fact that the honourable member for Bennelong's press statement yesterday claims that they would still be entitled to pay for public holidays, that is not the case&mdash;there is no entitlement in State legislation. The entitlement comes from the award. If it is not given in the basic legislation which the Opposition would introduce as a criterion to be incorporated into individual contracts&mdash;which the honourable member for Bennelong does not propose&mdash;in that case there would be no payment for public holidays required in such contracts. It is the intention of the policy to get rid of the awards. What happens when these awards go out of existence?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Cabinet on Monday made a number of important decisions about television. One of them was that there would be continuing community access to the vacant sixth national television channel. This decision allows community broadcasters to develop audiences for their programs and responds to the interests of their particular communities through a new format. We think it will be a very useful training ground, equipping people to run broadcasting services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major and important decision was in relation to pay television. The Cabinet agreed, and the Government has agreed, to introduce a new regime for pay television which will provide Australian consumers with the opportunity to view up to 10 more channels. Importantly, the decision gives the Australian Broadcasting Commission a chance to participate in pay television without putting at risk the national broadcaster's free to air service. The Government will require that all licensees allocate 10 per cent of the program expenditure to Australian content.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very far reaching decision and one which we think is appropriate for Australian television. It provides one new operator without any former ownership of newspapers, telecommunications companies or networks. It also provides unrestricted access as to equity for networks, telecommunications companies and newspapers, and it provides two mandated channels for the ABC. This, we believe, gives the ABC an opportunity in pay television that it had given to it in the 1950s in relation to free to air television, in that the networks have been treated fairly because they are now no longer prohibited from participating in pay television. But I think what is important about this is that, as the Government has recognised the networks' legitimate interests in pay television, it is now time for a trade-off for the networks to better reflect the interests of the community in some of the things they do. One of those is community standards in television.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, and I think many members on the Government side, have become increasingly concerned about the level of violence on our television screens. Many children are now exposed to the excessive and often gratuitous violence that seems now to be commonplace. While I expect&mdash;and I say this as a parent&mdash;my responsibilities to be such as to supervise what my children view, I believe that a system of classification that applies to television in this country could be applied in a way that would make it easier to exercise these responsibilities. At the moment, AO rated programs can be shown after 8.30 p.m., a time when a lot of young children are still glued to the screen. Research undertaken by the former Australian Broadcasting Tribunal shows that 35 per cent of children are still watching television after 8.30 p.m. It is not until 9.30, quite late in the evening, that the figure drops away to 15 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government does not set these times or the standards; they have been done by the television stations in consultation with the Australian Broadcasting Authority. That will happen now and in the future, and draft codes of practice dealing with these matters are available for public comment. But I take this opportunity to urge the networks to consider not broadcasting AO material until after 9.30 at night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In doing that, as they have been sensibly dealt with and considered fairly by the Government in relation to pay television, their access to it and their interest in it, I believe it is time for them to consider broadly their community responsibility and come to terms with this particular point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The newly created Australian Broadcasting Authority will soon begin Australia-wide research into community attitudes towards levels of violence and depictions of sex to enable it to devise appropriate classifications for pay TV especially for R-rated movies. As far as free to air television is concerned, perhaps the networks should give thought to classifications and program information that give parents a clearer idea of what a program contains, so that we can make better decisions about what our children watch. However the networks go about it, whatever they do, the system should give parents some help in protecting their children from excessive, and in my view potentially damaging, violence without diminishing the value of what is a major form of recreation in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be writing to the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations to let it know my views. I think the time is long overdue when, with these sorts of standards which we have let the television industry itself impose on television, the television stations should come to the party and recognise, when chasing ratings and looking after their own commercial interests, that a lot of this violence is endemic to the system and that the stations also have to consider community interests, as the Government, and I hope the Parliament, considers the role of free to air television stations in pay television.</PARA>

Can the Minister inform the House of progress being made with the implementation of the recommendations of the Carmichael report, particularly on the establishment of industry based pilot projects? Can he also inform the House about the state of industry training initiatives taken in the One Nation statement and the Young Australia statement?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2739" SPEAKER="Beazley The Hon K.C." NAMEID="PE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SWAN" MINISTERIAL="EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was very pleased to be able to announce today the first 22 industry based pilot projects to be established under the recommendations of the Carmichael report&mdash;the start of the creation of a new system of vocational training in this country which, as a result of the development of these pilots, will be in place by 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These first 22 projects provide employment and training for more than 1,100 young Australians. They will be the first of what we expect to be 140-odd industry based projects, and projects also based in State training authorities, that will be put in place in the course of this year. These first 22 cover pilots in building and construction, the automotive industry, road transport, retail, tourism and hospitality, clerical, administrative, steel, metals, electrical, plastics, chemicals and the wine industry. So honourable members can see from that list that even at this early stage there has been a substantial embracing by all sectors of Australian industry of the Carmichael vocational certification process that we announced some time ago. As I have said, I would expect some 140-odd projects to be in place by the end of this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member also asked questions about how the other propositions that were raised at the Youth Summit and announced by us subsequently are proceeding. The answer is that they are proceeding well. Under the accredited youth training program&mdash;that is, a proposition that we provide six months training and then a Jobstart card to young people&mdash;we anticipate that some 34,000 young people will be assisted. We are in a position now where virtually all of those schemes are in place in the different States, appropriately timed to start up in TAFE colleges in the new year. As a matter of fact, in the honourable member's home State one has already got off the ground a bit before the start of the normal year of operation for educational institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have just signed an agreement with South Australia for 1,000 places that are now in the process of being taken up. Some 34,962 apprentices and 8,796 trainees commenced prior to the end of September 1992. Apprentice recruitment in the September quarter is up 18 per cent on the corresponding period in 1991. Trainee recruitment for the September quarter is up 90 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the introduction of additional support measures, until the end of September 1992 nearly 13,000 unemployed and at risk apprentices had been assisted into new apprenticeships or to continue with their trade or studies. It is proposed that some 8,500 people will now take up career start traineeships. Already those propositions are well and truly in place and are being dovetailed with the Carmichael proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all the other programs&mdash;the special incentives for group training, increased traineeships in the public service, the pre-vocational courses, the land care and environment action program&mdash;guidelines have been firmly established and are out with the States. Starts have been made, and all will come through to successful operation early in the new year. So the promises and undertakings that were given to the young unemployed people of this country, and that were given to our young people in the area of traineeships, are in the process of being successfully implemented by this Government.</PARA>

The fact of the matter is that the French farmers cannot hold the world to ransom in terms of a more open trading environment. They should not be allowed the right to veto and this Government will pursue a course of action that will ensure that that point is not just driven home, but will develop a strategy to try to counter it.</PARA>

It will be with heads of government. They have to get involved, and that is why that letter is important. I might add also that the statements coming from the newly elected President Clinton in the United States are somewhat encouraging in this regard. He said that in the transition period, they will not ease off in terms of ensuring that an outcome is achieved.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This document continues the practice of presenting to the House of Representatives at approximately six-monthly intervals a schedule listing government responses to House and joint committee reports as well as responses which remain outstanding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The practice of presenting this schedule to the House follows the undertaking of successive governments to respond to parliamentary committee reports in timely fashion. On 25 May 1978 Prime Minister Fraser informed the House that within six months of the tabling of a committee report the responsible Minister would make a statement in the Parliament outlining the action the Government proposed to take in relation to the report. The period for responses was reduced from six months to three months in 1983 by the incoming government. The Leader of the Government in the Senate announced this change on 24 August 1983. The ministerial statement method of response was continued. More recently, the Government has advised that responses to committee reports will be made by means of a letter to a committee chairman, with the letter being tabled in the House at the earliest opportunity. However, for the purposes of this schedule, the date of the presentation of the Government's response to the Parliament will be considered the date of the Government's response, not the date of any correspondence with the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The schedule does not include reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, nor the reports of the House of Representatives Committee of Members' Interests, the Committee of Privileges, the Publications Committee and the Selection Committee. Responses to reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts are usually made in the form of Finance Minutes, which are tabled by the Committee. Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the forthcoming coalition government, ministerial arrangements and relationships with the States will also be of particular importance. For example, early in the administration of the new government, we will be sitting down with the States to discuss the implementation of our Fightback program, which involves the abolition of seven taxes, including a payroll tax, which is a tax on jobs, the abolition of which will create up to 200,000 jobs. That is why the Opposition was very pleased to hear the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) say today that in the next election a vote for the Labor Party will also be a vote for a GST. That is a responsible attitude to take because that is a reform which is in this country's long term interests. I was not really surprised because we have known for years that the Prime Minister is in favour of a GST. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members will remember that back in 1985 he had the Tax Summit and attempted to get the GST through. He was unable to at that time, but he still was keen to have the GST introduced. Now he has given a public declaration on behalf of all the members of the Labor Party that, when the coalition wins, the Labor Party will support our reforms. So a vote for Labor is a vote for a GST. I think that is very good news for the country as a whole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our package we will not only abolish payroll tax, or just a State tax; we will also abolish all the existing hidden consumption taxes that Labor has been increasing at a great rate in recent years. We will also abolish petrol tax. That will mean that every time people go to their local petrol stations, they will save 19c a litre&mdash;that is, about $11 every time to fill the family tank. At the moment visiting a petrol station is the same as visiting a branch office of the Tax Office. The Prime Minister is the greatest bowser bandit in Australia's history. All those taxes will be removed and replaced with a new tax, the GST, that will be much fairer, particularly for people on low incomes. In our package people on low incomes will get the greatest benefit. That is a much fairer Australia and it will provide the opportunity for hundreds of thousands of Australians to get work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my opening remarks by saying that the Minister for Family Support and Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons), who is at the table, will also be supporting the GST at the next election in respect of the tourist industry, about which he has had a lot to say in recent times, and in respect of local government. I think the public will be pleased that this issue is, in a sense, behind us from today. A GST and tax reform are inevitable; and, as the Prime Minister himself has now said, it will be introduced. Of more particular relevance is the debate about the cover-up that the Federal Labor Government has been involved in concerning the arrangements of the Loan Council affair. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) is not in the Parliament today. He was responsible for the biggest breach in global borrowing limits in the history of the Loan Council and he ought to be here to debate the issues. Government members have adopted a new tactic&mdash;that is, firstly, they ran the cover-up in the first place, and, secondly, they now run a cover-up as we attempt to expose what went on. Honourable members would have seen today in Question Time that the Treasurer refused to answer every question that he was asked. Yesterday we asked him whether he had published all of the documents. He refused to give a guarantee that he had provided all of the documents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Select Committee on the Functions, Powers and Operations of the Australian Loan Council has been established, and the Government has opposed it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also seen, as more evidence of the cover-up, the Government leak selective documents. We have had more minutes out of this document than honourable members have had hot Sunday dinners.

It says much about the contempt which Labor Parties and this Prime Minister in particular have for this institution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ladies and gentlemen, do not think that this is some passing issue. We have a democracy because people have been prepared to fight and die for it. We have a democracy because people of standing in our community have been prepared to stand up for the values which our democracy represents. When the Prime Minister of the country attacks the basics of our institutions, it is no wonder that the Senate today censured the Prime Minister. I believe it is the first time a Prime Minister has been so censured by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Loan Council affair is very simple. There are rules about how much States can borrow. In this case, the State of Victoria borrowed twice the amount of money it was allowed to borrow. It was not a small amount of money&mdash;it was $1.2 billion. So it was a massive blow-out of Victoria's debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Labor Treasurer knew about it for 4 1/2 months and did nothing, even though back in 1988, when we had a parallel circumstance, the Federal Labor Government then came down on the National Party Government in Queensland like a ton of bricks for the same offence. In fact, in the Queensland case it had not even committed the offence&mdash;it was thinking about committing it&mdash;and these blokes basically threw the book at them. In the Queensland case they dealt with the National Party very severely and publicly, but when it came to a massive breach with their Victorian mates in the Labor Party they went silent about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now know, because Senator Button revealed all in the Senate yesterday, that the principal reason for the fact that the Federal Treasurer did not do what he ought to have done as Federal Treasurer was that there was a Victorian election coming and he did not want to shop on his mates. We know that, because he told Senator Button that in a corridor back at the end of July. Of course, the Prime Minister also knew what was going on. He knew in mid-June or by about 6 July at the latest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a nutshell, to show honourable members how this matter could have been fixed up, it was publicly revealed about a week ago and it was fixed in a week. The loan in fact was regularised. It was fixed in a week when there was public exposure and public pressure to deal with the issue. It was fixed in that one week because there was a new broom in Victoria, a Liberal-National Party coalition Government. It came in and the matter was fixed in a week, whereas when Labor was in those opposite dillydallied for 4 1/2 months. So all we now have from the Government is an attempt to hide the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has put up numerous defences&mdash;10, in fact&mdash;as to why the Treasurer should not be held accountable for the massive cover-up of the global borrowing limit breached by the Victorians. The first one was confidentiality. That was the same old defence that those opposite put up first time round in the Khemlani affair. They have virtually dropped that argument now, because on Sunday the Treasurer, after having said that it was all confidential, got up and said, `Look, it was in the Budget after all. It was in the Budget in the first place, so how could it be confidential?'. The next day he was on Melbourne radio with Neil Mitchell and he said, in relation to the question of what the markets knew, `The markets knew all along'. If they knew all along, why did it have to be confidential? There goes defence No. 1. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second defence was the sort of Victorian defence. The claim is that the Victorian Government does not want it. The truth is&mdash;I have spoken to the Victorians about this&mdash;that they are neutral as to what went on in the past. No wonder they would be neutral. How could anyone suggest that there should never be an investigation into what went on in the past? That would be like saying that there should never have been a royal commission into Rothwells, there should never have been a royal commission into the Tricontinental affair or that the receivers and managers of Bond Corporation should not look into the books. That is not their argument; they have never put it, and the twist being put on their statements is false. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third argument was, `We did all we could'. That is simply not true because the documents show that this Government never threatened the Victorians with the same threats that were issued to the Queenslanders in 1988. The fourth argument was that this was a caretaker government by the time the balloon should have gone up. The Treasurer said yesterday that when the election was announced that was the end of it; there was nothing else that could be done. How is it&mdash;the Treasurer should come in and answer this question as well&mdash;that on 10 September he wrote a letter, in other words after the election had been announced, which was simply a continuum of the previous correspondence? It was business as usual. That argument is demolished on the Treasurer's own correspondence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth defence was to attack the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). I just dismiss that; that was irrelevant. We all know it is irrelevant, but it shows how desperate those opposite are. The sixth defence was that there was to be the Nicholls committee report and that that would resolve the matter. That argument is demolished. Honourable</PARA>
<PARA>members only have to turn up the relevant page in the Nicholls committee report to see that the question of breach of global borrowing limits has simply not been mentioned. That argument, defence No. 6, is gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence No. 7 was, `The States just give us whatever they give us and we put whatever they give us straight into the Budget'. That is a load of nonsense. Those opposite knew, when the Victorians gave them that figure, what it included. Even the Victorians put a footnote to the table that should have gone into table 19. That argument is finished. There is no argument; no defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence No. 8 was that the status of the borrowings was in dispute. That argument is blown apart by the correspondence. If those opposite look at the correspondence and the minutes, they will see a statement that the Victorians had foreshadowed their request for an endorsement by the Commonwealth of the loan application regularisation. Furthermore, the Treasurer is now saying&mdash;he twists and turns on all these issues&mdash;that it is not so much that it was a matter in dispute; in fact, it was so clear that he told them not to make an application. If it were in dispute, why would he have told them not to regularise the breach in the global borrowing limits? Defence No. 8 is finished and gone. It is no help to the Government at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned defence No. 9, which is, basically, to put up the shutters; do not answer questions. Yesterday there were five questions; we got no answers. </PARA>

They will not give us all the documents. There is no guarantee of all the documents and they pretend that it is because I have put in an FOI request. They released documents after I put in the FOI request, so that argument is gone. Then they will say, `It is in the public interest', but they have released documents which in some cases not even the Victorian Government has. When the Victorian Treasurer asked the Treasury for the documents, it said, `There aren't any in Victoria'. When we heard those stories about shredding machines in the week before the election, I thought it was just a bit of politics. Now we know for a fact that there is no file on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He seems to be simply repeating the same points day after day. I would have thought that he would have been bored with them; certainly the people of Australia are bored with them. The fact that he is just repeating the same points does not mean that there is any chance of them being believed or sticking in the public's mind. I think that repetition simply defeats his own purpose. He also perversely and very strangely suggests that a vote for Labor is a vote for the GST. I do not follow that logic at all.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition seems to be suggesting that we ought to be supporting the idea of a Senate inquiry, whereas his own colleagues in the State, I am glad to say, do not support the idea of a Senate inquiry. Yesterday Mr Stockdale, the Victorian Treasurer, told reporters:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new state government had no desire to be drawn into any federal political controversy and had not been asked by its federal colleagues to support the Senate probe.</PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to make it clear that this government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Victorian State Government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Premier and I, are not critical of the federal government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise: `The Victorian Liberal Government is not critical of the Federal Government'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">we are not critical in this matter of the management of the Federal Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA>So if the Victorian Government is not critical, it is very strange to find all this point scoring on the part of the Opposition. Mr Stockdale continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our criticism . . . is laid four-square at the door of (the former state government).</PARA>
<PARA>That is simply oppositional State politics. It is striking to find that Mr Stockdale is not involved in the vacuous point scoring that has been going on on the other side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition also made a valiant attempt to defend all his Senate colleagues. I happen to sit on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts with Senator Bishop, and I really find her behaviour abominable. To see her brutalising public servants in a cruel and vicious way&mdash;and, as I think the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said today, vilifying people under privilege&mdash;is a disgrace. It undermines the dignity and credibility of parliament. I think her Liberal colleagues should censure her for her behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to deal with a particular aspect of this debate about the Loan Council that has received no coverage at all during the last week, and very little before that. The whole basis for this debate is the claim that the Victorian Government was deeply in debt, that there was a crisis, and that that justified extreme fiscal restraint of a most inequitable kind and the vicious industrial relations policies that the Victorian Government has just announced. The reality is quite different. The Opposition has been trying to exaggerate the extent of the Victorian debt, and I think it has succeeded to some extent in persuading the wider electorate to believe it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the Victorian debt is relatively low. If Opposition members bothered to look up the figures&mdash;which I am quite sure none of them have done or they could not possibly justifiably make the points they are claiming to make&mdash;they would find that the Victorian Government debt at the end of June 1990, the most recent year for which figures are published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, was 26 per cent of gross State product. It is true that that is above the level in some other States, though not all. The debt to gross State product ratio in Tasmania was 35 per cent; in the Northern Territory it was also 26 per cent. The average for the States was 17.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The perspective with which we should look at that is an international one. By international standards there is only one other country which has a lower debt to State or national product ratio than Victoria has, and that is Finland. Every other Western country has a higher, and mostly much higher, ratio of debt to gross domestic product than Victoria has or, in fact, Australia. The ratio in Finland, the only country that is lower, is 18.6; the ratio in Britain is 37 per cent; in Norway, it is 44 per cent. In Germany, which would appear to many people to be the clearest example of a well-managed economy, the ratio of general government debt to gross domestic product is 44 per cent, compared with the ratio of gross product in Victoria of 26 per cent. In France, the ratio is 47 per cent; in the United States, it is 59 per cent; in Japan, another country to which a lot of people would look as a fine example of a well-managed economy, the ratio is 63 per cent; in Canada, the ratio is 76 per cent; in the Netherlands, it is 80 per cent; in Greece, 85 per cent; in Italy, 103 per cent; in Ireland, 113 per cent; and in Belgium, it is 132 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All those countries have ratios of debt to gross product that are higher, and most are multiples of the ratio in Victoria. So if the Opposition were being realistic it would acknowledge that, in fact, debt in Victoria was relatively low&mdash;not only was it low in comparison with other countries but also it was low in comparison with earlier debt in earlier decades. In the fifties and sixties, debt in Victoria, and in every other State, in fact, was a far higher proportion of gross State or Territory product than it was in Victoria at the end of 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that even a debt of 26 per cent of gross State product does cause some problems, and it is true that the debt servicing costs in Victoria amounted to 18 per cent of total revenue; that is a significant leakage. That is why the Victorian State Labor Government was trying to reduce debt; it was planning to restrain outlays and to build up revenue, in so far as it had scope to do so, to prevent any further growth of that debt, and gradually to reduce it. It is important always for governments to minimise their debt consistent with other objectives. Nevertheless, 18 per cent of its total revenue spent on debt service is a relatively low proportion by international standards. I think that an air of crisis has been created by the statements of the Victorian Opposition which are quite unwarranted by the realities. It is important to put this perspective on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to what the Opposition claims it is concerned about, that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) did not enforce the Loan Council guidelines, it is quite clear that he did so. He demonstrated that in speeches in the House on Tuesday and Wednesday, and the Prime Minister has fully explained that as well. I repeat: I think it is a waste of time to continue going over the same issues which have been adequately covered already. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In brief, it is worth repeating some of the points that the Treasurer has already made. He has already said that nobody came to the Commonwealth and said explicitly that there was a specific problem in Victoria. Victoria's breach of the Loan Council's global borrowing limits was revealed during discussions and correspondence which were initiated by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth's behaviour in this has been thoroughly sound, responsible and reasonable. Despite there being a Labor government in Victoria, the Commonwealth went and actively sought information on the state of Victoria's finances. This information was sought because the Commonwealth had received information from various sources that suggested some transactions were of a questionable status, so it was important for the Commonwealth to follow that up, and it did so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was during those discussions that Victoria first mentioned the borrowings at the heart of this matter. Consistent with the seriousness of the Victorian situation, which was confirmed in the independent Nicholls report, the Treasurer repeatedly sought from the previous Victorian Treasurer a clear and thorough exposition of the situation facing the State. The fundamental problem that had to be addressed, to which the Treasurer's efforts were directed, was to ensure the development and adoption of a medium term strategy. That was done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already described the Victorian Budget, which set out to restrain outlays so as to reduce the recurrent deficit so as to prevent further build-up of debt and gradually reduce debt. The Treasurer sent numbers of letters to the Victorian Government. He had meetings with the previous Victorian Treasurer. I really do not think that much point is served in my going over the detail of that, because that has been fully explained by the Treasurer himself and by the Prime Minister. I would simply like to conclude by saying, again, that repetition of these empty claims serves no useful purpose. The Treasurer has, under careful cross-questioning from the Opposition, already described fully the basis for his action. He has shown to the satisfaction of anyone who has been listening that he acted responsibly and carefully in ways fully consistent with his responsibilities under the Loan Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The incident does suggest that some further reporting requirements ought to occur in the Loan Council context, and that is why work is under way in the Treasury at present, in the Loan Council secretariat, to design additional reporting requirements to prevent this sort of incident recurring. In any case, the incident is not as serious as the Opposition has described because, as I have emphasised, the level of Victorian debt was relatively low by historical and international standards. Whilst it is important in future to ensure that Loan Council guidelines are fully honoured by the States&mdash;and perhaps the Commonwealth's power or the power of the Loan Council secretariat needs to be enhanced in some way to do that&mdash;within the guidelines that exist, the Treasurer acted fully responsibly, and the House should fully accept that.</PARA>

I am reminded by colleagues that it was Premier Cain who commenced this type of dissembling when he called an October 1988 election when he did not need to. Why? He did it so that he could get the election over before the whole Tricontinental and VEDC scandal hit the press. This time it was a bit different.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about ministerial integrity. One of the fundamentals of the Westminster system is that the Parliament should be fully informed. Another fundamental is that Ministers must tell the truth.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that on this occasion no question was needed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), waxing eloquent on previous rules of the Loan Council. I have studied the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on that matter, and I have studied the press, but I cannot find the honourable member for Blaxland criticising the change in the rules. I know why: the prime advocate was the then Premier of New South Wales, Mr Wran, who wanted to get out and build all his powerhouses and get his aluminium smelters, notwithstanding that aluminium could not be sold, as Victoria eventually discovered. The honourable member for Blaxland did not criticise it then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all pretty bright in hindsight. But the simple fact is that, at that time, notwithstanding the laxity of the rules, they were applied even-handedly to Mr Wran, to State Labor governments and to State Liberal governments. </PARA>

Then all of a sudden the whispers start from our mates down in Victoria and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) finds all sorts of reasons not to tell.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it got down to the fact that he was obliged to tell; he was obliged to endorse Budget Paper No. 4. He said, `But I took the piece of paper they sent me'. If he knew it was wrong, why did he allow it to be published? Surely the minimum responsibility that the Treasurer had was to send back that bit of paper and to have it rewritten. But he did not do it. We know why he did not do it and we know why we have two sets of rules in the Loan Council. It will not change until we change this Government. There is such a record of dissembling!</PARA>

She went on television after having borrowed $650m. Had the honourable member for Fraser wanted to be a bit more forthcoming with his statistics, he might have reminded us that in Western Australia we have a situation now where that lady needs something like 34 per cent of own source revenue to service Government borrowings. She has borrowed more money than Burke and Dowding put together&mdash;that is not counting the bit they kept in the safe, of course! The simple fact is that she has borrowed more.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a major embarrassment for the Opposition last weekend when the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders, said on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program that it was arguable whether Mr Kennett's proposals were in keeping with Mr Kennett's promises before the election. That is strike one; embarrassment No. 1. Later that evening, on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Face the Press</EMPHASIS> program the shadow Minister for industrial relations said that he thought it was a pity that Mr Kennett had broken election promises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the reason why this House has been diverted all week. That is the reason why the Liberals do not want to talk about industrial relations. They do not want the people to have a close look at the promises that were made before the election in Victoria and the fact that the Victorian Liberal Government has broken those promises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How has it done that? It has decided unilaterally to abolish the 17 1/2 per cent annual leave loading for workers in Victoria. It has decided that penalty rates are out if people live in Victoria. It has decided that people are not allowed to be on a picket in Victoria if there are more than six people on it already. These are pretty outrageous proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout Europe, as you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, workers receive one-month's salary as an annual bonus towards the end of the year. In Australia we do not have a system of bonuses where people get a month's salary once a year. We have a system whereby workers, just as they are about to take their families on a holiday, receive four weeks times 17 1/2 per cent of their salaries. It allows parents to ensure that they can provide a decent holiday for their kids. It allows parents to ensure that they are looking after their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the Liberals saying? They are saying that this is outrageous and that it is terrible that Australian workers should get this bonus before their holidays. They ignore the fact that workers in Europe get this one month's bonus. They say that penalty rates are out and it should not matter whether people work on a Saturday or a Sunday; it should not matter whether people have to start their shifts at midnight, despite the impact that has on family life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberals then say that we cannot have more than six people on a picket if there is an industrial dispute. I would hate to think how Lech Walesa and Solidarity would have brought down communism if they had been allowed to have only six people on a picket at the Gdansk shipyard. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that Solidarity brought down the Communist Party in Poland and that was the start of the end of the Communist Party throughout eastern Europe. But the members of Solidarity and Lech Walesa would have been imprisoned or fined if laws such as those suggested by Mr Kennett had applied in Poland at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a bit rich for Liberals opposite to say what a great leader Lech Walesa is and what a great thing it is that workers in eastern Europe now have the right to form free trade unions instead of trade unions dominated by the Communist Party, when they are proposing rules which would have meant that Lech Walesa would have been gaoled or fined and Solidarity would not have been able to stand up for the rights of the Polish workers. I think perhaps we might have to ask Mr Walesa to visit Melbourne and give some lectures to a few people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the real reason why we have had this debate all week: the Liberals want to divert the public's attention from what Mr Kennett is proposing for the ordinary working men and women in Victoria. That is the reason why they have repeated the same questions and allegations day after day, when the Liberal Party is the party which is responsible for allowing irresponsible State governments to escape the financial discipline imposed by Federal governments. It has been the Labor Party and Treasurer Dawkins who have ensured that all States meet those responsibilities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly. The Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Argentina and Brazil represented a very important visit to two countries which are fellow members of the Cairns Group of nations in the Uruguay Round of talks in GATT. The relationship between our country and them is of considerable importance as a consequence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I go into the substance of my comments, I take the opportunity to draw the attention of the House to some unsubstantiated statistics on page 44 of the report. It is unfortunate that, in the haste to prepare the report, these figures have been incorporated. There are particular references to the rate of abortions in Brazil. Among these is a reference to a so-called press report from earlier in the year, giving World Health Organisation estimates that there are five million abortions and some 400,000 deaths each year in Brazil due to complications following abortions. That is about half a million people a year who die as a result of complications from abortions. I wanted to set that straight and to quote from an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Population Research Institute Review</EMPHASIS> which refers to this specific allegation. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to the Instituto Brazilio Geographia Estatia (IBGE), only 55,066 women between 14- and 50-years of age have been reported as deceased during the year 1988. It could be argued that many deaths are not reported, but this can only be significant in rural areas, for in any urban area the dead cannot be admitted into any cemetery without an official declaration of death, which sooner or later is computed by the IBGE.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the important thing is: out of these, how many die because of an abortion? According to the World Health Organisation's 1989 statistics, in 1986, in Brazil, only 241 women out of a total of 41,685 women, aged between 15 and 41 years, died because of an abortion, which tends to make the estimation of 400,000 deaths each year due to complications following abortions a little outlandish. I wanted to tidy that up at the commencement of my brief remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation visited Buenos Aires, Cordoba and the staggering Iguazu Falls in Argentina. In Brazil we visited Sao Paulo, Brasilia, Manaus, which is deep in the Amazonian region, and Rio De Janeiro. During our time in Buenos Aires we were very fortunate to have a lengthy meeting with the President of Argentina, President Carlos Menem, and we all found that a very interesting and useful meeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of particular interest to delegation members were the large number of meetings we had with Argentinian government officials, and in particular the discussions with them about the quite substantial economic reforms being undertaken in that country following the tremendous deterioration during the years of the military rule and the suppression of democratic institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the interest that was shown was due in no small part to the fact that a number of these reforms are proposed or have been mooted for our own country. As a consequence, we were able to see and talk at first-hand about the effects of those reforms, about some of the mistakes that have been made&mdash;and there have been a small number of those, according to the Argentinian government officials&mdash;and to be able to discuss the right way of going about these reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer in particular to the large number of privatisations that are going on in Argentina, one of which was the privatisation of Aerolineas Argentinias, the national air carrier. Aerolineas was sold to Iberia. Unfortunately, it then starved Aerolineas of capital and that, of course, meant that the services provided by Aerolineas were not able to be kept up to scratch. I think that is an important lesson for Australia as we approach the privatisation of our own national carrier, Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The visit to Brazil was of great interest to the delegation. Brazil is more or less the same size as Australia, but has an enormous amount of water resources. There are a large number of economic and environmental issues of importance in Brazil, in particular, of course, the environmental damage that has been asserted as having occurred in the Brazilian jungle and the Amazonian Basin. We were able to talk at first-hand with the Amazonian Institute officials at Manaus, as well as with the Governor of the Amazonas state, about some of the ramifications of the environmental damage being wrought by the slash and burn farming practices of some farmers, and also about the substantial amount of gold mining being undertaken in the northern part of that region. Of particular concern, of course, is the washing of chemicals into the river and then flowing downstream, affecting the lifestyles of some of the indigenous natives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In talking about the Amazonian basin region, it is important to recognise the tremendous effect the city of Manaus has on visitors. It is a city of some two million people. It is considerably inland on the Amazon River and, in fact, has an enormously developed infrastructure. It has an international airport that operates 24 hours a day. It has a metropolitan transport structure, one of the world's leading opera houses and quite a large harbour. I suppose many of us in Australia and elsewhere, from our readings and from our experience of commentary about Manaus, would probably think of it as being perhaps a shanty town when, in actual fact, it is a substantial major city on the international routes in and out of Brazil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to refer very briefly to some of the recommendations of the delegation. Of note is the recommendation relating to the privatisation of the Argentinian telecommunications system and the opportunities that that presents to Australian telecommunication providers to be able to put in bids to provide services and equipment. I think it is important that those opportunities are undertaken and that they are promoted widely by Austrade and through other means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation also recommended the negotiating of science and technology agreements with the governments of Brazil and Argentina to promote the exchange of scientific and technical information, particularly in matters such as agriculture, mining, forestry, ecologically sustainable development, renewable energy, pollution control, waste management and the protection of endangered species. One significant recommendation is that Austrade re-examine whether it should establish an office in Sao Paulo in addition to or instead of the office in Rio de Janeiro. That arose as a consequence of a meeting with the Brazil-Australia Chamber of Commerce in Sao Paulo. It complained that it felt that Austrade having its office in Rio de Janeiro was, in fact, making it very difficult for the Chamber of Commerce to develop trading relations between Sao Paulo in particular&mdash;because that is, I suppose, the major commerce city of Brazil&mdash;and Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another item of interest to Australian companies that the delegation brought back with it was the fact that, as from the beginning of October, the Brazilian computer industry has been deregulated from being protected against foreign imported equipment. There are additional opportunities there for Australian hardware and software providers perhaps to be able to make some inroads into the Brazilian computer industry. Again, we hope that Austrade will be able to help promote those opportunities, with a bit of luck, through a new office in Sao Paulo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to extend my thanks to Ilze Svenne from the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and Jessica Byrne-Hoffman from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and to the officers of the Australian embassies in Buenos Aires and Brasilia for their cooperation and their assistance. I offer my thanks and those of the other members of the delegation for the tremendous hospitality offered to us by the Brazilians and the Argentinians. As honourable members were made aware by the Speaker at Question Time today, we are, in fact, having the privilege of a visit by an Argentinian parliamentary delegation right at this moment. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Act 1982. The amendments will give effect to the Government's decision to extend the life of ACIAR, to broaden its mandate, to change the constitution and membership of its governing bodies, and to address four administrative issues which will further increase its efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ACIAR is a small statutory authority which promotes and assists collaborative research between Australian and developing country institutions on problems of mutual concern. This collaborative research is aimed at development of sustainable agricultural systems and the design of appropriate natural resource management strategies. ACIAR's activities form part of Australia's aid program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is in a unique position to provide such assistance because of its environmental and agricultural diversity and the high level of expertise of our scientists. Australia is the only developed country located in the tropics and subtropics, and many of our scientists are working on problems very similar to those in much of the developing world. Because of these similarities, benefits from ACIAR's work flow to Australia as well as to developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When ACIAR was established 10 years ago there was some uncertainty over whether Australia's initiative to establish a special purpose statutory authority, which would mobilise Australian agricultural research expertise to help developing countries solve their own problems and improve their own research capacity, should be an enduring feature of the aid program. As a result, the ACIAR Act 1982 contains sunset provisions which limit the life of the Centre to 12 years unless, following review, amending legislation is introduced by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year, following a referral from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), a comprehensive inquiry was undertaken by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to examine ACIAR's effectiveness and the desirability of its continuation. This was followed by the sunset review, as required by the Act, which drew heavily on the findings of the Joint Committee's inquiry. The Government has considered the sunset review report, and that report and the Government response to the Joint Committee inquiry report have been tabled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Agricultural development is a key element of economic and social growth in developing countries and ultimately serves Australia's own economic interests because that growth fuels demand for agricultural and other products from trading nations such as Australia. Improved farming technology is the basic engine of growth in low income, substantially rural, developing countries. Numerous studies have shown that investments in agricultural research generate very large returns, and these returns, coupled with the way the benefits flow to those in poverty, make investment in agricultural research extremely good aid indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Using a broad definition of agriculture, ACIAR has developed comprehensive but low-cost programs in crop and animal sciences, forestry, post-harvest technology, plant nutrition, soil and water management and land use, economics and farming systems, and fisheries. There have been some outstanding successes. Examples include the successful biological control of salvinia water weed in Sri Lanka. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This project rid Sri Lankan reservoirs and water courses of a choking mat of salvinia water fern, the world's worst water weed, using insects that feed on it. It was built on earlier work by the CSIRO Division of Entomology which resulted in the spectacular clearing of the weed in Australia and Papua New Guinea. Beneficiaries are rice farmers and fishermen and their families, hydro-electricity authorities, and rural people generally because of reduced spread of disease by mosquitoes. Independent assessment indicated a likely economic benefit to Sri Lanka over 25 years of $25m&mdash;a benefit to cost ratio of 32 : 1. ACIAR is enabling the CSIRO team to release the controlling agent&mdash;a beetle&mdash;in Malaysia, the Philippines, Fiji, Kenya and Zambia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ambitious projects to control Newcastle disease, the world's most important viral disease of chickens, in village chicken populations in southern Asia using a heat-resistant vaccine are currently being concluded. Poor rural villagers throughout the world keep chickens to provide much needed protein and cash, but frequent epidemics of Newcastle disease cause heavy losses in village chicken populations. Although Newcastle disease is not present in Australia, a mild variant of the virus exists here. This V4 strain causes no disease symptoms but does provide immunity against Newcastle disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Veterinary scientists at the University of Queensland working with colleagues in Malaysia developed the idea that a heat-resistant strain of V4 could be developed and used as a vaccine which would not need to be kept in refrigeration. A first project proved this idea, and resulted in a vaccine coated onto chicken feed that could be conveniently fed to village chickens. A second project involved controlling the disease across a whole State in Malaysia, and proving and adjusting the technology in five other South East Asian countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most severe disease threat to Australia's livestock industries is foot and mouth disease. ACIAR has promoted research to develop and prove the effectiveness of tests that can rapidly diagnose the presence of the disease and identify the strain of the virus causing the outbreak. This research involved teams of veterinarians from the Australian Animal Health Laboratory and the Department of Livestock Development in Thailand. The disease is endemic to northern Thailand and studies with the live virus there made it possible to refine a test and prove it in the field with actual outbreaks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having the test available allows Thai veterinarians to quickly diagnose foot and mouth disease outbreaks and correctly identify the virus strain causing them. Cattle and buffalo can then be vaccinated with the correct vaccine. Rapid confirmation of false alarms or, should the worst happen, of foot and mouth disease outbreaks in Australia, would save the Australian livestock industries millions of dollars. For example, the tests enabled Australian scientists to diagnose a false alarm in Queensland in only 17 hours when a disease outbreak was suspected in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final example relates to an excellent project on culturing giant clams for farming and restocking denuded tropical reefs. Giant clams became threatened after heavy poaching of tropical reefs in the 1960s and 1970s. Their meat is much sought after and forms part of the traditional diet of many Pacific island peoples. Work by James Cook University of North Queensland staff, and colleagues in the Queensland Department of Primary Industries, the Philippines, Fiji, the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Tonga and Tuvalu resulted in the development of low-technology, on-land hatching technologies for artificial rearing of all seven known species of giant clam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ocean culture techniques by which the clams can be grown to a commercially valuable size have also been developed. Nationally operated clam hatcheries are now operating in Australia, Fiji, Tonga, the Philippines and the Cook Islands. Apart from the benefits to villagers farming giant clams for traditional use and cash, denuded reefs can now be restocked for conservation purposes with locally extinct species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that ACIAR has been outstandingly successful. It is lean, professional and efficient and has an excellent approach to its task. It has adopted a unique strategy of identifying developing country research priorities, of assessing the mutual benefit of projects to Australia and the developing country, and of matching these with relevant Australian expertise in the formation of carefully tailored, collaborative research partnerships. The need for such programs now is even more compelling than at the time of ACIAR's establishment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the driving force of agricultural innovation to increase per-hectare yields to feed burgeoning populations remains, the call for increased productivity is being counterbalanced by a call for sustainability. This requires a research-based effort to ensure high yields, but without depleting land, water and marine resources irrevocably. Australia faces similar challenges to the developing world in this regard and will benefit from the ACIAR partnership mode. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the overwhelming evidence of the worth of ACIAR's activities drawn out from its review and elsewhere, the Government has decided that ACIAR and its work should continue. The primary purpose of this Bill is to secure the Centre's future beyond its initial 12-year life. However, in considering that fundamental issue, the Government has also examined and endorsed three other recommendations which will extend ACIAR's mandate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No provision exists at present for ACIAR to engage in training activities. Yet training is integral to the research projects ACIAR commissions, not only to enable their successful conduct but also at times there are excellent opportunities for broader capacity-building training. Up until now, this deficiency has been overcome by AIDAB reserving a small part of its training resource for ACIAR. In the future, ACIAR will be able to conduct its own project-related training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter relates to the implementation of results flowing from research projects. While the primary responsibility for the provision of resources necessary to ensure the transfer of technologies from ACIAR research projects into development programs remains with AIDAB, and AIDAB and ACIAR do maintain a regular dialogue on these matters, it is clear that there are occasions when it would be more appropriate for ACIAR to assess and commission a development activity independently. Accordingly, the Government has decided that ACIAR's functions should allow ACIAR to fund development activities when necessary to try to ensure adoption of the results of the research it commissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third matter relates to Australia's support for international agricultural research centres, primarily those of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, but also other related centres and activities. The research conducted by the centres has been a driving force in expanding food production in developing countries. Most of the high-yielding varieties of rice, wheat and maize which have enabled the spectacular increases in production, commonly termed the `green revolution', were derived from varieties developed by two centres, the International Rice Research Institute and the Centre for Wheat and Maize Improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has also been a substantial beneficiary. For example, around three-quarters of Australian wheat sown today comprises varieties derived from international research. The value of increased wheat productivity since the varieties were introduced in 1974 is conservatively estimated at $2 billion. Australia contributes to the work of the international centres through the aid program administered by AIDAB. ACIAR has developed close linkages with the centres and increasingly has been called on to provide technical and policy advice to assist in determining relative funding priorities and making sound decisions. With ACIAR's future assured, the Government has decided that responsibility for this important part of the aid program should become one of ACIAR's functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the success and relevance of ACIAR's activities can be attributed to the direction and influence of its two governing bodies, the Policy Advisory Council and Board of Management. The uniquely constituted Council, with its strong developing country representation, has played a fundamental role in the evolution of the Centre's programs. Similarly, the board of management has provided strong strategic management direction to the Centre. Nevertheless, the Government considers that some changes to the composition and size of both bodies are warranted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 19-member Council tends to be somewhat unwieldy in practice; hence it has been decided to reduce it in size to a maximum of 14 members. It has also been decided to allow more flexibility in its membership by removing the requirement for Australians to be in a majority, and to allow for senior, appropriately qualified AIDAB officials to participate in the work of the Council, instead of necessarily the Director-General of AIDAB. Similarly, the Government considers that the board of management could be reduced to five members with the removal of the requirement for ex officio membership of the AIDAB Director-General. ACIAR maintains good informal links with AIDAB and consultations are held routinely on a variety of matters of mutual concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remaining provisions of the Bill address four administrative issues aimed at increasing the efficiency of ACIAR. The first issue relates to the powers of delegation of the Director of the Centre. Section 41 of the ACIAR Act stipulates that the Centre shall not enter into any contract without the approval of the Minister. The Attorney-General's Department has interpreted the power of delegation to approve contracts as limited to a person in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, an inappropriate and impractical arrangement for a statutory authority which is independent of the Department. This limitation has been construed on the basis of comments in the second reading speech made by the Hon. Tony Street, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, in 1982. The ACIAR Act also limits the delegation of powers to `a person'. This prevents the delegation of powers to the board of management. The amendment Bill enables the Minister to delegate his powers to the board of management of ACIAR or to the Director or staff of the Centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third issue relates to the banking of trust moneys. All moneys appropriated to ACIAR are paid into the ACIAR trust fund. The ACIAR Act also stipulates that all other moneys received by the Centre, other than trust moneys, are to be paid into the Trust Fund. As a consequence, any trust moneys received by the Centre cannot be banked into the trust fund, but must be banked into a separate bank account. This Bill amends the ACIAR Act to enable the Centre to bank trust moneys into the ACIAR trust fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth issue concerns the financial reporting arrangements for the Centre. The Centre satisfies the criteria by which an organisation is deemed to be a department, and consequently is subject to the financial statements guidelines. The ACIAR Act stipulates, however, that the board shall prepare financial statements in such form as the Minister for Finance approves. The approved form is that set out in the entities guidelines. As a result, ACIAR currently prepares two sets of financial statements. This Bill eliminates this anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill does not imply additional outlays, although the Government is keen to see an increase in funding for ACIAR and the international agricultural research centres as Budget circumstances permit. The administrative amendments to improve the efficiency of the Centre will reduce administrative overheads. The Bill will come into force on royal assent. I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to comment on this motion. In effect, it is a guillotine motion to declare some 51 Bills urgent, the effect of which is to limit time for debate on these Bills. As I was saying earlier in the week when a similar motion was passed, this is because the Government has been unable to get the management of its affairs in order such as to meet the requirements of the Senate, even though on this occasion the Senate will not formally require us to have the legislation out of this place and to the Senate by a fixed date, if the Government wishes to get the legislation completed by Christmas. The Government has now adopted less obvious means to have the same effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of times that the Government has moved these motions to declare Bills urgent is increasing rapidly. From 1976 to 1982, only 17-odd Bills were declared urgent. In the period 1983-91, 401 Bills were declared urgent. Last year, 101 Bills were declared urgent. I am not sure where we will finish up, and I do not know whether there are any more Bills to be declared urgent this year, but we certainly will at least equal the record of last year. This has implications for the Parliament. It means that honourable members on both sides will be limited in the debate that they can have about matters of substance, particularly in the Committee of the Whole House when they can go through legislation clause by clause, raise matters and get responses from Ministers about these issues. That is now, in reality, denied to the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are matters, such as the child support legislation&mdash;something that is important to each and every one of us in this place; certainly to honourable members on this side of the House&mdash;which we want to discuss and debate and perhaps suggest amendments in committee to the relevant Minister as he or she listens to the debate to see whether or not there might be the opportunity to reflect on those suggestions when the Bill leaves this place and goes to the Senate. That will now be denied. Honourable members are finding it less relevant to be in here when this number of Bills is put through under a guillotine. That has the cumulative impact of making honourable members feel that their role in this place is being diminished. That is why today I will yet again oppose a motion to declare Bills urgent and, in effect, apply the guillotine. It is very regrettable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing a lot of professing today. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) talked about the majesty of the decision of the people in a slightly different context. If the majesty of the opinions of the people are going to be truly reflected, then their representatives ought to be given the opportunity to discuss matters that they are sent here to discuss in a meaningful way. Twice in the one week we have seen guillotine motions where a substantial number of Bills are going to be forced through the House. I think that is regrettable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Parliament is becoming a cipher for the Executive. The Executive will always need to have a role in the operations of the business of the nation in this place. No-one denies that. But our structure is such that Ministers of the Crown, the Prime Minister and others, come into this chamber and are able to be questioned openly by representatives of the community and legislation and proposals from the Executive are able to be scrutinised in a meaningful way. Once the balance shifts markedly in favour of the will of the Executive, then the balance that our system tries to represent, in giving the opportunity to the community through its representatives to have meaningful debate, is denied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are rapidly seeing, particularly from this Prime Minister, a tendency to treat the Parliament merely as a rubber stamp. We should take the view that parliament is not just this place, the House of Representatives, but also the other place, the Senate. Standing order 75 says that we shall not reflect upon each other's place of representation. In recent days we have seen that the Prime Minister has flagrantly disregarded that convention. Today we saw an absolute outrage when he compounded his error of yesterday, describing the Senate as unrepresentative swill, and today he described the members of the other place as pansies. On being asked to withdraw, he did not do so. That is very unparliamentary language and is very regrettable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am making is this: where this motion to declare Bills urgent is moved continuously and increasingly to impose the guillotine, it effectively disturbs the balance of the needs of the Government to deal with its legislation and also denies the rights of members from both sides to discuss these matters, which are matters of importance. It is not as though some of these Bills are not important. I have mentioned child care. There is a change to the Medicare levy which impacts on each and every Australian. That matter is going to be pushed through the House. There are the Natural Resources Management (Financial Assistance) Bill and the Corporate Law Reform Bill. A range of debate has taken place in this country about corporate law reform. Mr Cameron has just been appointed as the new head of the Australian Securities Commission. Many issues could be debated and discussed&mdash;they are all going to be denied to us. There is also the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill. There are many differing opinions in this place about how we should be dealing with higher education funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the Farm Household Support Bill? What about the farmers in this country who are suffering mightily at present? I note that the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) is in the chamber. He could tell the Parliament, chapter and verse, about the pain that is being experienced by farmers right around Australia. There is a Farm Household Support Bill which recognises this pain. But does it go far enough? Are there ways in which we can amend it, to make it better, to make it more relevant, to bring into the net many of those young farmers, particularly the ones last onto the farms who are being forced off because of the financial positions in which they find themselves due to the huge interest rates that they have had to suffer in recent years, and of course the vagaries of the weather? We are probably losing our best and brightest farmers, the ones we cannot afford to lose. They are the ones who have the young children&mdash;the future farmers of this country. Let us not forget the wealth that comes to this country from our farmers. That is a very important Bill on which we are being denied the opportunity for detailed debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the Australian National Training Authority Bill. These are issues that are important to the Government. I know there are many on the Government side who are concerned about training, and rightly so, but the guillotine effectively means that we cannot debate these matters in detail. I know the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) has a commitment to training. We do not always agree with his proposals, but I am sure he would agree that there needs to be time for debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we come back to the reason. The reason is that the Senate is somewhat unreasonable in how it deals with legislation from the House of Representatives. There is no doubt about that. We also know that the legislative arrangements of the Government, the legislation committee of the Cabinet, could be doing far better than it is doing in requiring its Ministers to get the legislation here far more quickly and more timely to give this chamber the proper time to deal with this legislation in the detail which it deserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is sad that 51 Bills are being declared urgent today. The other day we had 17-odd. There is an accumulation of some 70-odd Bills that are going to be pushed through the House this week and next. On the few remarks I have made, it is quite clear why we believe that the balance between the needs of the Executive and the needs of private members is being denied. That is why we will be opposing this motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the honourable member for Bass and Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Smith) on these points. While there is a Senate timetabling and scheduling problem, which we are reminded of twice a year at least, it is a deeper problem than that: the organisation and the running of the Parliament. It is a responsibility for the Government, the carriage of which is the responsibility of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley). He has now had some experience on this issue over the last few years. I would have thought that, with the benefit of five years experience, this man would come up with a better scheduling of legislation so that we do not come to this House to face not one but two guillotine urgent Bills listings. As the honourable member for Bass correctly pointed out, the first listing was for 20 Bills, now we have 51 Bills being guillotined through on one bit of paper, by a given date&mdash;a date which, incidentally, is beyond the cut-off date for an election this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parliament is a fragile institution. The standing of parliament is a matter of great concern and import to the governments of Australia. This is all the more so during periods of recession, during periods of great economic agony which exist right across Australia&mdash;whether it is those who have to go to the community kitchens in Albury-Wodonga for their meals for the first time in 60 years since the Great Depression or whether it is the unemployment in Bundaberg and Gladstone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can cheapen the standing of parliament very quickly by going down this process of adding 51 Bills into the sausage machine legislative process which the Government seeks to impose on the Parliament this afternoon. It is unacceptable conduct. It does nothing for the standing of the Parliament. It does nothing for the standing of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Neither does the conduct of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who again today added insult to injury with further descriptions of senators&mdash;`swill' yesterday; `pansies' today. That conduct further cheapens the standing of the Parliament and the institution of parliament and offends against standing order 75: the conduct and behaviour of members and members' descriptions of senators. I now find double affirmation and confirmation&mdash;and I know I can only make passing reference to this&mdash;that the Speaker asked the Prime Minister to withdraw those remarks.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My best bet is 27 February. We are led to believe that the Government must have this particular Bill passed before the Parliament is dissolved for the elections. There are a number of happenings which are neither the wish of the coalition nor the Government, particularly the mailing out of literature and information on nominated candidates, their photos and other procedural matters, which are tidied up by this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It therefore follows that there will have to be a further guillotine in addition to the two guillotines before the House with regard to additional legislation coming from the Senate and not yet the subject of a guillotine because the Government cannot get access to it as it has not been introduced onto the floor of the House. One of these Bills, notably, is the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill. I invite the Minister in his response to confirm that he would seek to have that legislation passed during the Budget session of 1992. I assume he does. That would confirm that more than 51 Bills will be the subject of the guillotine next week, quite apart from those that are the subject of the guillotine this week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a shabby legislative process for which the Government and the Minister must stand condemned. He has been in business five years. As Leader of the House he has had a great deal of experience in the Parliament. He has been well aware of and has, in more recent years, factored in the Macklin amendment and the two-day sitting requirement. Indeed, it was that two-day sitting requirement that cost Bob Hawke the prime ministership last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that enough is enough. It is time for a better deal for the Parliament. It is time for a better deal for the people of Australia with regard to the legislative process of the Parliament. It is time for a fair go and it is time this place had the opportunity to focus more on the economic circumstances of so many Australians who have found their standard of living has deteriorated further over the five years of Minister Beazley as Leader of the House and over the 10 years of Prime Ministers Hawke and Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the guillotine of 51 Bills is a shame on the Government, a shame on this Minister. We deserve a whole lot better and the sooner the better. The sooner the election occurs so we can clean up this act the better it will be for all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;Parliament is not fragile. Parliament is a very effective body in this country. The fact of the matter is that we are, because of the nature of our federal system, enormously oriented towards legislation. We sit as much as we used to, but these days we give private members a go. That is the basic difference between the situation that has existed in the last five years of this Government and basically what existed prior to this time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We give members a go. We do not legislate by exhaustion. One thing those opposite will find if they actually go through the statistics is that we use the closure provision far less often than the Opposition did. That was its means of getting legislation through without extensive guillotining. We think it is better to actually provide a degree of certainty and to ensure that the Parliament sits reasonable hours. It did not sit reasonable hours when I first became a member of parliament. Let me tell those opposite: when one is debating at two and three in the morning, not much sensible is said about the needs of the people of Australia though time is invariably filled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point made by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) was that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) cheapened this place. I think the Prime Minister's remarks in Question Time today did exactly the opposite. They were the sorts of statements that ought to be made and would have to be made at some point during an election campaign or earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are dealing with Budget issues, people must know from the major parties during an election campaign that those parties will not behave as parties behaved in 1975 and reject a Budget of a duly elected government so that that government can no longer continue to function. We cannot do that. The point is that no responsible party in this place can stand up and say that it will reject, use a peripheral advantage in the Senate to reject, a government's Budget arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister indicated quite clearly that, whilst we would oppose the GST which would be, if it were ever introduced, obviously a Budget Bill, we have sufficient regard for the standing of this place, the dignity of parliament and the mandate relationship that exists between parliament and the electoral process not to deny the Government a capacity to survive the years for which it was elected. As I said, it had to be said at some point during the election campaign. Of course, during the election campaign, having said it, we will be saying a lot more about the GST. I might say, from my own experience in handing out leaflets in my electorate over the weekend, that the GST debate is just getting more and more interesting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition also had something to say about a Bill that is currently in the Senate. Of course, there will be more sittings than the week that remains for this guillotine. That Bill will no doubt emerge at some point of time from the Senate. When it does, either this year or next year, we will deal with it in the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The speculation on election dates is really getting a little humorous. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has been calling an election every three weeks for the last 12 months, I think&mdash;basically since he brought down Fightback. He said, `There must be an election just around the corner', `Bob Hawke will have an election', then, `Paul Keating will have an election immediately'. I cannot for the life of me fathom the obsession of this political ingenue with elections. Perhaps because he is a political ingenue he feels he has to announce one every three weeks or so. I am perfectly satisfied with the answers the Prime Minister has been giving on these matters and they will indeed in this process be done slowly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has just been pointed out to me that I have been misrepresented. There are not 51 Bills being guillotined here; there are 67. This is an enormously productive parliament. The point about it is that we are a country that lives by an intense legislative process. It is probably a good thing that we are a country such as that; that we have a written Constitution under which things can be dealt with on the basis of reasonable clarity, but there is a penalty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of questions is interesting. When those opposite sit around and talk about questions and the honourable member for Franklin gets up and asks about questions, I think a reasonable thing can be said to him about that&mdash;that is, he ought to speak to his Opposition front bench. It is an absolute disgrace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The provisions of the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1992 are to provide for the Australian Wheat Board or its subsidiary to be directly involved in value adding and to continue the Government's underwriting guarantee of the AWB's borrowings of 85 per cent until 1998-99.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background to this matter is that there has been intense industry debate on the future of the AWB and on the future of the grains industry generally. It has taken place over the months since the Grains 2000 Conference, held by the Grains Council of Australia, in September 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The GCA liaised closely with the Government throughout this period. As a result, the Government agreed to a package of measures for the wheat industry, announced on 8 October 1992, which would provide a framework for growth and would promote the security of the industry for the period to June 1999. The wheat industry is Australia's third largest agricultural export earner. I would like to make the observation that in the last 10 years production averaged 15 million tonnes or 3 per cent of the average world wheat production of some 508 million tonnes. Australian wheat provides about 13 per cent of the international market, that is, about 91 million tonnes. We have approximately 29,000 wheat farmers in Australia. That number is about 14 per cent of Australian farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides additional, extended functions and powers for the Australian Wheat Board to enable it to undertake grains based value adding activities directly. These are provided within the Constitutional limits that permit such activities to be undertaken; that is, for export, for trade between States and Territories, and within Territories, but not for trade within States. Intrastate trade will require complementary State legislation if and when the need arises. The AWB can undertake these value adding activities either in its own right or through a subsidiary company set up specifically for this purpose and will be able to draw on monies standing to the account of the Wheat Industry Fund, the WIF. The WIF is funded through a statutory levy imposed on every wheat sale made in Australia, and that part of the levy directed to the AWB, is currently set at 2 per cent of farm gate value. A further one per cent of levy is directed to research and development. The WIF will not be revolved before an adequate capital base has been built up of around about $400m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for continuation to June 1999 of the Government's underwriting guarantee of the AWB borrowings which enable the AWB to make advance payments to growers for wheat of a season delivered to the pool. The level of the Government guarantee is set at 85 per cent of the aggregate estimated net pool return. That is calculated as a estimate of pool returns for a season made first in September each season and based on consideration of a range of estimates of production of the AWB receivals of expected costs and sale prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Wheat Marketing Act 1989, a guarantee was set to terminate in June 1994, and for the season commencing July 1992 the guarantee was set at 82.5 per cent. This means that the amendments raise slightly the level of the guarantee for this year. The amendment will now give the industry an opportunity to build up not only moneys for value adding but also its capital base for the AWB, giving the industry security to plan a future of financial independence post-June 1999. The last element of the Government's package which does not require legislative amendment relates to continuation of the AWB's export monopoly. The Government will review this position subject to progress in the Uruguay Round of the GATT, and as any successful reforms arising from the Round become effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The entire package of measures has the agreement of the Grains Council of Australia, which is the peak body representing grain growers in Australia. State affiliate membership of the Grains Council covered by this agreement include the New South Wales Farmers Association, the Queensland Graingrowers Association, the South Australian Farmers Federation, the Victorian Farmers Federation, and the Western Australian Farmers Federation. It is the case that some small groups within the industry continue to oppose statutory WIF levies and the use of WIF equity, particularly on value adding. WIF equity can only be used in accordance with an annual business plan approved by the Grains Council of Australia. The Council has put in place stringent criteria governing investment of WIF equity. Profit from the use of WIF equity is credited back to WIF equity holders on a pro rata basis, and during 1991-92 the fund returned 15.2 per cent when bank rates were 11.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the big difficulties at the present time, particularly in Queensland&mdash;I am sure the shadow Minister at the table, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), certainly recognises this because of the area he represents&mdash;has been caused by the extremely dry season and the massive effect that not only low prices but also droughts have had on many wheat producers in our State of Queensland, and certainly in New South Wales as well to a large degree. Indeed, a report commissioned by the Australian Wheat Industry shows that something like 40 per cent of farmers are no longer viable without assistance; that is according to the Queensland Graingrowers and I think that is a valid point. It is very difficult to control the weather. That is why the Government has put in place what is, I think, the right package with regard to the rural adjustment scheme to underpin the problems that farmers face in times of hardship through drought and through depressed prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know there have been some comments from some honourable members opposite, particularly in the National Party, who want a different type of strategy and basically a guaranteed minimum price. But a lot of growers in the industry are sceptical that that would have worked given the dry economic policies of some honourable members opposite. I think the strategy that has been put in place is the best one that can be achieved. What needs to be recognised about the crisis, particularly in the wheat industry, and the low returns that growers are getting, is that every time I look at table 4 on page 12 of the summary of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> and look at the returns that are supposed to come from growers it shows that mixed grain and wool producers are getting a net income of over $60,000. On that basis, Acil did a report which said that a goods and services tax together with the other policies that the Opposition is implementing would be beneficial to framers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made the observation that I am not aware of any grain grower in my area who is netting that sort of income. I am quite sure there would be very few grain growers in either of the electorates of the two honourable members sitting opposite who would be earning that sort of money. In fact, there are many growers who are not making any profit at all. To put a tax of 15 per cent on their food and clothing does not make sense. To blow inflation out by 7 per cent does not make sense. If road user charges are put on to rural Australia&mdash;which those opposite will have to do unless they are going to forgo more revenue, and then the $12 billion hole in Fightback will become bigger to the tune of about $3 billion that they need to fund roads&mdash;then people in the wheat industry in particular will be affected because of the areas in which they live. Wheat producers have to eat just like everybody else. Paying 15 per cent tax on every service that they use and for everything that they consume does not make a lot of sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that Acil, the firm that has given the thumbs up for Fightback and has used some sweeping observations on net incomes for farmers of between $55,000 and $71,000 as the basis to do it, has also made some sweeping statements with regard to the car industry, and has also basically endorsed the Opposition's policy on cars&mdash;which even a six-year-old would see as being detrimental. The former Liberal consultant David Trebeck is one of the senior principals in Acil. There is no doubt that Acil is stooging for the Liberal Party, and the Opposition in particular, and is out after a consultancy which it believes it would be successful in getting if the Opposition were successful in the coming Federal election. In doing that, it damages its own integrity and damages what should be a non-partisan response from any consultancy. I think that companies that are looking for consultants could look elsewhere than dealing with a Liberal Party promotion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the observation again that not many farmers earn that sort of money&mdash;I am sure that they would all like to&mdash;and those farmers in the wheat industry who do not will not benefit from Fightback or from a GST. I am always amused when the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) says how concerned he is about farmers; he wants to implement some of the worst and most vicious policy changes on them. Whether it be in relation to health, housing, education, abolishing a cross-subsidisation for telecommunications by privatising, or making farmers' kids pay up-front to get a tertiary education&mdash;whatever the case may be&mdash;farming families are affected like everybody else.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before us maintains the AWB single desk selling status on export markets and, as such, is welcome. It also extends until 1999 Commonwealth underwriting of AWB borrowings at a rate of 85 per cent of estimated net pool returns. We do not believe that that is as good as our policy, where we provide year of production underwriting at 95 per cent on a per tonne basis, but it is better than the provisions of the existing legislation which would have phased out underwriting altogether over the next couple of years. There will be virtually universal approval of these measures by the industry across rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other two objectives of the Bill are more cause for close examination. The continued accumulation of the wheat industry fund, currently collected via the levy which is now set at 2 per cent, is broadly&mdash;although, to be honest, not totally&mdash;accepted, welcomed and defended by growers. The use of that money by the proposed AWB subsidiary, however, for commercial investment in grains based value adding exercises&mdash;to some extent beyond the reach of grower option or control&mdash;is another matter as far as many growers are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is indeed a relief that single desk selling of Australia's crop is to remain. In the discussions that I have had with many of my north-western wheat farmers they have expressed some concerns about the accountability and performance of the Australian Wheat Board in the period following the 1989 legislation. Some of them talk of the day when the Wheat Board should compete as an exporter, not the exporter. In the meantime, the reality is that we trade in a highly corrupted world market. The intransigence of the Europeans in general, and of the French and Germans in particular, is such that the chances for reform in the near future are increasingly remote. Add to this the continuing United States subsidisation of its export grain and even the most stringent critics of the AWB become adamant that single desk selling must remain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that over 70 per cent of our exports are bought essentially on a single desk basis. There is an age-old adage that we do not divide our sellers when we are faced with a single purchaser. When that international market corruption results, as it has, in disastrously low prices&mdash;prices which in our non-subsidised farm sector are fed straight through to growers&mdash;the limited but nonetheless significant benefits derived by single desk selling cannot be forsaken either by our cash strapped farmers or by cash strapped Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AWB estimates its marketing leverage based on single desk selling status to result in about a $20 premium per tonne against selling costs of around $3. In anybody's language that is a good result. Interestingly, although there has been some disputation of those figures in this country, I was recently in the United States as a guest of that country&mdash;which I greatly appreciated&mdash;and, whilst there, I picked up a copy of an interesting paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">International trade:</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canada and Australia rely heavily on wheat boards to market grain</EMPHASIS>. It was put together by the United States General Accounting Office and it confirms the AWB's claims as to the value to Australian growers, in terms of increased returns, of single desk selling. It argues that the AWB contributes to an 11 per cent&mdash;or in last season's terms a $US21 per tonne&mdash;boost over and above the prices that growers would have received had they been forced simply to accept prevailing world prices. This is attributed to a range of things: one, the claim that we subsidise inputs, is surely nonsense and has been recognised as such by the then President of the United States, George Bush, in this very place in January this year. Indeed, as a wheat grower, I believe my indirect charges and taxes&mdash;the things that, regrettably, the Labor Party spokesmen on agriculture do not seem to be able to understand&mdash;are such that I am a net subsidiser of the rest of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also nominates the Board's borrowing leverage, by virtue of its underwriting. It also nominates RAS funding, interestingly enough, as a form of subsidisation, which I find a very tall order. Intriguingly, though, it goes on to point to the capacity of the Wheat Board to offer different prices in different markets as being one of the secrets of the results it achieves. The latter is apparently supposed to make it possible for the AWB to develop new markets by offering below posted prices for new customers&mdash;I suppose, some of those new customers that we have been forced to go and look for as a result of US activities in world markets&mdash;while at the same time it sells to established buyers and to the domestic market at higher prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that this is intriguing because in fact in this erstwhile publication&mdash;I will take a bit of a hit at the people who put it together; our friends across the other side of the Pacific pond&mdash;no illustrations or examples are offered. Nonetheless, the report clearly shows that the AWB is effective in securing better prices for Australian producers even though it claims that growers' incomes are assisted by just 11 per cent in total terms compared with&mdash;this is very interesting&mdash;the value of assistance measures resulting in a 46 per cent boost to farm incomes in the EC, 44 per cent in the US and 43 per cent in Canada. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason the export powers should remain, especially because, regrettably, those subsidies look to be likely to remain. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has indicated that the export powers of the Board will remain until trade reforms resulting from the GATT flow through. On that basis we can probably assume that single desk selling status for the Wheat Board is safe for many years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The export enhancement program in the United States was commenced in 1985 when that nation was frustrated by what it saw as the excessive subsidisation and production of grain by Europe appearing to threaten its share, or what it felt was its legitimate share, of world grain markets. Plainly, the program was meant to blast the Europeans out of the water and force them to stop subsidisation. The trouble is that it has not worked. The Europeans, knowing that the United States just does not have the relative economic firepower that it once had, has refused to reform, as we have seen again recently. The fearsome French farmer in particular plainly intimidates his apparently somewhat jellyback representatives much more effectively than does American economic might or the dictates of plain economic good sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Americans will claim that the export subsidies have worked, even though not as well as hoped, because, although their share of world grain markets has increased only from 29 per cent to 31 per cent since the program was introduced, the official line is that without EEP they would have lost a lot more world market share. That may be so but in the meantime the reality that we are faced with in this country is that our share of the world's wheat market has slipped from about 17 per cent to 7 per cent. Although drought has unquestionably played a part in that&mdash;for example, the 1983 crop of around 23 million tonnes has not been possible to repeat, partly because of seasonal conditions&mdash;it needs to be acknowledged that lower prices, prices in fact below the cost of production for many Australian farmers, have meant that Australian farmers have been forced out of the industry. We are growing and exporting much less wheat and receiving much lower prices for that wheat. It is a double whammy for Australian farmers and for the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The official Washington line from the State Department or representatives in Congress or the United States Department of Agriculture&mdash;whoever one likes to talk to there&mdash;is that as soon as the European Community reforms its agricultural policies the EEP will be correspondingly wound back. They say that the pain for Australia&mdash;and they do not deny that we are feeling a lot of pain at the moment&mdash;will then be rewarded as prices rise in response to lower production. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not, as the honourable member for Parkes points out, hold my breath, because the trouble is that nobody in America outside of Washington believes that. I was constantly warned by bankers, economists, farm leaders and others that in fact American farmers are increasingly seeing EEP as an entitlement; that is, their farm production is subsidised, they therefore produce too much and, given that they have an excess, they expect and will continue to expect their governments to find export markets for that excess product. Therefore, in the terms put to us by the Minister, the AWB's export powers are pretty secure. The world's agricultural trading environment, unfortunately, is not likely to be rapidly reformed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Grains Council and the Minister are currently claiming that they have acted in the only sensible way open to them. Indeed they have, but it needs to be remembered that it was not long ago that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Land</EMPHASIS>, a publication sometimes intriguingly close to the Labor Party, ran a story about the Minister's interest in using this issue as a lever to divide the coalition&mdash;in other words, his attempt to use this for political objectives rather than in the best interests of farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Newco proposal, based on the interesting concept that a private corporation should be allowed to take over the AWB's export powers, together with other concessions, was not accepted by growers. The first grower meetings were held in my electorate amid ominous hints that the coalition's firm position was not really firm at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Growers, fortunately, came correctly to believe that our policy&mdash;single desk selling and 95 per cent underwriting of year of production cropping&mdash;was preferable to Newco, which in my view faced a very real prospect of rejection by the Government as it would have opened the floodgates for the politicisation and possible ending of the very thing that is at the heart of the Australian Wheat Board's and growers' interests. As my colleague the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) said last night, victory is sweet indeed as far as the coalition is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Minister commendably backed off. He did, however, pursue his particular baby&mdash;value adding. The proposal to create a subsidiary body to the AWB for the purposes of investing a significant proportion of wheat industry funds&mdash;around 20 per cent plus $30m of the current $130m that is already in the fund&mdash;is an interesting one. The exact nature of the subsidiary board has not yet been finalised. Its provisional guidelines are that the funds must be used for the strategic and commercial interests of wheat growers via investment in value adding ventures which are to enhance the core business of the AWB to the advantage of wheat growers and WIF equity holders. The envisaged structure will be similar to the current trading arm of the AWB. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the existing legislation does not entirely preclude value adding ventures by the AWB, this legislation essentially changes the environment from one of tolerance, of allowance perhaps, to one of facilitation and encouragement. There are widely divergent views about this in the bush, and I want to make some of these points on behalf of the wheat growers who have contacted me in recent days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Value adding sounds attractive, and there was a time when a lot of it was undertaken in this country's agricultural industries. It is an irony, of course, that the Minister is so very keen on value adding, presumably to soak up some of our one million unemployed, given that he was once the head of one of the very structures, the ACTU, which, through the facilitation of unrealistic work practices and attitudes in this country, shut down so much of the very value adding that we now say we must have for our agricultural industries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Value adding as a concept will not improve the price of grain to Australian farmers. Indeed, if done badly it may cost them money. But it does offer other investment and return opportunities. Wheat growers, like all rural producers, need to think long and hard about investment opportunities in value adding industries. I believe that as a concept that is very sound.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But many are asking whether a marketing authority like the AWB is the best vehicle to achieve this objective. Many are unhappy about the investment of their money by compulsion in enterprises which they either do not approve of or do not believe will return them adequately. Of course building a capital base for the purposes of marketing grain is a proposal far removed from the mere collection of WIF funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Others expressed real concern that the subsidiary board may be tempted to effectively subsidise value adding projects by offering cheaper wheat. Put another way, there may at times be a conflict of interest between the traditional objectives of the AWB to obtain the best returns for growers' wheat and the desire of the new board to facilitate new value adding exercises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the Minister has specifically allocated his desired percentages of funds to be made available for value adding exercises means that there may be a tendency from time to time to throw money at projects without careful examination of their merits. Then there are the growers who no longer deliver any wheat to the AWB, preferring to sell all their crop on the domestic market. Some of those people see no reason why they ought to be compulsorily obliged to invest in value adding projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other issue I want to touch on is that the Grains Council and the Minister must address the rather surprising situation where apparently some banks, and in one State the Rural Adjustment Authority, have viewed WIF equity as an asset and have discriminated against, in one case that I have heard of, a farmer who wanted a re-establishment grant, on the basis that he had a considerable asset in the form of his equity in the WIF fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there is a need to develop a suitable mechanism for those who ultimately leave the industry altogether, or for some reason have good and legitimate reason for wanting to extricate themselves from involvement in the industry altogether and, following from that, from the WIF fund. In considering the structure, objectives and charter of the subsidiary board, I believe that the Grains Council of Australia, the AWB and the Minister&mdash;while he remains the Minister&mdash;must look very closely at some of the concerns expressed by their constituents and my constituents. The concept of value adding is an admirable one, but we need to make certain that the end result is a better bottom line for Australia's cash-strapped wheat farmers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill provides for the maintenance of the AWB's export powers, not through any commitment of this Government or the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean). This legislation is in the House in the form it is because of the good sense of wheat growers throughout Australia and the consistent stand taken by the coalition which, through the highly politicised development of the new wheat arrangements, maintained a firm policy of full export powers to the AWB and a 95 per cent underwriting commitment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also draw the attention of the House to the Minister's pronunciations concerning the future of the Wheat Board and its relationship to GATT negotiations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am convinced that the strength of the Australian wheat industry in the past and in the future is linked very closely to the single desk selling arrangements.

I therefore wish to concentrate my remarks on other aspects of this legislation that concern me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill has three major elements. Firstly, it extends until 30 June 1999 Commonwealth underwriting of AWB borrowings at the rate of 85 per cent of estimated pool returns. It continues the accumulation of the wheat industry fund, and it allows for the establishment by the AWB for the provision of grains based value adding services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House will recall that in 1989 this Government made major changes to Australia's wheat marketing arrangements. These changes deregulated the domestic wheat market through the removal of the compulsory acquisition powers of the AWB and the termination of administered domestic pricing arrangements. They ensured that the non-viable world price, resulting from corrupt and subsidised trading, became Australia's domestic wheat price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it was the first wedge in the door to break down the 45 years of successful marketing, quality control and effectiveness of the Australian Wheat Board's activities on both the domestic and international market.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, this legislation contains the accumulation of the wheat industry fund. I support such a fund as providing a capital base for legitimate AWB activities, and it is supported by the industry. Such legitimate uses would be making advanced payments and insurance payments to the Commonwealth of levy collection costs. As we know, the minimum percentage payment into the fund is presently 2 per cent but it has the capacity to rise to 5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I am concerned that there is no provision in this legislation for wheat growers leaving the industry to recoup their funds from this WIF. The only option is to sell their entitlement at obviously massively discounted values. Such lack of convertibility provides no security for farm borrowings. It has the capacity, as my colleague the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) recently stated, to be used as an asset through some of our rural adjustment schemes, but it is not seen by the banking community to have any security whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I acknowledge the argument which was put to the House last night by my colleague the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) that WIF funds would be useful in growers' hands in these times of economic uncertainty, I support the attempt of the industry to maintain and increase its capital base if this is the industry's decision. I remind the House that I represent the rich wheatgrowing soils of the Wimmera and Mallee. This year's harvest has the potential to be the best since 1983. Possibly, if the season continues the way it has been going, it may be the best harvest ever recorded in the history of wheat growing in my electorate. None of the wheat growers in my electorate have complained about their contribution to the well-being of their own industry. They are complaining only about the lack of its negotiability as indicated in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the final element of this legislation and one that is of great concern to me. This is a new initiative that allows the establishment by the Australian Wheat Board of a subsidiary for the provision of grain based value adding services. Value adding activities are defined in clause 3 of this legislation to mean activities that increase the value of grain or grain products and include the processing of grain or plants from which grain is obtained, the manufacture of products from grain or plants from which grain is obtained, and the promotion of such activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 4 provides the Australian Wheat Board with the new objective of participating in value adding activities with the stated aim of benefiting Australian wheat growers.

The effect of subclause 5(b) will be to make it a function of the AWB to engage in value adding activities for certain purposes, including trade and commerce with other countries and among the States. </PARA>

Section 13 of the principal Act allows the AWB, with ministerial approval, to form subsidiary companies, to enter into partnerships, to participate in joint ventures and to buy, hold or sell shares, debentures and securities. Section 71 of the principal Act allows the AWB, again subject to ministerial approval, to borrow money both within and outside Australia. Clause 8 will allow a wholly owned subsidiary of the AWB, again subject to ministerial approval, to borrow money both within and outside Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 74 of the Act allows the AWB to enter into certain contracts for hedging purposes. It is again subject to ministerial approval in relation to the purchase, sale and shipment of grains and borrowing and investment money by the AWB. The principal effect of clause 10 will extend the range of contracts that the AWB may enter into for hedging purposes to cover those in relation to value adding activities. The uses for which the AWB may use fund money will be extended by clause 13 to include any purposes in connection with value adding activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned some of the detail of these particular clauses that relate to value adding issues because I am absolutely certain that very few wheat growers in Australia have any detailed idea of the implications that will result from the legislation which will be passed in this House tonight. I also pay credit to the Australian Wheat Board for its limited, but effective, entry into the provision of promotional and commercial activities to countries which are major purchasers of Australian wheat. Egypt and the former Soviet Union have been excellent and successful ventures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I urge great caution in this new move to give the AWB the power to engage in value added activities. This is nothing more than the hobby horse of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Honourable members have heard the honourable member for Gwydir comment on this already. We all urge value adding of our Australian resources, but it will not be achieved by directing a statutory authority into such ventures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Value adding will occur when the economic and industrial climate is favourable. Australian industry needs competitive circumstances to attract either growers' or other investors' money into value adding activities. It cannot be achieved by legislation. Surely the lessons of Victoria or South Australia or the massive abuse of taxpayers' funds in Western Australia should have been learnt by this Government. This may well be my last speech in this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government, since the introduction of the 1989 wheat arrangements, has reduced the status of individual wheat growers to influence their own future. They have been placed at the cliff face of a corrupt marketing system, while unfairly bearing the brunt of high domestic costs with half-hearted government backing, even at the level of Australian Wheat Board borrowings. Under the Keating Government, clever politics is more important than people and ideology is more important than issues. Wheat grower members in this Parliament have continued to object to the politics that has been played by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We remember 1984 when we were told, `Agree to the Minister's arrangements, or you won't get paid your first advance'. In 1989 there was deregulation, but no counter-reductions in cost. Finally in 1992 the blackmail and the bluff have failed. As the honourable member for Gwydir has pointed out, the failing of the Newco proposals and the very real risk that single desk selling would be lost entirely to the Australian wheat industry have finally been put down by the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's policy is unequivocal: retention of monopoly export powers and 95 per cent underwriting of the current crop. The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), as usual, attempted to introduce additional factors into this debate and raised what I regard as important policies for Australia's primary industries sector which are contained in the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fightback package aims at doing the only thing that an Australian government has any responsibility for and influence over. We have very little influence over the price that is received for primary products on the world market. I acknowledge the work that the Government has done in working towards making other countries come to grips with the effects of subsidisation and corrupt trading practices and the impact of this on the Australian wheat industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one area in which this Parliament can take some action is in the reduction of costs to Australian industry. This is the importance and significance of Fightback. It removes the massive fuel excise and the wholesale sales tax regime. The removal will help value added industries and processes in this country as will the removal of payroll tax. Of course, the most significant impact of Fightback is the fact that exports are zero rated. Fightback will not just put Australia in a more competitive position with other countries, but will ensure that Australian primary industries can compete more favourably on world markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support this legislation. The most significant factor in the legislation is the retention of the Wheat Board's single desk selling arrangements.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">As previous speakers have said, the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill which we are discussing today has three key elements: firstly, the continuation of the Australian Wheat Board's single desk status for exports markets; secondly, the extension of the Government's guarantee of the Wheat Board's borrowings at 85 per cent of the estimated net pool returns until June 1999; and, thirdly, the continued accumulation of the wheat industry fund until June 1999 to provide a capital base for the Wheat Board to provide working capital for its trading activities and to fund advances once the borrowing guarantee runs out, and for investment in value adding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have just heard an excellent speech from the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher), and before that the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson). I would like to make some initial general remarks about the wheat industry. It has been steeped in the culture, traditions and pioneering spirit of this country over the years, indeed for over a hundred years. It is a very vital export industry that in recent times has usually returned an export income for this country in excess of $2,000m a year. It has been Australia's second most important primary industry after wool and it has produced a crop of around 10 to 15 or more million tonnes every year in recent years. In fact, I think the last 10 year average is about 14 million tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Twenty per cent, in round figures, of that is sold domestically, mainly to the flour millers and to the stockfeed industry. That industry has been deregulated in its marketing aspect since 1989. The other 80 per cent, in round figures, of the crop is exported. It goes out to about 40 countries every year. Sixty per cent or more of that is sold directly through the Australian Wheat Board, and 30 to 40 per cent of that is sold under Wheat Board supervision by international grain companies, such as Louis Dreyfus, Cargill and Bunge. The Wheat Board, of course, has single desk seller status through all those sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The world production of wheat is very substantial indeed. It has built up to somewhere between 550 million and 600 million tonnes a year. With Australia averaging only about 14 million tonnes, that means we are only producing about 2 to 3 per cent of the world's production. However, when it comes to exports, Australia is in the top four or five exporting countries. We export about 10 per cent of the world's traded wheat between countries, which is about 90 to 100 million tonnes a year. The other main exporting countries, of course, are the United States, Canada, the EC in recent times, and Argentina. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years the Wheat Board has branched out into other activities. It also trades in barley, chick peas, field peas, faba beans and sorghum. In recent years it has had a tremendous battle trying to keep our markets in the face of the European Community subsidies, which have been matched by United States subsidies since about the mid 1980s. I note one example of a subsidy of $US65 per tonne for wheat sold into Algeria. That is equivalent, roughly, to the price paid for the wheat itself. It makes it very hard indeed for Australian growers to match those prices in marketplaces and still make a profit for themselves at the end of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all that, I believe Australia must continue to press for progress in the Uruguay Round of the GATT negotiations. Since agriculture was brought into GATT in the mid 1980s, people have been expecting an overnight solution to these problems. I always believed that it could take at least five, if not 10 to 15 years, to achieve and I think we have to recognise that the progress will be slow. Any progress that we make will be gained step by step, but it is very worth while to hang in there just to hold the ground, because we do not want these world protectionist tendencies to take off more than they already have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Wheat Board, of course, has export monopoly powers. Amongst the growers, certainly in my electorate, that has very wide support indeed. It could be said that that support is breaking down to some extent, but if you go along to a meeting of growers, such as I do from time to time in my electorate, there might be 30 or 40 people there. You will usually only find one or two who are against this export monopoly power. The bulk of the audience are for it. Certainly, there will be a handful or more of supporters who are very fervently for it. The reason usually given for the export power to be maintained is that it is essential for the Wheat Board, so that it can guarantee sales to our core customers who like to buy on a government-to-government basis. Also, it allows us extract a premium for our product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wheat Board, as I have said, is faced with a corrupt world market. How best to market our wheat, which is what this Bill is all about, is a debate as old as the wheat industry itself. This afternoon, when I was putting some notes together for this speech, I was amused to read a statement by a commentator on the Queensland wheat industry back in 1902. I will read some of the words of what this person wrote. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The small wheat farmer with his stock of bags of wheat in his barn, visiting his neighbouring town with samples to exhibit to the local miller, or dealer, trying to secure a remunerative price, is much to be pitied. He has done a giant's work in lifting and hauling again and again his heavy bags of wheat, until they are safely stacked under his barn roof. He has to buy his wheat sacks at considerable cost and, when he has sold his wheat, away go the costly bags with it. He has no market test as to the quality or value of his wheat and he has to contend single-handed against the generally superior skill or knowledge of the dealer or miller, while his own strength of resistance is often weakened by the keen pressure of the need of cash. Sometimes he gets a good price; sometimes he does not. Very frequently he, rightly or wrongly, feels dissatisfied and complains. It is the system, or want of system, which is chiefly to blame. How many bitter quarrels and disputes arise about the bulk not being up to sample shown, about shortage of weight, about damaged grain and the hundred and one other points upon which differences may take place.</PARA>
<PARA>The commentator went on to say that it was no surprise that farmers on the one hand and dealers and millers on the other were often embittered toward each other. He concluded that what was needed was a proper test of wheat quality and, secondly, a system in which buyers and sellers could meet more or less on even terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess we can say that we have solved the first problem of being able to test for wheat quality, but the argument and debate rages on about the second. It is this feeling of frustration amongst growers, that they are too often being ripped off, which has led to numerous schemes over the years. We have had a slow evolution of schemes in this country, most of which have taken place since the Second World War, leading to compulsory acquisition, compulsory pooling and all the refinements that have gone on with those schemes over the last couple of decades or so. The early schemes after the Second World War that ran until the mid-1960s have now been analysed in depth, and just about every study of them shows that they had little effect on price when compared with the world price. In fact, they ended up costing growers hundreds of millions of dollars. What I mean by that is that the growers of Australia were actually subsidising the Australian consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is something I believe the growers of this country have never had recognition for. It is something that ought to be acknowledged at times when growers find that they are behind the eight ball and occasionally call for a bit of help from the rest of the community&mdash;help that seems to be available to just about every other industry in Australia. They have been subsidising the Australian consumer for decades to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has come out of these studies that interests me is that the fluctuation in the yield of wheat produced has far exceeded the fluctuations in the prices that the growers have received. The yield fluctuation, of course, comes about because of drought or because of high or low wool prices which cause growers to grow less wheat or more wheat. The 1974 Green Paper showed that the overwhelming percentage&mdash;97 per cent, I was astounded to see&mdash;of variations in incomes for farmers for their wheat was due to fluctuations in volume of production rather than the prices they received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to compare that with the wool industry, where we have had a comparatively stable volume of production of wool over recent decades but greater fluctuations in price compared with wheat. Trying to stabilise prices for wheat growers might be a good thing to do, but it does not necessarily mean that they are going to have a stable income. I believe that a stable income for wheat growers is something we have to turn our attention to more and more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been great year to year variations in yield in the wheat industry. In fact, one could say that the earlier sophisticated schemes sometimes aggravated the variations in output that we had. Fortunately, we have refined those over the years. In a sense it has been a bit like tax averaging of farmers' incomes. It is all very well when the farmers' incomes are going up but when they have been plunging, as they have been in recent years, the fact that farmers have to pay an average tax from higher incomes from previous years hits them very hard. One wonders about the value of these schemes. I sometimes wish we could go back to the schemes we had in the past where farmers could opt in and opt out of this tax averaging. At least that was something that was very valuable to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think schemes for wheat stabilisation have been too much treated as a separate commodity by commodity entity rather than looking at production from the farm of all commodities. For example, wheat acreage has all too often been inversely proportionate to the price paid for wool. We have had a stabilised price but we have let the volume fluctuate according to the price that we can largely get for our wool. This commodity by commodity approach perhaps should be looked at again and not treated in isolation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been the philosophy in the wheat industry that the weakest seller has set the market price. When we are producing only 2 to 3 per cent of the world's wheat, this is something that needs greater analysis than has previously been done. I am a strong believer that we must constantly analyse the arguments on both sides to get the best deal for the wheat growers of this country, who have far too often seen their toil expended for very little income at the end of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to read back over some of the philosophies of one Len Dorman, the general manager who took over the Wheat Board in 1963. He then tried to get the best of both worlds by using international grain traders under AWB supervision for grower advantage. He always felt that, if we had international grain traders in other countries selling wheat from other countries but not being able to sell Australian wheat, those people would be working against Australian wheat growers. So he tried to get them into the system more than they had been in the past. I think that philosophy has continued in the Wheat Board until today when, as I said before, 30 to 40 per cent of our export wheat is done under Wheat Board supervision by international grain traders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not rule out the role of international grain traders out of hand. These sorts of merchants can often ferret out a sale where a wheat board cannot because they are keener in that they are searching out a profit. They can often offer deals and terms outside what the Wheat Board can do. If the Wheat Board can have some sort of supervision over them, perhaps we can have the best of both worlds to satisfy what growers want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Trading today is very different from what it was in years past. We do not necessarily have to deal with buyers face to face all the time. It can be done from a phone or a fax machine at the back of Bourke, if we so wish. Both sides, buyer and seller, have all the world's information before them at the flick of a switch on a screen. Another point is that buyers' specifications are becoming much more demanding than they were in the past. We are also seeing this in the wool industry, and we have to pay attention to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Testing is much better than it was in the past. Buyers are requiring more information on quality characteristics, particularly on things like protein. They want less variation in whatever line they are buying. There is a greater recognition that different wheats have different qualities which lead to different prices. There is a greater emphasis on this. This has led to a disaggregation of the pooling system in Australia not only in the types of wheats going into the pool but also in the breakdown of the costs that are deducted from the pool. That is done now on a State to State basis with rail costs. I think the rail costs that have been imposed on the wheat industry by the States have been an absolute disgrace. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I compliment the Wheat Board on what it has done with testing on over a thousand receival sites in this country. I also compliment the Wheat Board on its after-sales service for our overseas buyers. It was perhaps a bit lax in that regard in the past but in recent times it has been very diligent. The Board is providing much more information, seminars and assistance to overseas buyers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to see a recent study on the best wheats that are produced in the world. Among bread wheat types, Canadian spring wheats were judged to be the best, but close behind were Australian prime hard wheats followed by US spring wheats. On soft-type wheats, ASW Australian wheats were right at the top of the list. That pays tribute to Australian wheat growers. US white wheats and US soft red wheats ran second and third. Among durum wheats, Canadian types were at the top of the list followed by US wheats and Argentine wheats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, world wheat marketing has changed very much from what it was in the 1950s and 1960s. There has been a constant updating of Australian Wheat Board practices. Indeed, if they had not changed we would have been left far behind. We need continually to shed previous attitudes, put them behind us, and update our practices. In the past there has been a philosophy that those who suggested change were dangerous heretics, but I believe that is now largely behind us. The Wheat Board and others in the wheat industry listen more to what everybody has to say. They try to adopt what is good and reject what is bad, and that is to be welcomed. A greater emphasis has to be placed on both yield and marketing, which is what we are discussing here today, because they are very important areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the other two areas pertinent to this Bill. The 85 per cent guarantee on borrowings that the Government has frozen until 1999 is a welcome development, although it falls far behind the 95 per cent that the coalition is offering. Even at 95 per cent there will be a very rare call on the taxpayer in this country. All it does is guarantee borrowings for the first payment, and it means that the AWB can borrow at better interest rates because of the Government guarantee&mdash;a small thing to give growers for what they have done for Australian consumers in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There has been much comment on the wheat industry fund. It runs at 2 per cent of sales, taken out of growers' receipts. We are aiming to build that up to $400m or $500m at the end of the decade. That could not have come in at a worse time than now, when growers are strapped for cash and many of them are running at negative incomes&mdash;often of $20,000 or $30,000 or more. It is true that the growers do want this wheat industry fund, but I am not convinced that there is strong support for it. Most growers I have spoken to seemed to be very vague about it. I think there has to be much more scrutiny in that area. In conclusion, I support the direction of this legislation, although I do not think it goes far enough. We need constant scrutiny and debate on marketing of wheat in this country. </PARA>

I will canvass them briefly because I really want to put our position on wheat into perspective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Parkes has commented, the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill refers to a wheat industry fund levy. I, like other members, have some reservations about this fund. I understand that the Grains Council assures everybody that the wheat growers want the levy. I hear it but, frankly, my wheat growers do not seem to be as enthusiastic as the Grains Council has suggested. I notice the way in which the funds are to be distributed and I trust that the result of the fund will be to give some greater independence to the Wheat Board in its operations. That is the long term objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) suggested in his second reading speech that 80 per cent of future contributions will go to building up the capital base of the wheat industry. In that sense it will give the wheat industry as a whole a capability to look at its operations in a more independent way and with less dependence on government. To that degree, I guess that, the Government having committed itself to the continuation of the Wheat Board, the measure goes part of the way towards the Newco proposal which the Grains Council had advocated and which I never thought was a goer&mdash;not because I did not support the idea of a private enterprise organisation, but simply because I could not see governments sustaining an export monopoly for a private corporation of that character. In that circumstance, I felt that Newco was going to be disadvantaged before it got very far at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wheat industry fund will provide some private sector or wheat grower involvement in the operations of the Wheat Board. But I stress that as the levies are now to be paid&mdash;and many would prefer not to contribute&mdash;I trust there will be a maintenance of the identity of those who are contributing so that we get to the stage of either recycling the funds or in some way people at some stage in the future being able to draw funds from that capital base. There should be an equitable basis for redistribution of those funds. I cannot see anything in the legislation about it. I suggest that that is an area that needs to be taken into account by the Wheat Board and by the Government in the operation and accounting of that money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Together with around $30m of current equity, 20 per cent of future contributions will be set aside for value adding activities. I supported entirely the remarks of the honourable member for Mallee about the contribution that can be made in this respect. I would like to see the Wheat Board putting money into the wheat research field to help the private sector look at value adding rather than necessarily undertaking it itself. I am not convinced that the Wheat Board can do this as well as the private sector, but I am totally convinced that there is a role for the Wheat Board to pursue in looking at innovative ways by which it is possible to value add to the crop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Parkes said, yield is a very important part of the future returns to wheat growers, as is marketing. If we look at yield, we also want to look at where the wheat will be used and how it can be used to the greater benefit of the Australian wheat grower. My belief is that the money that is being put aside for value adding activities would be better used to develop new markets, new techniques and new processes and then passed onto the private sector so that it might pursue those activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not a great one for believing that the Wheat Board, for all that it has operated so effectively over the years, is the best organisation to be engaged permanently in value adding activities. I trust that there will be no reduction in the money used to develop these processes so that they, through a patent, a licence or some other way, can be passed onto the private sector, where those are not patentable. But, if they are not, they would be there to allow the Australian private sector to take advantage of them, and the wheat grower would get the same benefit. The other $100m is to go to trading division operations. There is no doubt that that is essential and necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some discussion about the other two elements of the legislation. I want to talk about them because I have been involved in this area for so long. The first is the monopoly of export power. I am delighted to see that the Government is retaining that. I notice in the conditions set out by the Minister that it is subject to an effective result from GATT. If there were to be an outcome that none to date have predicted, there might be a need for some change&mdash;for example, were there to be a remarkable reduction in agricultural protection as a result of the negotiations that now seem totally stalled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to look at the wheat industry, we have to understand some of the changes that have occurred in it. The advantage of the monopoly export power is that it means that the Wheat Board is able to use the wheat marketing arm as its predominant purpose in a way which enables us to compete with export enhancement programs of the United States and with the common agricultural policy of the European Community. At the same time, I do not accept the argument, which some in the United States would, that the Wheat Board being our sole market leader is a reason to suggest that we are, therefore, subsidising the wheat industry. Some quite convoluted arguments have been presented by American congressmen and others on that subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not accept that, because we have a single marketing arm, the Wheat Board is in any way subsidising the grower. What it does on a commercial basis is determine the price and grade of wheat for a particular market. That is not subsidising the grower; it is engaging in a commercial practice of marketing properly the crop for which the Wheat Board is responsible. I do not see that in any way as a subsidy. I think the United States spokesmen who use that argument are doing it purely on the basis of self-gratification and self-justification for an export enhancement program that is not justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble is that the export enhancement program has made it impossible for the Wheat Board to get what otherwise would be a fair price for the grain it sells, simply because its enhancement subsidies reduce the value of the world market attainable for particular categories of wheat, particularly in markets in which we are competing against the United States. It makes the Wheat Board reduce its price because of no marketing force other than the presence of the export enhancement program. A number of studies have assessed that reduction at a varying rate per tonne&mdash;some as high as $30 and more per tonne. That is an incredible price deduction at a time when there are all sorts of other competitive factors in the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing about the board and its monopoly export power that needs to be registered is that the world market is changing. For a long time there were incredible and effective deals done by successive Australian Wheat Board chairmen, virtually over the telephone. Jack Cass, Les Price and Clinton Condon have all had telephone conversations with their counterparts in the Soviet Union, as it was. They have been able to negotiate millions of dollars of sales, simply on the basis of a telephone conversation because of the trust that existed between them&mdash;all this at the height of the Cold War. The position has been similar with China. It has been remarkable the way in which that monopoly power has given a capacity for negotiation with those centrally controlled economies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But times have changed. One of our problems in the wheat industry is that, as those controlled economies have split into independent republics, there is a total uncertainty as to their capacity to fund purchases of grain and the way in which it is going to be stored and handled for the future. One of the big challenges for the Australian Government is the way in which it looks at its aid programs and, in particular, the World Bank, the FAO, the International Monetary Fund and other international agencies. We should look at ways to deal with the humanitarian requirements in order to help these countries feed their people. We should provide money in such a way that they can re-establish the stability of purchase that used to be such a major part of the previous grain marketing process. That gets into a much wider subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely critical that the Australian Wheat Board is able to obtain that export marketing monopoly. I trust that the Government, on that other front, is looking at ways in which it might help some of those former centrally controlled economies. I have in mind the enormous advantage there is in being able to provide some sort of guarantee so that that money can come back by way of purchase of Australian grain or by way of food aid grain, instead of just giving it as money to projects, which in other instances might be valuable but, in this instance, helps the Australian wheat grower and the development of the private sector economy in those now independent republics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other part of marketing that I think is important, as the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) identified, is that there are a number of private traders who certainly have a niche in handling grain. I have been quite impressed by some of the market opportunities that have been discussed with me. I am concerned that the Wheat Board does not apply undue and unfair restrictions on access to grain by private traders. There are obviously disadvantages if they are going to compete in such a way that will force the price down. That is one of the advantages of the export monopoly. But there are niches that the private sector traders can service that I do not believe the Wheat Board can necessarily cover to the same extent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be most concerned if the Wheat Board were too restrictive in permitting those private traders to develop their market outlets. If we link those private traders back to the value adding that I and others have spoken of with respect to the concept of the wheat fund, it is essential that they try to develop those alternate uses for grain. That will be one of the strengths of the vertical integration of the industry of the future. We do not want to deny either the private marketing or its access to those new value added techniques that might establish new markets and new processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own electorate, Goodman Fielder Wattie has developed quite significant starch and gluten processes using wheat as a base, on a basis that has been quite unique. It has established subsidiaries within the European Community and has operated most competitively against other gluten manufacturers in other countries around the world, essentially operating with corn or maize based grain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the private traders and the private sector, there is an advantage in value adding and in the private traders being given a reasonable go to develop their own niche markets so that they are able to supplement the demand for Australian grain. They are not looked on by the Wheat Board as competitors. As far as I am concerned, the private traders supplement the market outlet. At a time when the world market is changing, it is particularly important that they are given a reasonable opportunity to develop those markets and the specialty markets, as they will tend to be, for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to express my disappointment that the borrowing guarantee will continue instead of underwriting. I know that the Government is extending the guarantee on borrowings by the Wheat Board until June 1999 at a level of 85 per cent of the aggregate estimated net pool return. I do not believe that gives the wheat growers the sort of cash flow that most need immediately after harvest and on delivery of grain. I far prefer the coalition's policy and I think that every wheat grower I know of would equally prefer it. The 95 per cent underwriting gives the grower a chance to get cash flow, which is absolutely critical when the seasonal volatility of the last few years is taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know a wheat grower who does not, perhaps more than anybody, contribute to the viability of country towns. If there is a good wheat crop we can be sure that those country towns have higher employment. The service and retail industries have their debts paid by the cockies. They go in, pay their bills and the economy of the whole town starts turning again. If we are not going to allow that to happen, part of the viability of rural Australia will be affected. How much worse is it at the moment, when so much of Australia is still suffering&mdash;some is just emerging&mdash;from one of the worst droughts in living memory? The last two years have been absolutely appalling across a large stretch of the wheat growing area of eastern Australia. If those wheat growers had that 95 per cent underwriting they would be able to contribute to the recovery of employment and small business in those small towns, and then to the larger towns, and then to the cities around the eastern seaboard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People in this place too often forget that interlocking chain between the production heart, which has long generated the cash flows and sustained the growth and development of Australia, and the end product in the unemployment queues going into the local CES office. If there is a cash flow on the wheat farm, that cash flow goes right back down the chain and the number of unemployed is reduced. Fundamentally, there is a requirement that the Government should look at the marketing chain, not just for the wheat grower but for the added end benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason, I do not believe that the guarantee on borrowings of 85 per cent is sufficient. I am delighted that it is being continued until June 1999 and that it will be reduced to 80 per cent in 1994. I believe it would be far better if it were a 95 per cent underwriting, firstly, because it would help those wheat growers who have been labouring because of bad seasons and, secondly, because it certainly would help towards the restoration of the economic viability of many of those small towns and through the chain which, because of seasons and other factors, have been so critically affected in the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill has my support. It is reluctant support because the legislation is not good enough. I am fed up with one other aspect of the Bill: the way in which the Government seems to have borne down on the industry in the last few years. The difficulty with any industry is that there needs to be certainty. Now that this legislation has been brought in, and until it is replaced by legislation to be introduced by the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), as Minister for Primary Industries and Energy in the incoming Hewson Government, with a decent 95 per cent underwriting, probably early in 1993 the way things are going at the moment, I think the industry really needs to sit back and think, `Well, at least we have got something out of Labor; it is not much, but it is better than nothing'.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, there will be universal pleasure amongst wheat growers that the single desk seller status of the Australian Wheat Broad is to be entrenched. That is very important for such an industry in Australia, which is basically dependent upon its export markets. At the present time it is particularly difficult to sell wheat in a corrupt market, so we need to take advantage of any small opportunity we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Australia has a quality product. It is entitled to gain premiums for that quality. If we are to maintain and develop those premiums, it is essential that we retain the single desk selling status. The products we have are in demand. We have been able to sell them around the world, even against the massive subsidies being poured in by the Americans and the Europeans. So we should not lose any advantage that might be available to us in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About the only people to oppose the retention of the single desk selling status were of course the people in the Australian Grain Exporters Association. It is something of an irony that they should be called the Australian Grain Exporters Association, because they were all foreigners, mostly American, but certainly companies with boards of directors that owe their allegiance to other parts of the world. They naturally saw advantage to themselves in being able to trade in Australian grain. It gave them the choice of optional purchasing for particular markets and it also gave them the opportunity to take advantage of the quality of Australian wheat, to blend our high quality with some of the poorer quality wheats they were acquiring in other parts of the world and of course to return the premiums to their own share-holders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this instance, most of the shareholders are family-owned American companies. The multinationals had no commitment to Australia. They were looking to come into the Australian market for what they could get out of it. They were here for profit. I have no problem with companies wanting to earn profits in the Australian situation but, certainly, I have a greater priority to ensure the well-being of Australian wheat growers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who look at what is going on in the Australian oilseed industry&mdash;where one of these same multinationals that wanted to become involved in the Australian grain exporting industry, Cargill, now has virtual monopoly control&mdash;realise the dangers of what can happen when a foreign-owned company gets such a priority position in an Australian industry. Cargill is in control of the majority of Australia's oilseed crushing capacity at the present. It dominates the market, basically sets the prices and the Australian oilseed industry is in a nosedive. Production is dropping each year and there are many who are concerned that the industry could die out altogether. The wheat industry, one of Australia's biggest and most important industries, cannot be allowed to be exposed to that kind of fate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the legislation, which again is an improvement, is the Government borrowings guarantee of up to 85 per cent of net pool returns until 1999. As the previous speaker, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), mentioned, the Government had intended to reduce that guarantee to 82.5 per cent this year and to 80 per cent next year. When guarantees get to that sort of level, they cease to have any worth. Any bank will lend that sort of money, so the Government guarantee was starting to lose any currency, starting to lose any worth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the grain industry leaders sold their industry somewhat short in agreeing to this particular proposal. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) was obviously trying to play politics in the hope that he could divide the coalition. The coalition offered the wheat industry a very much better position; namely, 95 per cent underwriting. There is a much greater difference between an 85 per cent loan guarantee and 95 per cent price underwriting than just 10 per cent. One is an 85 per cent guarantee of a loan; the other is a 95 per cent guarantee of a price. It has very real and very significant benefits to the Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was virtually no prospect of the Government guarantee of the loan ever being called up. There is not a great prospect of a 95 per cent price guarantee being called up, but it would have happened once in recent times and that was an occasion when the industry was facing catastrophe. It would have been of great value to the industry at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry is getting something less than it could have achieved because it yielded to the pressure of the Minister at the time. The industry can be assured that it will not be too long before it will have the opportunity to negotiate with a more sympathetic government that will deliver something that is more worth while for its needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The controversial aspect of this particular Bill of course has been the wheat industry fund. The payment of 2 per cent of growers' returns&mdash;2 per cent they can ill afford, particularly in the current environment&mdash;extends until 1999 to assist the Australian Wheat Board with its capital base for trading activities and particularly for greater investment into value adding. There has been value adding in Australian primary industries for years. Those who have been around and have listened to the current Minister speak may think he invented it, but he is a very late convert to value adding in Australian industry. In fact, he has contributed greatly to destroying the value adding that has occurred in this country for many years. The value adding has occurred with no help from the Currans of this world who have done their level best to destroy value adding in the meat industry or from the Food Preservers Union which has done its level best to destroy value adding in so many of the vegetable and fruit industries or, for that matter, the Government and its current arrangements with the meat inspectors in AQIS, who are doing their level best also to destroy value adding in Australian abattoirs at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If all that is not bad enough, the taxation regime of the current Government also destroys incentive and encourages industries and companies to do their value adding overseas. So if this Government were just to do something about the current tax regime, were to do something about reforming industry in this country and developing a much freer marketplace and, in particular, freer industrial relations in this country, it would provide a major incentive to value adding with or without this particular levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also resistance to the way in which the AWB is using its additional capital base in its trading activities. In some States it is an advantage to have a grower owned and controlled organisation marketing actively and purchasing growers' grain. But in States like Queensland where there is already a strong and active grower controlled organisation called Grainco performing this function, growers are uneasy that they are being compelled to contribute towards the capital base of a grower owned competitor that could use this grower contributed levy to buy market share in Queensland against the growers' own organisation. This is a matter that is causing a good deal of concern and indeed a good deal of ill will between the Australian Wheat Board and the growers in my own State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is sad to see the decline in grower respect for the Australian Wheat Board over recent times. Once, growers proudly regarded the Australian Wheat Board as their own. Its strength was its close relationship with the growers. Sadly, we hear too often these days about growers who do not trust the AWB or regard it as not even acting in their own interests. They see it as a remote bureaucratic organisation in Ceres House in Melbourne with directors and management they do not know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it was a disaster for the Australian industry when it lost directly grower elected board members on the Australian Wheat Board. We were told we needed directors with special expertise, that growers were not competent to run their own organisation. But elected representatives met every day with farmers; the farmers felt they knew the people who ran their own organisation. They trusted them. They got direct market signals from the people who were directly in the marketplace and the board responded to their needs and to their wishes. That is lost when the directors are Sydney solicitors who will not go out into the dust and talk with growers about the problems that are occurring. I think that was a turning point for the Australian Wheat Board and one that is leading to their loss of esteem and their loss of respect in the community. I regard that as a most unfortunate development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wheat marketing is difficult. It is not sold only, as I mentioned earlier, on merit or quality these days but also, sadly, on who can provide the biggest subsidies. This Bill helps Australian growers a little in their fight against the treasuries of the rest of the world, but the Bill could have been so much better if the Government had been prepared to give the industry what it really needed and what it really wanted. </PARA>

It appears determined to ensure that legislation does not receive adequate examination and that the community is left in the dark about its impact upon their lives. This is not a unique problem; it is characteristic of the last 10 years of hard Labor. Between 1976 and 1982, when the coalition was in government, only 17 urgent Bills were presented to Parliament. Between 1983 and 1991, there were 401 urgent Bills. In 1991 alone, the Parliament was faced with 101 so-called urgent Bills.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 2) and Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 3), which we are debating tonight, are good examples of legislation by exhaustion and by ignorance. As late as last Friday, Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 3) did not even exist in printed form, and the explanatory memorandum contains errors of significance. No doubt there are more drafting errors yet to be found, which will then require further legislative change at substantial additional cost. The Parliament will no doubt be held responsible by the community, when in fact it is the gross incompetence of the Labor Government which is to blame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This cognate debate covers an extremely wide area of both administrative and policy reform in social security. Few areas of policy have been left untouched. It is what can best be described as the final meal before Armageddon. Many of the changes to the administration of pensions and benefits will be helpful to recipients and will remove a number of anomalies. Changes to the income and assets test will help people receiving Job Search allowance, Newstart allowance and sickness allowance. I must, however, draw attention to the amendments relating to the payment of social security benefits overseas, valued at some $200m per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is proposed in the legislation that recipients living outside Australia whose pensions or allowances are cancelled will have three months in which to appeal to reclaim payment. They will not have to return to Australia. While this may appear to be humane, I am concerned that it leaves open the possibility for people to continue to obtain benefits, even after death, in which case they will certainly not be entitled to them, and that the capacity to review payments in many isolated communities is obviously limited. This, therefore, is an area which must continue to be given the very highest and most constant review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition supports the proposal to make it a criminal offence under the Act for a person to access Social Security client information without lawful authority and disclose that information to unauthorised persons. The recent ICAC report in New South Wales demonstrates beyond doubt that there has been a trade in confidential information and, regrettably, much of it has come from within the Department of Social Security. Clearly, data protection is necessary to prevent people from misusing access to confidential information on fellow citizens, and clearly the punishment must fit the crime. The Secretary to the Department of Social Security, Derek Volker, stated in evidence before a parliamentary committee that it was a `nightmare' trying to safeguard the Department's extensive data banks. With over 22,000 staff, most of whom would have access to confidential information, the Department must set and apply the highest ethical and disciplinary standards without exception. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 3) also contains important amendments arising from the Budget. Because it is a Budget Bill, by convention the Opposition will not oppose its passage through the Parliament. This is not to imply that we support in all respects the contentious aspects of this legislation, which the Government has very cunningly combined with increases in both the pension and access to fringe benefits for all pensioners and part pensioners. The legislation increases the age pension along with benefits and allowances by the grand total of $1 per week. In addition, the March quarter CPI adjustment has been brought forward to January. Obviously, there is an election in the wind. This is being paraded to pensioners and beneficiaries as a clear indication of the Government's generosity, when clearly it is simply a crude pre-election bribe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation also puts into effect the Budget promise to extend access to fringe benefits to all part pensioners. I believe this is little more than a sleight of hand. While it is claimed that Commonwealth benefits can be provided at an additional cost of $2m this year and $9m next financial year, the Department has told me that the cost is $10m, another example of an inaccuracy in the explanatory memorandum. In addition, the Department said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will be aware that there has been strong opposition by States to this proposal owing to the substantial costs likely to be borne by State and local governments whose services are made available to those receiving Commonwealth and fringe benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>We were told in the Budget that negotiations would be conducted through the Commonwealth Grants Commission, but there was not a word in the second reading speech of the Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett) on this most important matter. I have little doubt that this commitment will join the dubious pre-election promise made in 1989 that no pensioner would pay tax by 1995, a commitment which could cost approximately $1 billion. The legislation also contains important changes in the administration of the rent assistance scheme and increases in mobility allowance for disability support pensioners. But the Government has not matched our commitment in Fightback to provide an additional disability allowance of $45 per fortnight for persons with disabilities in excess of 70 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important example of the sloppy drafting in this legislation relates to the waiting period for migrants to access benefits. The explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Permanent Australian residents and holders of designated temporary entry permits who arrive in Australia on or after 1 January 1993 will be subject to a 26 week waiting period before JSA or SA can be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reference to `permanent Australian residents' is causing considerable concern. The language must be clarified because they are not the words used in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the more contentious proposals in this legislation. These relate principally to the inclusion of unrealised capital gains on shares in the income test. This raises some important principles which need to be addressed, especially in the context of a so-called needs based welfare system. Under the Act income is defined as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An income amount earned, derived or received by the person for the person's own use or benefit.</PARA>
<PARA>This differs fundamentally from the conventional definition of income as contained in the tax Act and which most people understand. The definition was utilised by the Labor Party in 1988 when, again in a Budget Bill, unrealised capital gains from managed investments were included for the first time in the income test, obviously using the word `derived' as the basis of that decision. We warned the Government on that occasion that this would create a number of anomalies, as the provision was applied neither to privately held shares nor to land and property investments&mdash;only to managed investments&mdash;and that consequently it ran the risk of severely disadvantaging older pensioners who may have difficulty in managing their investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Events have shown that we were right. Now the Department is claiming that there is a loophole and that some pensioners have transferred their investments out of managed funds into private shares to deliberately avoid the new income test, despite the greater risk of those private investments. Unfortunately, the prolonged bear market over recent months, now into years, has significantly depreciated the value of most portfolios. Yet the Government's proposals, as we understand them, will not adequately take this into account. Valuations will ignore purchase values and cover only market variations over the previous 12 months and forward for the next 12 months, even though pensioners will be able to offset losses against gains on their portfolio. This is a useful reform to the 1988 arrangements which were negative only in the sense of where the values rose and there was no consideration for where values fell. On the other hand, of course, as is pointed out in the legislation, individual pensioners will have the opportunity at any time of their choice to seek a review if they believe the outcome has not been satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But is it any wonder that many pensioners fear the worst? Frankly, the Government has done little or nothing to reduce their concern. According to the Department of Social Security, there are 81,000 pensioners, 60,000 of whom will be affected. In fact, one of the estimates given to me by the Department says there are 84,000 pensioners; yet another example of dubious statistics. In addition, there will be 20,000 who may have a pension reduction of less than $10 a week; 1,500 may have a reduction of $100 or more a week; and 150 with shareholdings of $60,000 or more will be liable to have their part pensions cancelled unless they fundamentally change the structure of their holdings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Press reports in recent days have suggested that the average pensioner will in fact lose up to $700 per year of pension. While this is probably a distortion, nevertheless it clearly demonstrates why there is major public concern over this issue. If a pensioner, for example, has a mixed portfolio of $20,000, and the average is $15,000, returning a fully franked dividend of $1,000, and an unrealised capital gain of $2,000, at present the dividend of $1,000 is counted under the income test, reducing the pension by $500 at the rate of 50c in the dollar. As a result of these proposed amendments, the pensioner's unrealised capital gain of $2,000 will cost that pensioner a further loss of $1,000 on his or her pension. The net overall effect, counting dividend and capital gain, is a net loss of $1,500 and clearly a severe drop in living standards. Alternatively, to protect the pension, the pensioner could realise the capital gain, as the Government obviously wishes, pay his capital gains tax plus the 50c in the dollar withdrawal rate on the pension, resulting in an effective marginal rate of tax of approximately 66c in the dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example of distortion is the situation where a pensioner bought BHP shares, say, 12 months ago. Those shares have now declined in value by 27 per cent. But under this legislation the pensioner would not receive a reduction in pension. However, if the shares increased in value by, say, 10 per cent on the original price over the next 12 months, the pension will be reduced, but the shares are still 17 per cent down in price from when they were first bought. One can only conclude that this was a very dubious investment which the Government's differential policy encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only way to avoid assessment of unrealised capital gains will be to invest in property to circumvent the income test. I ask the Minister: is this what the Government is trying to encourage? Surely not. Surely it should be encouraging pensioners to maximise their own income in secure investments and to rely less on welfare support if it truly believes in an equitable needs-based welfare system. Greater self-reliance includes investing in Australia to create more wealth and more jobs for all of us, and traditionally Australia's pensioners have been major savers, although this has changed over recent years due to the severe decline in dividends, and their capacity to save. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the differential treatment of pensioners' assets has clearly distorted their investment decisions since 1988 and has encouraged the taking of risks, contributing significantly to the one-third increase in the number of people who are now qualifying for the pension over recent months. Pensioners with some assets are seriously concerned at what they see as a gross inequity which is not applied to any other section of the community. Who else, they ask, is expected to lose 66c in every dollar earned? This, incidentally, does not include brokerage fees, other charges, or stamp duties. These transaction costs are important and I had hoped that the Government would be moving an amendment to this legislation to at least discount those additional costs, but apparently that is not to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a growing perception among retirees and pensioners that this Government, with its voracious appetite for revenue, is working towards introducing a wealth tax. The Minister tonight has the opportunity in this debate to deny this serious charge and to explain the Government's position on this important matter. Pensioners are finding the current retirement income policy extremely confusing and subject to constant change. It is obvious that retired Australians have long since lost confidence in the application of the existing assets test. This test was last reviewed in 1986 when average returns were estimated to be approximately 10 per cent; now they are barely half that. Today they are well below the appropriate figure and retirees believe the test is therefore unduly discriminatory. Their assets often earn well below the allowable income limits yet they are locked out of the pension by the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Self-funded retirees now need $377,700 in earning assets to obtain enough money at a deemed rate of 6 per cent to equal the married pension rate after the massive commercial failures of the 1980s, which were the ultimate outcome of the failures of this Government's economic policies. Among the great losers were not just the Skases or the Bonds of this world: there were hundreds of thousands of retired Australians who thought they were making sound investments in accordance with government policies and government wishes, and who, ultimately, lost most of their retirement income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to urge the Minister to initiate a major review of the assets test to ensure that it is fair and will receive the support of all retired Australians, especially those who throughout their lives have done their best to maintain their independence in retirement but because of circumstances beyond their control and because of the failure of government policy now find themselves in serious financial difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one beneficial aspect of this legislation and it is this: these provisions will not come into effect until September next year, obviously well after the election. The decision was taken by the Government to overcome the argument, which was strongly raised in 1988, and with success, that the legislation was retrospective. Nevertheless, that gives both the Government and of course the new government after the next Federal election the opportunity to review these areas of policy because it is important that Australians be given the opportunity to retire with confidence and with a sense of security. If social justice means anything to this Labor Party, it is time it applied it to retired Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), as usual, whinges about the Bills that are before the House. He did not acknowledge that the basis of both these Bills&mdash;the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3)&mdash;is the good that we are doing for people in the community who need to access the social security system. We know that the Opposition has a spite on the social security system. We know it wants to do such things as decimate the staff, privatise social workers, knock billions off the social security bill, and knock a lot of money off people who need it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite talk continually about, and shed crocodile tears for, self-funded retirees and so on. The honourable member spoke a lot about them. Over the last couple of months, I have addressed a number of self-funded retiree organisations. Admittedly they are concerned because at the moment interest rates are very low. But these retirees were not complaining when interest rates were high and young people&mdash;for instance, those with mortgages and children to bring up&mdash;were probably earning no more than the cut-off point before a person is not entitled to $1 of pension. Unfortunately, in the economic cycle, the wheel turns. Sometimes one section of the community is advantaged and sometimes another section is advantaged. Unfortunately, at the moment, in many respects, self-funded retirees are the ones being disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing is that, when it is explained to them that a couple can earn over $30,000 a year before they are not entitled to $1 of pension, and that a single person can earn about $18,000 before not being entitled to $1 of pension, and when they understand that the living standards of all Australians because of the economic circumstances have been somewhat lowered, they are prepared to say, `Well it is our turn at the moment to cop a little bit of medicine'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, I have been out there. Those opposite should go and speak to them. I speak to them all the time and I have found that they understand enough to know that this is probably something that is happening only now and that things will improve. It would be great to think that interest rates will be at this rate for ever and a day, but we all know that economic cycles are such that that may well not be the case. These people understand that. In the main these people own their own homes, do not have any debts and are earning more than are some people with families, with children to support and school fees and mortgages to pay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, whilst those opposite may say that there is a constituency out there that is very dirty about this, I can assure them that, while some people do feel that way, most of them are retired executives&mdash;people who had very high superannuation payouts. I go to Noosa on the north coast and to the south coast of Queensland, and a very large proportion of such people there are fairly well off. They are doing it tough at the moment compared with the standard of living that they have been used to&mdash;but a lot of people in the community are doing it tough at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to support the social security legislation Bills. I want primarily to talk about the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) as there are many good and positive aspects of the Bill that will benefit a wide cross-section of the community. They represent the Government's determination to continue reform despite the present difficult economic circumstances. The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) gives effect to a number of changes to the social security system which, given the limited time that I have to discuss such matters, can be canvassed elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bradfield talked about the extension of fringe benefits and then complained about the fact that the States may well have to pay a lot of extra money. Of course he is aware that there have been negotiations with the States about the extension of fringe benefits. We have actually done something about it. In so far as the Commonwealth can do something about it, we have done it. We have extended them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I go around the country and speak to pensioners I find, as I am sure do all honourable members, that a very high value is placed on fringe benefits. It is true that some States are pretty lousy in providing them. The Labor States, Queensland and Western Australia, have seniors cards. They provide, without any problems, a lot of good concessions to senior citizens. A lot of people complain to me, saying, `Why is it, Mr Sciacca, that here in Queensland we get concessions for transport and so forth, yet when we go to New South Wales we cannot get as good a deal?'. I say to them, `That is because there is a Liberal government down there; when there was a Labor government, the concessions were better'. If the States have to find a bit of extra cash until such time as they can come to a deal with us, it is bad luck, because a lot of the State governments are already providing concessions. I cannot see how anyone can be critical of this Government simply because we are trying again to help those people who need our help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bradfield had a lot to say about the changes relating to share income. The change to the income test treatment of shares is fair. It improves the equity of the social security system. Pensioners with shares are not being singled out; in fact the opposite is true. For a number of years shares have been treated concessionally relative to other investments. This measure fixes that. The change brings the treatment of shares into line with the treatment of most other types of investment. There is no reason why investors in equity trusts, who invest in shares indirectly, should be treated differently from pensioners who invest in shares directly through the share market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put criticism of this change in context, it is part of a package of changes to the treatment of investments that simplify the system, improve equity and provide benefits to pensioners and beneficiaries. As I have said, particularly important is the extension to all pensioners of eligibility for fringe benefits. Over 50 per cent of people affected by the share measures will benefit from the extension of fringe benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fringe benefits are currently available to pensioners who satisfy the fringe benefits income and assets tests. Under this Bill they will be extended to all pensioners regardless of their income and assets level. Nearly 400,000 social security and veteran pensioners and social security allowees will benefit from this change. Pensioners with shares also benefit from an accompanying measure to allow losses to be offset against gains. The current rules take no account of the losses experienced by investors in shares, with the result that income from dividends is assessed even when this is more than offset by a decline in the value of the shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pensioners will also benefit from the bringing forward of the pension indexation date from 20 March to 28 January 1993, together with a real increase in the pension of $2 per fortnight. This will mean a total increase of $6 in the fortnightly maximum rate of pension for singles and $10 for couples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested that it is unfair to assess unrealised capital gains. However, it is a simple matter for share investors to sell some or all of their shares if they need to access gains for current needs. The decision to sell or retain the growth is clearly a matter of personal choice. But there is no reason why taxpayers should support those people if they choose not to utilise that growth for current needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some commentators say that the change has implications for taxation treatment of capital gains. This is not so. The taxation and social security systems are separate and serve different purposes. Pensioners will continue to face the same tax assessments as other share investors. The change also enhances the operation of the social security means test by ensuring that a rigorous approach is taken to assessing the capacity of pensioners to contribute to their own financial support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of pensioner organisations, such as the Combined Pensioners Association and the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, have also recognised arguments for taking action in this area. In fact, a respected independent commentator, Daryl Dixon, who sticks it into the Government from time to time, has supported the measure as being equitable and sensible. Only 5 per cent of all social security pensioners will be affected, and those will mainly be people with large shareholdings. Pensioners with a small number of shares and no other income are unlikely to be affected, and the changes will not take effect until 20 September 1993, some 11 months away. This gives pensioners plenty of time to adjust their affairs if they so wish. People are not locked into shares; they can liquidate them relatively easily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change will apply to shares held on and after 20 September 1993. If the shares are sold before 20 September, the proceeds will not be taken into account under the income test. In addition, there is provision in the Bill for costs such as brokerage, which was mentioned by the honourable member for Bradfield, to be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the guillotine, I will finish by saying that every time we do something positive in the area of social security we get criticised by the Opposition; it does not matter what we do. If those opposite were to get into government, they would put on pensioners the impost of extra taxation. We are about trying to do something for those people who, for whatever reason, have to access the social security system. The measures in these Bills are equitable. They treat pensioners as far as possible in an equitable way and in the same way as they treat people who make money from other investments. I have much pleasure in supporting the Bills. </PARA>

We are talking here about almost one million retired people in this country. Tonight we have had revealed again, clearly and unashamedly, the naked truth of this Government's contempt&mdash;outright contempt&mdash;for this large section of the Australian population. I would have thought that the honourable member for Bowman, having listened to the concerns of those people, as he has, would have changed his attitude.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tell honourable members what the Treasurer said then, which the honourable member for Bowman has repeated tonight. He said that they lived well under high interest rates and they could cop it sweet under low interest rates. That is what the Treasurer said then.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that many self-funded retirees in this country are now hurting very much. The assets test, because of changed returns on investments&mdash;and that is clear to anybody&mdash;has meant that they are prevented from accessing social security. I believe that the Government's real agenda in respect of self-funded retirees has now become clear. For some time I grappled with this because I wondered whether it could be true. But I believe it is now quite clear that the Government's real agenda in respect of self-funded retirees is to take their savings and their assets from them; in other words, to say to them, `The only way you will live and survive in this new low interest rate era that we have upon us'&mdash;which I admit advantages 95 per cent of the population&mdash;`is to sell off your assets or spend your savings. We do not want you to have that wealth that you saved for and accumulated through hard work all your lives; we do not want you to be able to hand that on to your children, as that offends our principles of egalitarianism, social equality and all those things.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make the point very clearly that the people we are talking about have done the right thing: they have saved for their retirement. Some of them have been fortunate to be able to do so, and I am not putting down others who have not been able to. But these people have saved for their retirement. They have set up their retirement, they have invested their money, they have taken account of the interest rate situation at the time they invested, and they have structured their affairs so that they could live off their savings and accumulated wealth. Now the Government wants to put the boot into them when they are down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make one point clear to the honourable member for Bowman. I am talking about the many self-funded retirees at the low end. We are not talking about those at the wealthy end; they do not have a problem. Their incomes have been reduced by 30, 40 or 50 per cent as well, but they are still doing well. Some of those people are in my electorate. But I am talking about those people at the low end who have assets but are now living on very low incomes. They are living on peanuts. Of course, they do not get any of the benefits received by those on social security. So we have a whole new class of poor people in this country. They are the ones who have been spoken of tonight as though they have done something wrong, whereas we believe they have done something right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that the Opposition recognises that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned with some aspects of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3). Sometimes when one reads the second reading speeches of Ministers in these debates, one really wonders whether they are living in the same world. The Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett) says that the Bill introduces `substantial enhancements to the social security system announced in the Budget'. I would have thought that added a whole new meaning to the word `enhancement'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, of course, what the Government is about in this legislation&mdash;and I will refer to some of the invidious aspects in a moment&mdash;is saving money. It is about saving money at the expense of those many pensioners who are not by any means amongst the better off people in our community but are already struggling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly concerned&mdash;and the Minister might address this issue&mdash;with the treatment of managed investments, listed shares and other securities. These changes have been described by the Government as `fairer'. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age Pension News</EMPHASIS>, which is the Government's propaganda vehicle, if you like, for DSS people, ran an article headed `Fairer treatment of shares'. My office was inundated with telephone calls and letters from pensioners about this particular article. They rightly pointed out that this was not fairer treatment of shares in any respect at all. If it was, I might say, it adds a whole new meaning to the word `fairer'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that what we have in this so-called fair treatment of shares is a de facto wealth tax. That does not surprise me either, because it is probably part of this Government's agenda one way or another. But who is affected by this obnoxious treatment of share values? It is affecting pensioners. This is aimed at the poor people, the less well-off people in our community, and I just cannot support that. I will not vote for this because I believe it discriminates against pensioners in an unprecedented way. The Minister in his second reading speech said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The income test will take account of growth on the managed investments only for the period during which the investor was a social security client.</PARA>
<PARA>That is understandable. But the matter I am most concerned about is his statement that `from September 1993, when the managed investment rules are extended to listed shares and other listed securities, we will treat'&mdash;and I am paraphrasing here&mdash;`increases in the value of shares and capital gains on shares', which is what we are effectively talking about, `as income for the purposes of the income test'. So the Government's proposal for the treatment of shares and share portfolios&mdash;and we are not talking about big portfolios of shares in the hands of social security pensioners&mdash;is to treat unrealised capital gains as income for the purposes of the income test. That is described by the Government as fairer treatment!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me pose a question to the Minister on behalf of my constituents who contacted me about this. How do they live on the lower social security benefit they receive as a result of this fair treatment? When they go to buy their groceries at the end of the week and their pension has been reduced by $4, $5, $10 or $15&mdash;which is not a lot to us but is a lot to my mother, who is a pensioner&mdash;do they take their share scrips, their share certificates, to the supermarket and say, `I am sorry, Mr Supermarket Owner, I haven't got enough cash this week, but my shares have gone up in value so I will give you a bit of this. Perhaps I can pay you back when I sell my shares or when my estate sells my shares.'? It is clearly discriminatory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem appears to be that the definition of income in the Social Security Act is different from the definition in the taxation regime. But that does not justify this treatment. It may explain it in some convoluted way, but it certainly does not justify it. The Government argues that this is consistent treatment. Once again, that may explain the treatment, but it does not justify it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the merit in consistency when it creates this clearly unsatisfactory situation for pensioners?

What do they live on after September 1993? In that sense, the whole exercise is probably academic anyway because, as the Minister has foreshadowed, with a new approach to income and assets testing, there may be a new and better approach to this matter. The Minister had better explain it; I might be missing the point and so might the pensioners who are out there listening to this debate. Come September 1993 or some time after, we can assume that those pensioners stand to lose their pensions as a result of an unrealised paper capital gain which will suddenly be taken by this Government to be income when it is not.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pose another question. We are told the fact that this will not occur until September 1993 gives pensioners time to adjust. What does that mean? It seems to me that it says to pensioners, `There is time to sell your shares'. What other option do they have? We are told that the equity in this situation is that they will get the benefit of a decrease in the value of their share portfolios. That is an interesting comment. At the moment the share market is at a fairly low point and we do not expect that it will go much lower. So shares will go up rather than down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any case, this is a serious interruption to the way in which pensioners may want to order their affairs. What does the Minister mean by `time to adjust'? He really means `time to divest yourself of your shares'. Does this mean that no pensioner in this country with a small share portfolio will be secure? What about a hobby share portfolio? That is all it is for some of these people; they take an interest in the stock market and they are entitled to do that. But after September 1993 they will no longer be able to risk having a share portfolio. I assume that that is the Government's intention and that is why it is giving pensioners time to adjust their affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken about this matter because I believe very strongly that this is not fair treatment of pensioners. I have not heard the honourable member for Bowman argue that it is.

The honourable member for McPherson represents an electorate which comprises a very large number of retired people. His electorate, like my own, is a retirement area. Very large numbers of people from Sydney have retired to my electorate.

In fact, people are often surprised by the high percentage of pensioners who receive the full pension because their incomes are so low. I imagine that if I compared my electorate with that of the honourable member for McPherson we would probably find that because his electorate is more middle class than mine more pensioners in his electorate would be affected by the income test. More pensioners in his electorate would have their pensions reduced under the terms of the income test. If we compared the electorates of the honourable member for McPherson and the shadow Minister for social security, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), we would find that even fewer pensioners in his electorate would receive the full pension because of the fairness of the income test.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member interjects to agree that that is a fair and proper thing. The income test works. But the difficulty is that in the past income was defined only as interest on money in bank accounts, accounts with credit unions and so on. Many people sought to avoid the income test by arranging their investment portfolios in such a manner as to enable them to receive the full pension, while having not only substantial assets which could be realised at a time and place to suit them, but also substantial income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely the honourable member for McPherson would agree that the Government was right several years ago to ensure that people could not arrange their finances in the form of property trusts or other mechanisms through an insurance company, building society or investment group in order to avoid the income test. It is not fair to the pensioners in the honourable member's electorate who have only a few thousand dollars in the bank and who may not be receiving the full pension&mdash;although I think they would have to have quite a bit more than a few thousand dollars; but perhaps they would have enough interest earnings on their bank accounts to see their pensions reduced. It would be unfair to penalise those pensioners while allowing pensioners with very substantial assets to arrange their finances in such a way that they would still receive the full pension. Surely the honourable member would agree that the Government was right to take action on this matter. </PARA>

He is certainly not advocating a return to the old rules because he knows they were unfair. In the same way, if we make the comparison with an investment in a share portfolio we can see that it is unfair to the pensioners who are penalised when they earn interest on a bank account if we allow pensioners or retirees who have invested their retirement incomes in shares to escape the operation of the income test.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people will say, `Well, shares are different. You put several hundred thousand dollars into BHP shares and you don't earn any income on the capital gain on those shares until you sell the shares'. It is very clear that any time people want to realise that income they can sell the shares. There is no difference between a $200,000 investment in BHP shares and a $200,000 investment with the Commonwealth Bank in a bank account. We would be penalising the vast majority of pensioners who do not have access to all of these investment portfolio schemes which try to avoid the income test if we were to follow the view of the honourable member for McPherson. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member asks what they will live on. It is not that hard to sell some of the $200,000 worth of BHP shares. If the honourable member sees that there is a difficulty with these pensioners, I suggest that the pensioners examine closely the views put forward by the honourable member for McPherson. The honourable member might claim that he is speaking for them at the expense of the other pensioners who are currently caught by the income test, but perhaps he has not explained to them how they will be affected by the Opposition's plans for a 15 per cent consumption tax on all goods and services, food and vegetables, and electricity and telephone accounts. It is very clear that those people may not receive compensation, because the Opposition says that the compensation package is arranged in such a way that the least number of people will receive compensation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic principle here is that whether people's money is in bank accounts, managed investments or share portfolios, their ability to support themselves should be compared in an equal manner so that all pensioners are treated fairly. The vast majority of pensioners whose entire incomes are put into bank accounts, credit unions or building societies should not be treated any worse than those people who have accountants and others to arrange their portfolios or investments in a special way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important that that principle of equity and fairness is applied across the board, so that we can ensure that pensions are treated in a proper manner. For the information of the honourable member for McPherson, I point out that I think it is very important that the attempts of this Government to ensure that the rules are fair and equitable to everyone are supported. On a number of occasions, when the Labor Government has sought to improve the fairness of the system, unfortunately the Opposition has sought to score a few cheap political points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government brought in the assets test, despite much political pain. People like the former member for Denison, Mr Hodgman, were running around saying that the gold in pensioners' teeth would be assessed as an asset. When we tightened up the rules on investment trusts, the honourable member for Bradfield, representing the electorate with the highest income level anywhere Australia, was saying that this was a terrible thing. In the measure which is currently before the House we are ensuring that all people are treated fairly and equitably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there were a Liberal Government in office today, I know that it would be seeking to ensure that people were not allowed to escape the proper incomes and assets tests, because honourable members opposite in their heart of hearts know that it is wrong to let some people receive a full pension when they have more means than those who are presently affected by the current incomes test that works on interest income. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I will respond briefly to some of the remarks made by honourable members opposite. I have to say that they seemed to focus on a single issue in the Bill. Let me deal with the other issues first. I did think it was a bit hard of the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) to be critical of the expedition with which the Government has tried to deal with this Bill. The Bill was brought on very quickly partly to suit his own needs, for perfectly understandable reasons. I think that in response, he was a bit uncharitable to the Government in that point of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we are not parading around the country the generosity of the changes we are making in the pension increases in January. We are simply saying that we recognise that they are a modest response, but they are essentially a response so that the Government's commitment to maintain the pension at above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings is maintained. It was thought necessary to make these modest adjustments to the pension in January to ensure that that promise, made at the time this Government was originally elected, was maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of the clarification of permanent Australian residence, let me say that although the Bill does not quite say what I think the honourable member for Bradfield required, it does, I think, achieve his objective. The Bill says that the waiting period starts on the day on which the persons's permanent entry permit comes into force and lasts for 26 weeks. That is, irregardless of other reasons or other temporary permits, it is the permanent entry permit which is the date for the application of those restrictions in relation to that benefit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quite confident that that objective is achieved. I turn to the one point raised by the honourable member for McPherson outside the issue of self-funded retirees and share issues. He made a sarcastic remark about enhancements in this Bill. I simply have to say that if his view is that this Bill does not contain enhancements, then he has neither read my second reading speech, nor read the Bill itself. If one looks through the Bill one finds that it contains significant enhancements for pensioners. I have already referred to the increase in the pension. In addition to that, of course, there is the intention to extend the fringe benefit to all part-pensioners, so that extends to all  with any form of pension. I would have thought that that is an enhancement which even many of his constituents would appreciate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a complete revision and extension of the support for carers and, again, in his own constituency there are quite a number of people who benefit from the carers pension and the extensions we have added to that. We have continued with the disability reform program here, so that there is an increase to the mobility allowance for people with disabilities. An education entry allowance is introduced. There is an increase in the employment entry allowance. The Bill is replete with enhancements and I think that the honourable member for McPherson could well acknowledge that.

Given the criticism of guillotine, the House has been able to deal with this Bill and also give the Minister a brief opportunity to respond to the remarks made. I think that my colleague, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), gave a very clear explanation of the equity of the proposals. I read what the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) said when we first began the process of treating capital accrual in these matters as income.

<PARA>This, of course, is what we have tried to do in this Bill. Having applied the principle of treating a capital accrual as income in a number of other investments, then it would be discriminatory, it would be unfair, if we did not include this remaining major element&mdash;the shares&mdash;in it as, of course, the honourable member for Bradfield was arguing in 1988.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was argued that, in a sense, we should not do these sorts of things because these pensioners were building up shares and things like that to pass on to their children. The difficulty I have with that proposal from the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) is that while I certainly support people building up resources to pass on to their children, I do not believe that the rest of the Australian taxpayers should fund those proposals. That is my real difficulty with the proposition from the honourable member for McPherson. If these accruing capital gains are not utilised by the pensioner, but simply passed on then, of course, it is pension payments by the rest of the Australian population that sustains those capital gains. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first Bill being debated cognately is the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1992. It sets out to increase the low income thresholds below which people are not required to pay the levy, as announced in the 1992-93 Budget. The Bill intends that individuals with taxable incomes of up to $11,887 and married couples and sole parents with family incomes of up to $20,070 will not be required to pay the levy. As well, the income threshold is increased by a further $2,100 for each dependent child or student.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shading-in provisions are also amended to reduce the levy where taxable income exceeds $11,887 but is less than $12,680. This was not the only Budget measure affecting the Medicare levy. The remaining Medicare levy is an increase in the rate of the Medicare levy by 0.15 per cent to 1.4 per cent from 1 July 1993. The latter impost is expected to raise an additional $300m in 1993-94; that is, $300m in addition to $2.5 billion the levy is expected to raise in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Medicare levy is one of the more misrepresented of the Labor Party's range of taxes. It fosters a degree of fiscal illusion, whereby people are led mistakenly to believe that they receive subsidised health care in return for what looks like a small levy on their income. In reality, the Medicare levy does not even begin to cover the costs of Medicare, and the difference is made up with other tax collections through the remainder of the tax system. The Medicare levy pays for barely one-eighth of the combined health expenditure of the Commonwealth, State and local governments. The Medicare levy does not even pay for the Labor Party's medical benefits payments, much less all the other categories of health expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990-91 the revenue Labor collected by way of the Medicare levy represented less than 60 per cent of Commonwealth medical benefits payments and only 27 per cent of Commonwealth payments for all medical and hospital services, not to mention the health services provided by the other levels of government. The reality is that the Medicare levy is just a smack in the teeth for taxpayers, which bears no relation whatsoever to the funding of the nation's health system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Labor were to inject some honesty into the Medicare levy and set it at a rate that reflected the real costs of Medicare, while reducing other taxes by a similar amount, then we would need a levy of around 5 per cent just to cover the Commonwealth's health expenditures. In order to fund approximately $20 billion in total expenditure by governments on health in Australia each year, it would need a Medicare levy approaching 10 per cent. Australians would then appreciate the true costs of our grossly expensive health system and take an appropriately dim view of Medicare and the income tax burden it thrusts upon them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in the Medicare levy in Labor's Budget is just another tax hike that will be levied at a flat rate across all incomes, excluding only those low income earners exempted by the provisions of this Bill. Even the low income exemption still leaves large numbers of low income earners having to foot the Medicare levy on top of their income tax each year. Labor is not only guilty of misrepresenting the costs of Medicare to taxpayers, it is also guilty of a serious distortion in what it says about the impact of Medicare levy on Defence Force personnel under a coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Labor's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Poles Apart</EMPHASIS> document, the Government claims that Defence Force personnel earning more than $45,000 would have to take out private health insurance or pay a surcharge on the Medicare levy. Like a lot of other material in that document, that is completely untrue. The coalition has clearly stated that Defence Force personnel will be exempt from any Medicare levy surcharge, if they are currently exempt from the Medicare levy. Defence personnel with dependants who now have a pro rata liability for Labor's Medicare levy will also have a pro rata liability for the surcharge, but only if their income exceeds $50,000 and if they have failed to take out private health insurance, which under the coalition will be rewarded with a generous tax credit. Labor's claims about the Medicare levy and Defence Force personnel are just another example of the outright lies and misrepresentations contained in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Poles Apart</EMPHASIS> document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other two Bills before the House are the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1992 and the Income Tax (Dividends and Interest Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 1992. The latter Bill facilitates measures in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) to introduce a new withholding tax of 30 per cent on royalties paid to non-residents. Where the recipient of such royalty payments is resident in a country with which Australia has a double taxation agreement, the rate of withholding tax will be limited to that specified in the agreement, which is generally 10 per cent. The new arrangements will apply to royalties paid or credited from the commencement of the recipient's 1993-94 income year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has a number of serious reservations about these provisions. The effect of the Bill will be that Australians will have to pay at least 30 per cent more in order to utilise technology and other products on which royalties are payable. This situation comes about because licensing agreements for such products invariably contain a `gross-up' clause whereby Australian taxpayers are required to increase the gross payment made to a non-resident by the amount of any tax withheld to allow the non-resident the same rate of return that would have been obtainable if no tax had been withheld. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These clauses can result in increased cost to Australians well in excess of the actual withholding tax rate imposed by these Bills. The withholding tax measure is said to be essentially an anti-avoidance provision, but it will lead to a significant increase in costs to Australian businesses seeking to take advantage of the best technology and new products from around the world. This is a measure which therefore discourages Australian business from pursuing world best practice and adopting new technology with which to improve their productivity and efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax is also at odds with international practice and an OECD model tax treaty that Australia has signed just this year, albeit with some reservations. The OECD model tax treaty provides for a nil rate of withholding tax from royalty payments. While many OECD countries nevertheless impose royalty withholding taxes, it is far less common for them to do so on royalty payments to residents of other OECD countries. For example, the United Kingdom does not impose such a tax on royalty payments to, amongst others, citizens of the United States, France and Germany.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More seriously, however, this Bill ignores the importance to Australia of the free flow of technology into this country if we are to increase our overall level of productiveness and international competitiveness. This claimed anti-avoidance measure threatens not only to increase costs to Australians but also to put us out of step with the rest of the world. At the very least, transitional rules should be introduced to lessen the impact of this Bill. Such transitional provisions would exclude royalty agreements and other agreements entered into prior to 1 July 1993 to ensure that they are quarantined from the effects of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although said to be primarily an anti-avoidance measure, Labor is still trying to sell it with the argument that it will be of benefit to taxpayers. While it is true that it will be possible to introduce simplified administrative arrangements as a result of the introduction of this withholding tax, these arrangements will be of benefit primarily to the Australian Taxation Office rather than to taxpayers. It is typical of the ATO's approach to tax law simplification that it seeks to simplify the tax law for its own purposes but not for taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) is an omnibus Bill which implements a wide range of measures. These amendments concern environmental protection expenditure, research and development tax concessions, horse breeding stock, the deductibility of interest for borrowings to fund superannuation contributions, zone rebates, losses on disposal of securities, the provisional tax uplift factor, capital gains tax and a number of other areas. The legislation provides for the provisional tax uplift factor for 1992-93 to be reduced from 10 per cent to 8 per cent. The Bill also increases the margin of error in estimating taxable income when varying provisional tax from 10 to 15 per cent. While this will provide some provisional tax relief, it is interesting that this measure will apply only for the year 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The uplift factor will be raised again to 10 per cent in 1993-94, which strongly suggests that Labor anticipates inflation and interest rates to increase in the interim, which is not the official line coming from it either in its official projections or in its rhetoric. It is just possible that this measure has let the cat out of the bag and that a Labor government's real inflation rate and interest rate forecasts for the years ahead are very much understated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, there is a strong argument to say that the reduction in the uplift factor should have been much greater than 2 per cent, given the level of inflation and interest rates prevailing at present. It would be even more desirable to link the uplift factor with one of the money market indicator rates to ensure that the uplift factor is permanently in line with economic conditions rather than having to be adjusted after the event via legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for a deduction to be made available for environmental protection expenditure incurred by business on or after 19 August 1992 for the year in which it is incurred. This expenditure is any expenditure incurred for the sole or dominant purpose of preventing, countering or rectifying pollution, or treating, cleaning up, storing or removing waste. The waste or pollution must be the result of the taxpayers' income producing activities and where the waste or pollution is present on the site of the taxpayers' income producing activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The environmental protection expenditure provisions of this Bill are to be welcomed, although there are some notable omissions in this context. Expenditure on capital equipment, plant and buildings for environmental purposes cannot be written off in the year that it is incurred; it can only be depreciated. The sole or dominant purpose test imposed on environmental expenditure by this Bill is likely to be a difficult one to meet, especially when the environmental expenditures arguably have more than one purpose, which one would expect to be a fairly common occurrence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Institute of Australia has argued that this is an inappropriate test for environmental expenditure and the coalition is inclined to support that view. Moreover, some environmental expenditures will continue to be non-deductible, such as clean-up costs at a site where a business closes down completely and so is no longer involved in income producing activities. The deductibility made available for environmental expenditure under this Bill is thus very much incomplete and has a ring of tokenism about it. This is also true of provisions in the Bill for the deductibility of gifts to the gift funds of environmental organisations. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Environmental groups in Australia are already beholden to Labor for the generous funding it provides for several of them. Now they are to be made even more beholden to Labor through these proposed tax expenditures which will guarantee that these organisations remain, effectively, arms of the Government. The fact is that many of the environment's so-called spokesmen in Australia are virtually on the payroll of Labor, and it is conceivable that this does affect the way that they choose to approach environmental issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there is a role for tax expenditures in promoting charitable and other worthy goals, the organisations that will benefit from these provisions are little more than pseudo-political parties with political objectives operating in an entirely political context. Essentially, they are not about promoting the environment but about promoting their own political interests within the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These provisions have nothing in common with those relating to gifts to the Coral Sea Commemorative Council, which is a truly worthwhile purpose. It is a measure of Labor's priorities that whereas the provisions relating to the gifts to environmental organisations are open-ended, the deductibility of gifts to the Coral Sea Commemorative Council is limited to donations made between 26 November 1991 and 30 June 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions in this Bill are nothing but a sop to the various Green groups to secure support at the next election. These groups do not even have to support Labor at the next election to earn their keep. All they need to do is attack the coalition as they have done in past elections and their paymasters will be very happy indeed. The Bill also implements Budget measures to increase the fixed dollar amounts of the zone and related rebates by 25 per cent from 1 January 1994. </PARA>

This is a direct rip-off of the coalition's Fightback proposals and another case of imitation being the sincerest form of flattery, as we saw with the abolition of the coal export duty and a number of other measures. It should be remembered, however, that whereas the Government will be increasing zone rebates in a manner similar to that proposed by the coalition, it will not be adopting a number of the coalition's tax reform proposals that will be of distinct benefit to Australians living in remote areas. These include the abolition of fuel excise and wholesale sales tax, which will substantially reduce the costs of freight to people living in remote areas as well as in rural and regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment on a number of Bills, particularly the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) as it relates to tax zone rebates. Before I do that, I will make a few comments on a number of things the previous speaker, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), had to say about health care. I was very interested to hear his remarks on the Medicare levy. It would appear to me that, in no uncertain terms, he is opposed to the current policy on Medicare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would know, about 70 per cent of all Australians fully support Medicare. The reason they fully support Medicare is that it is a universal health system that actually works. It is fair to say that Medicare has successfully delivered universal health care to everybody in this country, while keeping costs to around 8 per cent of GDP. It is a universal health care system that Australians will not tolerate being tampered with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Curtin should realise that the dismantling of Medicare is folly. The Opposition should take heed from the US experience: about 30 to 40 million Americans are not covered by any health insurance. I had the privilege of being in America in about March of this year. Even at that stage it was obvious that one of the big political issues in that country was going to be the lack of universal health care. As I said, 30 to 40 million Americans were not covered by any sort of health care. Governor Bill Clinton made it quite clear that he intended to introduce a universal health care system for Americans. I have no doubt that that was a major factor in his landslide victory in the United States of America only a very short time ago. As I said previously, a system such as Medicare simply cannot be tampered with, as it works and works very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking about the Opposition's policy in relation to health care&mdash;this is certainly relevant to this debate, particularly in light of the comment made by the previous speaker&mdash;it is very important to realise that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has said quite categorically that he would cut about $1.3 billion from public hospital funding. On the other hand, it seems that he would give what I would describe as a real gift, approximately $1.4 billion, to private health insurance companies. He would also abolish gap insurance, which I have absolutely no doubt would skyrocket insurance costs to such an extent that the whole health care system of this country would break down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, from my point of view, I am extremely concerned about the Opposition's policy on health care as it relates to rural areas. Under the Leader of the Opposition, pensioners apparently would still have access to bulkbilling. However, the peak pensioner group, the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, believes that the coalition's policy provides incentives for doctors who refuse to bulkbill. Under the coalition's health care policy, while a doctor may receive the AMA schedule fee of $31 for every non-pensioner patient, pensioner patients would only return to that doctor about $19.98 a visit or 85 per cent of the Medicare schedule fee. Very few doctors bulkbill in rural areas, which means that the pensioner will initially have to pay the up-front fee of some $31. That will have an adverse impact on pensioners, particularly those who live in rural and remote parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really want to talk about tax zone rebates. One of these Bills&mdash;the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1992&mdash;will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects. While a number of worthwhile initiatives have been announced in the Bills that we are dealing with tonight, as far as I am concerned one of the most important initiatives deals with tax zone rebates, which is of particular importance to people living in my vast electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was announced in the August Budget that there would be an increase to the fixed dollar amounts in the tax and related rebates by 25 per cent from 1 January next year. This is very welcome news to the residents of my electorate in Kennedy and to all those Australians dealing with the extremes of temperature and isolation that make life in rural and remote parts of Australia very challenging, to say the least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been pushing for an increase in the tax zone rebates since my election in March 1990. In the first months after my election I attended a number of public meetings across western Queensland. One of the questions that I was inevitably asked by constituents was: when will we get an increase in the tax zone rebate? I was still hearing that same question in July of this year, when the Prime Minister's women's task force visited Mount Isa and Atherton in my electorate. It is fair to say that this view has been consistently expressed by people throughout my electorate over time. The view is that those tax zone rebates should be increased to compensate rural families for the higher costs of most goods that they have to purchase due to freight charges, and also in recognition of the economic contribution of remote Australia to the national well-being of this country. It is fair to say that that message has got through directly to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As convenor of the north Australian social justice strategy working group I also made sure that that message got through directly to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). I thank my colleagues on that committee who assisted me in pushing that message. I also thank people such as the State member for Mount Isa, Tony McGrady, who is in the House at the moment. He has also been pushing for quite some time to increase the tax zone rebate for residents in Mount Isa. The Mount Isa City Council has also been very strongly behind this push. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at a map of Australia, it is interesting to note that about 80 per cent of that land mass is held by Federal Labor members of parliament. The Government holds&mdash;and will hold after the next election&mdash;the Federal seat of Kalgoorlie, the seat of Northern Territory, the seat of Grey in South Australia, the seat of Leichhardt in Queensland and my seat of Kennedy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at those seats and other rural seats, such as the sugar belt seats on the northern coast of New South Wales and the coast of Queensland, one sees that something like 80 per cent of the land mass is now held by Labor members of parliament. I think I am correct in saying that rural and remote Australia has actually turned to the Labor Party in droves like never before. I think they will stay with the Labor Party because people in rural Australia know that the Labor Party really has their needs and aspirations at its heart. They also know that a GST, as proposed by the Opposition, will put living in the bush out of the reach of average Australians. We out there in rural and remote Australia, who are living in the bush, do listen to what the people in rural Australia want and, indeed, what they do not want. What they do not want, I might say&mdash;it is coming through loud and clear every day by way of letters and phone calls to my electorate office&mdash;is a whopping great GST hole in their disposable incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition says that under its Fightback package there will be compensation for the burden of the goods and services tax. But, of course, there will be no compensation for my constituents in Mount Isa, Normanton, Ingham, Charters Towers, Barcaldine or Blackall for the added burden of a 15 per cent goods and services tax on absolutely everything they purchase&mdash;absolutely no compensation at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As those opposite would know, it costs a lot more to buy a loaf of bread in a place such as Burketown than it does in a capital city such as Brisbane. For example, at the Burketown general store one pays $2 for a loaf of bread and at Woolies in Brisbane one can get a similar loaf of bread for $1.25. Petrol is far cheaper in capital cities than it is in rural and remote Australia. It is a furphy to claim that excise is being scrapped under the coalition's Fightback package. We all know that it would introduce road user charges. Suddenly, members of the coalition are running around the place saying, `But those road user charges will not be introduced until at least 1995'. Well, so what? The Government's proposed road user charges will not be introduced until that date in any event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not fair on the people in Burketown in my electorate that they have to pay 75c extra every time they buy a loaf of bread. But the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) wants to make them pay 15 per cent on top of that extra 75c each time they buy a loaf of bread. Under Fightback, the coalition would actually make people in Burketown pay $2.30 for a loaf of bread. Sure, people in Brisbane would also pay more; they would pay $1.43 for a loaf of bread. But I ask: how fair is that? The people coping with the climatic extremes and isolation of life in Burketown have to pay 30c tax on a loaf of bread to the Government while people living in Brisbane with paved roads and every government service at their fingertips are paying only an extra 18.75c on that loaf of bread. It is not fair, and every fair-minded person in this country knows it. The Catholic Church knows it, the Uniting Church knows it, welfare groups know it and of course the people of Burketown and remote Australia also know it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of making the cost of living more expensive in remote Australia, the Government has responded to the voice of remote Australia and increased the tax zone rebate in recognition of existing higher living costs. That great Prime Minister Ben Chifley actually introduced the rebate in 1945 as compensation for `the disabilities of uncongenial climatic conditions, isolation or relatively high living costs'. I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it gets just as hot in Burketown and Mount Isa in December 1992 as it did in December 1945. Living expenses in rural and remote communities are still a lot higher than they are in the cities. Of course, we in isolated Australia and in western Queensland still contribute billions of dollars each year to the national economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill provides for the base component of income tax to remote area zone rebates to be increased by 25 per cent from 1 January 1993. The level of the taxpayer zone rebate is equal to the base value applicable to the taxpayer's zone of residence and a specified percentage of the sum of any dependant, housekeeper, sole parent and notional child rebates to which the taxpayer is entitled&mdash;also called the relevant rebate amount. The level of zone rebates in ordinary zone A&mdash;places such as Mount Isa, Cloncurry, Boulia, Julia Creek&mdash;has gone from $270 to $388, plus 50 per cent of the relevant rebate amount. Rebates in ordinary zone B&mdash;towns such as Longreach, Charters Towers and Ingham in my electorate&mdash;have gone from $45 to $57, plus 20 per cent of the relevant rebate amount. Rebates in special zones A and B&mdash;places such as Normanton, Karumba, Croydon and also Richmond in my electorate&mdash;have gone from $938 to $1,173, plus 50 per cent of the relevant rebate amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes will be effective for PAYE purposes from 1 January 1992. A proportional increase in the base component of 12.5 per cent will apply for the 1992-93 year for assessment purposes. Consequently, for 1992-93 the base values will be $304 for zone A, $51 for zone B and $1,056 for the special areas in zones A and B. The increase in the base zone rebate is estimated to cost $5m in 1992-93 and $19m in 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Budget also announced the extension of the rebate to social security remote area allowances. The increase will take the rate of payment of remote area allowance to $30 per fortnight for couples and $17.50 for single people. The child rate of remote area allowance will remain unchanged at $7 per fortnight. The rate increases will actually benefit over 44,000 pensioners, beneficiaries and allowees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Curtin, said that all the Government has done is mirror what the coalition would do in Fightback. The difference is that we are not introducing a 15 per cent GST on everything people in rural and remote Australia buy. In other words, we acknowledge that people living in rural and remote Australia do suffer disadvantages, do suffer things such as isolation and weather extremes, but we are going to not only increase the tax zone rebate by 25 per cent but also give them an undertaking that in government we will not introduce a GST, which will more than take away any advantages they would get by the increase in the zone allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, instead of making living more expensive in remote Australia, this Government has increased the tax zone rebate in recognition of higher living costs that exist in those areas. As I have said also, this is in stark contrast to what I believe is the Opposition's diabolical plan to in effect bankrupt rural and remote Australia. There is no doubt that families in remote Australia are much better off with the extra cash that we offer them as a result of the increase in the tax zone rebate allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are doing other things to assist people in rural and remote Australia. I refer specifically, in the short time I have left, to tourism. I notice that there is a debate going on currently in the coalition in relation to tourism and the effect a GST will have on the tourism industry, particularly as it affects northern, rural and remote Australia. The tourism industry is burgeoning in the rural and remote areas of Australia, but a GST will absolutely devastate that industry. A 15 per cent GST will mean that people going to the Stockman's Hall of Fame in Longreach will have to pay 15 per cent extra to get in. It means that Australians will find it cheaper to go to South East Asian areas than they would to take a trip to north and north-west Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also an interesting debate going on in the public arena in relation to the coalition's policy on tourism. I note that recently a Senate candidate for the National Party, a woman by the name of De-Anne Kelly, made some very interesting statements about the GST and its effect on the tourism industry. She has made it quite clear that she fully opposes the implementation of a GST on the tourism industry and that such a tax will have an adverse impact on those tourists coming from overseas who want to travel around this great country. However, I notice also that Senator Bill O'Chee said recently that a GST will actually be of great benefit to the tourism industry, particularly in northern Australia. When Senator O'Chee's attention was drawn to the comments that were made by the Senate candidate De-Anne Kelly, Senator O'Chee said, `Look, I know what she said, but that's not what she meant'. It appears to me that there is currently a real blue going on with the coalition about the GST as it affects tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can also say that there is a blue going on amongst those rural members of the coalition as to how a GST will affect rural and remote Australia. All I can say is that the coalition ought to get out there and listen to what people are saying. If it listens to what people are saying in the bush and takes heed of it, it will drop this crazy tax; it will drop it like a hot potato. Indeed, it will stop imposing what will be nothing but a burden on people living in rural and remote parts of Australia. In conclusion, I fully support the increase in the tax zone rebates because it will be a great benefit to people living in my electorate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this cognate debate I wish to direct my comments to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5). The objectives of the Bill are: firstly, to provide for the indefinite extension of the taxation concession for business expenditures on research and development at a rate of 150 per cent; secondly, to remove the limit of $10m that currently applies to pilot plant used in R&amp;D activities so that the full cost of pilot plant acquired or commenced to be constructed on or after 19 August 1992 will be able to be claimed over three years as R&amp;D expenditure; thirdly, to deny the concession to companies involved in syndicates or other financial schemes which involve government bodies, such as the CSIRO or any university, which allow guaranteed returns on their investment; and, fourthly, to strengthen such, to empower the Industry Research and Development Board, the IRDB, to refuse to register and to revoke registration for companies which undertake research and development   activities financed through ineligible finance schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has determined that it will support the Government's intentions in respect of the 150 per cent research and development taxation concession. The 150 per cent R&amp;D tax concession was introduced in July 1985. The Government had planned to lower the 150 per cent concession to 125 per cent as at June 1993, but consequent to the 1992 Budget statement it has determined to retain the existing 150 per cent rate for an indefinite period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concession was implemented to encourage increased private sector investment in high risk, new product developments and innovative production processes. Australia's business investment in R&amp;D has historically been at low levels compared with other OECD states. Its total gross expenditure on R&amp;D as a percentage of gross domestic product is 1.23 per cent. The OECD average is 1.87 per cent. As the large public R&amp;D effort makes even this sad comparison look better than it is, business spending on R&amp;D, one of the crucial indicators of industrial performance and competitiveness, looks worse still. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia ranks sixteenth out of 19 OECD states which have measurable levels of private sector R&amp;D expenditures. Australia's rate of business expenditure in business enterprises on R&amp;D is of the order of 0.51 per cent of GDP. The OECD average is 1.18 per cent of GDP; that is, we have built up to half of the OECD average, not the basis for jubilation at all. In fact, the rate of private sector expenditure on R&amp;D is nothing less than appalling. Very little the current Government has done, including introducing this program, has changed the fundamentals of that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government argues that the concession builds on other structural changes which are driving the development of a more export orientated technologically competitive industry base. If it did build on other real and across the board structural reforms such as the coalition will implement when in government, something substantial might come of the Government's efforts to improve the rate of private sector investment in R&amp;D. Irrespective of this, in this financial year 1,800 companies are registered for access to the concession, which is jointly administered by the Australian Taxation Office and the IRDB. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill before the House will allow registered companies to deduct at an accelerated rate of 150 per cent their expenditures on eligible R&amp;D. For the House's interest, the registered companies span virtually every industry sector, though there are very heavy concentrations in computer software, mining and mineral products, chemicals, transport, food and agriculture, and the electrical equipment and miscellaneous manufacturing sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the absence of fundamental structural changes to the economy under the Labor Government, the tax concession is the only thing these companies have going for them to induce greater investment in R&amp;D. They are not on the whole driven as they might be by international competition. They do not derive the substantial returns, benefits and incentives of a low business tax regime or a productive and flexible labour force. The only carrot they have to technologically upgrade their production processes and product design is a tax concession. For the Government, this is the only quiver in the bow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision, which the coalition has also adopted, to lift the rate of the concession to 150 per cent after 1993 is an important one. It is argued that the 150 per cent rate is important because the effective tax advantage achieved through the program will fall to 9.75c in the research dollar if the rate falls to 125 per cent, as against 19.5c at the 150 per cent rate. The reasons for the difference in tax advantages flow from the reduced company tax rate in hand with the different rate of the concession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1985, the 49 per cent company tax rate meant that a research dollar spent at the 150 per cent rate provided an extra 50 per cent of 49c, or 24.5c above the standard 100 per cent company deduction. At the 39 per cent company tax rate that we have at present, the 150 per cent concessional rate means that for every research dollar spent an extra 50 per cent of 39c, 19.5c, will be returned to companies. Under the 125 per cent concession, if it had been allowed to stand, the tax advantage would therefore be 25 per cent of 39c, or only 9.75c. I hope that is clear. It certainly will be to anybody who takes the trouble to read these figures in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. I understand it is very hard to absorb on its first hearing. Those of us who have lived with it very closely tend to rattle it off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initial 1989 impact study by the Bureau of Industry Economics into the 150 per cent concession indicated that around one-third of the real increase in business spending on R&amp;D is attributable to this program. It is claimed that the concession at the higher rate of 150 per cent is essential to retain the upward trend in private R&amp;D spending on high risk long term projects which is serving, in hand with other factors, to cement widespread change in business attitudes towards investments in innovative products and processes. I would hasten to add that for the coalition parties the tax concession is but one step in many towards building a self-supporting private sector R&amp;D effort. This is our goal when in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In hand with the coalition's other reform policies, the effect of the 150 per cent R&amp;D concession will provide a vastly more powerful tool for expanding Australia's still languishing R&amp;D effort. Apart from extending the taxation concession at the higher rate, the Bill before the House also has the effect of virtually terminating all opportunities for any abuse of the concession&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) Bill also has other purposes, one being to eliminate some of the financial engineering that has been associated with this taxation concession. Since 1987, when the Government allowed syndicates to register for the concession alongside discrete private companies, there have been repeated concerns that the concession has been used by companies which have not been exposed to full risk in the process of incurring their R&amp;D expenditures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Syndication allows companies to register as joint partners in R&amp;D projects with expenditures and degrees of risk beyond the capacity of one company alone to manage. Essentially, the problem has been that syndicates have been formed which have enabled investors to obtain a guaranteed return from investment in an R&amp;D project. This has largely been achieved by way of syndicates operating through tax exempt public bodies, such as universities or the CSIRO, which reportedly utilise tax free trust accounts as a means of underwriting returns on investments. There are other methods of guaranteeing returns and reducing risks as well. For example, as outlined in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill, a private syndicate may contract a government agency or university to carry out an R&amp;D project. Yet, as part of that agreement, the government body may guarantee that, in the event the research outcome is unsuccessful, it will buy back the core technology, including any value added to that technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the amendments to the Act, the syndicate will be deemed to have not been at risk and all expenditures related to the project will be declared non-deductible. The amendments as proposed in the Bill, especially those relating to section 73, effectively close the door to syndicated arrangements for all but transparent, legitimate industry based arrangements where the company is at full risk. Industry has claimed that this represented in the past double dipping by public bodies in that it supplemented their appropriation support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, the Government has drastically reduced the likelihood of any future abuse of the concession and has ensured that it applies virtually exclusively to private companies which are making high risk investments in R&amp;D. These issues have always been a source of concern for the coalition parties over the years, and we have tackled this issue publicly and on a number of occasions. On each occasion the Government has defended its position vigorously. I am now pleased to see that the Government has finally come around to accepting the coalition's arguments in these respects and recanted on its past defences of these practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will have the added effect of ensuring that public research agencies and universities are not allowed to access the concession through any financial schemes. The Bill also proposes amendments to provide the Industry Research and Development Board authority to deny registration for the concession. The IRDB will be empowered, under the terms of a new section 39MA of the Act, to deny registration for the concession to companies which intend to participate or which are found to have participated in ineligible finance schemes, or else to withdraw registration certificates for companies which are already registered for the concession but are found to be involved in such schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, rather than list each individual contrived scheme, which would have the consequence of continued catch up legislation when new schemes are uncovered, the Act intends laying down broad guidelines in consultation with industry which will ensure financiers appreciate both the strict terms and intention of the Act. These powers are to invested in the IRDB and will be complemented by existing authority held by the Tax Commissioner to act in a similar manner under the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. My comments will follow from earlier on. The legislation that I referred to earlier on also provides for an amendment to the limit in the treatment of expenditures on pilot plant. There is very little time left, so I will not go into great depth as to how the treatments of expenditure on pilot plant are changed. Suffice it to say that the Government will alter the tax Act so that the pilot plants, which have long lives for R&amp;D purposes and frequently are never able to generate income for the company, will be treated much better. In other words, the Government now recognises that pilot plant investments are very much higher than the existing $10m threshold, and that threshold should be waived.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All up, the cost in forgone revenue of maintaining the concession at the higher rate of 150 per cent instead of 125 per cent is $110m in 1994-95, and $125m in 1995-96. The tax concession under debate aims to change company behaviour. It aims to encourage business to spend more on R&amp;D. But it has to be remembered that this is only one instrument for achieving this goal. If the goal is to be achieved at all, it must be confronted on a comprehensive basis. To be sure, we all want to see higher levels of private sector expenditure on R&amp;D, but in order to achieve this some other changes are necessary which are of greater direct significance over the long haul than the incidence of a tax concession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Developmental expenditure, the commercialisation process, is a massively expensive process&mdash;100 times more than the original research costs which might underpin it. Companies investment in R&amp;D is guided by the cost of capital, the productivity of labour, the efficiency and cost structure of supply networks, and the huge impact of business input costs. It is in these areas that dramatic reform is needed. They need to be reformed because the added cost burdens, regardless of the 150 per cent tax concession, threaten to bury Australia's commercialisation capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what the coalition is on about. If we allow companies to operate in an internationally competitive, low cost environment, an environment which allows them the simple right to exact internationally competitive rates of return on labour and capital, then we are starting to build the constellation of factors that build industries with the innate character which makes for higher rates of spending on R&amp;D. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Tax Legislation Amendment Bill and the Taxation Laws Amendment (Fringe Benefits Tax Measures) Bill implement the Government's `One Nation, One Job' statement tax scales and the fringe benefits tax measures that were flushed out of the 1992-93 Budget by the coalition's exposure of Labor's hidden tax agenda for after the next election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House will recall that Labor was forced to make a major taxation policy statement on 16 September of this year following the admission by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in the Budget context that new taxes would be necessary if the Government could not bring a future Labor Budget balance into surplus as projected in the `One Nation, One Job' statement. When it was revealed that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had excised the relevant section on new taxes from the Budget Papers, they cobbled together overnight a statement on tax policy which was tabled in this place the following day, followed by the introduction of these Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These Bills are designed to allay justified concerns that Labor will be unable to deliver on its promised One Nation tax scales and that the proposed new tax measures hinted at in the Budget will not be forthcoming and will turn out to represent a major tax slug on the Australian people. That is why these Bills have been introduced now, even though their provisions will not come into force until 1994 and 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members should think about that: legislation for past and current decisions on taxation law amendments is not even in this place, but this legislation is here for two years hence and is being debated under the guillotine. What does that mean if it is not what I have already said, which is that this is a pre-election ploy&mdash;nothing more, nothing less. In the meantime we will have a Federal election which will render this legislation essentially meaningless, at least so far as the doubtful and unfunded `One Nation, One Job' tax cuts are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Either the coalition will assume office and will deliver genuine and much needed tax reform, or Labor, by some miracle, will retain office and will have every reason and every incentive to renege on the proposed tax cuts which will prove to be essentially undeliverable in view of the inevitable Budget deficit blow-out that will ensue under Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this legislation is a con job for the purposes of the coming Federal election and was designed to get Labor out of hot water in which the Treasurer and his failed Budget had landed it. Moreover, if it were not for the Treasurer's Budget gaffe, this legislation would be nothing more than a vague promise in Labor's largely forgotten `One Nation, One Job' economic statement and one that would probably never be delivered given Labor's fiscal policy record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tax Legislation Amendment Bill proposes to reduce tax rates in two stages from 1 July 1994 and 1 January 1996. These tax cuts are nothing but a sham and do not even begin to return the bracket creep that Labor has expropriated from taxpayers since it came to office in 1983. Moreover, these projected tax cuts cannot hold a candle to the personal income tax cuts being proposed by the coalition under its Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most significant feature of Labor's proposed `One Nation, One Job' tax cuts is that they contain absolutely no tax relief for low income earners. People earning less than $20,700 per annum will not see one red cent reduction in personal income tax under these proposals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly, and it has taken a few other people for granted; I might get to that later. With this legislation Labor will mulishly maintain the current level of the tax free threshold above which low income earners will continue to be subject to the current levels of taxation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, the coalition, the Liberal and National parties, will raise the tax free threshold from the current $5,400 to $7,000. We will also reduce the tax rate applicable to incomes under $20,700 from 20c in the dollar under Labor to 16.2c in the dollar under Fightback and the Liberal and National parties. The coalition's proposals will result in all taxpayers earning less than $50,000 a year paying only 30c in the dollar as their top marginal rate, whereas under Labor's proposed tax cuts they would be paying 41.5c in the dollar plus an increased Medicare levy. At the same time the coalition will cut the top marginal rate of tax from 47c in the dollar to 42c in the dollar, while Labor would leave the top marginal rate at 47c in the dollar and increase the Medicare levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With these tax cuts the Labor Party has abandoned its traditional constituency, as my honourable friend mentioned earlier, thinking it is safe in the knowledge that it can afford to take its traditional supporters for granted in trying to win the next election. It is interesting that, while the Government, in its statement on tax policy of 16 September, says that it will not increase the overall tax burden, it gives absolutely no undertaking to reduce it. In its taxation policy statement Labor is not even pretending to lower the overall tax burden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is in complete contrast with the coalition's Fightback package which gives an explicit undertaking to reduce the overall burden of taxation on the Australian community. At the same time as Labor hands out a few future paltry tax cuts that do not even begin to return post-1983 bracket creep, it is expanding its fringe benefits tax collections and its compliance and enforcement mechanisms. Labor is doing what it has long done best&mdash;giving a little with one hand and taking a hell of a lot more with the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to the fringe benefits tax were to have been kept in the Treasurer's bottom drawer until after the next election, but Labor's hand has now been forced and we have this and the fringe benefits tax measures Bill now before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Laws Amendment (Car Parking) Bill will follow shortly, its having been introduced in the last 24 hours or so. In the meantime these Bills will change the method of calculating the value base of the fringe benefits tax by making it closer to that of income tax. From 1 April 1994&mdash;April Fools Day, which is appropriate&mdash;the FBT will be levied on the FBT inclusive value of the fringe benefit, and FBT payments will be deductible to the employer for income tax purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This change to the valuation of the FBT base will raise about $2.5 billion between 1994-95 and 1995-96. While this measure will increase the amount of FBT collected from business, it does address the anomaly of the current FBT system whereby some businesses are able to minimise their FBT liability. The new system also introduces a measure of FBT tax relief since it will be tax deductible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has said that when in office we will review the remaining anomalies in the FBT system and will align the FBT rate with the top marginal income tax rate, plus the Medicare levy, that will be applicable under the coalition's proposed new and reduced income tax scales. So we will support these amendments while at the same time renewing our commitment to genuine tax reform as set out in Fightback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor's statement on tax policy, tabled along with these Bills, demonstrates the total bankruptcy of its record on tax reform and its failure to come to terms with the need for fundamental tax reform to take place in this country forthwith. Labor's hollow rhetoric about Australia being a low tax country does nothing to disguise a highly inefficient and highly inequitable tax system that imposes massive costs on the Australian community. That other countries suffer from similar problems, particularly in the OECD, should be of no consolation whatsoever to us here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, rather than embracing comprehensive tax reform as advocated by the coalition, Labor has resorted to a few doubtful tax cuts and enhancing Australian Taxation Office compliance and enforcement measures. Faced with the prospect of a massive Budget deficit that would put at risk its `One Job, One Nation' tax cuts, Labor asked the Australian Taxation Office to go and find it some more revenue. This is in large measure what Labor's statement on tax policy is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ATO, as it always does, responded to this request with its income tax compliance-enforcement strategy document, which was also tabled along with these two Bills. Again, this document is dated 15 September, although it should really be dated `late at night 15 September and early in the morning of 16 September' to reflect the way in which it was hastily cobbled together to get the Government out of deep trouble after the Budget's secret tax agenda was exposed by the Liberal and National parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's tax policy statement dated 16 September says that the Government has officially endorsed this Tax Office compliance and enforcement strategy. That must be an all-time record for a government response to a departmental options paper, although there was only one real option presented to the Government in that document, which no doubt shortened the processes of giving it formal approval. That option was for the Government to give the ATO more money to hound taxpayers with enhanced enforcement and compliance measures, a none too surprising conclusion for the Tax Office to reach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This sums up Labor's version of tax reform for the 1990s. Having totally failed to deliver on tax reform in the 1980s, Labor's agenda for the 1990s is to collect more FBT and to go chasing after taxpayers with a bigger and better-funded stick. Labor will give the Australian Taxation Office an extra $114m over three years from 1993-94 to 1995-96 to fund so-called enhanced compliance and enforcement measures as outlined in the Tax Office compliance and enforcement strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will principally involve an extension of the tax file number system and an improvement of the ATO's record keeping and audit programs. After 10 years of Labor in office, one could be forgiven for thinking that tax collection procedures should be just about perfect by now, particularly if those opposite lived up to their rhetoric in combating tax avoidance and tax evasion in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Information reporting arrangements, including the tax file number system, will be widened to cover further categories of business and other income areas. The Tax Office will also target small business record keeping to improve the level of small business compliance with the tax law. The ATO's income tax compliance and enforcement strategy states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The record keeping practices of many taxpayers in this segment can be improved considerably.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a bit rich coming from the ATO in view of what leaked Tax Office minutes had to say earlier this year about the ATO's own record keeping practices. The House will recall that leaked Tax Office memos showed that the ATO often failed to keep any records, and that some of the records it did keep did not meet proper accounting standards. Indeed, if the ATO itself were to be subject to an audit of the type it imposes on the rest of the community, then the ATO would be in very serious trouble indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small business owners will be thrilled to hear that the ATO will be diverting more resources to a program of record keeping audits of small businesses as part of the measures designed to dredge up the $1.7 billion in additional revenue that Labor so desperately needs. The Tax Office concedes in its income tax compliance and enforcement strategy document that the suggested enforcement strategies would impose additional compliance burdens, the cost of which cannot be quantified at this stage, although we do know that generally speaking compliance costs in Australia are amongst the highest in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ATO claims that it will seek to minimise the additional compliance burdens that result from these measures by engaging in consultations with taxpayers. But, as the so-called simplification of the wholesale sales tax system shows, there is virtually no Tax Office consultation with business on important compliance issues despite the sweeping, albeit ad hoc, nature of those changes to the wholesale sales tax law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The record of the ATO to date, at Labor's behest, suggests that whatever consultation might take place on compliance issues will be minimal and in the end largely worthless, as the ever-increasing high compliance burden of the Australian taxation system would justifiably lead us to believe. The Government has undertaken to introduce new legislation to support these compliance and enforcement measures, but not until 1993-94, so it is not expected that these measures will yield any revenue benefit until 1994-95. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would think that, if there were a real need to legislate at this time and to debate the legislation under the guillotine, it would have a more contemporary application. But, no, it will not apply until 1994-95. Then the Government estimates that these new measures will net an additional $1.7 billion in the two years 1994-95 and 1995-96. Together with the fringe benefits tax changes, Labor will collect all up an additional $4.2 billion between 1994-95 and 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether these revenue projections can possibly be met, of course, remains to be seen. We have every reason to be doubtful on that score, given Labor's track record in making such forecasts. But it should be emphasised that, even if these projections are capable of being met, there is still considerable doubt over whether Labor can meet its Budget deficit reduction target and at the same time deliver on the promised tax cuts in its `One Job' economic statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite likely that the Government will be unable to achieve either objective, given the disastrous state of Labor's Budget balance. Thus it is reasonable to expect that, were Labor re-elected, it would be forced to resort to new tax measures, including an expanded wholesale sales tax system, if it has any intention of delivering on these proposed tax scales. </PARA>

Fairness and equity have been the hallmarks of the tax reforms introduced by the Labor Government since 1983, and that commitment will remain. That is what these amendments are about tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one thing that the honourable member for Curtin did not mention was the fact that the fastest growing industry&mdash;I should imagine the only growth industry&mdash;under the Liberal-National Government of the former Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, was the tax avoidance industry. Of course the Treasurer at the time was none other than the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). That industry has been reduced quite dramatically under this Government because this Government has addressed the problem through a reduction in company and personal income taxes over a period of time, coupled with the introduction of the fringe benefits tax and the capital gains tax which has ensured a much more even spread of the tax burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bills which are before us tonight continue the proud record of this Labor Government in reforming our taxation system. It has made it much fairer and more equitable. `Fairness' and `equity' are not two words which spring to mind when discussing the coalition's tax policies as contained in its Fightback package. The Leader of the Opposition's GST is the centrepiece of his Fightback package. It would tax basic food items while the cost of luxuries would be reduced. His idea of fairness is to put a 15 per cent tax on bread and milk while reducing the price of a Ferrari by some $30,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But those opposite cannot get away from the fact that their tax policy will hit the poor hard in order to give a tax break to the rich. People on low incomes spend most, or even all, of their incomes on consumption items, while people on higher incomes save a much higher percentage of their incomes. Any tax system based on taxing goods and services will naturally hit low income earners harder under these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But to make matters worse, not only would the coalition introduce its regressive GST but also the spending cuts that would have to occur in order to finance the tax cuts would hit areas such as social security and Medicare, and thus have a further damaging impact on the less well-off. One of the arguments that the Leader of the Opposition has used to try to justify the tax is that it would hit the black economy and reduce tax avoidance. It is useful to look at this claim in more detail because when it is analysed we can see that it is clearly quite false. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the activities which are currently associated with tax avoidance are drug trading, illegal gambling, prostitution and crime generally. The Leader of the Opposition would have us believe that the introduction of a GST will suddenly turn drug pushers, SP bookies, pimps and prostitutes into honest, understanding taxpayers. This idea is fully supported by the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), who has been quite vocal about the fact that he will clean up the black economy. Such a notion is obviously absurd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the other activities in the cash or black economy are things such as baby-sitting, lawn mowing and home maintenance services. The introduction of a GST will not change the fact that a significant number of people offering such services would still avoid tax&mdash;in fact, the GST would encourage such people to avoid tax. While the tradespeople who were avoiding tax may still have to pay GST on all of the equipment they use, they will also be able to increase the price of their services and avoid the GST. This would disadvantage honest taxpaying tradespeople, as dishonest tradespeople would pocket extra money simply by putting up prices to just under the GST price and still avoid the tax. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is evidence to support this argument in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document. In Supplementary Paper No. 6, which is a summary of the overseas experience with consumption taxes, it clearly shows that the two countries with the lowest rate of tax avoidance were those which did not have a GST&mdash;Switzerland and the United States&mdash;whilst the country at the top of the table for the size of its black economy was Belgium, which just happens to have a GST. This is also the experience in Canada. It introduced a GST only recently, but the black economy is already starting to grow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other claim that the Leader of the Opposition is fond of making about his tax policy is that it is a low tax policy. We have already seen what he is talking about. It is a high tax policy and a low wage policy. He has got it all wrong&mdash;particularly if he follows the model that his friend in Victoria is embarking on at the moment; and he is at it again today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This claim simply does not stand up to any sort of analysis. The cornerstone of this policy is the Leader of the Opposition's phoney tax cuts. When the size of the Opposition's tax cuts are adjusted to take into account the increased inflation and bracket creep which would result from the introduction of a GST, these tax cuts would not even compensate low and middle income earners for the introduction of the GST. For instance, people on $25,000 per year will be $14.10 per week worse off, whilst people earning $100,000 will be $73.20 per week better off once the inflationary effect of the GST is taken into account. The coalition's policies would result in higher taxes, not lower taxes. With its industrial relations policies, there will be higher taxes and lower wages&mdash;that is what it is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's policies would amount to an extra $28 billion in new taxes every year. This money would come from four areas. The first, of course, is the 15 per cent GST of the Leader of the Opposition, which would tax just about every good or service produced in this country. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document itself boasted that the GST would raise $27 billion in its first year. This is greater than the revenue raised by the wholesale sales tax, payroll tax and fuel excise that it would actually replace. When we talk about the fuel excise, the Opposition is not telling us what it is going to do about road user charges. </PARA>

I remember when the GST was first introduced in New Zealand. It was 10 per cent. It is now 12.5 per cent. Other countries have had similar experiences. One example of the high tax policy of the Liberal Party is the area of company tax. What do they want to do with company tax?  Do you want to have a go at it too? This Government has been responsible for the greatest reduction in the rates of corporate tax in Australia's history, providing business with the incentive to invest in the economy. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8J4">Mr LES SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and personal tax as well. If we want companies in Australia to compete internationally against countries that have a lower tax system, we have to be able to have an effective tax system in order to compete with them. We have reduced company tax from 49c down to 39c. Honourable members opposite know that. That has actually happened. But now, the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Liberal Party, the party which is supposed to be the friend of business&mdash;you would not want enemies when you have friends like them&mdash;plans to increase the tax from 39c to 42c. So it is obviously on the way back up again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fightback package is going to destroy any opportunity for business to expand in this country. It will stifle business. The rationale behind this increase is that business would get tax breaks elsewhere through the removal or abolition of payroll tax. Anyone who knows anything about payroll tax knows that it does not apply to all businesses. The 800,000 small businesses around the place obviously do not pay a lot of payroll tax. One would think that anyone who employs one employee would pay payroll tax, but they do not. Small businesses would be severely disadvantaged, and all honourable members know that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members opposite know in their heart of hearts that that is right and they will not admit it. Somewhere along the line they have to admit it. The small business people out there admit it. They are awake to the Opposition. They are not as silly as the Opposition thinks they are. They know who their real enemy is, and it is the coalition with its Fightback package. It does nothing for small business. So there are plenty of examples where these things are going wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example of the high tax policies of the coalition is the 25 per cent increase in tobacco excise that the Leader of the Opposition has promised. There is also the introduction of the Medicare surcharge for families with incomes over $45,000 and single people with incomes over $35,000 on a sliding scale up to $800 and $400, respectively, if they choose not to take out private health insurance. That is another penalty for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of a consumption tax is not the answer to the problems faced by Australia. In fact, it would create a whole new series of problems. The electorate out there is waking up to that. The people know what is going on. There is no way that people on low to middle incomes can be adequately compensated for the regressive impact of the consumption tax, no matter what those opposite say to the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government is the only government that has had the courage to introduce significant tax reform since the end of the Second World War and our achievements in this area have been many, particularly over the last 10 years. The Government has introduced a fringe benefits tax. Honourable members opposite opposed this tax, and still oppose it in real ways, although I heard the honourable member for Curtin say that he was going to support these amendments here tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fringe benefits were another fast growing area. A lot of people were getting fringe benefits, and there were instances where taxation was clearly being avoided. People were getting great packages and they were virtually paying no tax at all. They had their own plastic cards where they could go and buy what they liked. They could take their families out to dinner and they could get their wife to do the shopping with it. It was the greatest thing of all time. Then there were the motor cars&mdash;you name it&mdash;and it just went on and on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the people who were paying the most tax were the people on lower incomes. The people who could least afford it were paying the higher tax. This Government has brought in a much fairer and equitable tax system, where the people who can afford to pay are paying tax for the first time in some time. They are the ones ought to pay. But under the Opposition's proposals, the people on the lower incomes, the people who cannot afford to pay, will pay more and the people on the higher incomes will be much better off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at cars, for instance. The average Australian does not buy Ferraris. He cannot afford the $300,000-plus for a Ferrari. Most Australians are flat out affording a new Commodore. With the saving on a Ferrari, one could buy a new Commodore. One could put an extra car in the garage. But the average Australian cannot afford that. This Government has had a very strong commitment to tax reform and I think its record stands on that. The introduction of the fringe benefits tax is an example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin) has taken a very keen interest in overseas tax havens. The Government closed off those overseas tax havens and introduced an enhanced tax file number which has certainly improved the tax collection areas a lot. It has reduced the level of tax evasion. The Government introduced the capital gains tax, which those opposite opposed, and continue to oppose. I think it is right that the Fightback package states that you were going to do away with the capital gains tax. How are honourable members going to replace that?  That is an area where people have been avoiding tax for years and years. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It just amazes me that honourable members such as the honourable member for Curtin can get up here tonight and defend a whole range of things. When one looks at the Opposition's Fightback package, one has to look at the winners and losers. Earlier tonight I was reading some information. It was rather interesting because my colleague the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch) was telling me something here this afternoon. The Leader of the Opposition has actually tried to sell his consumption tax policy to Australians by saying that under a GST everyone would be better off, and we know they are not. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can tell you, it is overwhelmingly beneficial to the people that really make this country, that is the workers of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a quote from a doorstop interview by the Leader of the Opposition on 25 October 1991. Do honourable members know the doorstop interview?  I understand it is 350 days today since he has actually done a press conference. It was another one of his special little doorstops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasury analysis actually shows who would be worse off under Fightback. Some 70 per cent of householders, or full time wage and salary earners, would be worse off. Sixty per cent of self-employed farmers and small businesses would be worse off as well. The farming community would definitely be worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It amazes me that the people who are pretending to represent the rural community will be the ones to make farmers worse off. We all know that farmers struggle from year to year through a whole range of factors. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and I both know from our experience in the banking inquiry in which we were involved how the farmers are getting a rough deal. That was highlighted again in the supplementary report that came out today. Both the rural community and people in the suburbs of this country would all be much worse off under the proposals offered in the Fightback package. We have to look at who would gain under a goods and services tax. It cannot possibly be people on low incomes; it has to be those on high incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia are starting to wake up. Today my staff sent me down a copy of a letter to the editor of the local paper.

As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) said the other day, Government members cannot be trusted with the money; they cannot be trusted with the keys to the vault. They have run up a debt, in round figures, of $10,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia. My little kids, before they even get out of school, have a $10,000 debt that is partly their responsibility.

There was $1 billion left out&mdash;effectively disguised as a footnote; it was only short term. But he knew it was not. One billion and a bit dollars is only petty cash, I suppose.

What we propose for this country are the largest personal income tax cuts in Australian history. We propose a 30 per cent reduction in personal income tax&mdash;a reduction of $13 billion. This means that 95 per cent of taxpayers will face a marginal tax rate of 30c or less in the dollar.

The great lie of the wholesale sales tax is that when this Government came to office in 1983 it brought in $3 billion of revenue. By stealth over those years it has increased that collection from $3 billion to $10 billion. It has done it by increasing the rates and increasing the coverage of the wholesale sales tax.

It was a recession we were not going to have, but ultimately it was the recession we had to have. The Government has increased that collection of wholesale sales tax from $3 billion to $10 billion by stealth. That is a hidden consumption tax which collects $10 billion. Not only is it directly imposed on a wide range of goods that people buy every day at various rates&mdash;10, 20 and 30 per cent; it impacts indirectly on almost all goods and services. The honourable member for Oxley could not seem to understand that that was the case.</PARA></TALK.START>

I speak to people every day who say, `We don't pay wholesale sales tax, so it doesn't affect us'. But it does. At every turn it impacts, and it compounds. The other iniquitous feature of the wholesale sales tax is that it compounds through the distribution channel; it is added onto all the way along. We want to abolish that tax. </PARA>

Government members can run the argument all day that somehow the goods and services tax is that as well, but the payroll tax is a direct tax on employment. All the employers that I speak to&mdash;the bigger employers, who pay payroll tax&mdash;make the point very clearly that if they did not have to pay payroll tax they could employ more people, and they will employ more people. Whilst small businesses do not pay payroll tax directly, they feel the cascading effects of payroll tax. Many of their suppliers pay payroll tax and it affects the cost of goods for people further down the chain. We intend to abolish petroleum excise.

That is based on our very conservative calculations. Treasury actually estimated that the effect would be less than that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was the Treasurer. As the royal commissioner appointed by the former Liberal Government said, the only growth industry in Australia was tax avoidance. He also made the statement that, for the rich, paying tax was a matter of choice. Back in those days, of course, the top personal tax rate was 60c; the bottom tax rate was 30c. That is where we have come from. That is the sort of tax system we inherited. It did not matter for the rich whether they paid tax or not; it was a personal choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were bottom of the harbour schemes. The honourable member for Bennelong, as Treasurer, was notified by the Taxation Commissioner on a number of occasions that these schemes existed, but his advice was completely neglected. Not only did we have a rotten tax system, but we had a person in charge of the system who was totally incapable of taking advice from his own Taxation Commissioner as to how he might make some of the most basic repairs to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nowadays the top personal tax rate is down to 47c but, more importantly, the bottom tax rate is down to 20c. I can remember sitting in this House when we introduced legislation for a capital gains tax. I can remember going through the 1984 election when we said that we would have a tax summit and we would not rule out a capital gains tax. I can remember going through that election campaign with the Liberal Party and the National Party running a scare campaign on that tax. But this Government never ruled it out. We took it to the Taxation Summit, and nowadays we have a capital gains tax which I think is amongst the fairest in the world. It has repaired a gaping hole in our taxation system, but it was opposed by the Liberal Party and the National Party. The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) can point. He was not here, so I will give him a history lesson. He does not know what it was like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also the fringe benefits tax. People had salary packages. They took a part of their income as cash and paid tax on it, but a sizeable proportion of their income was taken as fringe benefits on which they paid no tax. Once again, this Government introduced legislation to repair that hole; once again, it was opposed by the Liberal Party and the National Party. We sought to end taxation deductions for entertainment expenses&mdash;the rort where the rich could take their mates to lunch and write it off against their taxation obligations, but workers who took their lunch to work in brown paper bags could not. That is the sort of taxation system that the Liberal Party had. It has opposed every decent measure that we have introduced into this House to reform the taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things I can say about all those reforms is that there was consultation. We actually spoke to people about it. We had a tax summit. I contrast that with the sort of taxation proposals that Opposition members have put before the House. How much consultation was there about a consumption tax?

We can remember the reports in the paper where the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) walked into the party room with this huge document and handcuffed every Opposition member to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Listening to the previous speaker, the honourable member for McPherson, it seems to me that he has learnt his lines well. He and his colleagues have got them off parrot fashion, but there is no guts or heart in what they say because there is no authorship. There has been no consultation about the introduction of the goods and services tax.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard the honourable member for McPherson talk about a wholesale sales tax. Of course, he had his lines down pat, straight out of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document. Let me say this about a wholesale sales tax: it can discriminate. In the supermarkets of this country junk food can carry a 20 per cent tax, but fresh vegetables carry no tax at all. Let us talk about the advantages of the wholesale sales tax system. Certainly one of the advantages is just that&mdash;it can discriminate. We can put a higher tax on Ferraris than we do on Falcons, and we do. And we make no apologies for that.

I forgive the honourable member for McPherson because he and a number of members on the opposite side were not here in the days when this Government pushed through the most dramatic tax reforms in the history of the Parliament and fought them all the way against the combined forces of the Liberal Party and the National Party. Nowadays those opposite accept them. The reason they accept them is that the Australian public accepts them. The Australian public are a lot smarter than those opposite give them credit for.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I was saying before I was interrupted, the gap between what the Opposition says its taxes will raise and what it will spend amounts to $6 billion, or $6,000m.

I think it has been 350 days since the Leader of the Opposition has fronted a press conference with the journalists in this Parliament. Is it any wonder?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most obvious way in which it will be raised is not to have a 15 per cent tax but an 18 per cent tax. It is the only way the Opposition's policies will allow it to plug the gap. It will not be 15c in the dollar; it will be 18c. Those opposite will be in good company because every country in the world that has introduced such a tax has increased it. Let me just give a couple of examples: in the United Kingdom the rate of the goods and services tax when it was introduced was 10 per cent and it is now 17 1/2 per cent; in Austria it was 8 per cent at its introduction and it is now 20 per cent; in Denmark it was 10 per cent at its introduction and it is now 22 per cent. </PARA>

If you were to offer a package that compensated people from its introduction, would you take account of the inflationary effects that would be generated by adding 15 per cent to the cost of goods and services in the country?'.

He went over the top again because he clearly has no answer to the problems he is facing. He is frightened to death to go to the polls now because he knows he cannot win, but he is frightened to death to wait until next March or April because he knows that unemployment is likely to be worse. He knows that the balance of payments is definitely going to be worse; he knows that the economy is going to be in worse shape and not growing; and he does not know which way he is going. It is no wonder he is confused. It is no wonder he is attacking half of this Parliament and calling honourable senators swill and pansies. That is terrific from a Prime Minister!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall when our Prime Minister, the head of government of this once proud nation, went to Indonesia and told the Indonesians, `Look, don't pay any attention to that ratbag of a flag we have. I'll go back and I'll fix it. Ignore that flag that represents the heritage of my country, because we'll fix it and then you'll like us. Then you'll buy more of our goods and services and you'll increase trade with our country'. That is the kind of Prime Minister we have in this country. Today he went over the top in Question Time, and tonight the honourable member for Canning stands up and makes a joke out of taxation reform&mdash;and the Australian people are not laughing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These two Bills in total represent an attempt by this rather failed Government to try somehow to match the taxation reforms inherent in Fightback. We hear an awful lot about Fightback from those opposite. We hear an awful lot about the GST from those opposite. We do not hear much about what the Government is doing in terms of real reform to try to address our real structural problems. Fightback is a real attempt at real reform across a great broad base of portfolios, of policy agenda issues, in order to try to make a new start in these, the dying years of the twentieth century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But these two Bills are about trying to match the tax cuts in Fightback. Of course, they do not. They do not match them anywhere along the scale, and they do not even come close to addressing the problem of those on low and middle incomes. They will not even by 1996 address the basic tax free threshold. Fightback addresses that and lifts it substantially. They do not address the taxation rate for those on a minimal income of $20,600 a year. Fightback addresses that. Why? It is because it is a range of measures, funded, put together to try to reform our antiquated system. The tax cuts inherent in these Bills today are no attempt at reform. They are simply an attempt to portray a failed government being able to match what a reformist in-coming government attempts to accomplish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) was caught out in his Budget because he did not have enough money even to pretend to fund the tax cuts that he cannot afford to give. So we are stuck with a structural deficit, a massive turnaround in government spending from an $8 billion surplus to a $16 billion deficit, and increasing. The Government then offered tax cuts to the Australian people as well without any real solution. There was no cutting of costs. The Government could not think about whether the Public Service was operating efficiently or not or whether it was using taxpayers' funds to the best advantage. Labor governments are not very good at that: they are really not very good at managing other people's money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill brings in some `funny money' tax cuts, and the Treasurer has to find some way of filling the hole. He is going to fill it by revising the mechanisms associated with fringe benefits tax. Why did he not revise it all the way and simply make it nice and simple, as it should have been in 1986? The honourable member for Canning has said that nobody knows anything about the history of taxation in Australia. I know a bit about it. Even though I was not in this place, I was in the community trying to create jobs and to earn income. I was paying heaps of tax then, but not any more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fringe benefits tax in 1986 should have been directed at those who received the fringe benefits; that is fair. If a man receives a benefit he should pay the tax. Under our progressive taxation system that is reasonable and fair; I accept that. But the Government taxes companies because Labor governments only know how to tax companies. They think that business is a great big basket of gold just waiting to be milked like a cow. They think out of business there is always going to be some other benefit that they can get to put in the public purse to redistribute. But they forget the fact that it is business and industry that need to be competitive with business and industry in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give the former Treasurer and current Prime Minister credit for deregulating the financial market: it needed to be done. I give him credit for deregulating the banking industry: that needed to be done. We needed to start breaking down the walls that surrounded our island nation to make us part of the world, because we trade today with the whole world. Everything we make and consume in this country, and every service we supply, is competed for somehow by some other country. So we needed to be competitive and we needed to have those walls brought down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But when it came to the fringe benefits tax, we taxed companies. We said, `Let's whack the old companies. Let's give it to them once again and make sure the companies are uncompetitive'. The companies cannot compete as the tariff walls come down and the dollar is floated, so we lose them. When we lose companies we lose jobs. When we lose jobs, we lose income; and people lose heart, hope, opportunity and a sense of belonging to the community. We devastate the economy and we devastate our people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of this Bill tries to redress the difference in the highest personal income tax rate under the progressive system and the fringe benefits tax rate. It essentially brings those two in line and then gives companies credit. Why do those opposite simply not change the system and say that the fringe benefits tax ought to be the account of those who receive the benefit? It is simple and makes it easier for mechanisms such as Austudy to determine total, real disposable income. It is fair, but those opposite did not think about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another part of this Bill is a cobbled together bit under a great deal of suspicion called compliance. All of a sudden we found in October that the Australian Commissioner of Taxation thought that he could get billions of dollars more out of compliance largely, once again, by the Government making sure that we attack companies and businesses, those trying to produce the wealth and provide the jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we tightened compliance measures, but we did not have those measures available when the Budget was brought down in August. They certainly were not in the Budget. We had a hint, though. If I remember rightly, there was a one-line sentence in the Budget that said there were some other measures that we might have to look to down the track to help fund these funny money tax cuts that we are talking about here tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sure; everybody ought to pay his or her fair share of tax. But one of the problems with the taxation regime in this country is that it is highly progressive. It is a disincentive for people to work harder or longer, to accumulate more income or to save. So one of the basic premises or foundations upon which Fightback is built is a change in the nature of the levels of taxation to reduce reliance on income tax and to increase reliance on consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) will say that we do not have consumption taxes; that we do not believe in consumption taxes in Australia. This Keating-Hawke Labor Government started with $3 billion worth of wholesale sales tax in 1983. That was a consumption tax. What have we got today? We have over $9.5 billion worth of consumption taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Canning had the audacity to talk about compensation for a GST. Where is the compensation for this massive increase in wholesale sales tax that our citizens have incurred from 1983 to today? There have been over $6 billion worth of increases in consumption taxes with not one dot of compensation for anybody. It does not matter whether people are on zero incomes, the lowest incomes, middle incomes or high incomes; nobody gets any compensation because people do not really think about a hidden consumption tax. The wholesale sales tax is just that&mdash;a hidden tax that everybody pays but nobody knows about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has another problem. It gets built into the production chain in industry, so we wind up exporting it. It also acts, because it has varying rates applying to it, as a discriminatory device in terms of production and manufacturing and the supply of services. Some arbitrary bureaucrat, with the Treasurer's compliance, decides what rate to apply to what good. Having decided that, that then affects the balance in the marketplace as to how much of those goods or services people will consume and, therefore, how much will be produced by the companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question that other hidden consumption taxes are supported by this Labor Government. After all, what is the fuel excise? Supposedly it is for road revenue so that we can build new roads to take care of our growing population. In fact, only about 25 per cent of the fuel excise is spent by this Labor Government on roads. The rest of it goes into Consolidated Revenue. In fact, fuel excise is another one of Labor's hidden consumption taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one remaining: customs duty. I give the former Treasurer and current Prime Minister for a few more days credit for starting to bring down the tariff walls. Thank goodness he did. Our industry has been so protected for so many years that year after year after year companies have come to Canberra and said, `Look, times are tough out there; the unions have said we have to have a national wage case, that wages have to go up. So wages have gone up and I can no longer compete in selling my cars so I will have to have an increase in tariffs'. Compliant governments have gone along and said, `You are right; we will increase tariffs'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the unions came along and asked for increased wages, and the two just kept going up in a never-ending spiral. We will never address the quality issues or the productivity issues as long as we hide behind that protective tariff wall. I give the current Prime Minister, the former Treasurer, credit for that. But he seems to have changed his tune a bit since the Wills by-election, and I think that is a shame. Perhaps it is positive in the sense that Australia is having the long awaited and, I would say, much needed debate with regard to getting rid of protective tariffs. We are debating it now, but we are debating it in the sense that we on this side of the House believe that tariffs should come to an end altogether, or that they should surely be at minimum levels by the turn of this century. But all of a sudden the ex-Treasurer, the current Prime Minister, sees that he may have some political advantage in switching sides, so he switches back and forth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw that today. Today we saw the greatest capitulation of all time. In Question Time the Prime Minister essentially said, `We support the goods and services tax'. He supported it in 1985&mdash;and, regardless of what the honourable member for Canning says, he did not support a retail sales tax; he supported a fully fledged goods and services tax, a VAT type tax. He supported it in the strongest language, with quote after quote, in venue after venue. The only reason we do not have it is that he was rolled by the ACTU, and rolled comprehensively. If he were to try it again he would be rolled again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we found out the truth. No matter who wins government after the next Federal election&mdash;and I am quite confident we will be on the other side of this House&mdash;even if the absolutely diabolical, unthinkable should happen and the grand old Labor Party is returned once again to devastate this country, we will still have a consumption tax. Make no mistake; those opposite will bring it in one way or another. Today at Question Time the Prime Minister confirmed that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a few problems in this nation, and these Bills do not really address them. They are window dressing to try to match the comprehensive set of reforms which we on this side of the House intend to introduce in 1993. These Bills do not address our $150 billion and growing deficit; they do not address the one million unemployed; they do not address the 385,000 long term unemployed and their families; and they do not address business bankruptcies, which are 20 per cent up this year on last year, when last year there was an all-time record. These Bills are nothing but a charade by a failed Labor government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to speak on the taxation Bills, but the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) always excites me. We have heard a lot of talk about the unnecessary complexity of taxation law and how it must be simplified. If we are to have a taxation law that is equitable, it has to be complex. If it is not, the rich will simply pay their accountants to get around it. The system has to be complex to thwart the efforts of those people.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is true that a lot has been written into the taxation law system since then in an attempt to make it fairer. The people of Australia have to understand that there is no other way to get equity into the tax system than to have these complexities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been cynically amused by this debate. The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) seems to be some sort of a spokesman for the Opposition in this area. He got into the Senate in 1977, as I remember. Those honourable members as old as me, and with as good a memory, will remember that that was the era of the fistful of dollars. The Liberal Party stormed into power on the fistful of dollars. It was, of course, a lie. That was shown as soon as the coalition got into power, when it legislated to take away the very increases it had promised. It is sad to see today that nothing has changed. The honourable member for Curtin is at it again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some legitimate concerns about the goods and services tax. There is no doubt that it will impact upon low income people and that is because of the propensity of low income people to spend virtually 100 per cent of what they get every week. If they spend any amount at all on food they will be worse off. At the moment food is not taxed, but those opposite with their goods and services tax will tax it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the average food bill for an average family is in the order of $150 per week, quite clearly families will have to find quite a lot of extra money which they simply do not have. I know a few of these people. I know how close it is every week and how dependent they are on every week's wages. So let us have no nonsense about it not affecting low income people. The tax threshold will not affect these people; what they will get back will come nowhere near compensating for what it will cost them every week for food. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem those opposite will have with their tax is in the area of small business. I come from small business and I can tell those opposite that when I was in business&mdash;and I was successful&mdash;I never paid so little tax in all my life. It was a real shock to me to become a pay as you earn taxpayer and have to pay tax every week, with no way of minimising it and no way of reducing the amount that I was supposed to pay. So let us hear no more of this nonsense. The reality is that tax is not the great problem of small business. I think there is one exception. I certainly think provisional tax is a problem, but then provisional tax was brought in by Menzies so I guess in that sense it is sacrosanct. But it is certainly a problem for small businesses, particularly in the second or third year of operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farmers will find it very difficult. I know how farmers operate now and the great bulk of them present their accountants with a box full of invoices and bits and pieces. For the main part, they are not good bookkeepers.

Because there is no award protection, the unscrupulous in New Zealand are simply saying, `You stay on the minimal dole which New Zealand provides or we will pay you $1.50 an hour'. Explain to me how the country benefits from that. In this case it was lucky that the fellow was over 21 years of age and he could get some redress under the legislation.

If he stops working of course it will impact on me; I realise that. But I can sympathise with him because if it were me I would not work for $3 an hour either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It just shows how little understanding those opposite have. I remember that when the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) was questioned about whether he would work for $3 an hour he said, `Well, if I counted all the hours I work I am probably working for less than that'. The only way that the Leader of the Opposition could work for less than that is if he somehow or other gets about 60 hours into a day. But it is quite clear that mathematics is not the Opposition's strong point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The once great Liberal Party is now the extremist party. It is a radical party. It is the party of change for change's sake, not for planned change. Let there be no doubt about it, the GST is the Opposition's attempt to differentiate itself.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members talk about the GST as though it will change things. The GST will change very little. I will tell honourable members why it will change very little. Tax is not the problem in society today. While Opposition members rail about it and talk about the lack of incentive, dishonest people would cheat if the tax rate were 15c in the dollar. They would still cheat. Honest people pay their taxes. When people say, `I'm not going to work because tax takes all my money from me' they are really saying, `I'm prepared to trade off extra money for leisure time'. I do not think that is a very bad thing. </PARA>

I note that the United Nations ranked Australia seventh out of 130 countries. When those opposite paint this black picture, as they are wont to do, they are talking down the economy. There are problems with the Australian economy and I have actually spoken and written about these issues. But those opposite are a mile off. Their taxation policy has a cohort in the form of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's industrial relations policy will not improve productivity and it will not improve the job situation. It will cause enormous animosity in the community. The problem is that until we get some manufacturing industry there will be no jobs. This is the thing that I do not think the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) understands. But, quite clearly, the Leader of the Opposition does not understand it and, judging from the diatribe from the honourable member for La Trobe, he does not understand it either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He talks about the evils of tariffs. Let us look at the tariff situation. Australian tariff protection grew under Liberal-National Party governments. Black Jack McEwen installed it. It is the Labor Government which has been reducing those tariffs and continues to reduce them; not those opposite. They are unlikely to reduce them because some of the people who have benefited most from those tariffs are the large employers&mdash;the people whom you support and who support you. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that reducing tariffs blindly is the answer. There are some areas in which we cannot be competitive. No matter how productive we are we will not be competitive with the very cheap labour of the rice bowl of Asia. Those opposite can talk about becoming more competitive with Asia, but I do not want my kids working for Asian wages. That is not the future for Australia. We must get into manufacturing where we have the expertise and ability to get into niche markets. There are a lot of those opportunities around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for La Trobe said that we do not understand business. We are the ones who reduced company tax from 46 per cent to 39 per cent. We are the ones who introduced imputation. If I had a preference, I would not have done it that way. I would have been inclined to tax the benefits of people who hold shares and exempt companies from company tax. That would have been my strategy. Industry had been asking for imputation for years and years and its cries had fallen on deaf ears. Those opposite were the people in power here.

He said we should allow Asian labour into our factories in order to produce things more cheaply. I suppose he thinks we will bring them in on some sort of contract wage. He says how successful this has been in Germany. But if one reads the newspapers one would suspect that things are not going all that well in Germany. It is a country which gives its workers far better fringe benefits than we give ours, it gives them more holiday pay, longer holidays and a higher hourly rate of pay. But it also has this phenomenon of cheap labour. That is something we must steer well clear of. </PARA>

Because the British were not prepared to take out their own garbage, they put strains into that society which will reverberate through that economy and that society for years and years. There are people in Australia who want to do this. We can say, `This German bears no relation to Australia'. That is okay.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the few moments I have available to me in the debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Fringe Benefits Tax Measures) Bill, I want to range more widely on the issue of tax. If Australia really has such a great tax system, as has been espoused in this House tonight while debating amendments, I think Australians really have to ask: why is Australia in such a great mess?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a massive increase in bankruptcies in Australia. I have some statistics, some of which have come out only within the last 24 hours. I have belonged to business in my time and understand that many of those businesses are going out of the back door because of the imposition of one tax on top of another&mdash;one Federal tax, one State tax, one local government tax, until they can bear it no longer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have to look at the issue of one million people in Australia who want to have a job but cannot get one. Has that been the creation of the greatest equitable tax system we have ever had in Australia? We are not counting the number of people who want to improve their work situation from a casual basis to a full time basis. We have between 1.5 million and 2 million people in Australia who want to work on a full time basis. The most recent estimate from Treasury indicated that next year unemployment will increase over and above what it is this year. If we have such a great system, why do these things happen?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been indicated that our foreign debt which just 10 years ago was $22 billion has increased to $150 billion. If we take the decrease in the exchange rate of the dollar, it probably stands at about $160 billion or $170 billion today. It is not taxation that is hindering business and progress in this country, it is real high interest rates which are discouraging business and discouraging people from borrowing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We talk about massive foreign investment. I will give honourable members three examples in my electorate. Two abattoirs are now 70 per cent owned by foreign business because no Australian finances were available for them; Club Med is opening tomorrow with an investment of about $55m&mdash;all foreign investment; Aqua Del Ray with a $1 billion potential&mdash;all foreign investment. This has occurred because the tax system we have in Australia today has not allowed people to have disposable income. Instead, they have put their money into fixed savings and superannuations, money which is not available for this type of thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complaint I hear is not so much about foreign ownership but that we cannot go into a shop in Australia and buy Australian produced food. Australian businesses are being forced out of business; they are being forced offshore. A very pertinent point was made in the last fortnight by Tony O'Reilly from Heinz. He said that people would not invest in Australia because of the cost of production, wages, taxes&mdash;the whole lot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why, if our tax system is so good, do we have this recession that we `had to have'? We have heard tonight about gaps in the Fightback package. I discount and deny that there are those gaps. Labor has never mentioned once its gap of $13.4 billion in the last Budget and it claims to be the lowest taxing party. The graph is there.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) There were many factors influencing an individual's decision of which scheme to choose. Projected length of service was one important consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) 288 officers from the former supplementary list, who are serving on short service appointments, were reviewed with the aim of offering them transfer to an open ended appointment or extension of their current short service appointment, or advising them that no further service would be offered at the completion of their current appointments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The criteria for the review depended on future manpower structures of the RAN as well as personal performance. Included in the review were members on initial short service appointments which would expire before the end of 1994, those on extended short service appointments and those whose short service appointments would have expired when they accrue between 15 and 20 years of service. 413 officers on short service appointments were not considered and will be considered in subsequent reviews.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) &amp; (7) There has never been a commitment to offer open ended appointments to officers on short service appointments nor has continued employment been assured to members after their initial period of short service. The express purpose of the short service appointment is to supplement the number of open ended appointment officers in order to meet the overall requirement for trained manpower in the RAN.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) All officers had 12 months from 1 October 1991 to make a decision. Information was provided to all members on their individual superannuation benefits and of the benefits offered by both schemes. In addition, the circular letter reminded members of the Hotline number which could be contacted for information or assistance. The majority of officers not considered in the review had served for less than seven years at 30 September 1992 and there was no guarantee of reaching 20 years service to be eligible for DFRDB benefits. Those with between 15-20 years service were reviewed and given a firm commitment. It was possible to make a decision based on the information provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) No. The election period of twelve months from 1 October 1991 to 30 September 1992 is embodied in substantive legislation which had the support of all Parties in its passage through the Parliament.</PARA>
