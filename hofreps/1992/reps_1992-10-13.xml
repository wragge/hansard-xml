<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to his statement yesterday that he had not received advice from Treasury about the ongoing deterioration of the world economy and the threat that that deterioration presents to the Government's economic growth forecasts. I also refer the Treasurer to a report in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> that just such a Treasury assessment was given to the Government on 23 September. I ask the Treasurer: is this report accurate, and why did he conceal its existence when asked about it yesterday?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question that the honourable member asked me yesterday concerned an assessment of the world economy. I have received no such assessment of the world economy which would lead me, or indeed lead the Treasury, to change the estimates or forecasts for growth this year. Yes, it is true that the Treasury provided, as it does on a continuing basis, information about developments within the domestic economy. Much of the contents of that note I included in my response to the honourable member yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. The industry response to the Government's announcement of last week has been extremely positive. The package itself represents an important step forward for the industry. It involves phasing out of government support by 1999, whilst providing the framework for growth and the development of a more vertically integrated industry. It recognises that the future for our wheat industry lies in a freer world trading environment and a greater commitment to do more than just trade the commodity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this package the Government has also had regard for the particular circumstances confronting the industry by agreeing to maintain the export monopoly for the Australian Wheat Board in the absence of a conclusion to the Uruguay Round. This recognises that in a world trading environment which is corrupted by the lunacy of massive EC and US subsidies the monopoly provides our most effective mechanism to protect the interests of our growers. I might say that pessimistic media reports this morning about US-EC talks in Brussels appear to be premature. The real challenge at this critical stage is the exercise of a political will at the highest level to achieve an outcome prior to the US presidential elections next month. That remains possible, in my view, because it is in President Bush's strongest interests to push for such a conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the package, the GCA, the Grains Council of Australia, has agreed that that monopoly position should be reviewed subject to the progress in the Uruguay Round. In fact, the whole package has the agreement of the Grains Council of Australia. This is another example of this Government's capacity to work with industry and to get industry agreement to achieve growth strategies within the broader discipline of phasing down government support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the Opposition could not have developed this outcome. The package itself is not policy by edict; it is not driven by the textbook. The Government is consulting with and working policy out with industry, and industry has recognised that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the industry comment is concerned, there are reams of support for this package from the industry itself.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It probably will be put on the list. On the question of price underwriting, unlike the Leader of the National Party's policy approach on trade&mdash;which he is still keeping a secret, I might add&mdash;the honourable member for Murray at least had the preparedness to put in a letter to the Grains Council of Australia on 11 August which said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition's wheat policy has not altered since 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no pressure on us to change our policy.</PARA>
<PARA>He confirmed the Opposition's policy for a 95 per cent price underwriting scheme for wheat. No pressure&mdash;no pressure, indeed!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How do we reconcile that commitment about no change since 1989 with a statement made by the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age  </EMPHASIS>of 6 April 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition Leader, Dr Hewson, said he opposed a floor-price scheme for wheat farmers. . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said it was right to provide assistance to the industry during a difficult period, but he did not believe a minimum price scheme was the answer. "The last thing you want to do with an efficient industry is to make it inefficient", he said.</PARA>
<PARA>In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of the same day, the Leader of the Opposition is reported as saying that the Western Australian Government's proposal for price underwriting was `a stunt'. That is really calling it as it is. In June of this year the Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order under standing order 145 on the matter of relevance. Clearly, the question was asking about wheat policy.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question is about price underwriting. I am highlighting the fact that we on this side have rejected that approach, but that there is division on the other side of the House as to where those opposite stand on the point. I continue quoting what the Leader of the Opposition said in June of this year:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If I've stood for anything since I became Leader of the Opposition . . . it is for my absolute determination to call it the way it is, to call for what needs to be done irrespective of the short term political consequences . . . We want to demonstrate a particular determination to govern in the interests of all Australians, not by deals, not by looking after special vested interest groups.</PARA>
<PARA>That certainly explains the coalition's general approach to industry policy. For example, it would effectively decimate the automobile and sugar industries.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But how do those opposite then explain a specific policy that singles out the wheat industry? They explain it this way: it is an empty promise made by the Deputy Leader of the National Party and it would not be delivered in government. The Nationals would simply be rolled over on this issue, as they have been comprehensively rolled over before. Price underwriting is special treatment. It comes at a huge cost to the taxpayer and, aside from its ideological backflip, where are the outlay figures in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that the coalition has a sham policy in relation to price underwriting. That policy stands in stark contrast to the practical outcome of the agreed industry strategy which I announced last week. The Government has given hope to the wheat industry and that industry has acknowledged it. The rural sector is working with us and it is walking away from the National Party, just as the National Party has allowed itself to be walked over.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer.

Was the Treasurer's answer based on the confidential Treasury minute dated 23 September? If so, is it not reasonable to assume that this advice is out of date, because on 2 October the OECD announced that it had substantially revised down its forecast for OECD growth from 2.2 per cent to 1.5 per cent?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of concerns in the tourism industry of proposals to impose new taxes on tourism in Australia? What measures has the Government in place to encourage and develop the tourism industry? Is the Prime Minister confident that the tourism industry will continue to grow in Australia as one of our major export earners?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1973" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The freedoms which the Government introduced to the economy in the 1980s saw the tourism industry blossom in such a way that 2.4 million people visited Australia in 1991. That is up over 155 per cent on the figure eight years earlier. In fact, tourism now accounts for 10 per cent of our total export earnings. My colleague the Minister for Tourism, in his national tourism strategy, indicated that 200,000 additional jobs can be created in this industry alone by the year 2000. That is, this industry is an efficient industry but it has a relatively high labour content. It is now one of Australia's biggest export earners, and is growing rapidly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has done a lot to promote the industry with reforms to aviation, by promotion through the tourism commission, by changes to tax treatment of buildings, plant and equipment in the tourism sectors and, of course, by developments in roads, et cetera. But, of course, the Opposition wants to tax the tourism industry with a 15 per cent goods and services tax. No wonder the industry is up in arms. The coalition is saying it wants to take the burden off industry, particularly export industries; yet it intends to impose a 15 per cent tax. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very interested in what Mr John Dart, the President of the Australian Federation of Travel Agents, had to say recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A lot of our members are small operators, and particularly up in the Northern Territory, which is a good example, where there are a lot of little guys with three and four Land Rovers, if you like small mini-buses, and doing a great job.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But with Fightback there are no offsets. There are no offsets in terms of the Fightback package because there is no payroll tax offset, and in many cases there is nothing else. So in essence the price of their product is going up by 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, you will notice in the advertisements which the Opposition is now running on television that I am depicted in a factory. The scam is that of the 700,000 businesses in this country, only 100,000 pay payroll tax, so the other 600,000 would receive no benefit by way of payroll tax reduction&mdash;no benefit. You will notice that it is a relatively large factory, because if it was put in a relatively small factory it would have been a distortion of the fact that it would have received any payroll tax offset.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This person is making the claim that most of the small tourism operators around Australia will get no payroll tax relief at all; in fact, most small businesses will get no payroll tax relief under the Fightback package; they will just wear the GST as a principal burden. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Look, I am going to ignore this because our families represent 500,000 workers and we have got families, possibly 1 1/2 million people who are affected . . . Many tourists would prefer to travel to destinations such as Bali, Fiji or Singapore than travel within Australia under Fightback because they will wear the 15 per cent tax.</PARA>
<PARA>Then we had this question from the Opposition spokesman for tourism, the honourable member for Fadden, in October 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I ask you, is it fair if you apply a GST to a loaf of bread and you don't apply it to a holiday in Hawaii?</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very good question. There was a report commissioned between the Australian Tourism Industry Association and the coalition, which is signed by the honourable member and Mr O'Clery. It says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Australian tourism industry and all members of the coalition ATIA joint committee believe that measures must be adopted to mitigate the adverse relative price impacts of the GST package on Australian tourism industry operators.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They recommend a series of measures. The document goes on in a similar vein, and it quotes Ernst and Young:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall it is a labour intensive value adding service operation often delivered by a small business. The Australian tourism industry is likely to incur a relatively large one-off cost and price impact on the implementation of the GST. The industry understands that it does not relish the prospect from its own perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They then in this report articulate a series of proposals to help the industry&mdash;none can help remove the 15 per cent GST impact. One suggestion is that Australian tour packages prepurchased overseas by international visitors should be zero rated, so that if an international tourist who comes to Australia buys the package out of the United States it is zero rated. The Opposition will not zero rate food, but it will zero rate tourist packages or consider it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report then talks about the deductibility of legitimate business expenses. The Opposition wants to get onto that old ramp again, as if in any way that can deal with the problem's source, which is a 15 per cent tax on hotel rooms and every service delivered in the tourism sector, including flights. Then it goes on to talk about depreciation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee unanimously agrees that depreciation allowances should as far as possible reflect effective economic life. To this end, the Committee recommends that short term traveller accommodation be subject to an amortisation rate of 7 1/2 per cent rather than the present 4.</PARA>
<PARA>Will that help someone with four Land Rovers in the Northern Territory? Will it help someone who already has a hotel? Will it help anybody who already has a building? In other words, what you are saying to the big hotel groups is, `We'll go along with the fiction that you can write a hotel off in 13 or 14 years and we will pay that from the Commonwealth Treasury so you can pay money into our political slush fund'. That is what that is about; it is not about helping anyone in the tourism sector.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition is asking why I increased the rate from 2 1/2 to 4 per cent. I will explain it slowly for him: 4 per cent into 100 equals 25 years&mdash;a 25-year amortisation. That is not 13 for a building. I notice that the Hooker Corporation said recently:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of traveller accommodation, the combined effect of the One Nation changes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, that 2.5 to 4 per cent&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and lower inflation is to increase the real value of depreciation write-offs by a massive 116 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>It concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is therefore an important observation that in present value terms investment in plant, buildings and equipment is now far less costly than was the case 12 months ago.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the real value of depreciation written off by 116 per cent; yet the Leader of the Opposition is considering jacking up the 4 per cent to 7 1/2 per cent to increase that 116 per cent more substantially. But it does not even deal with the problem at source, which is a 15 per cent tax on all tourism services across the country. All the people who have their hotels and motels and their tourist buses already as capital stock will have no relief from anything else. This would simply be a sop to the large hotels in the large hotel groups, presumably on the basis that they backhand the Liberal Party's financial position; in other words, `Let the Commonwealth Budget pay and you can give us recompense in our slush fund'.

Let me make it clear that there will always be a range of forecasts of what is happening to the Australian economy. Let me explain as simply as I can that the reason why there are forecasts included in the Budget is that they have budgetary implications.

What does that leave to pay for the $13 billion of tax cuts? It is $1 billion. Where is the $12 billion of tax cuts going to come from? It will come from cutting into Government spending, including support for the unemployed, which the Leader of the Opposition has the temerity to ask about, and ripping back on payments to schools and transfer payments in the social security system.</PARA></TALK.START>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1984" SPEAKER="Blewett The Hon N." NAMEID="VE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BONYTHON" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Cowan for her question and also for the work she has done in relation to this issue. She knows, as do those people who have worked with age pensioners, that many of them who own their own home often have real difficulty in raising small amounts of capital&mdash;a few hundred dollars or a few thousand dollars&mdash;for home renovations, home maintenance such as the repair of a roof and things like that, or for buying certain basic home appliances. These people have frequently got substantial equity tied up in their own homes, but they lack capital for repairs, renovations and capital goods. It always seemed a sensible solution to enable these pensioners to borrow money against the value of their homes and not have to pay it back until they vacate their homes or have it taken out of their estates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989, with the cooperation of the Government, a few of the financial institutions offered home equity conversion loans; that is, where pensioners could borrow up to $40,000 from a bank or other financial institution against the value of their home. There were some successes from that program. While a number of the banks and financial institutions were prepared to offer substantial loans of $30,000 to $40,000, they were very reluctant to offer small loans because of the administrative costs involved. Yet, on the evidence, it was often the small loans that the age pensioners required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus in this year's Budget we brought forward a new home equity loans scheme whereby small loans would be available to pensioner home owners. The Government would underwrite the scheme so that it would be viable both for the bank or financial institution and for the pensioner. Therefore, from April 1993 we plan that pensioners under 75 will be able to borrow up to $5,000 per year, and pensioners over 75 will be able to borrow up to $7,500 per year. These loans will be repaid on the permanent vacation of the pensioner's home or from the pensioner's estate and there will be no ongoing payment required. As the Budget indicates, in 1992-93 the Government will provide $2 1/2m to underwrite that scheme and $10m in a full year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very happy to tell the House that the selection of a particular financial institution to run that scheme is now well on track. We have had nine expressions of interest from financial institutions and the tender documents were sent to those nine institutions last week. We would hope, therefore, to finalise the contract with the successful loan provider by the end of 1992. Information will be sent out to pensioners in the new year, as soon as that contract is settled, and the first loans will be available from April 1993. The financial information service of my Department will be very much involved in advising pensioners how to make the best use of this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to the question by the honourable member for Cowan, this is an innovative, imaginative scheme. It is relatively inexpensive; it does answer a real need; and it shows how this Government is responding to the real needs of pensioners.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very serious motion. Let us deal with the first point in relation to a matter being raised while the House was in division. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) made a big point about the House being in division. The truth of the matter is that while ever the Speaker occupies the chair of the House he is custodian of the proceedings of the House. He has absolute responsibility for ensuring fair play as he acts out that role. On 4 March 1986 he stated, `All the Speaker is is a referee'. What we ask of the Speaker, in terms of this motion, is that he be a fair referee in handling what happened within a division and subsequently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that when we came out of the division the honourable member for Bennelong again stood and correctly brought matters to your attention by way of a point of order. By this stage of the proceedings we were out of the division. So no technicality which the Leader of the House will put up will stand in a defence of the fact that, at that time, the House was out of division. Mr Speaker, you were in the chair and you were asked to rule, in all fairness, that the remarks made and repeated should be withdrawn. The Prime Minister should have been asked to withdraw those remarks in the interests of direct compliance with the Standing Orders, the conventions of the Parliament and the spirit of fair play. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what applied when the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) subsequently took a point of order out of division.

<PARA>It is very clear-cut that the core problem which led to this incident this afternoon was that the Prime Minister was guilty. One must consider this stage by stage as we deal with the motion. The starting point was the Prime Minister's remarks. In accord with standing order 75, the Prime Minister was wrong to make those remarks. Standing order 76 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections on Members shall be considered highly disorderly.</PARA>

<PARA>It was this point that the honourable member for Bennelong quite correctly raised in his motion of dissent and drew to your attention outside the division. The Prime Minister was still in the chamber at the time. Your choice on the matter is very limited by the standing order and that is why we object to your ruling, Mr Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Standing order 77 says that `the Speaker shall intervene' in those circumstances. There is no doubt that the words involved at the core of the dispute were offensive, utterly objectionable and totally unnecessary. It is in that context under standing order 77 that our case is carried by dint of a debate and, hopefully, will be carried by some of those members opposite who have given the Government away. I refer to the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott) and others who are absenting themselves from the Parliament.

It is essential to good order in this House that your ruling ought to be upheld, both in detail and in general. Opposition speakers, on many occasions during their speeches on this matter, have managed to get away with constant reflections upon yourself. They might have got away with that if they had pulled the right motion out of the file instead of the wrong one, which was dissent from the Speaker's ruling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The defence of yourself in this regard, Mr Speaker, is very simple and it relies on two things. In some ways they are mutually contradictory, but they will do for the purposes of this particular exercise. The first goes to the interpretation of what is taking place during the course of a division. If you determine other than the way in which you determine was the way in which you ought to conduct affairs during a division, this would go also for a reasonable interpretation of what goes on in the course of debate when it is not compromised in some way or another by a division being in progress. I would rely on both of those points. They would suffice no matter what particular interpretation you decided to make on what was going on during the course of a division or what inhibitions there are on members during the process of a division. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point that I would make in defence of your ruling in this regard&mdash;and this might be a contested point&mdash;is that during a division normal Standing Orders do not necessarily go into abeyance, but they are much altered. It is obvious that they are much altered because of the considerable warnings that are issued to all honourable members in this place when a division is taking place. During those divisions honourable members are frequently very lackadaisical about their own interests and unmindful of the things that might well happen to them. During a division they are not protected by privilege. A normal debate is not going on. The sorts of processes that are in place to protect honourable members during ordinary debate do not apply during a division and honourable members should have good regard for that. So in the normal course of events protection against disorderly words or whatever in the course of a division is a protection which can be taken to the law courts as opposed to this place. That is the first point I would make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, of course, a general requirement to maintain order in the House. Obviously if there were in this place during a division total furore, other elements of the Standing Orders, including the general implicit standing order that the Speaker's capacity to keep order in this House must be upheld by all honourable members, would then apply. That is something which the Opposition does not want to hear. The conduct of those opposite during Question Time is to harass you and to generally create a disorderly impression in the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second point in defence of the Standing Orders goes to a standing order which has not been frequently quoted by those opposite, which would apply whether or not the particular interchange in question was taking place during a division or in a debate. I refer to standing order 78. We got a very good run through on standing orders 75, 76 and 77, and such a terrific run through on standing order 75 from the Opposition member who spoke recently, that we could be forgiven for believing that the Prime Minister was allegedly offending a member of the judiciary. That may say something about the hopes of the honourable member for Pearce upon leaving this place, but it is not terribly germane to what is contained in the Standing Orders. What is germane is standing order 78, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the attention of the Speaker is drawn to words used, he shall determine whether or not they are offensive or disorderly.</PARA>
<PARA>The Speaker is entitled to interpret whether or not remarks are offensive or disorderly in any way he chooses. During a heated debate in this chamber honourable members exchange views on this and that, and sometimes very vigorously, and the Speaker operates on the assumption that we are not all permanently shrinking violets and precious little things. We are elected to this place to be sufficiently robust human beings able to take a bit as well as dishing it out during a heated debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is precisely what takes place. If the Speaker were strictly and permanently to uphold every jot and tittle of standing orders 75, 76 and 77, virtually nothing would be said in this Parliament, except a sort of bucolic wave in which we would preciously bow to each other with great distinction and gravity but not very much would be transacted in this place. It would be a totally unrealistic view of what happens in parliament. Qualifying all those other standing orders, what we have instead, sensibly, is this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the attention of the Speaker is drawn to words used, he shall determine whether or not they are offensive or disorderly.</PARA>
<PARA>The commonsense operation of this Parliament requires that, if it is not going to descend into total mayhem and the normally robust debate in this place is not going to be allowed to go from being normally robust to utter chaos, then all members in this place must respect the Speaker's capacity to make a sensible determination under that provision as to whether or not the particular words uttered at any time could in the context of the debate that was taking place be regarded as disorderly. That is a sensible, permissive position for the Speaker to be in. When the Speaker decides to make a ruling under those provisions, there should not be harassment from either side of this House. If he is not given that freedom by honourable members, then this chamber simply cannot function. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to inform the House of the outcome of the visit I made to Japan, Singapore and Cambodia between 20 and 26 September. This overseas visit was my third since becoming Prime Minister. All three visits have been to Asia-Pacific countries. All three visits have helped put a sharper focus on Australia's relations with the region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A primary objective of each visit has been to talk with other regional leaders about how we can work together to respond to the fluid outlook in the region. But, just as importantly, I have also wanted to underline to both Australian and foreign audiences how much the Australian economy has shifted towards an international orientation, especially an Asia-Pacific orientation; how much Australia has already achieved in the region; and how much our future depends on successfully carrying forward this engagement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than is sometimes appreciated, the Asia-Pacific region is in the midst of a period of profound transition. The strategic consequences of the end of the Cold War are still working themselves out. The regional security outlook is generally favourable, but less predictable than before. The peace process in Cambodia, which involves an ambitious role for the United Nations, confronts a serious test of its sustainability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fluidity in the international trading environment is increased by uncertainty about the outcome of the Uruguay Round. Whatever the outcome of the round, we shall probably see an increasing trend towards regional, subregional, and bilateral trade arrangements. Regional governments are now required to develop policy responses to what could well be a rapidly evolving pattern of trade alignments. Asia-Pacific countries also need to consider how international and regional institutions can better reflect the growing weight of the region in world affairs, and the increasing importance of intra-regional linkages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My visit to Japan was very worth while in consolidating with the Japanese Government the strong community of interest we have with it in responding to these important questions. The Australian public understands very well Japan's significance in our external relations. Japan is the world's second largest national economy, accounting for about 14 per cent of global output. It has been our largest trading partner since 1970. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps more than is generally appreciated in this country, Australia is also an important regional partner of Japan. We are Japan's third largest source of imports and sixth largest trading partner. The bilateral trade relationship, now worth around $A24 billion, is one of the principal sinews of economic interdependence in the western Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The close dialogue between the two governments on regional and international issues reflects the habit of friendship and cooperation that has grown up between the two countries in recent years. Certainly, the warmth of my reception by the Japanese Government and the quality of my discussions with Prime Minister Miyazawa and his Ministers attest to the maturity of the relationship that we now enjoy with Japan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comments of Mr Miyazawa and his Ministers reflected, I think, a realistic view of the international scene. There was cautious optimism that the Japanese economy would return to a stronger growth path from the end of this year. There was a determination, which I supported, that Japan should play a more active role in international affairs. I affirmed Australian support for Japan's permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council so that the world body can better reflect changed world circumstances. I welcomed Japan's decision to participate in United Nations peacekeeping operations and the opportunity this provides for our military and civilian personnel to work together in support of the Cambodia peace process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I discussed international and bilateral trade issues with both Prime Minister Miyazawa and International Trade and Industry Minister Watanabe. They acknowledged an uneasiness in Japanese political and business circles about the increasing trend to preferential trade arrangements. Prime Minister Miyazawa expressed the personal view that an open and non-discriminatory multilateral trading system could be maintained despite these developments. He made clear his Government's deep commitment to a cooperative relationship with the United States and its support for an early and successful outcome of the Uruguay Round. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In underlining the importance of the bilateral trade relationship with MITI Minister Watanabe, I said that Australia would not be party to any trade arrangement which was directed against Japan. This commitment was reciprocated by his assurance that Japan would conduct its trade on a commercial basis without discrimination against Australia's interests in any arrangements with third countries. He reiterated this undertaking in the particular case of Australia's exports of automobile parts to Japan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In discussing the outlook for the Uruguay Round, I urged Japan not to hold back on the rice tariffication issue because otherwise it ran the risk of being portrayed by others as a final obstacle to a settlement on agriculture. The Japanese Government acknowledged the responsibility it faced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My discussions with Japanese Ministers also covered the need for expanded bilateral air services to cater for the expected increase in tourist traffic, MITI's support for Australia's trade promotion in Japanese regional centres, and Japanese involvement in the MFP project in Adelaide. In a general discussion of defence relations, I confirmed the Government's satisfaction with the current moderate level of activity, which includes high-level visits and dialogue on strategic issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government attaches considerable importance to the Asia-Pacific economic cooperation or APEC process as an essential mechanism for promoting open regionalism. I explained to Prime Minister Miyazawa the thinking behind my proposal for establishing over the medium term a process for periodic heads of government meetings based on APEC membership. Such meetings would add political weight and status to the APEC process. They would fill a significant gap in institutional arrangements in the region, enabling leaders to consult together in a way which has become familiar in European and trans-Atlantic relations. I was encouraged by a marked firming of Japanese support for the proposal. Prime Minister Miyazawa welcomed the initiative and agreed that the idea should be pursued further in consultation with other members of the region. Former Prime Minister Takeshita also firmly supported the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A special feature of the visit was my agreement with  Prime Minister Miyazawa to issue a joint statement setting out for the public record an account of the regional perspectives which figured prominently in our discussions. The statement demonstrates convincingly the extent of parallel interests we share with Japan in regional strategic and economic issues and the potential we have for working together productively in the region. It also makes clear that the cooperative relationship we aim to pursue with Japan is by no means an exclusive one. Rather, it is directed towards broad-based cooperation with other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including especially the United States. I now table the joint statement for reference by honourable members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My program in Tokyo included an audience with the Emperor and Empress of Japan. On behalf of the Australian Government, I invited Their Majesties to visit Australia whenever mutually agreeable to the two governments. The invitation was warmly received, but because of prior consideration of other possible overseas visits it may be some time before the visit takes place. I am sure that an official visit to Australia by the Emperor and Empress will be welcomed by the vast majority of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My visit to Japan included substantial contact with senior Japanese business and financial leaders and with the Japanese media. I impressed on these audiences the progress that has been achieved in making the Australian economy more competitive and internationally oriented and the commitment of the Australian Government, private sector and wider community to strengthening Australia's relations with the Asia-Pacific region. These contacts were very useful in registering with Japanese opinion leaders the changing nature and focus of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following my program in Tokyo, I made the first visit by an Australian Prime Minister to Nagoya, Japan's fourth largest city and the centre of a large industrial and trading region. </PARA>
<PARA>I took part in public ceremonies to mark the opening of an Australian consulate in Nagoya. This is one of four new consulates we are opening this year in Japan to strengthen our trade promotion in regional centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also visited the headquarters of the Toyota Motor Corporation and inspected technologically advanced production processes at its Motomachi plant, which will serve as the parent plant for the new Toyota car factory at Altona in Victoria.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his welcoming address at a lunch given in my honour, the Toyota President said his Corporation's investment at Altona was predicated on the Australian Government's car industry policy persisting into the twenty-first century, and that consistent government policy and harmonious labour relations were always important to the car industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My visit to Singapore on 24 and 25 September reinforced the longstanding partnership between our two countries. Singapore is Australia's fourth largest export market and our largest trading partner among the ASEAN countries. Australia and Singapore maintain close defence relations, both bilaterally and under the five power defence arrangements, which also involve Malaysia, Britain and New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My reception in Singapore was very warm. I had extensive discussions with Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, Deputy Prime Minister and Trade and Industry Minister Brigadier-General Lee Hsien Loong, and Defence Minister Yeo Ning Hong. Prime Minister Goh said our bilateral relationship was in excellent shape and that Australia and Singapore were following similar strategies in the region. He welcomed Australia's efforts to engage more closely with Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My discussions with Singapore leaders confirmed a broad range of agreement on regional issues, including the need to maintain an open trading system and support for promoting the APEC process. I congratulated the Singapore Government on its successful bid to host the APEC secretariat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major feature of my program in Singapore was participation in a very successful business seminar on the theme of strategic linkages between Singapore and Australian companies. The seminar was well attended by senior business representatives from both sides, including 28 very senior Australian business leaders who visited Singapore especially for the occasion. It provided an excellent opportunity for me and the Australian business people to explain the important ways in which the Australian economy is becoming more open and commercially integrated into the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accompanied by Defence Minister Yeo, I visited HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Brisbane</EMPHASIS>, one of eight Australian ships which had just participated in a large-scale maritime and air defence exercise under the five power defence arrangements. The Singapore Government made clear the value it places on defence cooperation with Australia, including our active role in the five power arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the same trip abroad I visited Cambodia on 26 September. It was the first visit by an Australian Prime Minister since 1966, the first by a Western head of government since 1970, and the first by any head of government since the signing of the Paris Peace Accords in October last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My brief visit served two important purposes. I was able to underline Australia's firm support for the peace process at a time when serious difficulties have been caused by the refusal of the Khmer Rouge to participate in the cantonment and demobilisation phase. I was also able to reaffirm the Government's warm appreciation of the efforts of the Australian military and civilian personnel serving with the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia and of the important contribution by Australian aid workers serving with non-government organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other members of the House have visited Cambodia since the signing of the peace settlement. I know they will support me in saying that all these dedicated and professional men and women are earning a high reputation for Australia in Cambodia. Australia can be truly proud of its contribution towards peace and a better way of life for the Cambodian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had detailed discussions with Prince Sihanouk, the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative, Mr Akashi, and the UNTAC Military Commander, Lieutenant-General Sanderson. Without underestimating the complexity and difficulty of problems which lie ahead, I was heartened by the determination of these key individuals to press ahead with UN-organised elections by around May next year, with or without participation by the Khmer Rouge. I assured them that Australia remained firm in its commitment to support a peace process whose outcome is a democratically elected government which can be recognised and supported by the international community. I said Australia wants to persevere so long as there is a responsible way forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am confident that my visit to Japan, Singapore and Cambodia has put Australia in a better position to deal with the challenges we face in the region. I was pleased that my visit to Japan and Singapore generated considerable public comment about Australia's trade policy options. These are crucial issues for our country. It is important that Parliament and the public have a clear understanding of where our national interest lies. In recognition of Australia's position as a medium-sized trading nation with considerable diversity in the composition and direction of our trade, the Government attaches fundamental importance to maintaining and strengthening the open, non-discriminatory multilateral trading system based on the GATT. As part of this, we accord high priority to an early and successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. The benefits of a multilateral agreement, which extends international trade rules to cover agriculture and services and which also strengthens the disciplines and dispute-settling procedures of GATT, are so overwhelming for a country like Australia that there is no need for me to describe them to this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also firmly committed to promote the development of APEC as an organisation which embraces the main economic linkages between the Western Pacific and North America. We also remain willing to seize trade opportunities and solve trade problems whenever and wherever they arise, whether bilaterally or plurilaterally, whether in a particular class of exports or with a particular country or group of countries. This kind of work is so constant and so detailed, so ordinary and unspectacular a part of the everyday work of our trade officials and of the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Mr Kerin) that we sometimes forget quite how much goes on. These three tasks&mdash;the GATT, APEC, and the everyday work of facilitating trade&mdash;remain at the core of our trade policy. But, as we enter this new era of uncertainty in the direction of the world trading system and in the strategic decisions of the major trading economies, I wish to describe the Government's approach in deciding emerging trade policy issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For better or worse, the Uruguay Round is coming to an end. Whatever the outcome, this will free the energies of trade policy makers and make clear the internationally agreed benchmarks upon which bilateral and regional trade enhancement can be created. If the Round fails, there will remain a vast agenda of reform in agriculture and services trade which should be addressed by some other means. Even if the Round succeeds in one form or another, there will remain plenty of room for further agreements which improve on its outcomes. As I said at the beginning of this statement, the trend towards regional, subregional and bilateral trade arrangements will probably strengthen. The European Community will certainly spread eastwards, even if there is now some doubt about the pace of deepening integration between the existing members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">NAFTA has now been signed by the governments of Canada, the United States and Mexico, and we expect that in one form or another it will be approved by the US Congress next year. We expect further links will be established between the United States and various Latin American countries. In our own region, APEC has been institutionalised with the creation of a secretariat in Singapore, while the ASEAN countries are now moving to establish their own free trade agreement. There is plenty of evidence of increased regionalism in trade institutions. There is also evidence of increased regionalism in trade patterns. Between 1970 and 1991 trade between Western European countries grew from 66 to 72 per cent of their total trade, and that between the APEC countries grew from 54 to 65 per cent of their total. So the end of the Uruguay Round is coming at the same time as Australia is changing profoundly and as regionalism becomes more important, and it is also at a time of new uncertainty over the trade strategy of the world's biggest economy, the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his recent Detroit speech, President Bush raised the possibility of negotiating trade arrangements with individual countries, including some in Eastern Europe and some in the Pacific. In the Pacific he instanced Australia, the ASEAN countries and Korea. No formal proposal has been put to Australia, but the issue is of such importance to our trading future that we cannot wait its full development before we make our own views known. Our overriding objective is to do all we can to preserve and enhance a trading environment in which our major markets remain as open to us as possible and these markets remain open to each other. We must never lose sight of the fact that most of our trade, and the fastest growing part of our trade, is now with other countries in the Western Pacific. We must also not lose sight of the fact that many of these countries are highly dependent on the US market. Finally, we must not lose sight of the fact that many of our trade partners are also our trade competitors in third country markets. Those considerations will guide us in what may well be a fluid and fast-changing external environment over the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the institutional forms and arrangements into which we may be prepared to enter, we are open-minded. We certainly do not rule out bilateral agreements or plurilateral agreements. Indeed, we may well initiate them, and we are of course a member of a strong bilateral arrangement with New Zealand. But some bilateral agreements are better than others, and some may deliver few bilateral trade benefits while potentially incurring substantial trade costs. The Government welcomed President Bush's Detroit speech in the sense that it demonstrated an interest in further promoting trade liberalisation in the Pacific area. The Opposition made an enthusiastic embrace of a preferential bilateral agreement with the United States despite having a week earlier labelled the United States as Australia's number one trade enemy. The Government's approach is more calibrated. We have reservations about the specific mechanism of a network of bilateral preferential trade agreements centred on the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty for Australia works at several levels. First, the Government would want to consider seriously any offer of a bilateral agreement with the United States which would reduce import constraints on those items of most concern to us&mdash;particularly beef, dairy products, sugar and steel. But experience suggests that such concessions would be unlikely because of congressional attitudes and other domestic pressures in the United States. Secondly, the perception in East Asia of any move by Australia and the United States to conclude a bilateral trade agreement would vary greatly depending on whether it was seen as part of a broader, even-handed approach throughout the region, or whether it was seen as part of a strategy to put pressure on the North Asian economies, particularly Japan. In the latter case, Australia would be seen as turning our back on East Asia despite the fact that it accounts for almost six times more of our exports than the United States. Thirdly, while we can understand why some Americans advocate bilateral trade arrangements on a hub and spokes model as a way of improving US trade access, the countries at the ends of the spokes may find that this approach does not help trade between them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A report on regional trade agreements prepared for the Government earlier this year by Professor Richard Snape and others argues convincingly that a hub and spokes system is a relatively unattractive option for trade liberalisation. These considerations were reflected in my statements in Tokyo about trade policy. As mentioned already, I told the Japanese Government that Australia would not be party to a trade arrangement which was directed against Japan. This commitment reflects a clear-sighted view of Australia's national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It goes without saying that the Government attaches great weight to our relationship with the United States. Australia and all other trading nations have benefited enormously over the years from the enlightened leadership the United States has demonstrated in helping to maintain an open and non-discriminatory multilateral trading system. The Australia-US defence alliance remains of fundamental importance in the post-Cold War period. Our bilateral economic relations are of great value to both sides. As made clear in the joint statement issued with Japan, the Government believes that US strategic and economic engagement is of fundamental importance to the peace and prosperity of the Western Pacific. For this very reason we have promoted the APEC concept, which embraces both the Western Pacific and the United States, and have queried other regional concepts which omit the United States. An important objective of Australian policy is to avoid so far as we can situations where we have to choose between relations with the United States and relations with East Asia. We also want to do whatever we can to encourage cooperative relations between the two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government certainly does not rule out Australian membership of regional trading arrangements. APEC is already evolving into a regional trade arrangement with a useful agenda of trade liberalising measures. If thinking and practice in the region evolves towards the idea of a trade pact, we would very much prefer that it be APEC-wide, and of course that it did not raise barriers or hinder trade between members and non-members. We appreciate that such an outcome will not be achieved easily and that, in the meantime, there may be proposals for plurilateral arrangements between subsets of the APEC membership.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in Tokyo, we do not think a Western Pacific trade area is a preferred arrangement, but we would certainly seek to join one if the trade policy decisions of the major players left us no better choice.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, an important principle which will guide Australian policy is that we very much want to avoid being party to a process which has the effect of dividing the Pacific into trade allies of the United States and trade allies of Japan.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trip to Japan and to the other countries of Asia was important because it laid bare our Prime Minister. It shows that he is absolutely no different when it comes to foreign policy than when it comes to domestic policy. He will say or do anything, misrepresent anything, pull any political stunt, play any political game to achieve some particular short term political advantage back here in Australia. It is no more than that; it is a clear cut case, and we have seen evidence of it today. It is a blatant political attempt to salvage a bit of his shattered reputation as a result of that particular trip. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could not help thinking as I was preparing my remarks for today of a statement he made back in August 1991 when he was asked about himself. As honourable members would know, he has never been short of words when it comes to talking about himself. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm not an economist at all, I'm in a more noble profession, politics.</PARA>
<PARA>He proves it every day of the week. Everything he does and everything he says has a short term political motive. There is no doubt that this statement is important all right but, as I say, not for the reasons he gave us, but for another set of reasons; important because it is an attempt to rewrite recent political history in Australia; important because it is an attempt to save face&mdash;the Prime Minister's face; important because it is an attempt to recover lost ground on the issue of trade policy; important because it is an attempt to neutralise our advantage in the trade policy debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable members want to ask themselves where this statement came from and why it came today in the way that it did, I would proffer the view that he very sadly misjudged the US reaction&mdash;he either misjudged or did not care at the time about the reaction of the US Administration&mdash;to some of the things that he said in Japan. I believe that he and his people have been significantly struck by the intensity of that reaction and he has had to come out today to try to recover some of that lost ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were being objective about this statement in itself, we would stand back and say, `Why would the Prime Minister go overseas at a time like this? What would he hope to achieve in the midst of the worst recession in 60 years? Surely he would have a clear cut sense of national priorities and national objectives'. What would they be? What has he achieved in relation to trade? That is a very important objective. What has he achieved in relation to employment here in Australia? That is how we should judge his trips&mdash;on the basis of some basic economic principles, things that are of concern to average Australians. They see him go off overseas; they see him take an entourage. They want to judge what he has achieved overseas in some practical Australian terms. I reckon that expanded exports and expanded jobs would be two of the best. I notice that he does not adopt those criteria in his assessment of this trip&mdash;little wonder, because he achieved nothing in relation to either of those. As I say, it is just a blatant political attempt to score points while overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's statement just reveals, quite frankly, in how much disarray Australian trade policy is at present. I think it is fair to say that, if I were to summarise the weaknesses of the statement, I would deal with it under four heads: it was a mixture of misplaced priorities; it was clear evidence of policy backflips; it was clear evidence of international grandstanding and the consequences thereof; and, as I say, plenty of evidence of posturing for basic domestic political purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the background to this statement first. As I say, the reaction of the US is very important because, as honourable members would know, when he went to Japan he visibly sided with Japan. He took Japan's side against others&mdash;in particular the United States. He attacked the US on a couple of occasions. He told the Japanese pretty much what they wanted to hear. I can just imagine him arriving in Tokyo and saying, `Now listen, guys, I know you're concerned, but don't worry, we won't go into any trade bloc that does not include you'. When challenged by us from back here: did you get an assurance on the other side?, he said yes. I think it is interesting to look at the communique that he tabled today about the outcome of his trip and the discussions with the Japanese Government. What is missing from the communique? It is reference to the trade guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Japanese have never shown a consistent pattern in taking our interests to hand when they have negotiated some bilateral arrangement with the United States or some other country. Why should we believe that things will be any different in the future? If we look at the things he said about that trip, we start to understand why he ducked the detail of that issue as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He clearly has no trouble adopting the courage of other people's convictions. He showed in his own distinctive style while overseas that he has a capacity to tell his hosts what they want to hear. He says that he has made three trips into Asia; this is the guy who has just discovered Asia, by the way. It was the place he used to fly over on the way to Paris in order to have his French clocks repaired. He has just discovered Asia. He goes in there and on each occasion he tells the Asians pretty much what they want to hear. When he went to Indonesia, for example, we heard a similar set of statements. The Indonesians would have been fascinated that, when he was finally put under pressure in Indonesia as to what he was going to do to turn Australia's circumstances around so that we could develop an effective bilateral trading relationship, as he seeks, he told them that he would change the flag and that they should not worry about it. That is the type of stupidity that he has demonstrated while overseas claiming to represent the interests of Australia. He does not understand what our interests are and he leaves his hosts in each case with a clear cut view that he has no idea what is in Australia's best interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had some limited experience in dealing with the Japanese in a number of different ways and on a number of different occasions, but from my limited experience of some 25 or 30 trips I would say that they would have been fascinated to see him come in and deal with diplomacy in the way he did and make some of the points he did. Some of his most important statements were made on a bullet train, not in the context of any formal remarks, which must just stagger people as to what this bloke is on about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, he misjudged sadly the American reaction. I think it is important at the start of my remarks to look at some of this reaction. The initial reaction to his statements about the United States and taking the side of Japan was reported in one newspaper at the time pretty much to the effect that it was not going to really comment on this because it seemed to have been made for domestic political reasons&mdash;even Americans could see it. But, as time went on and he repeated his statements, not only in Japan but also in other parts of the region, the irritation obviously grew. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw statements by Frank Lavin, the US Deputy Secretary of Commerce in East Asia; we have seen a couple of major press reports by Gregory Hywood, an Australian who has established an outstanding reputation for commenting on US events and international events from the United States; and we have also seen some comments by Robert Zoellick, the United States Deputy Secretary of State who, in one AAP report, was reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to have reacted swiftly and angrily to the Australian Embassy in Washington after comments by Prime Minister Paul Keating accusing the United States of manipulating world trade.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister did not just stop and take the side of Japan; he actually went on the attack against the United States and accused it of manipulating world trade. This report goes on to say that Zoellick:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . was surprised at the remarks made by Mr Keating.</PARA>
<PARA>It emphasises the irritation of the White House and contrasts that with the earlier reports&mdash;as I say, that the comments were made in the context of domestic political debate. The AAP report says that Mr Zoellick:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">..was amazed at Mr Keating's reaction, which came in response to a trade policy election speech in Detroit by President George Bush in which he left the door open for Australia to join in a free-trade deal with the United States.</PARA>
<PARA>Where are Australia's best interests when the President of the United States specifically mentions us as a possibility for a free trade arrangement as part of a network of free trade arrangements? Where are Australia's national interests when the Prime Minister goes out and accuses the President of manipulating world trade?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot, in our economic circumstances, with nearly $200 billion worth of international debt, afford to look a gift horse in the mouth anywhere&mdash;the United States, Asia, Japan or anywhere else. But our Prime Minister seems capable of that. No wonder the Americans were amazed at his reaction. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inclusion of Australia was the result of a prompting by Mr Zoellick, who has been active in persuading former Secretary of State, James Baker, now the White House Chief of Staff, of the worth of extending free-trade agreements to the Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA>This was a high level initiative in favour of us, an alliance partner, and he kicks them in the teeth. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The US had expected a favourable reaction&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Why would it not?  It singled us out of a host of possibilities&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to the Detroit package, feeling it was doing Australia a favour showing sensitivity to Australian needs.</PARA>
<PARA>So he was kicked in the teeth. Why not make the point in deliberate style? One source described Mr Zoellick's view as, `What the hell are you guys up to?', after he heard of Mr Keating's remarks. The report goes on, emphasising how `the Americans were irritated that the offer was not taken up as seriously as it was intended'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is pretty damaging stuff. This is by a Prime Minister who claims to understand the best interests of Australian trade policy. The report goes on to refer to the proceedings of a conference in Austin, Texas, on the North American Free Trade Agreement, where speakers were referring to the post- and pre-bullet train policy of Australia. No wonder the Prime Minister was in here trying to save a bit of face and extend the olive branch to the Americans in response to some of the things that he has said in recent days. It is important to look at some of Hywood's comments. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 9 October he emphasised:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before Canberra even knew the details of the Bush proposal&mdash;which are not yet clear&mdash;it rejected out of hand&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>before it even knew the details, the Prime Minister rejected out of hand&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the idea of a bilateral FTA, the only other game in town. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a short-sighted strategy and inconsistent with the flexible trade policy Australia needs as it enters a particularly demanding era.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister was not short on description of this particularly demanding era, but he did not recognise what it meant in terms of Australia's economic interests and the sort of policy response he should have put in place. In another Hywood comment which refers specifically to the Prime Minister's outbursts, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His outbursts against the United States in Japan a fortnight ago have caused genuine anger in the White House, particularly among the architects of Bush's new trade strategy, the former Secretary of State, now Chief of Staff, Mr James Baker, and his Deputy, Mr Robert Zoellick.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to tell how the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) was sent in to try to smooth things over in a subsequent visit to the United States. He is not the person one would send in to smooth anything over!  His most outstanding success while being Minister for Foreign Affairs in this Government is that he managed to get both black and white Africa offside on the same day, but he was sent in to smooth things over. In he went to smooth things over and, as Hywood says, `Needless to say, there was no meeting of minds'. One of them started at a distinct disadvantage, for a start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Hywood makes a very important point&mdash;that these comments reflect what is perhaps the deepest rift in US-Australian relations in a generation. That is what the Prime Minister did. In Japan, for the sake of short term political gain back here, he brought about the deepest rift in US-Australian relations in a generation. Strategic allies for 50 years, the United States and Australia, have now very different views. Hywood goes on to demonstrate some of those views and talks about the simplistic notion of the Prime Minister of fostering GATT first: if GATT fails, go to APEC; and, if APEC fails, go to a bilateral deal. In the most damning comment, he referred to the US view of all this. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The US takes the view that you take trade liberalisation where you can get it.</PARA>
<PARA>If the US is prepared to take it where they can get it, why are we not prepared to take it where we can get it? What was this Japanese trip all about?  It was an absolutely ridiculous situation where a Prime Minister sacrificed a longstanding trade relationship and broader alliance, and put it at risk for the sake of scoring short term political points back here at home. He shows no sense of understanding what is in Australia's best interests. He has actually brought about a whole new sense of dependence for Australia. He is the one who talks about wanting to build an independent Australia!  He would not run the economic policies he runs, which make us incredibly dependent on Japan, and he would not take the sort of attitude he took in Japan, if he had a clearly independent, self-confident understanding of the nature of Australia today and our possibilities in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other distinguishing feature of today's statement is very important. It is the extent of the policy back flips evidenced in the statement: it is an absolute classic. The reason it is this way, I believe&mdash;and I can stand corrected by the Prime Minister&mdash;is that he set out months ago to make trade a major initiative. He was going to go to the area and use this Asia-Pacific debate, latterly adopted as his own, to try to neutralise the ground we had made in arguing about the future of Australia being in the Asia-Pacific region. I reckon he set out actually to make a mark. But he did not count on our making a whole series of statements in speeches and in other contexts over a much longer period which, in effect, left him nowhere to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister does not think about the economics; he does not think about what is in Australia's best interests. He just thinks about how he can score a cheap political point. If I am out there taking the ground from under him he has nowhere to go. So he belts us, and everything we say. As he belts us, he cuts off his options. Honourable members might remember the Press Club performance of the Prime Minister a couple of days before he went away where he spent the whole of his time attacking the Opposition. I reckon that originally that Press Club performance was going to be devoted to a statement on trade strategy. But he could not do it, so he made a fool of himself trying to pretend that he had changed his mind on the goods and services tax. He was played on a break on this issue. He started behind. Then he went off to Tokyo and had to bring a touch of excitement, a touch of verve with all this stuff he says he is going to bring in. He went there to try to carve out a niche for himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the process, he set up a whole lot of straw men, a whole lot of phoney choices about Australia's position in relation to Japan and the United States&mdash;choices that nobody else in the region has even contemplated, because they do not exist: these choices do not have to be made. But he set them up and tried to make history on trade policy in Tokyo by playing domestic politics on the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just look at the way he has flip-flopped in this statement today compared with some of the early statements in relation to our trade policy. Let us take one example, the Bush initiative to extend the free trade arrangement from the United States on a network basis to other parts of the Asia-Pacific region. When it first came out he rushed out with a press release which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">President Bush's announcement of his goal to work for a strategic network of free trade agreements, including with nations of the Pacific, is a welcomed signal that the United States recognises the need to take part in building more liberal trading arrangements in the Pacific area.</PARA>
<PARA>A similar comment was made by a lot of people, including us, because it was a very important signal. I said at the time that I thought it might be one of the most significant statements ever made on international trade. He greeted it in similar terms; he was not going to be outdone by us. By the time he got to Tokyo he had taken a somewhat different view. It is instructive to look at some of the newspaper reports, which were mostly filed by those journalists who remain totally objective while they travel with him and totally uninfluenced, of course, by anything he says in the briefing he might provide&mdash;anywhere from on a bullet train to in a bar. They just report it as they see it, so I assume it is accurate. `The PM attacks US again on trade' says Geoff Kitney. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Prime Minister, Mr Keating, sharpened his criticism of the United States trade policies yesterday as Australia and Japan moved to establish a task force to discuss a new co-ordinated approach to trade and strategic issues. Mr Keating accused the United States of a loss of confidence in its position in world trade of seeking to manipulate trade relationships. He did not believe that the positions outlined in Tokyo would upset the United States".</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Now they are less confident&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the United States&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">about their industry and about their competitiveness and about their research and development base, they are going for things which I think don't let the US necessarily excel or see the US in its best light.</PARA>
<PARA>Here is a man who has made a clear-cut assessment of the United States: it has lost its confidence and lost its way. `PM pledges loyalty to Tokyo' is the heading in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> by Richard McGregor. `PM puts Japan First'&mdash;that would have gone down well&mdash;from Geoff Kitney in Tokyo. `PM sides with Japan on trade' was the heading from Peter Hartcher in Tokyo. `PM rejects Bush trade plan' was another heading. Look, the headlines are getting bigger. Another one was `Keating attacks the United States on trade'. Here is a killer: `Japan, Keating to fight trade giant' from the understated Peter Rees of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>; yes, he is always objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister took a completely different position from the initial reaction he gave in Canberra when that Bush statement was originally released. He went further in Singapore. He deliberately misrepresented the Bush initiative by saying&mdash;this was not just in Japan; he sustained it then through the rest of the Asia-Pacific region:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extension of NAFTA might well lead the US into thinking it could sustain its economic weight merely through involvement in its own hemisphere to the neglect of this region.</PARA>
<PARA>So there he is&mdash;one day almost a love affair, saying it is a great trade initiative, and the next, bucket, bucket, bucket of the type that we see here in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have we seen today? He has had to recover a bit of that lost ground. The reaction of the United States was too strong so we have had a third back flip in as many weeks by the Prime Minister. In today's statement he recognises the interaction between Asian and American trade. He recognises the fluid and fast changing external environment&mdash;two good reasons why he has to change his mind. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to institutional forms and arrangements into which we may be prepared to enter,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>wait for this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">we are open minded.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a bit different from the bucket that they copped in Tokyo. This is the same man who condemned NAFTA so instinctively when he was overseas. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We certainly do not rule out bilateral agreements, . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Well, a lot of his remarks earlier clearly ruled them out. He spelled out a kind of bilateral agreement with the US that would be in Australia's interests. Hang on; he has gone further; he has decided in today's speech to actually spell out what it ought to look like. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It goes without saying that the Government attaches great weight to our relationship with the United States.</PARA>
<PARA>That is classic stuff. He is doing two things: firstly trying to recover ground vis-a-vis the United States and the unexpectedly strong reaction that his statements brought from Washington and the White House and, secondly, trying to neutralise ground with us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is instructive that I took his speech and picked out three or four of those sentences and paragraphs to see whether I could find in them any of the things that we had been saying. We have the habit of hearing our own words coming back to us from over the table from him after a while when he decides to neutralise his remarks. I will just give a couple of examples. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I said at the beginning of this statement, the trend towards regional, subregional and bilateral trade arrangements will probably strengthen.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the first time he has said that. I go back to a speech I made on 15 July and I see that in my third point I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Australia needs to respond creatively to the trend in favour of co-operative economic, regionalism and sub-regionalism. We can do this by making APEC more than a debating society&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>it sounds similar to me to what he said today&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . by giving it some specific targets and deadlines, by involving the private sector more explicitly and by encouraging APEC's development as a GATT consistent free trade area.</PARA>
<PARA>So there is one piece of evidence. I also went on in that speech to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we also need to assess objectively the prospects for Australia negotiating GATT consistent free trade agreement in goods and services with particular regional countries or groups of countries&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this was back in July of this year&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to the extent that they would advance Australia's national interests in the wider region, such agreements should be actively pursued.</PARA>
<PARA>I have heard it all before; we said it several months ago and it comes back to us. Here is another example in today's speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We must not lose sight of the fact that many of these countries are highly dependent on the US market.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us remember that he was creating this phoney choice: if we are going to the US we are going to jettison Asia. We went out to try to argue that that was not the case; that Asians are actually capable of chewing gum and changing feet at the same time; that they can deal with the US, with Japan, with themselves and with Europe. That statement is reflected in one I made in a press release back on 27 September, commenting on some of the Prime Minister's remarks:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is that the Asia-Pacific countries have rapidly expanded their exports into North America, and North American exports into Asia have grown dramatically. The key question for the Prime Minister is whether he believes that ASEAN countries will somehow be turning their backs on Asia if they decide to pursue President Bush's proposal for free trade agreements.</PARA>
<PARA>Two out of two already! I go to another one that he puts down here:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We certainly do not rule out bilateral agreements, or plurilateral agreements.</PARA>
<PARA>That sits at odds with his attack in a similar statement that I have already read. It is interesting that, when I talked about a bilateral arrangement, NAFTA, he called that stunt of a Sunday afternoon press conference. Do honourable members remember that? What did he say? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Hewson is attempting to throw our lot, Australia's lot, in with a country, the United States, which doesn't want us.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important objective of Australian policy is to avoid so far as we can, situations where we have to choose between relations with the United States and relations with East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA>So we have to choose; we have to avoid situations where we have to choose. He spent his entire time while he was away talking about all these jolly choices that we have to make as a nation. As I said in a press release back on 25 September:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . his main purpose was to present some kind of historic choice for Australian trade policy, in deciding between the United States and Japan.</PARA>
<PARA>The choice is a phoney one. No other leader in the Asia-Pacific region is arguing the case for such a choice at this time. The only reason the Prime Minister decided to promote it was his determination to use international issues for whatever short term domestic political purpose he thinks it can serve. The fact of life is that Australia must pursue all its trade options&mdash;in Asia, in Europe, in the Americas and wherever else. To talk any other way is at best misguided and at worst mischievous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a clear-cut statement of our position. We have had a consistent position all the way on this. All we have seen from the Prime Minister is a blatant attempt to manipulate public opinion in Australia. He stands condemned today. He has no trade policy. He has a record of three back flips in as many weeks. He stands condemned, too, for that stunt he pulled at the Toyota car plant. I do not think poor old Dr Toyoda knew what was coming. He had no idea of the spin that was going to be put on his fairly clear-cut and straightforward remarks&mdash;the spin that would be put on his remarks back here in the domestic political debate. That certainly is not being echoed in recent statements from Toyota in Australia, which has not threatened to withdraw its investment under us at all, despite what the Prime Minister said. </PARA>

Australian service personnel are doing, without qualification, a magnificent job under what are very difficult circumstances in Cambodia. They are serving in the highest traditions of the Australian Defence Force and they deserve a visit by an Australian Prime Minister. We are glad that they have now had one. The whole Cambodian peace process has now reached a critical stage. Events in Cambodia have moved a long way since the Government announced the deployment of Australian forces&mdash;an announcement which the Opposition supported and which we continue to support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of that announcement, the Government undertook to keep the Parliament and the Opposition fully informed of the changing circumstances concerning the Australian deployment. The reality is that circumstances have changed, and changed dramatically, in relation to the comprehensiveness of the peace process and in particular to the role of the Khmer Rouge. We believe that there is an urgent need for the Prime Minister to make a full and detailed statement to the Parliament about the changes on the ground in Cambodia, the changes to the UN peace process and the changing role of Australian forces in Cambodia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The Committee's seventh report for 1992, which I have just tabled, concerns the Air Force aspects of the defence logistics redevelopment project, DLRP, which involves the implementation of a rationalised and centralised strategy of wholesale storage and distribution for the Australian Defence Force. The Defence National Storage and Distribution Centre, the second major component of the DLRP, will be the subject of a separate report from the Committee later in these sittings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report concerns the provision of facilities required by the RAAF to implement the relocation to forward bases of weapons systems spares as well as the rationalisation of associated property holdings. The Air Force aspects of the DLRP will allow the disposal of Defence property at Tottenham in Victoria, Toowoomba in Queensland, and Regents Park in New South Wales. The estimated cost of the proposed works is $25m. The proceeds from the sale of the properties will fund the construction of the new and enhanced facilities to be provided. The Committee's report on the Air Force aspects recommends that the works should proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report concludes that the scope of the enhancement of warehouses at seven RAAF bases can be justified on the basis of improved efficiencies and increased effectiveness resulting from the storage of weapons system spares in them. The seven operational bases are Williamtown, Edinburgh, East Sale, Amberley, Richmond, Townsville and Pearce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee also examined the future uses of RAAF storage facilities at Regents Park and concluded that warehouse 40, located there, is a valuable asset and should be retained by Defence as part of the National Storage and Distribution Centre. The land not required by Defence will be sold off. The Committee has recommended that Defence should continue discussions with Auburn Municipal Council and other planning authorities to ensure that the land which Defence proposes to sell will be used for purposes compatible with other adjacent land uses, including medium density housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal examined by the Committee involves the relocation of No. 1 Operational Support Unit to Townsville, and the Committee concluded that this will result in improved efficiencies and response times. Townsville is the home base of the operational deployment force, and the scope of the work can be justified on the basis of operational improvements which will result in having the two units in close proximity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's inquiry into the DNSDC and the Air Force aspects of DLRP focused in part on the fire protection measures to be provided. The Committee was advised that all upgrading of existing facilities will, as is economically cost effective, comply with the fire safety requirements of the Building Code of Australia and the Defence Manual of Fire Protection Engineering. Some fire safety standards required are more stringent than the BCA because they address the very pertinent issue of strategic risk. The Committee has nevertheless recommended that Defence should provide the Commonwealth Fire Board with details of the fire protection measures for comment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The property implications of the proposal have considerable ramifications, not only in terms of asset sales but also in terms of job redundancies which will result from the closure of the stores depots. The Committee has concluded that the successful completion of the DLRP is dependent on the proceeds from the sale of surplus properties, funding construction, or refurbishment of warehouses and associated facilities. The Committee, therefore, recommended that Defence should ensure that optimal prices are obtained from land sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to redundancies which will result, Defence advised the Committee that the recruitment of staff for the depots has ceased. This will provide scope for individuals to be retrained or redeployed where possible. However, Defence did acknowledge that there will be some people for whom it will not be possible to find current positions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's eighth report for 1992 relates to the construction of a Commonwealth office building on the corner of Adelaide and Creek Streets in Brisbane. The 25-storey building will accommodate 25,000 square metres of office space and four basement levels. The building, which will be known as Terrica Place, named after the 1920 building it replaces, will primarily accommodate the Australian Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Taxation Office is committed to 16,000 square metres of the building, while the balance of the office space will be leased to other agencies and the ground level retail areas will be let as shops. In line with the fully commercialised nature of the office estate, all tenants will pay market based rents and will be required to enter into long term leases with Australian Estate Management. The Australian Taxation Office has agreed to a 10-year lease term with two five-year options thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Terrica Place will be built on a portion of a Commonwealth owned site, adjacent to the historic Anzac Square precinct, on which there are already two government buildings. The major one is block A of some 17 storeys built in 1972 and the other is block B of some 7 storeys built in 1934. Block B is listed on the Register of the National Estate. In addition to ensuring the preservation of block B, this development will integrate the three buildings into a single complex around a landscaped plaza. The design of the new building meets the requirements of the Australian Heritage Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The construction of this building will enable the Australian Taxation Office to locate its Brisbane central business district activity in the one building and will greatly enhance administrative efficiency. The completion of the building will increase the proportion of Commonwealth owned office space in Brisbane from 27 per cent to 42 per cent. The project will protect the Commonwealth from the strong rent increase expected in Brisbane at the time of completion of this project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is satisfied, on the basis of confidential information provided to it, that the project is the most cost-effective means of meeting the Commonwealth's accommodation requirements in the Brisbane central business district. The estimated out-turn cost of the project is $82m&mdash;not cheap&mdash;although the Committee was advised by Australian Estate Management that in the current extremely competitive tendering market it is confident of receiving a tender price below that figure. I commend the reports to the House. </PARA>

Those programs are at Williamtown, Edinburgh, East Sale, Amberley, Richmond, Townsville and Pearce. The Committee reported that there was a need for the RAAF to improve its regional warehousing facilities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report went on to note that many of the older properties, some located at Toowoomba, Tottenham, Dubbo and those sorts of areas, were old depots, some dating back to World War II. I can appreciate that. In fact, I find what has happened most unfortunate. Many of the buildings that we have in the defence area do not suit the modern equipment that we have today. They do not provide dust free environments and those sorts of things&mdash;including, of course, adequate working facilities for certain defence staff. So I certainly support the provision of these new and modern facilities for what is a new and modern defence force in Australia which needs to be appropriately supplied and equipped.

I note that more than half the 150,000 square metres of vacant office space currently available in the Brisbane CBD is contained in a handful of prime buildings which would not be acceptable to the Commonwealth for its purposes. As I just mentioned, the report pointed out that there are currently 150,000 square metres of vacant office floor space in the Brisbane CBD, and that rings true with other capital cities. Commonwealth departments currently occupy 176,000 square metres of office space in the Brisbane CBD and, of this, only 47,000 square metres, or 27 per cent, is owned by the Commonwealth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Initially, I thank the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for the opportunity to make a brief submission and attend its inspection. The aspect relevant to my electorate is the Regents Park site. I am pleased with two conclusions reached by the Committee. Firstly, in relation to warehouse 40, there was at one stage a push that it be sold with the rest of the site. That was opposed by the National Union of Workers and the local officers, because&mdash;and this was the conclusion of the Committee&mdash;it is viable, it is useful and it has involved significant capital expenditure. I am pleased to say that the Committee has reached a similar view, that it should not be sold with the rest of the site. This particular Air Force base is a significant employer, both in my electorate and that of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), and the continued existence of that part of the operation will guarantee at least some jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I note that the Committee urges that there be some consultation between the Auburn Council and the Department. In recent years the Fahey State Government and its predecessor have at last started to tackle the problem of urban consolidation in Sydney. As I say, this has been ignored by governments of both political stripes. Unfortunately, in their decision to tackle that problem we see a class bias. Virtually all of the suggested regions for increased consolidation happen to be in working class western Sydney electorates. In actual fact, of about 30 railways they have chosen, one or two were on the North Shore. That is a massive indication of their bias in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At another defence site within the electorate&mdash;that is, the Merrylands reserve depot&mdash;there has been an unfortunate indication of the attitude of the State Government of New South Wales which I see this Committee repudiating. That Government decided, without consultation with the Federal Department, that it would rezone and gazette for medium density the particular property at the intersection of Woodville Road and Merrylands Road. That is typical of the degree of studied disinterest in the views of local residents and the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that in this report the Committee has strongly recommended that there be consultation between the Federal Government department and the local council.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I am pleased to support the recommendation of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works with respect to the new Terrica Place building to be constructed in Adelaide Street, Brisbane. It is in a central precinct; it is an ideal location for the purpose. It is also a building surrounded with some historic significance. It is adjoined by Anzac Square and the memorial in the centre of the city, and it has beside it other historic buildings owned by the Commonwealth. Most notable of those is the building between it and Anzac Square which was built in 1934. I am pleased to note that the proposals for the new Terrica Place take account of that heritage value and that the design of the new Terrica Place incorporates a facade which very properly fits in with that historical precinct of which it will form an important part. I am particularly pleased to note that the Government is meeting the requirements of the Australian Heritage Commission, and it deserves great credit for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other building which is part of that precinct is the Australian Government Centre. I had the pleasure of having my electorate office located there for some 18 months or so and I am very familiar with that part of the city. It is very central. It provides easy access for the people of Brisbane, with the Central railway station literally across the road in Ann Street. The use of that site for such a building is a wise decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government would now be the major building construction authority in the Brisbane city area. This new building now going ahead&mdash;a significant building of some 25 storeys&mdash;joins a number of other construction activities which have been approved by this Parliament. I wish to mention a couple of those, if I may. The new Federal Court building, which is now nearing completion at North Quay, is a major building and a beautiful addition to what is a lovely part of the Brisbane CBD area overlooking the river across to the south bank and the Cultural Centre. I had the pleasure of inspecting that site with the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, and was impressed by the commitment of the people involved on site and the quality of the work being done. The other major activity being undertaken by the Commonwealth, which I also wish speedy progress, is the new international airport. I will not dwell on that, but I am sure the Committee has that in mind for further consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the Committee on its report and the Government for its clear intentions to construct the new Terrica Place. It will be a fine building. It will admirably house the Australian Taxation Office. As my colleagues have pointed out, along with those other projects to which I have referred it now ensures that the Australian Government is a major force in the employment of people in the Brisbane area. My colleague the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) commented earlier that Brisbane is a striving and thriving economy. The efforts of the Australian Government in locating these new buildings in the CBD will add an extra emphasis to that economic growth and employment. I endorse the report. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment arises from the March 1991 industry statement in which the Government announced new arrangements for the automotive industry to the year 2000. As part of those arrangements the Government also announced that it would maintain an independent body for the duration of the arrangements to monitor the performance of the industry and to give advice and information to Government on the industry. The Government's decision to maintain an independent body was made on the recommendation of the Industry Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Automotive Industry Authority has built up considerable knowledge of the automotive industry and has shown itself capable of providing independent and factual advice to government. The authority is well placed to carry out the required monitoring role to the year 2000.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905, amongst other things, makes it an offence to import or export goods to which a false trade description is applied. In the past 12 months the Australian Customs Service has reported an increasing number of interceptions of garments and footwear which contravene this legislation. As recently stated by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), this indicates a need for an increased deterrent to prevent importers playing the odds by importing falsely described goods. The penalties under the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act have not been increased since the legislation was enacted in 1905.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 2B of the Bill will make a change to the Designs Act 1906 necessitated by two recent decisions of the Federal Court which have held, amongst other things, that designs for articles of uniform cross-section but of indefinite length are not registrable under the Designs Act. This has the undesired effect of invalidating many registered designs, against the spirit and policy behind the legislation. The amendment is necessarily retroactive in order to preserve the validity of current design registrations. Provisions will also be included for the protection or compensation of persons who acted in the belief that the registration of a design was invalid as a consequence of the Federal Court's decisions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Measurement Act 1960 provides the basis for the Australian national measurement system. The objective of the Act is to ensure that measurements are made on a consistent basis throughout the nation and are compatible with measurements in other countries. The Bill will amend the National Measurement Act 1960 to make consequential provisions resulting from the enactment by State and Territory governments of the uniform trade measurement legislation, to include provisions for a broader range of legal measurements than are presently allowed for in the Act and to clarify Australia's obligations under the international convention on legal metrology and to ensure that legal measuring instruments in use in Australia comply with national and international requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the introduction of uniform trade measurement legislation, verification of measuring instruments for use for trade will be replaced to a significant extent by certification of measuring instruments by licensed personnel. As the amount of error determined for a particular measuring instrument may vary according to the test procedure adopted, and to ensure that verification, reverification and certification procedures are uniformly applied throughout Australia, the provision of test procedures in certificates of approval is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The uniform trade measurement legislation also requires that verification tolerances, which may have different values, are those permitted under the Act. A legal opinion from the Attorney-General's Department concluded that `an amount of error probably allows for the more than one set of tolerances to be specified', but recommended that the Act be amended to expressly state that opinion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Act and regulations currently provide for the Commission to undertake pattern approval of measuring instruments used for trade. Pattern approval aims to ensure that measuring instruments are not capable of facilitating fraud, that they will maintain their accuracy between verifications and will not be adversely affected by changes in environmental conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is estimated that goods to the value of $40 billion are traded across Commission approved equipment each year. If measuring instruments do not comply with the approved pattern, then the community may suffer loss in two ways. Firstly, the non-complying instruments might include features that facilitate fraud. Secondly, the instruments might not be able to maintain calibration and might not be recalibrated unless it is in the vendor's interest to do so. Australia could also suffer loss of export revenue from the sale of resources such as coal, wheat, wool and sugar if non-complying instruments are used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Act provides for penalties if instruments falsely purport to comply with an approved pattern. However, no mechanism exists for instruments to be checked for compliance. State and Territory trade measurement authorities, a Public Service Board review of the pattern approval procedures, and Commission risk analysis reports have each identified pattern compliance as an essential component in maintaining the integrity of the trade measurement system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1959 Australia acceded to the international convention establishing an international organisation of legal metrology. The organisation was vested with responsibility for determining international requirements for legal measuring instruments and member states were `morally obliged to implement these decisions as far as possible'. With the globalisation of trade the convention has gained increasing importance and is in harmony with the GATT agreement on technical barriers to trade. The amendment clarifies Australia's measurement requirements under this convention and will be an essential component of mutual recognition agreements with Australia's trading partners. The Bill will extend the traceability provision of the Act to include legal measuring instruments and analytical measurements using certified reference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Act and regulations currently provide for the pattern approval and certification of measuring instruments used for trade. Pattern approval aims to ensure that measuring instruments will maintain their accuracy between verifications and will not be adversely affected by changes in environmental conditions. At the present time measuring instruments used for legal purposes other than trade measurement are not subject to pattern approval procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission has been approached by some State government authorities to provide for certification of some legal instruments to facilitate demonstration of traceability of these instruments in legal proceedings. Pattern approval to international standards would be an important prerequisite for certification of these instruments. The amendment makes provision for pattern approval, verification and certification of legal measuring instruments that may be applied as found appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reference materials are important for a wide range of measurements in industry and government regulation. Examples would include environmental monitoring and breathalyser measurements. As many reference materials originate overseas they currently would not comply with the provisions of the Act.

There is also a need to clarify the Commonwealth's obligation to AIDC's borrowings made during the operation of the Commonwealth guarantee, but which are subsequently rolled over into a further investment.

All subsidies for financially disadvantaged persons, whom I refer to as FDPs, are to be increased by 55c a day and personal care subsidies are to be reduced by $2.65 a day for non-financially disadvantaged persons. The $2.65 a day reduction to non-FDP rates equates to the current hostel care subsidies which are payable only to financially disadvantaged persons. It is intended that at all levels of care within a hostel there will be a $3.20 a day subsidy difference between the financially disadvantaged residents and the non-financially disadvantaged residents. The rationale behind this measure is that hostels have a greater capacity to raise income from their non-FDP residents through entry contributions and variable fees, and that government subsidies will be better targeted to support those in need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), in his second reading speech, suggested that the real impact on the resident and the hostel should be minimal as the changes, in combination with forthcoming real increases in pension income through pension and rental assistance increases, largely offset each other. Aged Care Australia, the peak body representing hostels in the voluntary sector, had this response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's decision, taken without consultation with the industry and applied retrospectively, strikes at the very heart of their social justice program.</PARA>
<PARA>The reduction in subsidies to non-FDP hostel residents is a cost-cutting measure by the Government which will ultimately disadvantage hostel proprietors in the voluntary sector. Higher charges are available to hostels from non-FDPs, but contracts are entered into between residents and proprietors regarding entry contributions on a monthly or annual fees basis. For many hostels, existing contracts and retirement village legislation will preclude adjustments to residents fees until either the annual review or automatic CPI adjustment, or with the permission of the resident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small and remote hostels that relied on their local community for capital fundraising have made commitments to their communities regarding entry contributions and differential fees. I raise the issue of the small rural and remote hostels because they will be particularly disadvantaged, especially in this time of great recession and the rural depression that is having a massive impact on those very small and isolated communities where some of these hostels are located. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Budget measure will impact severely on the financial viability of small hostels. Aged Care Australia has pointed out that there is a case for subsidy increases for small hostels which continue to be uneconomic. It has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately the Government is continuing to approve the construction of small stand-alone hostels despite continuing advice by us that these facilities are clearly uneconomic. This will only be overcome through the expansion of multi-purpose centres.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems crazy to continue to support stand-alone hostels when we could get much better utilisation of resources by supporting the multi-purpose centres. Aged Care Australia has pointed out that the so-called real increase in pensions and rent assistance of the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) is illusory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The low consumer price index is artificially low as a guide to inflation in the aged care sector. The low CPI is due mainly to reductions in the housing component which, in turn, reflects the dramatic reduction in rates that we have seen in this nation and does not really reflect the actual CPI increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fall in interest rates is of minimal benefit to the aged population, who are instead suffering because their interest income has dropped sharply. This is reflected in the growth of the number of people in receipt of age pension and part pension. Without the effect of lower interest rates, the CPI would have risen by 2 1/2 per cent from June 1991 to June 1992. Actual costs in hostels and nursing homes have risen even more than this over the past 12 months and are expected to increase even faster in the near future due to the pending award increases and increases in the occupational superannuation and superannuation levies. I wonder whether these factors were considered when drafting these amendments to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reducing personal care subsidies by $2.65 a day for non-financially disadvantaged persons is estimated to save the Government in excess of $9m in 1993-94. Aged Care Australia said that as a result of the estimated savings:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government clearly wants the non-FDP resident to pick up the cost of both generating the Budget cost saving of over $9m per annum and the increased subsidy of financially disadvantaged person residents.</PARA>
<PARA>Interest income for non-FDP residents has dropped sharply as a result of falling interest rates and many financially disadvantaged persons do not have the capacity to pay the increased fees. Furthermore, the existing definition of `financially disadvantaged person' does not give a good guide to the capacity of a hostel resident to pay increased fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many non-financially disadvantaged persons now have the full age pension as their sole source of income because they may have divested or spent their assets. Being a non-financially disadvantaged person is no measure of increased capacity to pay, especially as much of the resident's assets are used for the increasingly large entry contribution necessary to fund the initial capital cost. Aged Care Australia therefore recommends that the definition of financially disadvantaged person for the purpose of recurrent funding in hostels be changed to a basis of the resident being in receipt of a full single age pension and not owning a home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Aged Care Australia's detailed submission to the Minister the following recommendations were also made: firstly, coinciding with the 55c increase in the FDP subsidies, the personal care subsidy for non-financially disadvantaged persons should be reduced by $1.45. This represents 55c offset for the FDP increase and 85c of the $1 per week non-indexed pension increase due to be introduced at the end of January 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the remaining $1.20 of the personal care subsidy cut should be introduced following a national review of hostel operating costs. This review is to include examining the capacity of hostels to reduce operating costs without impairing quality of care and to increase fees to non-financially disadvantaged residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, on the topic of hostel subsides, I must make mention of the difficulties and complexities involved in hostel management. The 1991 Budget introduced three levels of personal subsidies targeted to the different care needs of residents in hostels: personal care high, personal care intermediate, and personal care low. In addition, there is a hostel care subsidy which is payable for residents who do not require personal care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the introduction of changes of hostel subsidy arrangements, instead of four levels of subsidy, there will be seven, thus creating more complex administration and budgeting and clerical activity. That will certainly impact on the hostels and, I imagine, on the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, which has to administer this Act. So much for the Government's gross hypocrisy when it made the accusation that the GST in the Fightback package will introduce more book work into people's everyday lives. This change will create more and, we believe, unnecessary book work for the hostel proprietors. The coalition parties are of the opinion that the question of hostel subsidies should be referred to a Senate legislative committee for consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn my attention now to the resident classification reviews. The amendments to the classification review provisions for nursing home residents allow for retrospective reclassification of nursing home residents to the date of original classification. Currently, a resident is classified according to the resident classification instrument&mdash;that is, the RCI&mdash;which measures a resident's need for nursing and personal care. When validation of this assessment means a change in classification, the change takes effect from the date of validation. On this side of the House, the coalition parties have taken on board the concerns of the aged care industry regarding the retrospective reclassification of nursing home residents which can occur at any time up to the period of reassessment, which is 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry states that, if the secretary revokes a classification and substitutes a classification that requires a lower funding level, the nursing home proprietor, under the proposed amendment, will be required to repay the Commonwealth the difference between the funding at the reclassified level and the level of the original classification. This refund will be required even though the nursing home proprietor has already spent the money on personal care for the resident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals Inc. has raised the following concerns with regard to the reclassification. It says that residents in nursing homes are classified by directors of nursing and their staff, utilising their professional knowledge and expertise in the best interests of frail aged persons entrusted to their care. They also use the RCI guidelines for directors of nursing provided by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. These nursing staff are professionally trained to care for the frail aged and understand the levels of care required by the residents on a daily basis. Departmental officers who have no working knowledge of the residents concerned cannot properly make retrospective judgments based on paper assessments of these frail aged and a single visit, often without the individual resident being assessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the proposed changes will hurt and disadvantage nursing homes financially. The RCI reviews over the last 12 months clearly show that in the vast majority of cases a resident's classification is upgraded, giving the nursing home less funding specifically for nursing staff and personal care. Directors of nursing have commented that they have grave concerns about the power given to the RCI inspectors who, through downgrading residents, could literally send a nursing home into bankruptcy overnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the RCI tool is only a means of funding nursing care staff, it has no financial effect on the profits of the nursing home. All moneys forwarded to the nursing home through this funding are utilised for nursing staff. It is absolutely ridiculous that money that has been expended on staff wages should be claimed back retrospectively. The money that will be paid back will have to come from other areas, adversely affecting the standards of care received by the elderly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the final concern raised by the National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals illustrates the callous disregard this Government has for the efforts of those dedicated nurses working in aged care hostels across the nation. In fact, the amendment has the direct result of cutting staffing levels to already cash-strapped nursing homes, further adding to the burden of Australia's huge unemployment problem. The industry's recommendation is that, as this Budget item will have no financial impact on the Commonwealth in the 1992-93 financial year, this matter should be referred to a Senate committee for further consideration. The National and Liberal parties support the industry's recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move to the issue of domiciliary nursing care. Care to the aged and disabled is provided both at home, under the home and community care program, commonly known as the HACC program, and at institutions, principally in hostels. A number of services are provided under HACC, including home help, nursing, meals, maintenance and transport. The home and community care program aims to enable those who do not require institutional care to continue to live in their homes and remain part of the community. As part of the scheme, assistance is provided through the domiciliary and nursing care benefit, the DNCB. The DNCB is not subject to a means test, is tax free and is currently paid at the rate of $42 per fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill provides an increase in the DNCB from $21 a week to $26 a week from 6 January 1993. The benefit is to be indexed annually on the basis of the CPI changes and will also be paid to carers during periods of respite care of up to 42 days per year. Whilst the increase of $5 a week in the DNCB is welcomed, the industry, carers and consumers feel that it is still woefully inadequate at $26 per week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move to the issue of private nursing home funding. The 1991-92 Budget introduced a system under which additional recurrent funding would be provided for a period of 10 years where a proprietor builds a new home or completely rebuilds an existing home. The Bill will implement the 1992-93 Budget decision to expand the funding available under this system. However, the funding is capped. An approval in principle system for new and rebuilt homes is created, allowing borrowing against increased recurrent funding after the home is built or rebuilt. However, it is possible that many proprietors who do not intend to rebuild their homes in the near future will, nevertheless, apply for an approval in principle just in case they change their minds or the State health authorities force them to rebuild. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, therefore, a risk that the available approvals in principle will be wasted. To avoid this possibility this legislative amendment allows the approval in principle to be revoked if no progress is made towards the rebuilding. The approvals in principle will then be able to be reallocated. The voluntary sector is concerned that it has been virtually excluded from the additional funding provided for new and rebuilt private nursing homes and former participating religious charitable homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, whilst we will not be declining to give the Bill a second reading, the Opposition is of the opinion that certain sections of the Bill should be subject to a detailed consideration by a parliamentary committee. The Opposition supports the industry's call for the provisions relating to hostel subsidies and resident classification reviews to be referred to a Senate legislative committee for consideration. Neither of these measures was discussed with the industry, nor has there been any proper consultation as to the implementation and effect of these measures on the viability of the industry. In view of the seriously critical importance of the maintenance of existing services to the well-being of older persons residing in hostels and nursing homes, it is not good enough to simply consider that these matters are Budget</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address the measures incorporated in the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). This Bill facilitates measures aimed at providing assistance for aged care&mdash;an extension of this Government's proud record of support for our aged citizens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments encompass a range of issues, including the amendments to part III of the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954, which are designed to increase equity with regard to hostel subsidies by providing higher subsidies for financially disadvantaged persons. The Bill amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 to close a loophole which would enable a child, in respect of whom family allowance is not being paid because of the income or assets test, to be declared a disadvantaged person and thus be issued with a health care card and receive pharmaceutical benefits at the concessional rate of patient contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill also amends part VAB of the National Health Act 1953. Part VAB of the National Health Act currently contains provisions allowing additional recurrent funding to be provided when a nursing home is rebuilt or when a new nursing home is built. The aim of these provisions is to improve the quality of nursing home buildings and, hence, to improve the quality of care. The nursing home industry took the view that this initiative would not efficiently meet its objective, since a proprietor could only apply for the additional funding after building the new home. The industry said that a proprietor considering rebuilding his home needed an assurance of the additional funding before construction commenced, as he would not otherwise be able to borrow the money to rebuild. The proposed amendment overcomes this problem and introduces a system of approvals in principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments of section 4 of the National Health Act will allow for Medicare benefits payable under the Health Insurance Act, for consultations by participating optometrists to private patients in a hospital or day hospital facility to be treated as domiciliary visits so as to attract Medicare benefits at the 85 per cent rate, rather than the 75 per cent rate for hospital patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another change proposed in relation to the domiciliary nursing care benefit implements decisions taken by the Government in the 1992 Budget context to increase the benefit from $42 to $52 per fortnight from January 1993, to maintain its value thereafter by annual indexation, and to continue payment of the benefit for up to 42 days per calendar year during periods of respite care&mdash;a measure which will be welcomed by many affected people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Labor Government came to power in 1983, it has greatly increased the funding available to the nursing home industry. Commonwealth funding for aged care has increased significantly since 1983-84 when the funds spent per person aged 70 and over was $946. This figure has grown to $1,894 in 1991-92. In real terms, allowing for inflation, this Government is now directly spending an extra $339 per person for people in this age group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's aim has always been to assist nursing home proprietors to improve the quality of life and the quality of care for nursing home residents. We have deliberately designed strategies aimed at enabling our elderly citizens to have a choice about the kind of accommodation they want in their senior years. For many, declining health has meant that a nursing home is the only option with essential nursing care offered in these facilities. But age pensioners without assets have often faced a decision between a no frills option, while the opportunity still existed for those with the cash to enjoy extra comforts in their later years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has introduced initiatives that give people in most need increased support by way of increased subsidies to nursing homes and hostels. This is an important aspect of our social policy. I am aware that a difficult situation can still exist for many aged and frail aged people wanting to get into nursing homes or hostels, particularly with the increasing ratio of elderly people to young people in the work force who, on a year by year basis, actually provide the funds or the facilities for the senior generations. It is in this context that these initiatives must be seen as cogs in the Labor strategy to give choices to our senior citizens&mdash;one of the most valued of which is the choice to remain in one's own home when age and frailty make the help of a carer necessary. This is a situation which many people will face. It is a situation which people in this House will, at some stage, most likely be facing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1984 the Federal Government initiated, in conjunction with the State governments, the now well-known home and community care program. HACC funds services which enable frail elderly people and people with disabilities who choose this option to remain living in their own homes. These services include repair or maintenance tasks, such as even changing a light bulb, replacing tap washers and garden maintenance, and also include general household support, such as help with cleaning, cooking, shopping and personal care. It is these little chores, taken for granted by many of us, that can make the difference between the ability to live at home or the necessity to move into a nursing home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to have in my electorate of Lilley in Queensland a new Advocacy Centre, a service for older people which was announced recently by the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples). The HACC Advocacy Centre in Nundah, under its new title, the Older Persons Advocacy Centre, OPAS, has been expanded to provide advocacy services for residents of nursing homes and hostels, as well as frail aged people living in the community. It is important to note that, despite its name, the service caters for people of all ages with disabilities who may access the services of OPAS. I urge such people to take advantage of the service as an adjunct to the growing number of facilities fashioned specifically for them. I will address the issue of specific facilities for people with disabilities at another time. They may not, and often do not, wish to be linked with services for frail aged people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage, I will outline the services offered by OPAS. The centre fulfils two roles incorporating the HACC programs, as well as promoting the rights of people living in nursing homes and in hostels. It provides free and confidential advice so that people are assisted to make informed choices for themselves and, if necessary, advocates are available to act on behalf of their clients. The Advocacy Centre will inform people of their rights and support them when they have decided how best to address issues of particular concern to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to commend publicly here, Wendy Skitch, the Golden Years Senior Citizens Centre and the staff at OPAS who have pulled together in a cooperative and positive manner to offer this service to residents of Brisbane. I also congratulate the Minister for establishing the Older Persons Advocacy Centre in an electorate&mdash;my electorate&mdash;which has 15 per cent of people in receipt of age pensions. It has 17 nursing homes, including Eventide, the largest in Queensland, and nine age hostels catering for over 2,000 people. HACC recognises the invaluable role of carers in enabling the majority of frail older people and people with disabilities to remain living independently in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most important services provided directly to carers by HACC is respite. This provides a break from the pressures and stresses of looking after their relatives which is essential to the well-being of the carer. The most commonly used form of respite under HACC is provided by day care centres. Clients can spend several hours a day, several days a week, in a day care centre where meals will be provided and activities conducted both to entertain and to give practice in maintaining skills. They are magnificent services. Alternatively, respite may be provided in the client's home for a few hours a day or even overnight. This service is vital in helping carers to go on with their task. Often carers have little time for themselves&mdash;no time for shopping, visiting friends or spending quality time with others or their own family members. I believe it is appropriate in the framework of this debate to acknowledge the measures taken by this Government to assist carers, the unsung heroes of our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Carers come from all walks of life and all kinds of backgrounds. They are in every street in every suburb. They include people who speak little or no English and those with special cultural traditions, including Aborigines. They are people in cities and in remote communities. They are mostly women, but there is a growing number of male carers. They can be any age. There are adult children looking after their ill or ageing parents, and elderly people looking after a partner. Many care for someone who has a disability, and a large number of parents devote their lives to the care of children with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within this enormous community of carers there are even more distant relatives and friends who have made the decision to take up the role of carer. Without these people the drain on the public purse to provide institutional care would be overwhelming. It is realistic to say that many other Government initiatives at all levels of government would never eventuate if taxpayers had to provide complete care for a significant portion of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the important measures in the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) is aimed at supporting carers by making changes to the domiciliary nursing care benefits. It provides financial assistance to 33,000 carers who provide invaluable 24-hour care and support for people who would otherwise probably be in a nursing home. In the recent Budget, the Government made a crucial contribution to carers as part of the $93m package. These initiatives reflected strong recognition by the Government of the immense contribution of carers to the Australian community and the important opportunity they provide to people who, without their care, might no longer be able to live at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such changes, initiated by this Government, will help people such as Ann, a constituent who came into my electorate office a couple of weeks ago. Her mother is now unable to care for herself so Ann, who is now 50 and with a career, is seriously considering giving up her job and caring for her mother. I was able to tell her of the increased level of benefits that will take effect from January that will give her an income and that the income will be indexed annually to ensure that the benefit maintains its value in real terms.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the benefit will continue during the periods of respite care that she can receive for her mother; that will be up to 42 days per year. In this way, there will be support for Ann while she takes a much deserved break from the continuing care task. Respite care is the service most valued by carers. The Government is providing a substantial boost in financial assistance to carers through the domiciliary nursing care benefit. This is just one example of our ongoing support of those in our community who really need it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most stressful situations facing an increased number of people in our community is that of a person close to them suffering from Alzheimer's disease or from dementia. This means a progressive decline in the sufferer's ability to cope with everyday life. There is presently no reprieve once the condition is diagnosed, although research is being undertaken into the area and it is hoped that there will soon be a breakthrough. There may be behavioural disturbances and, in the end, incontinence. Eventually the time may come when people suffering from Alzheimer's do not even recognise who is caring for them&mdash;often a child, or a spouse of decades. This brings heartbreak. This is truly a heart-wrenching lifestyle in which the costs are many but the rewards are few. Despite this, countless thousands of people continue in the caring role. These are the people who are assisted by provisions of the legislation under discussion tonight, the original Act, and the many programs put forward under HACC and other policies of this Government. They are people who are the human face of the debate, the statistics and the policy statements that we put forward in this House, and I think it is appropriate that we think of that flowthrough as we discuss the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A 1988 survey of ageing and disability estimated that about 300,000 carers live in the same house as the people they care for. There are doubtless many more who are able to live elsewhere, and many of these people do not themselves recognise that they are carers; they simply see it as their responsibility. They act from a motivation of love and would not surrender their role, but they suffer from stress and isolation, and may need assistance to maintain their caring role. This Government has recognised the needs of these diverse groups through the release of its carers policy and the assistance announced in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The HACC program recognises that carers are absolutely essential to the proper support of the majority of frail older people and younger people with disabilities who wish to remain living independently in the community. HACC provided over $54m last year in respite services. It was money wellspent. Despite this, there remains a significant unmet demand. In order to address that demand, this Government has allocated a further $40m over the next four years. We recognise that relief for the carers is vital, and so is support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome funding of carer associations around the country as part of this Government's commitment to carers. These associations will keep carers informed about matters of interest. They provide counselling and training in appropriate areas. They also give carers the chance to get together and gain support from each other, to share information and experiences, and to strengthen their feeling of worth and self-esteem. The provisions in this Bill attempt to facilitate services which any government would wish to distribute to as great an extent as possible to meet the unmet needs within our community. It is a wonderful contribution to an area which is becoming maybe more and more of a concern to governments as we reach the turn of the century and as we come into that situation forecast for some years whereby the ratio of aged people by far outweighs the number of younger people who are in the work force and whose tax money is required to keep these services going. Sometimes priorities must be set. The right for a priority as far as this Government is concerned, and as far as I am concerned, is for those people who are most disadvantaged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I propose simply to address the medical and health aspects of this Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), leaving aside some of the community services aspects which have been already addressed by my colleague the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott). I am delighted to inform the House that I will be fairly brief. There are a number of items here that are uncontentious. There is only one item that I wish to address in some depth. Some of the health issues related to this Bill are, for example, the extension to 1995 of the sunset provisions relating to radiology services which were going to end on 1 January next year, 1993, to allow the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners the time to develop accreditation guidelines for GPs who provide those radiology services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the whole of the radiology area has been thrown into great turmoil by the overturning by a Senate committee, organised and run of course by the Government and with a Government chairman, of the proposals for radiology put forward by the Minister concerned, the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe). It was yet another of the somersaults for which the Minister is becoming famous in this place&mdash;or perhaps I should say infamous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect that I wish to mention is an attempt to reduce doctors' ordering of unnecessary pathology whereby they are provided with, in effect, bribes by some pathologists who offer either nursing or other staff for the use of medical practitioners with an understanding that the medical practitioner will increase the pathology ordering as a result of this benefit. These cannot be provided at the premises of the doctor. There was in fact a loophole in previous amending legislation that attempted to do this; this legislation closes that loophole. The legislation indicates that the registration of an organisation of a health fund will be cancelled where the health benefits fund business conducted by that fund has been transferred to other organisations. An error in previous legislation inadvertently repealed this provision. It was obviously a sensible provision, and it is just an indication of the incompetence of this Government that it actually repealed such a sensible provision and did not manage to pick it up until such a late time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another provision is that optometrical consultations rendered whilst a private patient is in hospital or an approved day hospital facility should attract the normal 85 per cent MBS fee normally payable for medical services. Currently the rebate is 75 per cent, with health insurance funds being able to offer the remaining 25 per cent for insured patients. The payment of 75 per cent rather than 85 per cent was another of these unintentional consequences of changes in the legislation to reduce Medicare benefits for services rendered to private patients in hospital or day hospital facilities. The amendment recognises that the optometrical consultation is often not allied with the reason for the hospital visit. For example, somebody might drop his glasses and break them and need an optometrical opinion. Because of this it seems inappropriate that a reduction in the rebate should occur in this regard simply because of a chance occurrence such as this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is currently a legislative loophole which enables a child to be declared a disadvantaged person and therefore eligible to receive a health care card. The child is able to receive pharmaceutical drugs at the concession rate of $2.60 under this loophole, rather than at the patient contribution rate of $15.90. This Bill closes that loophole&mdash;another crazy loophole which should never have been allowed to occur and which indicates the sloppiness of this Government in its various amendments over the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other drafting errors in previous amending legislation are fixed in this Bill, including amendments that were made in error to provisions relating to members of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal instead of to provisions dealing with the supply of pharmaceutical benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>Most of these are uncontentious, but they are an indication of the turmoil and the sloppiness of the Government in the health arena at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major embarrassments to this Government must be its handling of health issues. The Minister concerned clearly has made a complete failure of his handling of this portfolio, and this has been widely recognised throughout not only the health community but the general community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one issue which we need to address and on which we will be moving an amendment in committee. This relates to patient referrals from GPs to consultant physicians or specialists. Information about the service rendered will have to be retained for 18 months by the specialists and produced to the Health Insurance Commission on request. We have no problem with that aspect. Clearly it is important for referrals to be retained to ensure that fraud and fiddling are not going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem that we have is that this legislation indicates that failure to produce either the referral or the information requested within seven days carries a penalty of $500. It seems crazy to us to require that sort of information to be presented within seven days. What happens if the secretary of the practice is on holiday, or the doctor himself is on holiday? What happens if there is some sickness in the practice, some disorganisation or the removal of the practice to other premises? Seven days seems to be a ridiculously short time in which to require that information and therefore we will move an amendment at the committee stage to extend that seven-day period to 30 days&mdash;clearly a reasonable period and one that I hope the Government will be sensible about and accept. The indications that I have received to date are that the Government will not accept even a modest increase such as this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some comments have been made to me that this is yet another indication of the paranoia and the chips on the shoulders of some members of the Government with regard to the medical profession. It has been interpreted by some members of the medical profession as yet another example of the witch-hunt carried out most notably by the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear), but in this case being maintained by the Minister concerned. We will therefore move that amendment in committee and I signal that to the House at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from that, the Bill is uncontentious. We will support the other recommendations and only accuse the Government of being incompetent in allowing these issues to arise in the first place and, secondly, in not dealing with them more promptly and more expeditiously. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can assure the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) that I have no chip on my shoulder as regards doctors, GPs or specialists. I would like to thank those members who have participated in the debate&mdash;the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling), and the honourable member for Lowe, whose suggested two amendments we will have some discussions about later in committee; I will be happy to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pick up three aspects of the debate that were raised by the honourable member for Maranoa on the question of subsidies to those in hostels and nursing homes. The honourable member for Maranoa bemoaned the fact that there had been some changes to hostel personal care subsidies. The basic change is that we chose in the Budget to increase the subsidy for financially disadvantaged persons, but there have been some offsets for those who are not disadvantaged persons. Our view here is that hostels have a greater capacity to raise income from their non-financially disadvantaged residents through avenues such as entry contributions and variable fees. Of course, these options just are not available for those who are financially disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Lilley mentioned, we seek basically to look after those whose needs are great but whose means are not. So our views on this matter are clear. We always shoot for equity and, as the honourable member for Lilley also mentioned, out of a given budget we have to make the most sensible decisions and share the money around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems a bit rough to me to be criticised by an Opposition member who is part of a pretend, alternative, government that would seek to cut between $6,000m and $10,000m from public expenditure and still hope to keep the level of subsidy that we have been able to gain for people as they are put into personal care, whether in hostels or at home. It is just not possible or credible for an Opposition member to debate the level of subsidy that this Government has given to those people when the Opposition would cut the public sector by $6 billion to $10 billion. That is a lot of money. It is pretty obvious that some of the money would have to be withdrawn from these sorts of subsidies&mdash;the subsidies that, quite frankly, are now essential to keep people well cared for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Maranoa thanked us for raising the domiciliary nursing care benefit but bemoaned the fact that we had not raised the subsidy even higher. Again, that was a bit rough when we consider the alternative. We cannot have as an alternative putting everything up and spending lots of money and then seeking to say to the Australian people that our credibility is based on cutting the government sector and cutting the amount that the taxpayer chooses to spend on the care of frail aged people, for instance. We cannot increase subsidies and look after people if we want to diminish the effort that governments make in assisting a lot of people but particularly the frail aged, because they do use a great deal of taxpayer subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite what the coalition says, there is good news. We have raised the domiciliary nursing care benefit which provides financial assistance to carers of people over the age of 16 who have been assessed as needing a nursing home level of care. Part 3 of the Bill includes amendments to support three changes to the benefit to take effect from 6 January next year. These changes are: firstly, that we increase the level of benefit; secondly, that we index the benefit annually; and, thirdly, that we continue to pay the benefit during periods of respite care up to 42 days per calendar year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Maranoa made one other point on the question of amendments to the date of effect of resident classification instruments. I think the nub of the honourable member's argument was that somehow we would apply a review retrospectively so as to disadvantage a nursing home&mdash;that we would give it a subsidy up-front, check the classifications that it makes for each of its residents and then later withdraw it if we found it to be in error. Not only should we do this; we are also bound to do it because if incorrect classifications are made&mdash;some fraudulently, I might say&mdash;we need the right to withdraw those moneys which are paid in advance. We need the right and the power to withdraw those moneys that are paid incorrectly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one will be disadvantaged. If we do not make this sort of amendment it means that there will be no incentive to not falsify records. We do not want to leave open a situation where it is actually to the advantage of a nursing home proprietor to falsify records, receive in advance money from the Commonwealth and then have it fixed later but hold the money. We cannot have that; it is not responsible. We have to close the loophole such that when we do determine that an incorrect classification has been made we can pull back the subsidy that was given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot accept the arguments of the honourable member for Maranoa on the question of our amendments to the date of effect of the resident classification instrument reviews. I find it laughable, on the question of subsidies to hostel personal care and to the increased subsidy to domiciliary nursing care benefit, that he can even enter the field and suggest that we have not done enough, when the very nub of the Opposition's argument is that it would cut severely government expenditure, which must apply to these essential services. I congratulate the honourable member for Lilley on being able to mention particular people who have worked with her for a long time. I also thank the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) for his work on this legislation and commend all the amendments to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>The amendments relate to the issues I raised at the second reading stage&mdash;the question of the time in which the Government will allow specialists to produce their referral notes which in the proposed legislation is a mere seven days. The amendments substitute 30 for seven, effectively increasing the period to 30 days. It is ridiculous to expect specialists, or indeed anybody, to produce any documentation within a period of seven days. What happens if the specialist or the secretary is on holiday? What happens if no practice secretary is there at a given time? What happens if there is a change in staff? What happens if the piece of literature&mdash;we are talking about one small slip of paper amongst literally hundreds of thousands in many cases&mdash;has been genuinely mislaid? There are any number of reasons why this approach is draconian and completely inappropriate. It is clearly not going to disadvantage the Commonwealth if we extend the period of seven days to 30 days. It is obviously a sensible amendment. It is not a question of party politicking. It is simply a question of doing what is fair and reasonable in regard to this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Laws Amendment Bill 1992 relates to control mechanisms in the immigration program. When the Migration Act was amended in 1989, part of the schema that was then proposed by the Government was to ensure that those categories of entry which were non-demand driven&mdash;that is, the categories of concessional and independent entry&mdash;should be capable of being capped. The fact is that in areas relating to preferential family reunion&mdash;for instance, spouse entry and entry for other close family members&mdash;the program is filled by the numbers of people wanting to apply to come to Australia. Those categories are regarded as being demand driven in the economic stream area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, employer nominations can be demand driven. It is dependent upon the numbers of applications generated by employers who satisfy the relevant conditions and cannot find employees within Australia. If we have parts of the program driven by the numbers of applications that are received&mdash;that is, the numbers of people who satisfy the requirements&mdash;we need a program which can be limited to the particular numbers established by the Government in its announcements. We need to be able, in essence, to cap those categories which are non-demand driven. As I mentioned, they are the concessional and independent areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was designed to prevent a blow-out in the immigration program. Even though we put those provisions in place in 1989, to this point in time they have not been used. The power was seen as being too blunt an instrument because it meant that the suspension of all applications would occur if the programs were capped. No processing would be undertaken. At a later point if it were decided to take the cap off the processing of new applications would continue but there would be enormous lags. The way in which the provision might operate could create a lack of fairness and equity between applicants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that the Government is now looking at the possibility of having to cap the program. The program numbers have come off to 80,000 this year in the Government's announced program. I assume that the basis for the Government looking at the way in which these provisions might operate and proposing fresh amendments is that it has in mind that it may need to use powers to suspend further processing in particular cases but did not wish to use the capping powers that were already there. Therefore, the Government has proposed in this Bill an alternative legislative scheme to cap various categories in the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This means that migration applications, even though the new capping arrangements could be used, can be accepted and held until the cap is either varied or lifted. It also means that those people who apply will not find that processing stops in relation to their applications if they are not successful; that is, they can be advised that their application has been rejected. Therefore, at least they will be informed of the outcome. It also means that the Government can continue to receive application fees and act in relation to those; that departmental officials in overseas posts will not suddenly become discharged of a workload if there is a suspension; and that there would be meaningful and useful activity in which they could be engaged. If the program cap is lifted at a later point, the matters can then be proceeded with, with some work having already been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also amends certain provisions to effect corrections to technical errors that arose in the Migration Amendment Act (No.2) 1991. Part 2 of the Bill establishes a scheme which will provide for the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs to have a flexible power to publish in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette </EMPHASIS>an upper limit or cap on the number of visas in a specified class or classes that may be granted in a particular year. The cap may be imposed or lifted at any time during that year by announcement in the Government <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>. It is clear that the capping powers are not to be applied to spouses, aged parents and dependent children; that is, the categories which are demand driven. Finally, in case the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) has any other concerns, I should say that the Opposition does not intend to oppose the introduction of this schema. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do have a number of matters that I wish to raise. The Minister considered one of them and obtained certain advice. It is important that the issues be put clearly before the Parliament because there are certain principles in relation to migration entry which I think are important, which the Opposition believes are important, and which I believe are important to the Government. One of those is the principle that in our approach to immigration&mdash;regardless of whatever other criteria are used&mdash;country of origin, race, religion and matters of that sort shall not be used as a basis to choose between individual applicants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note the basis upon which the Minister can impose ceilings on the numbers of visas that can be granted at overseas posts. The legislative schema will enable a cap to be established on the basis of particular posts. Therefore, with ceilings that are established on that basis, there is a potential or an appearance that factors other than merely of a planning nature could be taken into account. We are told that many of the factors that might be used would be past experience, anticipated demand, and matters of this sort which could well lead to variations between posts. That is a matter that I understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, preferential category entrants will not be affected. This is only going to occur in the concessional independent areas. But if these ceilings are imposed, processing continues and visas are issued which are only valid for certain purposes, there is the potential that, if we put a quota on a particular post which is determined by discretion, some communities could look very critically at those matters. This is a question that needs to be addressed very sensitively and carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those groups, which often lobby and press for variations for particular reasons, ought to be assured that discriminatory factors of the sort that I am mentioning are not matters that shall be taken into account at all. I note that, in relation to this potential for possible discrimination, the Minister has sought advice from the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) that the provisions as drafted do not preclude judicial review as to the exercise of the discretionary power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Particularly if there were improper use, I would regard racial factors, countries of origin and religion as being matters on which the Minister's judgment could be tested on that basis. I have sought privately from the Minister assurances in relation to this. He certainly tells me, and I am sure he will affirm, that if any misuse were to occur in this matter it would go very much against the spirit and the intent of these amendments and the policy that the Government would seek to apply and the policies that the Opposition would want to see applied. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome that. The fact is that some provisions in this Bill, in the technical language used, although intended to operate in much the same form as provisions in the existing Act, could give rise to some difficulties because of the different wording. Argument could be adduced as a result of the different drafting that these provisions were intended to operate differently from those already in the Act. It seemed to me that this was a matter that needed to be put beyond doubt and that either the form of words used in the present Act should be changed to be consistent with the amendments proposed here or the words used in the existing Act should be used in this amending Bill. One way or another, the provisions should be brought into line.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the Minister's foreshadowed amendments to give effect to those changes. It seems to me that that will resolve any potential for difficulties that could arise with this legislation at a later time. Such legislation, which will become an Act of this Parliament, is increasingly the subject of careful consideration by legal advisers. It is becoming very much more technical in its application, and it is certainly desirable when drafting is undertaken to ensure that any possible difficulties of that sort are not left to be exploited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that we are dealing with legislation that is intended to give effect to the Government's announced intention to reduce the size of the immigration program this year to a figure of 80,000. As I mentioned, the capping power is an important facet in that regard.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the helpful way that I like to make suggestions in this area from time to time, I am sure the Minister has been apprised of some of my statements at other times suggesting further steps that the Government might properly take to ensure that the immigration program is more carefully structured and targeted. I know that my comments and those of my colleagues are sometimes misrepresented in this area. A document was published in the Minister's absence called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Poles Apart</EMPHASIS>. It had some critical observations to make about the approach that the Opposition takes in this area, but it is important to note that there are a number of ways in which the program might be more carefully targeted, firstly to limit abuse and, secondly, to ensure that it delivers an outcome that is more carefully attuned to our nation's national interest. That national interest is often reflected in the skills outcome of the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, ever since the Fitzgerald report, has tended to emphasise over time that it pays special regard to the skills outcome and seeks to maintain that at the highest level. But the fact is that this year's program will see a substantially lower skills outcome than we have seen in recent years. It is a product of the way in which the Government's reduction of the program has been targeted. The Opposition in the way it defines skill&mdash;and this was revealed in certain Estimates debates in another place fairly recently&mdash;believes that the immediate relevance of skills that are acceptable to the Australian labour market is still not a matter that is taken into account, and certainly not a matter that is taken into account in determining the real skills level of the program. One can have people entering Australia with skills which may be recognised but which will never have the potential to be used, and which by the time they can be used, when the domestic labour market improves, will probably no longer be current because people have lacked the opportunity to use them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly the Opposition's view that the immigration program needs to be more carefully targeted to ensure that the Australian labour market is one of the factors included in any points testing arrangements. The Opposition is also of the view that, if this country is going to more carefully structure its immigration program, access to benefits is a matter that needs to be addressed in a much more determined way than has been undertaken by the Government to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome, as the Minister may have observed in some comments that I have made elsewhere, the Government's introduction in the recent Budget of a six-month restriction on access to benefits. But, were the Government to follow the Opposition's approach wholly, I believe it would have a significant impact on the way in which the program is presently targeted and would address much of the aspect of the present program whereby people have sought to come here, even in the context of the disastrous unemployment situation, because benefits are generally accessible after a short period and are still somewhat generous when compared to the circumstances that might apply in their homeland. That is an important factor to which the Government has not paid sufficient regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made some other comments in relation to the area of spouse entry. Of the order of 26,000 spouses and de facto partners are expected to enter Australia under the present immigration program. While nobody would want to deny genuine spouses or de facto partners the opportunity of joining their companion here in Australia, I think one would always be of the view that migration entry ought not to be manipulated by a fabricated relationship. This is an important matter and it has been, I think, well-addressed by the Government in relation to those people applying for a grant of resident status in Australia, but in relation to those people who are entering Australia from offshore it has still not been adequately addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a well-known matter of anecdotal evidence in many communities that people still enter Australia in relationships when their principal purpose is migration and they have no intention of remaining in that relationship. Although the great bulk of the 26,000 people who enter Australia come under marriage relationships, it seems to me still one-third or more enter under de facto relationships. Evidence given to the parliamentary Committee some time ago was that there is always some greater element of doubt about people's bona fides in the area of de facto relationships. </PARA>

I am sure officials try to have regard to many of the techniques disclosed in that, but it certainly seems to me that the provisions which were sought by the Government domestically&mdash;that is, for those applying for a grant of resident status whereby a period of two years temporary entry was given&mdash;were not unreasonable provisions for application for those entering Australia from offshore; in other words, to see whether the relationship is of a continuing nature after a reasonable period of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly experienced practitioners to whom I have spoken believe that it would be very difficult for people to maintain a fraudulent relationship for a two-year period if it were to be tested. I would also suggest, given the evidence the parliamentary Committee received, that a period longer than six months in a de facto relationship ought to be taken into account. This may require the amendment of some other legislation such as the sex discrimination legislation. I do not regard that as being at all unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the Citizenship Act is already an Act, as the courts interpret it, in which there are different provisions operating for those who marry as distinct from those who are in de facto relationships, and it seems to me that distinction ought to be made in relation to immigration entry arrangements, which are of far greater import. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The six-month period of cohabitation is certainly far too short. As I understand it, that provision was forced upon the Government as a result of a view as to the way in which the Sex Discrimination Act would apply in this area. The Minister looks puzzled, but it is my understanding that the view was that by the time people gave relevant notice, entered into a marriage relationship and made their bookings at the church or whatever, it would probably take about six months for a pair to be able to enter into such a relationship, and that if one had to find a roughly equivalent period for a de facto relationship which presumably could commence on the date when people say, `We are now living together', six months was roughly equivalent. In my view that is not a proper basis upon which to determine the important decision of migration entry, and it is a matter I think the Government can properly address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, I think people entering into second, third or fourth relationships with people offshore is a serious matter. Although a good deal of counselling goes on and although there is more careful scrutiny when people do not seem to be able to make their relationships work and continue to go offshore looking for a marriage partner, in my view the relatively short periods of time in which people can undertake such a new relationship when their first one breaks down fairly quickly after entry to Australia is a matter that ought to be addressed in a regulatory way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, as I understand is the case in the United States, there are provisions which already do limit people who wish to achieve permanent entry to Australia as spouses of Australian citizens or permanent residents. There ought to be restrictions in terms of their capacity to go offshore if the marriage relationship breaks down in a relatively short period after their arrival in Australia. I have been apprised of cases where people have come here, waited until permanent residency is granted, moved out of the relationship almost immediately and then sought to sponsor a new partner from offshore. These people ought not be rewarded if the original intention was to use an Australian permanent resident or citizen for the purpose of obtaining migrant entry with no intention of a genuine, long term relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are other matters the Minister can properly take up. They would have a significant impact upon spouse entry, which has been one of the fastest growing areas of the program. If this were to be far more carefully targeted the number of spouse entrants would be reduced quite considerably. It would not deny genuine spouses the opportunity to come to Australia, but it would ensure that those people who are abusing the system are weeded out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact would be quite significant also in terms of the skill level. I certainly would not want to make the change in relation to refugees as I take the view that we have a very special responsibility in relation to refugees, but it is the fact that the degrading of the skill level occurs most significantly in the area of refugee entry and in the preferential family stream. As they are the areas in which this occurs, we have to be much more careful to ensure that any abuse is in fact contained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have done in other forums, I offer these comments in a very constructive and positive way. Certainly I encourage the Minister to take them up. I have no objection to plagiarism in this area. I do not know what the honourable member for Calwell might say about it if the Minister were to take up any of these matters, but I think these are very useful issues to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not commented on the refugee area because I know it is likely, separately, to be the subject of legislation during this session. It is another area, of course, in which there is abuse and great care needs to be taken. I am sure that the legislation the Minister will bring forward at a later point in time will be a careful and thoughtful response to those shortcomings. To that extent, of course, we will carefully review it, and to the extent that it meets the sorts of objectives that we have highlighted from time to time undoubtedly it will receive the same sort of thoughtful and constructive passage that this legislation has received. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Previous speakers in this debate have emphasised that the Migration Laws Amendment Bill deals with capping and entrenching in relation to the Migration Act 1958. The background to that is the 12 May announcement of the intake for the coming year, which envisaged substantial reductions in the Government's expected intake and, more particularly, a decrease to 80,000. It contained major retractions in specific areas&mdash;the concessional family category falling from 19,000 to 6,000 and independents from 30,000 to nearly 13,500, as well as in relative terms a significant decrease in employer nominations. The background of this decrease in the intake forms the central need to give the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) power to cap.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), said that there might have been a coincidence of policy rather than any attempt to catch up with Opposition views in this policy area. I think that is very much the case. Very few of us are so immune to society and so separate from what is occurring around us as to be unaware of concerns out there in the wider electorate about migration levels, the nature of the intake and its alleged relationship with employment patterns. Clearly the Government has felt the same pressures as many of those opposite about where it should go in this policy area. It is largely coincidental rather than an attempt to beat the Opposition out there in the racist marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will speak later about some statements made by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) dealing with the inter-relationship of the economy and migration. This suggestion to cap gives the Minister substantial power to avoid what has been described by other speakers as the bluntness of the current provisions in relation to the processing of visas under section 28 and permits through section 40. People are aware of statements by the Minister pointing to some of the problems that arise from not moving down this road. It has been claimed that otherwise we would have the needless suspension of processing, even in contexts where people would not be permitted to come into the country anyway. They would not be processed, they would be sitting around facing what is largely a non-event, and indeed would not even get into the country in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, it has been claimed that the absence of this kind of power would lead to fairly uneven workload patterns throughout the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and, I guess, the posts themselves. I think we are already aware that the degree of pressure on various overseas posts is very diverse. It relates to the internal situations in those countries, the nature and level of the community within this country, and the connections with the homeland. All of those are crucial elements in the level of demand at those posts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To deny the Minister the right to move in this direction could, it has been correctly alleged, lead to a worsening pattern which sees concessional family claims taking 15 months in Pretoria, only four months in Auckland and 23 months in Beijing. Equally, in the independent category there would be a time scale in Manila of 20 months and in Tokyo of six. The uneven workload patterns and the inability of the Minister to allow posts to have caps are amongst the reasons one has to consider. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intake this year has targeted particular components of the overall intake. Certain categories have decreased more than others. Others in both relative and absolute terms have decreased markedly. Without this capping, the position would be far more difficult. It should be said that this capping concept cannot apply to all areas. As indicated earlier, others are demand-influenced. It is clear that aged parents, dependent children and spouses in the immediate family are not affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A variety of comments were made about the skills component. I think we have to be realistic that the overall migration policies of the past few years have been centrally identified, with an increased requirement for English. This has been evident in the new stipulations in regard to business migration, which were influenced by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, and in the number of categories which in future will require knowledge of English as prescribed in a recent ministerial announcement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are certain components in the program which take account of the fact that refugees may not have been to Oxford or Cambridge and that spouses are not necessarily intellectual giants. At the same time this Government has made a very real attempt through the points system to ensure that people gain entry for concrete reasons and having reached certain educational levels, rather than for nebulous reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have a program that looks at the degree to which we recognise overseas institutions. Those concepts are now central to a large part of the migration intake. They form a background to this legislation. There has been an attempt by the Government more clearly to target the intake to ensure that whilst there are very obvious humanitarian requirements, at the same time the Government moves to a greater emphasis on English requirements. It looks to the way in which English is delivered to incomers, and looks more clearly at the skills required. Indeed, the honourable member for Dundas said that in the past year the points system was altered in relation to the time when people obtained their qualifications overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent days the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has made a number of statements. I would like to deal with his comment on 10 October that every major study on this matter has reflected the negative impacts of migration. I prefer to be a little more agnostic about this issue. I do not really think the evidence is so emphatically black and white that we can say that absolutely and for certain all case studies point to negative impacts of migration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all right to say that Australia's greatest slippage in OECD terms occurred during a period of peak migration, but many factors have to be taken into consideration in order to arrive at the exact reasons for any such statement. It is questionable to say that it is crucially, absolutely and totally related to the level of migration intake. I do not subscribe to the view that we can say that migration is the be-all and end-all, that it massively and decisively increases our productivity and that without it we would be a hopeless nation. It would be incorrect to say that every study has pointed in this direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I agree with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie that we cannot rely on bodies such as the Bureau of Immigration Research as an objective judge and say that its papers are indicative, I would point to the fact that a large number of writers who are in no way bound to the Bureau say that the question is broader. Brian Parmeter in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economic Papers</EMPHASIS> of June 1990 commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even with a more careful definition of the questions to be posed and improvements in the analytical framework, more convincing research on the long term effects of immigration will still depend on more convincing empirical work.</PARA>
<PARA>John Perkins stated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Economic Review</EMPHASIS> of April 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Output in 1988 is estimated to have been 18 per cent above what it would have been had there been no immigration . . . output per capita increased as a result of immigration . . . the interpretation of such parameters is that a 10 per cent increase in factor inputs will generate an increase in output of 11.5 per cent for manufacturing and 12.8 per cent for the economy as a whole . . . these results relate to the combined effects of scale economies and embodied technological changes, so encompassing that part of technological development occurring with the investment, with associated scale of production.</PARA>
<PARA>Glenn Withers commented in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Journal of International Affairs</EMPHASIS> of May 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Very recent work finds a short term surplus, medium term debt and long term surplus on trade due to immigration. The long term benefit means that the medium term debt is `good' debt not `bad' debt.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think we can be absolutist and say that all evidence goes in one direction. But, clearly, the background to this decision to reduce the intake is a realisation that even those who defend migration acknowledge that in the short term the transfer payments go against the countries accepting migrants. There is an acknowledgment that the electorate feels that in the current very severe recession we cannot afford those short term costs. I put the view that there is a lot more work to be done on this. We cannot say that one writer has clearly proven to each and every one of us that there are no gains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect on which the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has spoken in recent days&mdash;and I would like to express some agreement with him&mdash;is the inability of the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) to understand his role as Chairman of the Caucus committee and of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations. There seems to be an inability to accept that those holding the position of chairman of a committee are not there to represent their views alone; they have the right to criticise policy in that area but must give the appearance to the general public that they are representing the Committee as opposed to themselves as individuals. I think that is a great danger in this policy area at the moment. As we see in Europe at the moment, it can create great tensions and great divisions in a society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem has been quite clearly indicated in a recent report to this Parliament by the Migration Regulations Committee: that one member would seemingly usurp the role of Chairman to parade his own views, which are a distinct minority view within that Committee. I think we have the same problem within the Caucus committee. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie quite correctly referred to the document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Towards a Fairer Immigration System for Australia</EMPHASIS>. That document is seemingly paraded as a document of the Party and of a committee in a particular policy area which has never been brought before the Committee and six months later has not even been sighted by that Committee. In recent times the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has quite correctly indicated concern that people would parade themselves, perhaps as alternative Ministers, as people who should be given the licence to go to conferences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As indicated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 12 September 1992, where a clearly distinct policy is seemingly enunciated by the Chairman, it is quite at variance to the continued support of the Caucus committee for the Minister's position in these matters. As I say, they are matters of concern in this policy area. This legislation is clearly designed to bring in necessary reductions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer briefly to the comments of the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs in regard to spouses. Any member who is in his electoral office often enough knows that, for all of the anecdotal evidence out there, the fact of life is that one has people coming into one's office every day of the week who have been refused permission to bring their wives into Australia because some bloke in Beirut cannot name the suburb of Sydney where the mosque or Maronite church is in which they are to be married. That is the kind of question the Department goes in for these days. We have the situation where the spouse of a person who is doing two different jobs a week and also studying is refused admission to this country because the authorities are not sure whether the spouse in Australia is a worker or a student. Quite obviously, this is indicative of very severe questioning by the Department. Those of us who have these cases coming in every day of the week are aware of the very strenuous efforts the Department is making to ensure that people are not very easily rorting the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I for one think the six-month period for a de facto relationship is quite reasonable. All we will accomplish by an increase is contrived attempts to get extensions of visas. This is already happening; people who have been with someone for five months are coming in wanting to get another two months for some purported reason so they will get over the six-month period. I do not think that will make a very concrete contribution to solving the problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might be out of tune with the design of the policy, but I would have thought that changing the rules in relation to people who marry when on tourist visas as opposed to those coming from offshore is designed not so much to attack fraudulent marriages as such but, as part of a general pattern, to start undermining a feeling overseas that people can just walk into Australia and, by some contrivance&mdash;not only that one&mdash;engineer permanent residence. It is part of that general pattern that we have not only in marriage, and something that I think both sides of the House would seek to diminish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I for one, as I say, do not advocate increasing the requirements for de facto relationships or engineering a situation where all couples have to live together for two years before they can get permanent residence. We all know that it is a fact of life that relationships crash&mdash;they can crash in a particularly short time&mdash;and to start penalising these people just because of `anecdotal evidence' is just not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, I think the suggestion by the shadow Minister in regard to relationships which collapse too soon and which then allow someone very quickly to bring another person in from offshore has a lot of validity. I recommend the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My concern with the Migration Laws Amendment Bill is that it relates essentially to the indecision by the Government as to what sort of a migration quota it wants for 1992-93. While I have understood something of the dilemma of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), it seems to me that the extent to which we have had a whole array of changes to the migration laws has promoted a good deal of concern in the community as to just where we are going and what the basis of future migration policy will be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side have said for a long time that, at a time of high unemployment and economic downturn, unless we are prepared to reduce the number of migrants coming into this country we will have a great many problems. This law provides for the suspension of the processing of visa applications and changing the basis of determining visas on a quantifiable basis. This smacks to me a little like the Minister deciding after the event that he believes he has to intrude, and illustrates to me that he is not sure just what the Government's policy will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the nature of migration at the moment there are three factors that do not necessarily flow from this legislation but are certainly matters before the community. I am quite aware that on the refugee scene the Minister has sought some capacity to balance those who apply for migration in the normal course against those who are applying for determination of refugee status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr Hand interjecting&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My worry as far as the refugees are concerned is that we run the risk at the moment of distorting our priorities for those who apply for migration in the normal course because of the overwhelming load of refugees, particularly the Chinese students, who seek change of status in a way that affects the priorities that should properly be accorded those who have been on the waiting lists and, because of a number of restrictions, are likely to be deferred for a number of years. Of course there is a problem with administering them, and there is a division within the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, of which there has been some mention in this debate and other debates in this House over the last little while. Some members of that Committee say a more sympathetic approach has to be taken to allow an extension of the temporary entry permit or in some way to perpetuate a situation which gives those involved a permanently different status from every other person in Australia, while others, according particularly to the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), will be in a position of rejecting the Chairman's advice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I am concerned, the recommendations of that Committee are clear. I know that the Minister has some sympathy for that point of view, and I hope that he will accept those recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, the first problem in the whole field&mdash;and I am interested in the way in which the Minister will respond&mdash;is the extent to which we seem to me to be hooked on a predicament that has been generated by successive Prime Ministers with inadequate advice which means that we will give priority to those who may not be classified as persons who are in genuine fear of persecution were they to return to their homeland against those who apply for migrant status in the normal course. That to me is the first and most fundamental quandary in the whole field of the administration of immigration at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second area that worries me relates to the determination of who will be accepted or rejected under this legislation. One of my worries in the general field of migration is the extent to which the Minister and his Government are allowing what I see as a tendency for migrants to retain their separateness rather than to become Australians. I know that it is a very difficult subject. If we are going to grow as a nation, we have to ensure that in the future the children of migrants have the same priorities that, in my view, children of new Australians had in the past. I have been delighted at the number of those who, whatever their origins, be they second generation Australians, those who were born outside Australia or those who were born immediately after their parents' arrival in Australia, have adopted a total Australian identity. The Australianisation of Australia, whoever the migrants are&mdash;old or new&mdash;is pre-eminent in my consideration of migrant policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am worried that&mdash;and this comes under the ethnic affairs part of the Minister's portfolio&mdash;today we tend to be too inclined to allow people to assert their separateness rather than their identity as Australians. I do not know that the Minister is necessarily of that view. While protecting, as we should, the rights of people to practise their religion, to maintain their customs and to preserve their heritage, we must not allow migrants ever to think that, if they are going to accept Australian citizenship, they should do other than see the English language and their Australian identity as pre-eminent in what they do. I do not see this second problem as necessarily flowing from this legislation; it is just part of the whole dimension of where we go in the administration of the policies of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area in this general field that concerns me is the problem of knowing who and what sort of a balance of people will be allowed in the future. I know there are problems with those who come in under a business category as business migrants. I do not think the Government has given enough consideration to what I see as people with skills. Family reunion is an emotional part of our migration policy, but, as you well know, Mr Deputy Speaker, if we are going to allow the migrants of the future to contribute to our well-being, it is those with skills who will essentially make a more significant contribution than those who come in simply because of family reunion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that people who come to Australia want to bring their families; they want to allow their closest blood relatives to come in too. But I am worried that, with the sorts of policies that this legislation reflects, there will still be a maintenance of what I would see as a disproportionate percentage of newcomers coming under that family reunion category rather than those that I would see as best suited to contribute to the advancement of Australian interests. Of all the areas in migration policy, that worries me the most. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this legislation, the Minister will have the capacity to provide limits on visas and treat migrants in a way that might well allow him to meet numerical quotas. But it is the quantitative and qualitative approach that need to be blended one to the other. Quality does not mean that one is looking at anything other than Australia's interests. I would hope that, in his interpretation of this legislation, the Minister might consider, to a greater degree than I think the present Labor Government has, the necessity for people coming into Australia not just to be here because Australia wants an augmentationist population, but because those who come to Australia can contribute to a better country. I have been most concerned that, in adopting migration policies over the last nine years of Labor administration, we have let the heart rule the head a little too much. </PARA>

I want people who will contribute to a better Australia. To my mind, that is the pre-eminent priority that I would give to the whole field of this legislation, including the administration of migrant policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see the legislation as another example of the Minister being unable to make up his mind as to what we have for the future. I know he has had problems. I am concerned about the quality of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. The advice received by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations suggests to me that the Committee is not in as good a state as it should be. For example, I have been appalled at the lack of knowledge of conditions in countries from which we source migrants. It might well be that information given to some of the officers of the Department is better than that given to the Committee. But it really appals me that there seems to be so little communication between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Immigration Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister would know, in our last report we made reference to the fact that there does need to be greater communication of information in the countries of source. This applies perhaps even more to refugees than it does to migrants. If people are going to be returned to their country of origin, we do not want to put them in a position of having their lives at risk and, consequently, we do not want to be seen as returning them to circumstances that are not acceptable in the normal course of the humane treatment of people. I think that is where this definition of refugees and the reasonable fear of persecution takes pre-eminence. I trust that, in the quality of that advice, as in other advice, the Department is not as bad as I have felt at times it has been in the evidence it has given to the Migration Regulations Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no objection to this legislation. I am more concerned about the quality of administration than the manner of administration. I regret that we seem to have so many changes in regulations and the legislation that it must be extraordinarily difficult for those in the community seeking to give advice to know just where we are going. It is a very important field. It is one that has as much significance today as it ever has in Australia's progress. I would hope that the economic management of Australia will improve so that unemployment can be reduced and the fear that so many existing residents and citizens of Australia have about migrants might be allayed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this blend between the need to try to contribute to Australia's well-being and the meeting of our humanitarian obligations that essentially lies behind so many of the changes that I know the Minister has made in the legislation. It is not just a matter of emotion; it should be a matter of our trying to look at Australia's interests first. I sometimes suspect that electoral pressures within electorates may be the basis for the changes that the Minister has pursued, rather than what would be in the long term a continuation of the best migrant policy that has motivated the changes. I hope that it is the latter, not the former. I will be interested to see how the Minister administers his task as it may not necessarily be the way that I see it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take no objection to the legislation, but I express my concerns about aspects of what I believe is one of the most emotional and significant areas of government policy and where I believe there has been too little notice taken of the priorities that Australia should give, as distinct from the priorities that I suspect electorally and humanitarianly seem to persuade the Government. For it is in that area that I think the Government has acted against what I would see as the preferred course in the administration of this extraordinarily important area of government policy. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to the present Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand). The present Minister is, in my view, one of the most courageous Ministers we have had in a long time. I think that he has done a very good job under very difficult circumstances. I know some of the pressures that have been on this Minister, in what the previous speaker, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) referred to as a very emotive issue. I think that he stuck to his guns extremely well. He was heard to comment some time ago about the lawyers. He used some adjectives that Minister Hand is prone to use. They would not be allowed by you, Mr Deputy Speaker, so I will not use them. But I think he is quite right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Walsh was undoubtedly the best Minister for Finance we have seen in this Parliament for a long time. Senator Walsh, by his control of the outlays, was the man who made the reputation of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as the world's greatest Treasurer; that was really done on the outlays side of the Budget by Senator Walsh. I think a lot of people, even those on the other side of the House, would agree with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I asked Senator Walsh what he thought was important, he said, `To keep the b. . . .. lawyers away from the money'. He is absolutely right. We have to keep the lawyers away from the money if we want the economy to run properly. If we want immigration to run, we certainly have to keep the lawyers away from immigration. They are a self-servicing breed that has done enormous damage. Again, that is a generalisation which is not always true, but it is a generalisation which is pretty accurate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make no bones about it, I support this legislation because it is a tentative step in the right direction; it is the first, faltering step down the road to lowering the migration intake overall. Migration is simply an idea whose time has passed. This country no longer needs large immigration. If we look at the history, we see that Australia's economy was at its best&mdash;we were the country with the leading standard of living in the world&mdash;when we had a low population and we had a lot of resource exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is rather amusing, and rather sad, to see the antics of the mining industry. The great Australian mining industry seems to be led by people who do not have a clue where their self-interests lie. Particularly disappointing is Hugh Morgan, a man who is seen by the mining industry as a loose cannon on the deck and whose utterances tend to terrify it. Occasionally he gets it right; he got it right about the Mabo case in the paper yesterday but, generally, Morgan is horrendously wrong. He is certainly wrong in immigration when he calls for half a million migrants a year. He tries to dress this up as some sort of humanitarian exercise. Do honourable members have any idea what that would do to the Australian economy? It might provide very cheap labour for Mr Morgan's mines, but it certainly would not be in the interests of the economy or of the people of this country. When we listen to the utterances of a lot of the senior people in the mining industry, we find that they all seem to advocate high immigration. They ought to go back and do some thinking about where their own self-interest lies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Refugees are a case that we have to consider; there is no doubt about that. I have been involved in a lot of refugee cases, not quite so much in the last few years, but for a time I probably did more refugee work than just about anyone in this Parliament. I have an abiding sympathy for people who need refuge, but this cannot and should not ever be allowed to extend to economic refugees. Australia cannot solve the world's economic problems and it would be foolish for us to do so, or to give any inkling that we intend to try. Therefore, we have to take a very hard line with refugees and make sure that they are political refugees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, by world standards, does more than its share of taking political refugees; by world standards, it does a good job. We take these refugees because of the compassionate humanitarian nature of Australia&mdash;not because of some perceived obligation to the world, or the world order. We do it of our volition because we think that it is the right thing to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall just after the ascension of the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) to his position as Leader of the Opposition that he made a statement calling for reduced immigration. I think that he had, in fact, read my paper and realised the good commonsense of it. He was immediately denounced by the Prime Minister as a racist. This has been the ploy: whenever anything is suggested about cutting immigration, the immigration industry charges in and calls you a racist. I defended the Leader of the Opposition in the media and said that there was absolutely nothing racist in what he said. Lo and behold, he went on television that night and said, `I am not a racist'&mdash;I am paraphrasing because I cannot remember the words exactly&mdash;`When the economy improves, I will vastly increase immigration'. He then compounds his error by saying, `If I don't, somebody else will make us do it'. So he gave away national sovereignty as well. It is quite clear that the objective of the Opposition is to buckle to this so-called world pressure. If so, those opposite will be able to make some very large savings because they will be able to abolish our military forces&mdash;we will not need them. I think this is something that is obviously hidden in Fightback; it has not been spelled out. It is clearly the intention because the Leader of the Opposition said that world pressure would determine the best interests of Australia. That is a nonsense. Australia must always look to its own interests. Nobody else will do this for us; no world order will look after our interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say very clearly that there is only one ground for immigration: net benefit to Australia. If there is no net benefit, then there should be no immigration. I believe that a total of 50,000 is a target we should aim for. The Minister's target of 80,000 is on the way down, and I certainly commend him for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be remembered that we lose about 30,000 migrants a year. So we are only talking about 20,000 positive out of a total of 50,000. There is always going to be the overwhelmingly compassionate case and the occasional case where somebody has a skill or an expertise that the country needs. Therefore, we need to have some mobility, some fluidity there somewhere, but certainly no more than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker talked about bringing in migrants with special skills. I would have thought that it would have been much better to train the people of Australia, to train Australians for those skills. If we do not do that, we feed animosity into the system, which continues to grow and to gnaw at society, as Australians simply see their position being usurped by foreign expertise that is brought in when the country already has an obligation to train its own people first. I say to those who pursue this argument of immigration for the sake of special skills that they should really look at what they are doing because they are undermining the whole basis of the training of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who impact on immigration were also alluded to in the debate. Quite frankly, I think the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade needs very close scrutiny. Its performance is, in many ways, quite appalling and I blame it rather than the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs for some of the pressures that lead to the decisions we make in immigration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have the distinction of having been censured by this Parliament on an occasion several years ago when I said that we should slow down South East Asian immigration to a level  which Australia can accommodate. I did not think it was particularly racist; I thought it was good commonsense, but it was deemed as racist by the then Prime Minister. He moved a motion which was jubilantly supported by the Opposition and by my own Party, and I was duly censured. I accept that. I was rather annoyed that the toy Parliament in Western Australia then sought to also censure me for the same thing when I considered that it was none of its business. On that occasion, the only support I got was from Asians. I got a lot of support from this source. It was basically two sorts: what I call the Sri Lankan or the old Ceylon Asians, the Asians who did not want to be Asian and their line has tended to be, `We have been brought up with a British culture, English is our language. We think that this is a superior culture and we want to be Australian'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other support I got was basically from the Chinese, whose line was, `Look, this is the greatest country in the world and we really don't want all these migrants messing it up. We don't want them upsetting things. We too think there should be some restraint'. So I think there is some evidence that Australia is subjecting itself far too much to the cringe; that we must adopt these policies otherwise other people will not like us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have an electorate with a lot of migrants in it. In fact, I think it would be one of the top six migrant electorates in the country. I find that my migrants, overwhelmingly, want to be Australian, and they want their kids to be Australian. They came to Australia because they saw it as the land of the future for their kids. I can tell honourable members that the last thing that migrants who came here for a future for their kids want to see is that future being undermined by migrants. So honourable members do not have to fear lowering immigration in respect of the migrant vote because most migrants understand full well the consequences of uncontrolled immigration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems we have in this country is the enormous coverage of the media when, largely through ignorance, it panders to such charlatans as Phil Ruthven, the futurologist, the man who sees Australia with a population of 150 million people&mdash;mostly Asian, he says&mdash;and this population driving the economy of this country. In fact, it will give us a living standard something like that of Bangladesh. It might be what Mr Phil Ruthven wants; he would see himself as up at the top. But they are certainly not the conditions I want for my kids, and I will be opposing that implacably. I think Mr Ruthven talks so much drivel that it is time the press started to look at him critically and determine just exactly what he is saying. It ought to look at his utterances of 10 years ago and ask whether it can honestly say the predictions and forecasts he made then are coming to fruition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said that migration increases per capita output. This is simply one of those statements that are not true. Migration does not produce increased per capita output at all. It increases total output, obviously, but more often than not it works to reduce per capita output. For Australia, productivity must be the name of the game. We are not going to get productivity with a migration problem. It has been conservatively estimated that immigration is costing this country in the region of $9 billion a year. I often think it is rather amusing for us in the Labor Party to talk eloquently and enthusiastically about waterfront reform. Things are getting better on the waterfront. When we get all the waterfront reform we want it will save about $1 billion a year. Big deal! It will be nice to have and we are on the way to getting it, but it pales into insignificance against the cost of immigration&mdash;immigration which we could fix at the stroke of a pen if we had the nerve to do it. Of course, we have not and neither has the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We talk about the categories of migrants that we want in this country. I say again that the only reason for immigration is net benefit to Australia. For this reason, the family concessional program must go. It was based on a fallacy from its inception. While I think one would have to give the dubious credit to Al Grassby for starting the idea and pushing mass immigration, it really was Malcolm Fraser who institutionalised it. It was a Liberal Minister who brought in this family concessional program, the idea being at the time that those opposite could buy votes. Of course, votes cannot be bought, and if we believe that we can manipulate the ethnic vote then we are saying that ethnics are inherently more stupid than Australians&mdash;and I do not believe that. I believe it is a racist concept and it is one that I totally reject. I reject it from experience. The rule of thumb is quite simple: rich migrants vote for those opposite and the poor ones vote for us. That is a generalisation that can be substantiated by a review of the ballot boxes. There are other factors that will affect it of course but, as a generalisation, that tends to be true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a category of migration which I think does need some consideration: working holiday visas. These visas are negotiated with various countries, and I think there are about six at the moment. We have reciprocal rights for people to come to Australia to work in the country for no more than three months at any one job to get valuable experience. My experience has been, representing a large electorate, parts of which are certainly isolated, that these young holiday visa workers go to these remote areas and perform a very good service. These are young people who are prepared to make a commitment to Australia. Rather than seeing them as queue jumpers, I would much prefer to see an expansion of the working holiday visa program and the total abandonment of the family concessional program which offers Australia nothing. As the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) said, we have to get some unity, some Australianisation into the community, and I think these young people who come out with an obvious commitment to Australia are the sorts of people that, if we are going to have migrants, would make by far and away the best sort of migrants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other areas that have to be considered here include the fact that immigration is impacting not only on our unemployment figures but also on the cost of running the country. In the present climate these immigrants impact almost always directly on the dole. This country had a textile, clothing and footwear industry, and an automotive industry. Then along came the myth of the level playing field&mdash;a myth subscribed to by both political parties. We have seen a massive scaling down of these industries but we are still bringing in the same migrants that used to feed them. Of course there is nowhere else for them to go but straight onto the dole. This is such palpable nonsense that it ought to be stopped forthwith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, however, not as simple as that. In my own electorate there is the township of Leinster. Leinster today would be about 80 per cent New Zealander. The reason for this is that when jobs become available in this mining town they are not advertised. The New Zealanders simply get their cousins from New Zealand. With communications and rapid travel, they can be there within a week. This denies those jobs to Australians and it impacts directly on the dole. It means that Australians who could be working and productive for this country simply are not earning the money. That is not all, however, because with these New Zealand migrants a lot of money is repatriated. While it is not directly germane to this Bill, as a government and as a country, we must hopefully get some consensus and look at the CER agreement because that agreement clearly is working to Australia's detriment and we are massively the net losers in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is absolute nonsense to say that, in the present economic climate, we can allow the free entry of New Zealanders. I might add that some of the strongest representations I have had in this regard come from New Zealanders who have come to Australia, made a commitment to this country, pay their taxes in this country and are, in my view, extremely good citizens. They are the people who have come to me in the biggest numbers and said that it is about time we put the brakes on what they themselves see as a crazy situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Migration has served this country well in the past. It is, however, as I said earlier, an idea whose time has passed.

I hope he does not get nasty with me when I suggest that in his reference to Fightback he is totally off the beam. There is no hidden agenda for the coalition, once we win the next election, to abolish the defence forces of this country. As I have said, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is totally wrong and off the beam in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do agree with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie when he makes the comment that the prime purpose of migration is to benefit Australia. I have no hesitation in agreeing totally with that. As far as I am concerned, if we leave aside the humanitarian questions of refugees, that is really the only reason for having a migration program. I make no apology for that. I am Australian and proud of it. All of the activities of this Government and any government should be directed to the benefit of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the main purpose of this Bill is to allow the Minister to determine the maximum number of visas or specified classes that may be granted in a program financial year or, as the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) put it in the second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Effective management of the migration program is essential in ensuring that planned program outcomes are not exceeded.</PARA>
<PARA>The Act currently contains a suspension power in section 28 which allows the Minister to suspend the processing of applications for visas in a specified class. That suspension power does not apply to applicants who may be the spouse, child or aged parent of an Australian citizen; that is quite right and quite appropriate. The suspension power in section 28 has never been exercised. Nonetheless, it does remain a very potent tool, albeit rather blunt in its application. But, if applied, it would suspend all processing of applications, although not necessarily establishing a numerical limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government says that the amendments proposed will overcome these problems through supplementing the visa suspension powers. It is proposed to allow the application of numerical ceilings or caps for a specific visa class and to allow the processing of applications up to the point of grant. Under this Bill the Minister will have the power to decide on the number of visas in a specific category in a given year. At the same time there is no limit on the number of determinations that the Minister may make each year in deciding the maximum number of visas in each class. Potentially, once the cap has been reached in a certain class, it can be raised again through a new determination to increase allowable numbers. The number of classes under which visas are issued could also be broadened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also gives the Minister the power to impose upper limits on the number of visas that can be granted at overseas posts. This provision takes into account the processing abilities and the workloads of different overseas posts. The capping provisions in the Bill will not apply to certain preferential visa classes. Therefore, as the Minister told the House on 19 August in the second reading speech, the Bill will allow the Minister to target the grant of visas in accordance with the priorities of the migration program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, I have no argument with having provisions to ensure that the priorities of the migration program are met. The concern that I have is what the fundamental objectives of the migration program should be. We in the coalition are very much committed to the concept of multiculturalism. There is no argument about the contribution that people of various backgrounds and cultures have made to Australia, which is all the richer for that experience. We have benefited enormously from the cultural diversity of people who have come here from all over the world. We have endorsed programs to assist people to settle successfully in Australia, and the definition spelt out in the national agenda for a multicultural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should recognise the difference between multicultural and multiculturalism. I see a vast difference between the application of a multicultural society and what could be described as professional multiculturalism. A multicultural outlook is one that holds respect for different cultures and community outlooks which are rooted in different traditions, religions and ethnic heritage. I suppose that is what I would call soft multiculturalism. But compare that with what one could term hard multiculturalism which in my book stands for the promotion, through administrative and educational intervention, of specific community group interests at the expense of others. Professional multiculturalism tends to establish ghettos and divisiveness that this country does not need and cannot afford. It can mean the promotion and protection of values at variance with broadly accepted attitudes of liberalism and plurality that Australia has thrived and developed upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say quite specifically&mdash;I have said this before in this place&mdash;that we do not need to import hatreds or prejudices. We do not want vendettas from other societies; they should be left behind. What we need in the people who come here is that they have the desire, the wish and the will to become Australians. Quite frankly, there is nothing wrong with being Australian. I am passionately proud of being Australian and passionately proud of Australia. I value cultural diversity. But, if people want to come to Australia, they should accept the proposition that they come here to become Australians, not to become foreigners living in Australia but not part of our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose I will be accused of racism, as I have been before. But I believe that it is important that people who come to Australia, to live in Australia and be Australians, should speak English; that is the language of this country. I believe we should be doing more as a society to help newcomers to learn it. I know that a lot has been done over decades. In fact my wife at one stage was a teacher of English as a foreign language to migrants. But we need to do much more because surely the cornerstone of acceptance and success in any society is being able to communicate in the language of that society. We should maintain cultural background by all means; I have no quarrel with that. But we need to accept and realise that Australia is a separate country and that we do not want to import, generate and foster the divisions that exist in so many other parts of the world. There is nothing wrong with wanting to have a peaceful, harmonious country in which people live in peace together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill offers the Minister the possibility of imposing quota systems at his discretion to favour certain visa categories, especially at overseas posts. I see in that a prospect and a danger of various interest groups lobbying for higher or lower ceiling numbers at various overseas posts, and this cannot be overlooked. By and large I would say that in the last decade throughout government in Australia, particularly in the Federal sphere, there has been an ongoing move to reduce and remove ministerial discretion. Quite frankly, I have no quibble with that. This move has reduced the potential for political interference, and I believe that is a good thing; I applaud that. I understand the need for the legislation&mdash;I certainly do&mdash;but I make the point that it does introduce some potential for that political interference that we are striving to remove. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose this could be the kiss of death for the Minister because, like the member for Kalgoorlie, I certainly praise the present Minister. I think he has done the job very well indeed. He is not listening to me at present, but I am sure I will catch his attention sooner or later and he will hear the nice words I am saying about him. No, he continues not to pay attention, so perhaps I will change my opinion of him, but I do not think I will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no fear with this Minister, nor would I have any doubts or worries about the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), who is sitting at the table and who, after the coalition wins the next election, will in all probability be the Minister for immigration. But I say to the present Minister and to all of those here: what if the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) was the Minister for immigration? Can honourable members imagine that one-man rabid faction as Minister for immigration with this power and this discretion in his hands? I suppose he will come in here in a moment, frothing at the mouth, and start yelling at me. That has happened before, and I am sure it will happen again. But the point that I am making is that that ministerial discretion is something that could be misused. As I have said, I have complete faith in the present Minister and in the gentleman who I believe will be the next Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, I am concerned about the multicultural concept and I am not happy&mdash;in fact I am far from happy&mdash;with the way that Labor has managed to politicise the multicultural concept.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there is no doubt that we do have some prejudice, I believe that basically we are a tolerant society. To some extent we may err too much on the side of saying, `She'll be right mate; she's okay; let's not worry about it'. I say again that I think the politicisation of the multicultural concept by the present Government has not served Australia well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government seems to have endeavoured to secure sectional interests in marginal seats, to promote sectional interests for the sake of votes under the guise of multiculturalism. As I said before, the coalition welcomes the idea of a multicultural Australia but condemns the Government's repeated attempts to politicise the concept. Fightback endorses our approach to multiculturalism. It has specific commitments to settlement programs, to welcome and assist new arrivals, and funding has been specifically quarantined from expenditure reductions within Fightback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill gives the Minister the power to set ceilings on visa categories to meet the priorities of the national migration program. It is something which should be carefully and objectively utilised, and must not be used to help realise political goals rather than national goals. The coalition will be aiming at lower immigration targets. Our critics will undoubtedly accuse us of being against multiculturalism on that ground. Far from it. Our immigration program will be realistic, objective and help make Australia a better country for those already here, as well as future arrivals.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) says, we are in a recession. He can quibble on the words but we are in a recession and the pain goes on. The current migrant intake is unsustainable in employment terms. It is not helping those migrants who are already here and those who are about to arrive in the expectation, sadly long out of date, that this is a country of great opportunity. I believe that it will be a country of great opportunity once again but at present that is not the case. It was once, but Labor has wrecked it and we will have to rebuild it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was an interesting article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, part of a series of articles which have brutally exposed the damage Labor has done to this country. The Government makes a lot of noise about the growth in employment in Australia over the past decade, claiming that employment has grown by 15.2 per cent between 1981 and 1988, according to the OECD. I might say that just in relation to the north coast of New South Wales in which my electorate of Cowper is situated the growth in employment in the six years to the end of 1990 was something in excess of 32 per cent&mdash;a very significant increase in employment which has been well above the Australian average. It is a factor which is not readily recognised by many people in the community, who seem to concentrate always on the very high unemployment figures, which comes by a lot of migration from the rest of Australia&mdash;not from outside Australia. It is internal migration because of our beautiful climate and the fact that if people have to be unemployed they would far prefer to be unemployed in Port Macquarie, Nambucca Heads or Coffs Harbour than in Geelong, Broken Hill or some place like that. The article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employment expanded by 15.2 per cent between 1981 and 1988, according to the OECD . . . </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very impressive, until you look more closely at the figures, as the OECD and the Federal Government's Economic Planning Advisory Council . . . have done. One reason for the rapid growth was that Australia's population increased by 13.4 per cent during the period&mdash;again the highest figure in the OECD with the exception of Iceland. This was due mainly to immigration. More migrants mean a higher demand for goods and services and ultimately labour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taking into account the rise in population, jobs growth was not 15 per cent but 1.6 per cent&mdash;a barely average performance in the OECD and well below the 7.4 per cent achieved in the US and the 4.4 per cent in Canada.</PARA>
<PARA>This highlights the need for a controlled and sensible approach to migration&mdash;not a political multicultural one. Also, we must take into account the prospects that exist for those arriving here. The ceilings on visa categories which the Minister can determine under this Bill apply to independent and concessional applicants. Preferential categories will not be affected. A research paper published by the Parliamentary Library Research Service in March this year entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Migration Selection During the Recession</EMPHASIS> stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The points tested selection system which applies to independent and concessional applicants . . . takes no account of demand within the Australian labour market.</PARA>
<PARA>The article concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major factor determining who migrates in current circumstances is `push' pressures in the source countries, not the state of the Australian labour market.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a concept to which we should pay a great deal of attention. This brings me to my earlier concerns about the politicisation of the migration program for which the potential does exist. The same research paper noted concerns that in 1989-90, Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs found it difficult to fill its concessional program partly because the skill level of applicants was lower than expected. It noted that Department management had been reluctant to alter the pass mark for concessional applicants because of concerns about the skill implications. That was at the time the Hawke Government shafted top management in the Department. There was a change of attitude in the Department in response to concerns from some ethnic interests and the selection system was changed for 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therein lies the danger of this Bill in the hands of a government that has demonstrated its ability and willingness to politicise the migration program. Migration selection must be for the national good and the benefit of those coming here. It cannot be for the political good of the Australian Labor Party. Every day we are confronted with the way the whole activity of this Government is perverted for the good of one man and one job&mdash;the job of Prime Minister for Paul Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to an example in November 1991 where, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics labour force estimates, 31.3 per cent of arrivals since January 1990 were unemployed. A total of 12.6 per cent of those migrants from English speaking backgrounds were unemployed compared with 42.5 per cent of those from non-English speaking backgrounds. This emphasises the point I made earlier, that if we are to have migrants coming to this country, whatever the level of intake, we have to provide the backup and the provision of English language services so that they can be assisted through English knowledge in obtaining employment. I quote further from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Migration Selection During the Recession</EMPHASIS> research paper:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the rationale for continuing with a non-targeted skilled migration program is flawed. The expectation that general skilling of the work force will help with economic recovery is questioned. It is more likely that economic recovery will have to occur before conditions in the skilled labour markets improve. In the meantime skilled migration should be curtailed.</PARA>
<PARA>I say in conclusion that the coalition is proud of its support for a multicultural Australia. I make no apology for attacking multicultural politics and multicultural politicians. Our immigration program will serve the national interest, the good of all Australians, irrespective of their background&mdash;not those chosen to curry favour with the Labor Government as has been the sad history of this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;We are discussing tonight Migration Laws Amendment Bill 1992, which might come as a bit of a shock to people who are listening to the broadcast&mdash;the one or two who happen to be tuned in. The shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), addressed the legislation, the proposal, and the concept behind it. I thank him for his comments. However, there are a couple of points that I should correct him on in passing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Nehl" NAMEID="AE4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AE4">Mr Nehl</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Gently.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5H4">Mr HAND</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Gently, as always. He made the point that the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) had suggested that there was no difference between the Government and the Opposition and that we were playing catch-up politics. He then went on to outline a range of ways in which we did, in fact, differ quite substantially. I think that brief explanation confirms the point that I made, so I will leave it at that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comments of the honourable member for Dundas regarding matters outside the area of this proposal, as always, will be taken on board and considered by me. This is an understanding which we have developed over some time. The fact that the Opposition and the Government sometimes agree does not necessarily mean that I have sold out or the Opposition has sold out. Unfortunately, some people are only too quick to come to that conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The numbers have been lowered as a result of very extensive consultations by me and by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, taking into account the economic situation that exists in the country today. The lowering of the program over the last few years from 140,000 to 80,000 is the result of very extensive consultations. In earlier times in this place I was probably known as a very high migration person, but once one gets into this portfolio and talks to people at the grassroots level, to business people and to State and local governments, and listens to what members of parliament on both sides say, one is then armed with a lot of information which, together with the statistical data that the Department collates in the course of a year, all goes towards helping one to make a decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make no apology to anyone for the downward thrust in the numbers. It is the result of a legitimate range of decisions that the Government has come to. Those people who are critical should join me at some of the community meetings where I have been confronted by some of the issues that have been raised tonight, such as access to English programs and the unemployment levels that exist within certain groups in the community. It is those things, when one comes eyeball to eyeball with a constituent group that one happens to be talking too about its particular situation, that help one to make decisions such as these. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a question of the Opposition leading, as one person is reported to have said; it is a question of well and truly documenting the discussions we have had and coming up with the figure of 80,000. Incidentally, that figure is not what the Opposition would introduce; its figure would be substantially lower. That is a policy which those opposite will have to live with, and no doubt they will. But it should be pointed out that when we had a policy of 110,000 the Opposition promoted a figure of around 70,000 net. That is the figure that we have ended up with&mdash;80,000 gross and 70,000 net. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Ruddock" NAMEID="0J4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr Ruddock</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is 50,000 to 70,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5H4">Mr HAND</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. We will probably end up with less than 70,000 net. So let us be careful about the claims we make. All I am saying to the House is that I have no difficulty&mdash;in case there are any doubters on either side of the chamber&mdash;in standing up anywhere and defending my decision to cut the program to 80,000, because I think it is justified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have just returned from overseas, where I visited a range of countries. I had no difficulty at all in explaining the reasons why we had cut the program. I said I expected that the program would hover around that number in the future until we were able as a nation to provide work opportunities for all of those who have come here in the post-war years and until we were able to give people coming to this country the opportunity to go to work and provide for their children in the way in which they wanted to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion that we have made decisions aimed at pandering to some mystical migrant group is most untrue. I can only speak for myself, but I can assure the House that I have not in any way buckled under any pressure from any lobby group. I have listened and I have consulted, but no one group has been given any better access to the process over and above any others while I have been in this job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A range of other speakers addressed this legislation. They were a bit wide of the mark, I might add. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), for argument's sake, said that he was very interested in my response to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations. He is a member of that Committee, as is the shadow Minister and one or two others in the place who are here tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have outlined my attitude to the issue referred to by the right honourable member for New England, which was the most controversial of the recommendations in the report. However, like always, the Government is now in the process of considering that report. There is a laid-down process in which we respond to reports of that nature and, in keeping with the traditions of this place, we will stick very carefully to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not run away from comments attributed to me on the question of the Chinese students, the pre-Tiananmen Square group, which I have made in this place before. The matter of how the Government will respond to the report will be a matter for the Government. When that decision is taken, I will relay that view to the House. I remind some journalists who have made a couple of comments about my not making any remarks with regard to that Committee report that I have been out of the country for the last three weeks. However, if they cared to press a button on their computer, they would have been able to call up my previous comments in this place, where my position was put fairly clearly. A couple of Sydney-based journalists seem to have difficulty in doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right honourable member for New England also talked about the role of overseas posts and people working in those posts. During my visit overseas, we had a meeting in Ireland of the immigration officers from all of the posts in Europe and North Africa. We went through all of the changes that have been made in recent times. I can assure the right honourable member that they are all full bottle. He should not have too many problems with his constituents who come from that part of the globe. There will be similar discussions with the senior migration officers in the various posts in other regions around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The officers are charged with a very difficult task and, having met quite a lot of them&mdash;perhaps most of them before they left to go overseas&mdash;I know that theirs is a very difficult job. They do not get a lot of thanks. I put it on the record that their conditions are normally very trying in terms of finding accommodation for themselves and their families and finding schooling for their children. In some posts there are a number of problems in terms of the client groups that they sometimes have to deal with. It is not all laughter and good times when working in an overseas post in immigration; there are certain problems and hardships that the officers have to endure, and I have nothing but admiration for the work that they do. I can assure the right honourable member for New England that they are well briefed on recent changes. I expect that, if he has to deal with the overseas posts, he will get 100 per cent service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right honourable member ranged into an area about refugees. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) made mention of lawyers. It is well known, and he is quite correct, that the language which I sometimes use to describe lawyers is not able to be used in here, and I will not test the friendship with the Chair&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AE4">Mr Nehl</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not only lawyers.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5H4">Mr HAND</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not only lawyers; that is true. The honourable member for Cowper ran into me in a lift the other night, unfortunately, and that has also been covered in the media. But we will not repeat that tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right honourable member for New England spoke of the need for the Department to be aware of situations when we return people so that their lives are not placed at risk. I do not know of any government&mdash;and you, Mr Deputy Chairman, as a former Minister, I am sure would agree&mdash;representing either side of the chamber which would have deliberately sent someone home to his or her country and placed that person in danger or put his or her life at risk. I am not aware of that. I certainly will not be doing that. If that is an assurance that the right honourable member for New England wants, I give it to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point that was made related to the question of decisions being made by the Government in some sort of attempt to win popularity. I have not set out to do that. Again I speak only for myself, but the Government has made a number of changes in terms of how immigration is being run. It has introduced user pays. There has been some criticism of that, but I make no apology to anybody for the changes we have made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that a well-heeled business migrant ought to be able to make some contribution to the cost of himself and family learning English. I would have thought that was a reasonable proposition that would be supported by most people in this chamber, and certainly by most people in the community. It does two things. It makes those who can afford it pay most, and it also creates a vacancy for someone at the lower end of the economic scale to go into. Furthermore, if there is a need to bring some specialist into the country who has a skill that is not available here, why should the employer not meet the costs of educating that person?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of user pays in the learning of English, again I think it is only fair that some very small contribution should be made when one considers the overall cost of 510 guaranteed hours that each person will now get for the first time. Some small cost at a few cents per lesson is not unreasonable, given that other people who wish to further their education&mdash;people who are being retrenched or, say,  railway workers who are changing jobs&mdash;have to go to TAFE and make a small contribution towards the cost. So we have not ignored areas that traditionally have been considered sacred and unable to be touched. We have increased the fees for visas in line with the costs involved in processing people, and again in a very reasonable way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow Minister also touched on the matter of refugees and said he would leave his arguments to another day. I think it probably preferable that most of the comments made by honourable members in this debate about refugees be left until then. However, on my recent visit overseas, I had the opportunity of going to Hungary, Austria and Germany to look at people who were fleeing the troubles of the former Yugoslavia. I also went to Kenya, and to the border of Ethiopia and Somalia and talked to people in a camp there. It was a dreadful experience. So my commitment in this program in terms of refugees has always been to maintain and protect what I think is the most important part of the program&mdash;that is, the offshore refugee component of the migration program. I believe there can be no other component as important as that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take the point that the right honourable member for New England made in regard to the question of people lobbying in Australia and seeking refugee status. I think it is a legitimate fear for anybody to have. Although there have been a few bumpy periods, I believe that with the foreshadowed refinements referred to by the shadow Minister that will be introduced later this year, we have without a doubt the best situation in terms of controlling that area of any country in the world. People in this country scoff at that, but it happens to be true. Go to Germany, go to Hungary, go to Kenya, go to Turkey, go to Iran&mdash;where there are 2 1/2 million Afghanis&mdash;and look at the processes that they have. They do not have an immigration program, and in most cases they do not have a refugee processing arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a problem. The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) is here and he knows this, because I have had lengthy discussions with him on the cost of all this. We have spent a long time trying to grapple with this situation, which no-one in this Parliament, clever as we all are, was able to predict. We have a problem and we have grappled with it. There will be more about that at a later date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of lawyers was mentioned. There is a photograph that I take with me all around the world, wherever I go. I mention it today because I might not get another chance before something tragic happens. On the photo it says: `Suicide is just two steps away. You might as well jump'. The reason I raise that today is that the sign was on the door of the lawyers' interview room in Port Hedland, until it was discovered and photographed and then removed. Honourable members would have seen on television the people on the roof. They would be aware that other people have been reported in the press today talking about suicide. They would have heard the sort of half clever remarks made by people. I was supported by the shadow Minister on this matter. Here we are trying to stop people doing something stupid and anyone would think we were the two guilty ones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That sort of irresponsibility is one of the reasons why I am just a bit cheesed off with some of the legal profession. It is not a question that some of them are also rip-off merchants and that we have had to try to contain them in the migration agents area. This topic was covered on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> tonight, and the legal profession says, `We can't be touched. Everybody else should be disciplined and controlled, but not us', said the man in the blue shirt. Well, bad luck for him. They are going to be. Everybody in this chamber knows who the main offenders are&mdash;some lawyers. So they have no special rate with me at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention the existence of that photograph today because I constantly live in fear, as do most of the departmental officers, that there are some people who, for other reasons and other agendas, are trying to wind up some of these people that we are desperately trying to process. We have had to put up with people saying, `Well, let's spin this out, because there is no work back in Melbourne. Let's see how long this can last', and threatening the Federal Court all the time. I repeat that it is a disgrace that a lawyer should take 17 months to lodge an application when the client concerned is in custody. But every time I rang and asked, `Why can't you do it?', I got threatened with some half smart, half clever remark about going to the Federal Court. That is the sort of problem we have been grappling with, and I think we are winning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I resent the constant barrage of misrepresentation in the media by people with other agendas, knowing full well that in most cases neither the departmental officers nor I can defend ourselves because the matter is either before the court or the review committee. There will be a day of judgment when all this comes out, and I hope it does. It is about time the Australian community knew what some people are trying to do, and that is to deliberately set about to undermine the migration program and the refugee processing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that I have got that off my chest, I wish to refer to some other matters about multiculturalism. I am proud to be an Australian and I am proud to be part of a multicultural society. I say to my friend the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) that people throughout Europe want to know about multiculturalism because in this country it is working. I do not agree with my good friend the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) on everything and this is one area where we fall out. He is wrong in his view and is wrong to knock multiculturalism. It is a great thing and we should be proud of it. When people from communities currently in dispute in what was called Yugoslavia&mdash;Serbs, Croatians, Bosnians, Macedonians&mdash;can march one behind the other in a recent procession in a city like Geelong, and indeed organise that procession, that is something we should be proud of in this country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>The amendments to clauses 5A and 6A arise as a result of the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), raising a question about a common term being used. I think the amendments are self-explanatory. They replace the word `child' with the term `dependent child'. It is a tidying up exercise, and I thank the shadow Minister for his suggestion that we in fact adopt this approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to add one other point in regard to this Bill.

We have to remember in this country that 204 years ago none of us new arrivals were here. We were all new arrivals, bar the Aborigines. The whole lot of us had just dropped in, invaded the land, taken it over. So three or four generations ago, where were we? I was back at Carrickmacross, a beautiful part of Ireland. That is where my family came from. That was four generations ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Multiculturalism is something we should not be frightened by. Multiculturalism is a wonderful thing, and we should be very proud of it in this country. I think multiculturalism means different things to different people, and I think that is important. If honourable members know the history of Geelong, and the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) would remember the 1950s and 1960s in Geelong, it was a wonderful sight to see those people working together to make sure things did not overflow from Yugoslavia. They were proud of it. And that is something we have over everybody else. Sure, we have a bit of a hiccup or a bit of a blip every now and again. When I go overseas that is all people want to talk about&mdash;`How do you get them all to live together?  How do they work together?  How do they cooperate?'. That is something we have going for us here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) is here. He has a different view about this. I know the honourable member for Kalgoorlie well. I have visited his electorate and campaigned with him, and I know a lot of people in his electorate. I know that he helps different nationalities there and that he encourages them to participate in the work force. He has a bit of a thing about the term `multiculturalism', but in practice he believes in it because he practises it. He goes on with a lot of other technical jargon from time to time that old Peter Walsh gives him, those speaker's notes, but that is okay&mdash;I accept that. Having people with different points of view in the Parliament and in our Party makes our Party great. The Labor Party has different points of view, but we come together as one, united, and we support the Party policy. Party policy is multiculturalism, and I rest my case. I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Student Assistance Amendment Bill 1992 amends the Austudy and Abstudy schemes to introduce what the Government refers to as a financial supplement to both schemes. This supplement in fact is a loans scheme and allows students to trade in some or all of their Austudy or Abstudy grants for a loan of twice the size up to a limit of $4,000. The scheme will operate from 1 January 1993. The Bill also legislates for the automatic indexation of Austudy and Abstudy grants in line with inflation.

<PARA>to the point where the need for change has been recognised. The Opposition has sought consistently and constructively to create a climate where worthwhile reform of student financial assistance can take place, despite the unrelievedly partisan attitude which the Government has adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this year's Budget $1.3 billion has been allocated to student financial assistance through Austudy and a further $194m to assistance through Abstudy. The cost of Austudy and Abstudy exceeds the cost of the total Commonwealth program of grants to government schools and is equivalent to 30 per cent of the total Commonwealth funding for higher education. Student financial assistance can thus be seen as a very significant Commonwealth financial commitment. In fact, it constitutes some 19 per cent of total Commonwealth expenditure related to education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sheer scale of the student financial assistance program requires that it be subject to the closest scrutiny. Funds allocated to the program are not available for other educational purposes, and funds which are poorly targeted within the program are not available to help the students in greatest need. It is a matter of very high priority for this program, as it is indeed for all Commonwealth programs, that the efficiency and effectiveness of the program be rigorously assessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training&mdash;of which the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), who will be speaking in this debate, is Deputy Chairman&mdash;brought down its report on student financial assistance in March 1991, the Committee expressed its great concern at that time that Austudy and Abstudy had never been properly evaluated. The report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee finds it disturbing that billions of dollars have been spent on programs for which the success or otherwise has never been assessed.</PARA>
<PARA>It drew attention to the fact that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEET's current performance indicators emphasise processing efficiency rather than program effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>The effectiveness of the program was difficult to evaluate because, as the Committee noted, its objectives were unclear. It was apparent that there were many students receiving Austudy who plainly were not in great financial need, while there were many other students in obvious financial need who were ineligible for aid under the rules of the program. Many of these were students in rural areas who were excluded from assistance by the operation of the asset test. In addition, it was evident from reports of the Auditor-General that substantial losses were occurring as a result of inadequate accounting practices, fraud and overpayments. DEET compliance surveys had found that between 12 per cent and 27 per cent of students were being overpaid. At the higher rate, overpayments would have totalled about $130m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition parties accepted then and accept today that a basic objective of student financial assistance should be that no student with the capacity and the will to continue his or her education should be prevented from doing so on financial grounds alone. This was an important principle, not merely on grounds of securing equality of educational opportunity but also in the public interest. All Australians lose if talented young people are prevented from realising their full potential simply because they cannot afford the direct costs and the loss of income which continuing with their education might entail. It was our view that, if this were the guiding objective for student financial assistance programs, the existing arrangements for those programs would require very significant modification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Fightback program announced by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in November last year, the Liberal and National parties made clear their view that very obvious steps could and should have been taken to better target student financial assistance, to end the rorting of the system and to reduce overpayments. A number of measures were announced by the Opposition in Fightback to achieve these objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the worst of the rorts occurred when well-to-do families arranged their financial affairs so as to reduce their taxable income, thus bringing them within the limits of the Austudy income test. In Fightback we undertook to replace the definition of income as taxable income with the concept of total remuneration, which would take account of fringe benefits and other income. Another rort occurred when parents signed a statutory declaration that they would no longer support their child, in order to make their child eligible for Austudy at the higher independent rate. This occurred, as did other rorts, under the exceptional circumstances provision of the Austudy regulations. This rort would be removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A significant efficiency and targeting problem was the cost of administering large numbers of small payments, which could not by any stretch of the imagination constitute the difference between a decision to pursue or not to pursue an education. We undertook to eliminate payments of less than $30 a week as being inconsistent with the objective of the Austudy scheme. In relation to overpayments and fraud, we undertook to implement much tighter benefit control procedures, with the objective of saving approximately $80m. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Our objective in announcing these measures was not simply to demonstrate that a responsible government could readily save very large and very significant sums on the Austudy budget without reducing assistance to those who needed it most; we also believed it was necessary to effect such savings in order to provide improved assistance to those in real need. This was very much a part of the philosophy underpinning Fightback, a philosophy which has quite deliberately targeted increased assistance to those in the community in genuine need who have suffered under Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key decisions in this regard that we announced at the time was the decision to increase Austudy payments by 6 per cent for all eligible students. This increase would be well in excess of any price effects flowing from the tax reform program announced in Fightback and would constitute a real increase in the level of financial assistance to eligible students. In addition to that, we announced a range of other measures to improve financial assistance to students in obvious financial need, particularly those suffering from the drastic collapse in rural incomes who faced the prospect of being withdrawn from or having to withdraw from their education without additional financial assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A key measure to assist such students, in our view, is a properly constructed hardship provision. Such a provision would recognise that many rural families are in a position of negative income and that any notional asset value attached to their properties would be totally misleading as an indicator of that property's income-earning potential. Accordingly, we announced that a coalition government would introduce a provision under which the asset test would be set to one side for families in extreme economic circumstances, and only the income test would apply. If families qualified under the income test in such circumstances, that would be sufficient for students in the family to receive Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, we were particularly conscious of the serious situation which had developed for many isolated families, with the decline in the real value of the boarding allowance for secondary students and the additional effect of the Government's introduction of an asset test on this scheme. In our view, the Government's policy had seriously compromised the opportunity for young people in isolated circumstances to access education, so we undertook to restore the real value of the boarding allowance to $2,500 and to abolish the asset test on the assistance for the isolated children scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Beyond these measures, a range of other decisions announced at the time greatly enhanced the opportunity for students who worked part time to earn additional income and to save on essential expenses. These measures included raising the tax free threshold from $5,400 to $7,000; the abolition of petrol excise, which would save many students up to $11 every time they filled their tanks; and the abolition of a wholesale sales tax on items such as computers, electrical equipment and stationery, to name just a few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth making the point that students whose incomes fall below the new tax threshold under Fightback's tax reform program, with the effect that the reductions in personal income tax will not fully compensate them for the price effect of the tax reform program, will be eligible for a tax credit, which will provide them with a direct monetary compensation at a rate greater than the expected price effect. These benefits would be in addition to the important benefits flowing to students from the improved financial arrangements for universities and schools and the increased availability of scholarships, including scholarships for students in need, that these arrangements would make possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, we presented a very wide ranging program to improve access to education and to lift the quality and responsiveness of the education available to them. Beyond measures such as these, the Fightback program is a comprehensive strategy to create jobs&mdash;some two million jobs over the remainder of this decade. In many ways, that is the single most important thing that can be done to assist students. The Fightback program provides students with the prospect of greatly expanded opportunities for part time work if they want it while at university, with a much greater certainty of employment after graduation. The consequence of the direct financial decisions we announced in Fightback would be of direct and evident value to students, especially students in real financial need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many aspects of the administration of Austudy and Abstudy which can be considered and dealt with only as part of a general review of the schemes. It remains a commitment of the coalition to fully review student financial assistance when in government to ensure that it is fair to all. I mention these various decisions because they demonstrate unmistakably how the coalition has led the public debate on Austudy reform and provided a context for a number of changes which the Government has since announced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the face of mounting criticism of the student financial assistance arrangements, the Department commissioned a consultant, Professor Bruce Chapman of the Centre for Economic Policy Research at the Australian National University, to report on the reform of Austudy. Dr Chapman consulted widely in the preparation of his report and presented his final options paper in April this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that Dr Chapman's work was not made any easier by an uncalled for intervention by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) after the publication of the first draft report. Dr Chapman's report provided documented confirmation of the major criticisms and concerns which the Opposition had expressed about the Austudy scheme. Dr Chapman concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is little doubt that the current arrangements sometimes target ineffectually, basically because there is relatively little sensitivity shown to the varied financial needs and circumstances of the potential clientele. The essential challenge for reform is to improve the targeting so as to ensure that the right amount of assistance is delivered to those who most need it.</PARA>
<PARA>Despite the Government's highly partisan attack on the coalition's proposals in the Fightback package for reform, Dr Chapman's report effectively confirmed the validity of those proposals. The report, for example, recognised that the manipulation of taxable income was a rort which allowed many students to receive support even though they had little need of it. Dr Chapman recommended that the Department and the Tax Office should investigate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . whether or not there are administratively feasible ways to redefine the taxable income base for student income support purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>The report also recommended an increase in the minimum allowance payable to $20 per week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the important achievements of Dr Chapman's report was to provide a cool and balanced assessment of the rationale for providing student financial assistance to both secondary and tertiary students. This was not easy to do in such an area of policy where people feel very strongly, but Dr Chapman is to be congratulated on the professional and sympathetic approach which his report demonstrates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Chapman sought to lay in his report a sound basis of principle for policy in this difficult area, and his analysis has very usefully contributed to this goal. Dr Chapman pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . governments need to be concerned with post-compulsory education because the education process delivers major benefits to society. The challenge is to understand the nature of these benefits, why government intervention might be needed to maximise them, and what forms this intervention should take to ensure maximum effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In policy terms, the key question is ultimately whether taxpayers or individuals should pay the costs, and in what proportions.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Chapman pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The benefits of education take two basic forms: those which flow to society as a consequence of having a more educated population, and those which accrue directly and only to educated individuals. Respectively these benefits are known as spillover and private. Together they should be considered to be the social or (total) benefits of education.</PARA>
<PARA>The private benefits are both monetary and non-monetary. In the late 1980s the lifetime earnings advantage of completing tertiary education, as against completing school only, was estimated at about $300,000. The non-pecuniary benefits include a broadening of outlook, a training of the mind, a flexibility and an adaptability which is the product of higher education&mdash;or should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The spillover benefits include a much more informed public debate, less crime, more tolerance; the community benefits of research; higher tax revenue resulting from higher productivity and wages and enhanced prospects for competitiveness and economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existence of both private and spillover benefits means that it is equitable that there be both private contributions to the cost of higher education as well as taxpayer contributions. Student financial assistance is necessary to secure the participation in higher education of students who might otherwise not be able to participate for financial reasons, with the consequence that we would all be deprived of the spillover benefits which result from their education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once having undertaken higher education, of course, there are private benefits which are derived by students themselves in the form of improved monetary and non-monetary rewards. Students who are poor usually become graduates who are not poor, and this should be taken into account in an equitable system of student financial assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should point out that to my knowledge the Government has remained silent on these principles stated so clearly in the Chapman report. It has not accepted nor rejected it, though in the Bill before the House this evening it is seeking to implement in part one of the major recommendations flowing from this report&mdash;the addition of a loan component to student financial assistance. Under this measure students will be offered the opportunity to commit additional resources of their own to the pursuit of their education, presumably in recognition of the fact that there are private benefits which will flow to them from their education. And while they are presently financially without resources or without adequate resources, in future they will have the income and the other benefits which make this short term investment on their own account worthwhile. The loans need to be repaid only when income in fact reaches a minimum level. There is no possibility of default under the arrangements set out in Dr Chapman's report and substantially adopted by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it quite clear that the coalition parties do not oppose a measure of this kind. Its great advantage is that it provides access to additional financial assistance which is at the option of the student. It thus allows much more accurate and non-bureaucratic targeting to help students in financial need. It is justified in principle because students seeking it will derive substantial private benefits from the use of these funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's failure to acknowledge in any coherent way the arguments justifying this arrangement is not unexpected. The Government's whole approach to the financing of higher education is incoherent. If the Government were to accept Dr Chapman's argument in the terms in which he stated it, it would have to reconsider its nonsensical decision to prevent students investing in their own education&mdash;a right it gives to overseas students&mdash;by allowing Australian students to gain additional places at universities for fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the arrangements to be established by this Bill, the Government is prepared to allow students to invest further private resources once they are admitted, but it is not prepared to allow them to invest in the tertiary place itself&mdash;even though the universities have indicated that they would support students having this opportunity, and even though there are students who desperately want this opportunity. If it accepted the argument of Dr Chapman's report, the Government might also be prepared to allow more flexibility to universities in establishing the private valuation which students give to their education instead of setting a rigid fixed charge for all students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Higher Education Council, in its September advice to the Minister on planning for the 1993-95 triennium, found it impossible, on my reading, to provide a coherent rationale for the current policy, and it indicated that it would be exploring issues which the Government has refused to address. The Industry Commission last year concluded, of course, as we remember, that the Government's current framework was fundamentally `flawed'. We are seeing a government policy where political ideology is prevailing at enormous cost to students and to the nation. This Bill is just one more sign that this policy is in the process of collapsing around the Government's ears. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since Fightback, the Government has summoned up the courage to adopt several of the coalition's proposals, at least in part. It moved quickly to adopt our policy to increase the real value of the boarding allowance for isolated children, though it has persisted with its determination to retain the asset test on the means tested portion, so there remains a significant difference in the policy of the Government and the Opposition on this matter. In the Budget, the Government acknowledged that there were savings to be made by redefining taxable income and including fringe benefits and by establishing a minimum payment level which it set at $20 a week. It even acknowledged that there were savings to be made by more effective action to recover overpayments, a matter which, I have to say, sadly the Minister denied at the time when the Fightback package was released. The Government tells us that it anticipates only about $7m from this source. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a matter which the Minister finds very hard to address. As I mentioned earlier in my speech, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training used estimates which the Department of Finance acknowledged could produce substantial savings. When we announced our target savings in Fightback, the Minister stated that he believed these were probably wholly irrecoverable. The Department of Finance put him right on that one, and indicated publicly in its comment on the Fightback proposals that it saw the possibility of at least $41m in savings. The Minister has come up with $7m. Judging from the Auditor-General's latest damning condemnation of the financial management of the Department, he should have been told to go away and come back with something more. But his vote is probably important in the Caucus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, we have a government dragged to the post to establish a suitable framework for student financial assistance. Instead of a coherent system, we have a rolling set of piecemeal reforms, without any coherent analysis of the issues. There has not been a single significant speech on this topic by the Minister in the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In assessing the changes in this legislation, it remains significant that nothing whatever has been done by the Government to realistically open access to education for rural students who would be excluded from Austudy by the assets test. These students do not have access to the loans arrangement set up by the Government, despite the fact that the Chapman report suggested they should. The Government has still not adopted an adequate hardship provision of the kind proposed by the Liberal and National parties. Rural students remain a significantly disadvantaged group under this Government, and it is still totally out of touch with the pressing need to lift educational access and standards in this country. After we have seen so many statements criticising the Opposition and a complete failure by the Minister to provide this House with a coherent explanation of the Government's financing arrangements in higher education, I am afraid that we can expect nothing more from this Government during its term of office. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to adjust the parental income threshold entitlement to Austudy so that it is the same as the entitlement to family allowance.</PARA>
<PARA>The petition also asks the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to grant a non means tested base allowance and travel allowance for tertiary students who leave their local area to study.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the second petition from the people of Bega that I have presented. I believe that the House needs to give attention to the petition. It is part of the consultation that the Government has undertaken over many years in improving the financial assistance methods in education. It is very important that we take into account all the views that come to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that both the suggestions are well motivated. I can see some community objection to the second suggestion, which recommends a non-means tested base allowance and travel allowance, simply on the basis of the fact that when we came into government in 1983 there were considerable complaints from people about the tertiary education assistance scheme, which was known as TEAS. There were a considerable number of complaints about the fact that there was no assets test on TEAS. I can remember people on wages complaining to me that people who were on fairly low income but who had very high assets were able to obtain TEAS. They were instancing doctors' children, farmers' children and others who were obtaining TEAS. There were many complaints about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time there were also complaints about people who were receiving other non-means tested benefits. People were saying, `Why should people receive benefits when they are perfectly able to look after themselves?'. So I can see some problems with the second suggestion. But I believe the first suggestion needs to be given attention fairly urgently, because if we see people as our greatest resource it is important that we have a student income which is higher than unemployment benefits in order to encourage people to pursue education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion which has been made to adjust the parental income threshold entitlement for Austudy so that it is the same as the entitlement for family allowance seems to me to be fair. But I can see why there are arguments against it. For instance, we are spending $6.5 billion on education and this suggestion would involve a very large increase on that. It would involve looking at the total income of government from taxation and working out just where such expenditure could be taken from. But it is important that we add value not only to our goods and commodities, but also to our education system and that is one important way of doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that Australia has close to the world's best student financial assistance scheme. Australia has one of the world's fairest and most equitable higher education systems. I recall a finance organisation appearing before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Long Term Strategies and telling it about some of the things Australia could be doing in exporting to overseas markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two of the items which it mentioned may surprise many people in Australia. One was health. It was stated that our health system ranked so high in the world that we ought to be marketing it to other countries and offering to set up a similar system there. There are many complaints about our health system, but of course they come mainly from people who have not suffered the health systems of other countries, such as the United States and Europe where people are paying out huge amounts of money for health. I recall reading about one farmer who lost his property because he had been in hospital for three months and simply did not have health insurance. That would not happen in Australia where we have compulsory health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of education, it was suggested by the finance organisation that we ought to set up education systems in other countries. It suggested that it was well worth looking at establishing the Austudy system, for instance, in other countries. Since 1983, the number of secondary students on income support in Australia has increased 3 1/2 times&mdash;there are now 350 per cent more secondary students on income support. This is far fairer and more equitable than the system which existed in 1983. The number of people on tertiary benefits has increased by 125 per cent. The real value of maximum benefits paid has increased by 11 per cent for tertiary students and by 115 per cent for secondary students. It is no wonder that a lot more people are staying on at school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That needs to happen because we no longer have what were called the `dead-end jobs'. In the days of the Depression we were able to say, `Let's put people out to work on the roads with shovels making bridges'. We now use far more equipment to do that work. Governments do not want to employ people to do that work; they want to employ machines. So we must have educated people. Of course, our main exports in the future will be in the information area and one of our main growth industries will be the information industry. So it is important that we take heed of that fact and educate more people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is still room for improvement. There are people in the Bega area, and in other areas, who are very unhappy about the existing system. Just because a poor person in the United States has to work at McDonald`s all night at $3 an hour to get his education, that is no reason why we should be satisfied&mdash;even though we have a better system in Australia. It is important that we continue this extensive public consultation. It is important that we continue to examine our system and improve on it, simply because we have made innovations in the education area. As a result, we have to put up with the fact that there are mistakes made occasionally and that there is room for improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to comment on the amendment that the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) has moved. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. . . the House condemns the Government for its failure to adequately address the problems in the administration and targeting of student financial assistance to ensure that it is fair and accessible to all. </PARA>
<PARA>This seems to me to be the very direction the Government is taking and the very direction that the Opposition is not taking. The Opposition asks us to accept a market approach based on the demands of the labour market. Universities and schools will compete for students. That is false competition. The real competition ought to be where it is. The competition should be within the demands of the labour market. The labour market should dictate the number of students coming in, rather than the universities competing with each other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly important in poorer areas and in rural areas that we do not generate that false competition. Fees are the key element of the Opposition policy. When we consider that the average course fee is about $12,000 a year, that is a pretty high fee to pay. Its system involves vouchers which are to be earned on merit. But what about the different costs of courses? The medical course may cost $30,000; another course may cost $5,000 or $10,000. What are vouchers doing there? They are making it much more difficult for poorer students to take on the more expensive courses, whereas under Austudy they are able to take on those more expensive courses if they have the ability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition policy really means hand-outs to the richest. I believe we ought to reject that. We ought to reject this amendment because it does not honestly point out the direction that the Government is taking, it certainly does not honestly point out the direction that members of the Opposition are taking, nor does it point out the fact that they have a policy involving loans to students. The honourable member for Goldstein was praising Dr Chapman. The sorts of suggestions that he was making were totally rejected by students throughout Australia. Representatives of the banks who have come before one of our committees of this Parliament have said that if there are to be loans, then they would require a commercial return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The loan system was adopted in the United States. The United States Government has to put funds into the loan system to enable it to continue. The Opposition's policy has made no mention of putting extra funds in to bolster the loan system. Even Mrs Thatcher realised that, to adopt this system, would be to adopt a system which involved a lot of defaulting on the part of people who had taken up the loans. As well as that, it is not particularly fair to the people who take up the loans and have to pay back the full cost of their education&mdash;whether it is $12,000 or $30,000 a year. It is not fair. The system the Government has of paying back a portion of the education over time, provided that they are on a certain income, is much fairer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before us is important in giving an option to some of these people who may not be eligible for Austudy. People who do not currently qualify for Austudy or Abstudy&mdash;about 50,000 tertiary students&mdash;would be eligible for a supplement provided the combined income of their parents was less than $50,000 per annum. They would be able to receive a supplement of about $2,000. There are people who would like to take advantage of that. I believe that that opens up the possibilities for children of parents who are unable or not prepared to pay for the full costs of some of the courses. It may well make a difference between a student being able to attempt a course or not attempt a course. So the improvements which have come to the student assistance scheme arose from the major review of Austudy which has involved the extensive public consultation that I have been talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted that the Opposition has decided to support the legislation. It will give opportunities to students who do not have them at the moment. Even students who are receiving Austudy or Abstudy will be able to receive a trade-in on all or part of their grant up to a limit of $2,000 for double the amount of money&mdash;that is, up to $4,000&mdash;and that supplement will be provided at no real rate of interest. It is also entirely optional. I know there have been criticisms of this, but the point is that it is entirely optional. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation is well worth while in broadening the scope of Austudy and Abstudy, enabling a lot of students who have not been able to take advantage of it previously to take advantage of it. But there is still room for improvement. I strongly commend to honourable members and to the House the petition which I will be handing to the Clerk tomorrow morning for presentation to the House and ask people to consider the recommendations that I have described in that petition.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr Dawkins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision of counselling services to displaced Senior Executive Service (SES) officers was one of the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration report on the Development of the Senior Executive Service. Paragraph 5.39 recommended that "all displaced (SES) staff subject to redundancy action be entitled to counselling and related services as of right. Access to such services should be through the Public Service Commissioner with the full costs being charged to the agencies from which the officers have been displaced". This was agreed to in the Government's response, tabled in Parliament in early October 1991. It reinforced a longstanding Public Service Commission (PSC) policy of ensuring that displaced SES officers have access to counselling services as necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PSC has referred agencies to two firms which have specialised in senior executive career and outplacement counselling for many years and are accredited members of the Association of Outplacement Counselling Firms. They are Pauline Hyde and Associates and Davidson and Axmith Pty Ltd. These firms provide two types of services to displaced officers&mdash;career transition counselling and outplacement counselling. Outplacement counselling is more intensive and is provided on a one-to-one basis. Both firms charge the same standard fee for outplacement counselling services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is required to fund appropriate counselling whenever the situation arises that officers are displaced, as are all other agencies. There has been one such case in the ATO in the last two years. In the past these services have been arranged through the PSC however, in future it will be possible for agencies to make these arrangements themselves following PSC guidelines. The PSC will shortly be calling for expressions of interest from firms that provide such services with the aim of issuing a broader list of firms that provide services of an equal standard.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FH4">Mr Humphreys</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. In response to a similar question from the honourable member (Question No. 1293, Hansard of 25 February 1992, pp 2838-2839) I supplied the following figures for the years 1986-87 to 1990-91:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">  These figures included "continuations" (i.e. a veteran in receipt of special (T&amp;PI) rate pension submitting an additional valid claim which does not affect the veteran's rate of pension) and, therefore, were overstated.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">   My previous answer gave the reason for the reduction in grants in 1986-87. Since then the level of grants has been fairly constant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The legislation was changed on two occasions affecting the criteria for special (T&amp;PI) rate pensions since 6 June 1985.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first change was to make the special (T&amp;PI) rate pension payable for life. The change was announced in the 1987 Budget and was introduced retrospectively from the date of commencement of the VEA. The basis for the change was the Federal Court decisions in Smith, Wright and McGuire in which the court held that the special (T&amp;PI) rate pension should not be payable for the whole of the veteran's life or indefinitely, but only for so long as he is not prevented from undertaking remunerative work by the service-related disability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second change to the legislation was a change to the required degree of incapacity. This was reduced from 100% to 70% in December 1988. The change was accompanied by a new provision that enabled a veteran to qualify where he or she met all the eligibility criteria at any point between the application date and the date of decision of the Commission or review body. The change resulted from a recommendation by the Veterans' Entitlements Act Monitoring Committee, following decisions of the Federal Court that indicated a misunderstanding of the intentions of the application day provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change to make these pensions payable for life would have had no impact on the number of grants or rejections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of the other changes would have been to increase the number of disability pensioners who were entitled to the special (T&amp;PI) rate pension. Figures are not available on the number of pensions granted at the special (T&amp;PI) rate resulting from this change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation requires a determining authority to consider the question of T&amp;PI eligibility once the threshold of the degree of incapacity of 70% is reached. There is no need for a specific application from the veteran for the special (T&amp;PI) rate pension to be made. There are, therefore, no statistics collected of rejections of the special (T&amp;PI) rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The change in the degree of incapacity from 100% to 70% was detailed in my speech in the House on 20 October 1988. The Government accepted the recommendations of the Veterans' Entitlements Act Monitoring Committee that a disability pensioner suffering a degree of incapacity of at least 70% was likely to be severely disabled and unable to continue working and should, therefore, be eligible for consideration of the special (T&amp;PI) rate pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the legislative change concerning the special (T&amp;PI) rate pension to be payable for life was to reflect the fact that since the inception of the T&amp;PI pension in the 1920's no Government had ever taken steps to remove a T&amp;PI pension from a veteran, except on the grounds of fraud, improved health or the capacity to undertake remunerative activity. The change was necessary in view of the view expressed by the Federal Court (see paragraph 2 above).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) No. In fact the December 1988 change made the granting of special (T&amp;PI) rate pensions easier. Naturally the number of grants of special (T&amp;PI) rate pensions must decline as the veteran population ages and leaves the work-force at a normal retiring age. Most veterans of World War II have retired. In addition it must be remembered that the veterans of WW II are dying at a greater rate than in the past and this reduces the number of possible claims. The veteran population eligible for disability pension who are younger than normal retiring age has reduced considerably between 1985-86 and 1990-91.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of Extreme Disablement Adjustment as an alternative for severely disabled veterans who because of advancing age or other reasons could not qualify for a T&amp;PI rate pension, indicates that rather than looking for a reduction in T&amp;PI pensions the Government has been keen to protect the interests of veterans. Similarly, the introduction of an "assessment period" is certainly a significant advantage to veterans applying for the special (T&amp;PI) rate.</PARA>
