I remind the Prime Minister that his economic policies have not only destroyed the Victorian economy but have also, in human terms, thrown 300,000 people out of work in that State. In the light of that devastating economic and human damage that you have already done to Victoria, why have you, as Prime Minister, not only endorsed but also actively encouraged a one-day political strike in Victoria at enormous further cost to the economy?</PARA></TALK.START>

This is in a State where it has been part of the national economic trend to see wages as a proportion of the total economy decline, where profits have risen, and where we have seen now a huge surge in productivity and low inflation. That is the crime these people have committed. If they actually go and stand up and say, `We are not going to see rates of pay and conditions of employment swept away like this' and they go and demonstrate in the street, it is industrial anarchy, according to the honourable member for Bennelong.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are those who argue, when they actually get around to arguing, the merits of a value added tax or a GST&mdash;a topic upon which the Opposition has gone strangely mute in recent times. This centrepiece of its policy has somehow been disguised in all kinds of other ways. But when they get around to talking about it, they often refer to the fact that it is the transparency of value added taxes which is so important as an argument for introducing them into a country like Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, one of the many problems that the Leader of the Opposition has is that he has created a fight with the National Building and Construction Forum over the way in which a value added tax would be applied to that industry. The way in which the Opposition has tried to handle this is to fob it off to the Cole Committee, telling the industry to take all of its questions to that Committee. The Cole Committee is reported as saying that it actually accepts the argument of the industry that the design of the tax as proposed by the Opposition is flawed. But of course the Opposition will take no notice of the Cole Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir William Cole has to realise at some point that his Committee has been created as a kind of stunt&mdash;a political cul de sac; a blind alley&mdash;where all of these questions can be raised, in the words of the Leader of the Opposition, `in the interests of consultation'. But industries never get an opportunity to actually talk to the organ-grinder; they only get an opportunity to talk to Sir William and his pals who all come from the big accounting firms. They never get an opportunity to put their point of view to the architects of this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why the Opposition has got into this problem is that it wanted to introduce a hidden tax as far as the housing industry was concerned. It did not want to have to confront the fact that home buyers would have GST added to the cost of building a house. So those opposite decided that they would call the housing and construction industry `exempt', hoping that people would think that that meant no GST was applied in that industry. But, as anyone knows, `exempt' Liberal style does not mean exempt. What it means is that the builder has to incur the cost of the GST on the architects' fees and the various inputs which are involved, and which he has to purchase, in the building of a house or a factory. But of course the extra costs that the builder pays get built into the final cost of the house or the factory, but they never actually show up in a way which could identify them as a tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Leader of the Opposition wanted was a hidden tax in the housing industry. In the process he has created a monster for himself as far as the commercial construction industry is concerned. By making this industry `exempt', even those buildings which are used for commercial and business purposes cannot have the tax deducted but must have that tax reflected in the cost of the building.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far from this being a transparent tax, far from this being a means by which you can avoid taxes for business, as a result of trying to impose a hidden tax on the housing industry those opposite have created this monster as far as the commercial construction industry is concerned. It is no wonder they are protesting and taking their complaints to the Cole Committee. What they have to work out sooner or later is that the Cole Committee has always been just a ruse, a kind of waste paper basket for all of these too hard problems which the Opposition will not face up to.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend to the House a report of research recently undertaken by the Group Industrial Relations Manager of Shell Australia, Mr John Keily. This research has been published by the Department of Industrial Relations, and I table a copy for honourable members. The study demonstrates clearly that many companies are now using the Government's reforms of the IR system and the cooperative spirit which has been created over the past nine years to make dramatic changes in workplace flexibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report articulates some of those changes and explains how they work and how they are undertaken. I mentioned in answer to a question earlier that the changes include continuous 12-hour shifts; loaded base hourly rates to replace penalty time; annualised salaries to incorporate penalty rates, overtime and allowances; flexible working hours; and time off in lieu. Any of the things which our conservative friends opposite might wish for&mdash;that is, continuous hourly shifts, the replacement of penalty time by loaded base hourly rates, annualised salaries which incorporate penalty rates&mdash;are all there. It can all be done and it is all being done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have seen from the Opposition is not a movement towards enterprise bargaining; it has nothing to do with a bargaining system at all. It has moved to a system of individual contracts which has nothing to do with an enterprise as such or enterprise bargaining. It has moved simply to a system of individual contracts which is not a bargaining system whatsoever; it is a system under which you take the contract or you take the sack.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong was telling us that he would have an enterprise bargaining system in place. Enterprise bargaining means that people who work in the enterprise come together. They sit down and talk about the enterprise with the managers and together they each come to understand how they could operate the business in a way which improves their income and improves profitability. In other words, they bargain together; they change together; they enterprise bargain. That has gone. What the honourable member for Bennelong wants to give people has nothing to do with enterprise bargaining but a single contract system. Because the only rights you have are common law rights under the master and servant approach, you take the contract or you take the sack.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Liberal Party there is now great heartburning about the Victorian Liberals having let the cat out of the bag on all of this. It is reported that in the party room at least one backbencher:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . has openly expressed concern that voter backlash against the tough Kennett reforms will impede the coalition's push for power. Senator Noel Crichton-Browne had used the party room to go on and make these points . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Then we had another report which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senior Opposition front benchers yesterday came under fire in the coalition party room for distancing themselves from the Kennett Government's radical industrial relations policies. Mr Tuckey said he was concerned Mr Kennett was not being given enough support. Those who spoke out in favour of Kennett were Tuckey, Ken Aldred, Michael Ronaldson and Shirley Walters.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that those opposite do not know which way they are going on this issue because they do not basically have the policy which they have been telling us they have. The important point is that the honourable member for Bennelong has continually told us that he will be producing a Bill. On 1 December 1991 he said, `We will be producing a Bill well before the next election'. That is about as far as you can go in filling out the detail. In April 1992 David Barnett&mdash;no radical in covering affairs from the Labor side of politics but someone who is generally well-informed about the coalition&mdash;said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The drafting has been completed and the Industrial Relations Amendment (Voluntary Enterprise Agreements) Bill is being checked with eminent lawyers around the country, a process which will take some weeks. Then, says the Opposition industrial relations spokesman John Howard, the Bill will be made public.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a Bill which has a name, which has been drafted and completed, and which has been shown around the law firms for them to check it out. But today we find that, in a debate in Queensland with Mr Dawson Petie, the honourable member for Bennelong said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, we've put out a detailed policy.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Petie said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The details of the legislation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Howard said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Look, with great respect, Dawson, when did any government in waiting&mdash;when did any Opposition&mdash;have the resources or the capacity to produce the actual Bills and the pieces of legislation?</PARA>
<PARA>Petie, pretty quick on the uptake, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But you've been saying for months that your Bill is in process.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Howard said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. In light of the fact that since last Tuesday there has not been one single question without notice on the issue of national unemployment, will the Treasurer assure the Australian people that full employment, rather than zero inflation and technical management of the economy, is the prime objective of the Government? If so, and given the expectation, contrary to Treasury predictions, that unemployment is likely to rise above 11 per cent, what specific initiatives has the Treasurer considered to achieve full employment? Finally, how does the Treasurer respond to the growing number of critics who argue that the globalisation of capital and a reliance on so-called free trade continues to undermine the basis for economic renewal?</PARA></TALK.START>

In fact, some American experience suggests that a worker entering the work force now may well expect to change his career or his occupation perhaps seven times during his working life.

We are demonstrating that we can compete, and Australia can be one of those countries that can benefit from the expansion of world trade in a way in which we did not in the 1950s and 1960s.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All of these things have come from a small public sector. As well as that, to go with it we have a relatively small public debt. In 1983, public sector debt was 24 per cent of GDP. It had fallen to 13 per cent by 1990, the lowest in the OECD. It has risen at the moment because of the fiscal stimulus provided from the Budget and the impact upon State Budgets. But, again, it is well below the 24 per cent&mdash;it is at about 18&mdash;which obtained when you were last in office. It has been done not by increasing taxes but by cutting spending. That of course is the quality way, and has been the quality way&mdash;not only targeting the system better but also reducing the size of government so as to reduce debt without needing to increase taxes. We do not want to emulate other OECD countries with a higher tax to GDP ratio, but the Opposition does. It wants to increase the tax to GDP level of Australians.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was just about to make the point at the time of the honourable member's interjection that, of the 13 countries that introduced a value added tax before the middle 1980s, 10 have increased their rates. Some of these are Austria, which has gone from initial rates of 8 and 16 per cent to 10, 20 and 32 per cent now; Denmark, which has gone from an initial rate of 10 per cent to 22 per cent; Germany, which initially had 5 and 10 per cent and has gone to 7 and 14 per cent; the Netherlands, which originally had 4 and 12 per cent and is now at 6 and 18 1/2 per cent; New Zealand, which has had a GST only since 1986 and has already increased it from 10 to 12.5 per cent; and, of course, the United Kingdom, which initially was at 10 per cent and is now at 17.5 per cent. These statistics prove that the bulk of the countries which have consumption taxes have a tax to GDP ratio eight percentage points of GDP higher than those which do not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In seeking to emulate those countries, as the Leader of the Opposition seeks to do in this pamphlet of his, he is in my view about increasing the rate of tax. In this pamphlet he says that New Zealand is bursting its way out of recession. I just make this final point: the fact is that it is five years since New Zealand introduced a GST, and over that period employment has fallen by almost 6 per cent. I make this point: this country does not need Dr Hewson's goods and services tax, this country does not want Dr Hewson's goods and services tax, and I am quite sure this country will not get Dr Hewson's goods and services tax.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today and it is not correct. I have no intention of dumping the CSIRO from rural policy, nor of excluding the CSIRO from the most senior decision making bodies in so far as it affects agricultural policy in this country. The report itself is based on a paper which has been circulated by officials to Ministers in the Commonwealth as a result of my combining three ministerial councils into one to try to get more strategic and integrated management so far as our natural resource base is concerned. That paper asks Ministers to do no more than consider a range of options.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But so far as my position is concerned, my intention is to involve the CSIRO as fully as possible in policy formulation. The real task for the new structure coming forward is how best to achieve that. That is not just my commitment; it is also my track record. I remind the House&mdash;and in particular the honourable member for Fraser&mdash;that when I had the previous portfolio of science and technology I argued successfully that the CSIRO should be involved in the policy formulation aspect of our response to ESD.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the Government's commitment to rural research and development is concerned, I remind the House that we reaffirmed that commitment in the last Budget whereby we maintained the expenditures in terms of rural research and development despite the speculation that was running around at the time. We, as a government, did have to face up to some tough economic decisions, but one thing we did not cut was rural research and development because we saw it as an investment in the future not as something which had to be cut to try to get the figures right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time there was a lot of outcry from the other side when there were suggestions that we were going to cut this rural research and development. One interesting comment came from the honourable member for Lowan, in the Victorian Parliament, Mr Bill McGrath. He slammed what he said was the `Federal Government's preparedness to slash rural research and development'. Who is Bill McGrath today? He is the Minister for Agriculture in the Victorian Government, and he has that headline against him in a Herald and Weekly Times publication last week. That is the Victorian Government's position. It is prepared to criticise us over a speculation of slashing research and development, but it is into the cutting of research and development up to its neck.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal with that issue later. I will accept it. There is not the slightest doubt in the eyes of any objective observer of the Australian scene that the Keating Government is aiding and abetting the strike that is now going on in Victoria. If it were not for the benediction and the blessing given by the Prime Minister in Question Time today, a blessing which has been given on earlier occasion, that strike would not be going ahead in Victoria. It is the rankest piece of hypocrisy for anybody, and most particularly the Prime Minister of this country, to dare to say, to have the unbelievable nerve and gall to say, that the mess in which Victoria is now finding itself is the fault of the Liberal Party and the newly elected coalition Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister talks about `how far we have come in 10 years'. That has to be the sickest and sorriest joke that anybody has ever tried to play on the long suffering people of Victoria. No State has suffered more under a State Labor government or a State government of any political complexion in Australia at any time this century than the people of Victoria have suffered under the Labor governments of the last 10 years. When the history of Victoria is written and there is a proper accounting with the passage of time of what has really happened in Victoria and in Australia over the last few years, the black marks against State governments will be at their densest and blackest when one examines the records of Victorian governments over the last 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say, as I have said before, that all of those people who have been associated with what has happened in Victoria, from John Cain through to the present Prime Minister of Australia, be it remembered, counselled and procured the support of Joan Kirner, John Halfpenny and Wally Curran for the Prime Minister to become the Prime Minister of Australia. They stood behind him. They became conspirators with him to undermine Bob Hawke. He did not care about what they were doing to Victoria. He was only interested in what they were prepared to do to Bob Hawke. He did not care about the pain they have inflicted on the people of Victoria; yet he has the gall, the nerve, the hide, the cheek to come into this Parliament, with all the false indignation that only a prime hypocrite can muster, and to say, `Jeff Kennett and the newly elected Victorian Government are declaring war on the people of Victoria'. </PARA>

They have ransacked their public finances; they have decimated the morale of their Public Service; they have destroyed the confidence base of the small business sector; and they have driven the State into the hands of the international pawnbrokers. Yet you characters opposite have got the nerve to try to put the blame for this strike on Jeff Kennett. It is well known that on odd occasions Jeff and I have not always agreed, but on this particular occasion I think Jeff Kennett deserves the 100 per cent support of this Parliament. </PARA>

The industrial relations Bill of the Kennett Government is not seen by members of the Labor Party as an attack on the living standards of the people of Victoria.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those opposite had any semblance of appreciation of the national interest, the last thing they would be doing at the moment is counselling and procuring what could turn into a general strike. The reality is that the Prime Minister is delighted that there is a strike in Victoria. He is hoping and praying that, out of the confusion, the chaos, the inevitable pain, the inevitable dislocation and the further economic loss that Victorian families will suffer, he will not get blamed and the Kennett Government and the Federal coalition will get blamed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say to the Prime Minister: we are alive to that strategy. We know that the Prime Minister does not give a damn about the welfare of the people of Victoria; we know that he has a maximum, vested political interest in chaos and industrial unrest in Victoria. The Prime Minister wants there to be trouble on the streets of Victoria because he thinks that it might repay him a political dividend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the Prime Minister's strategy. He wants the people of Victoria to be further hurt, in the hope that they might believe him when he says that it is Kennett's fault and it is the fault of the Liberals; it is not the fault of the Labor Party. But the Australian people who live in Victoria are not that stupid. They know that before the 1988 election they were lied to by Cain and his crew about the VEDC. They know what Cain has done and what Kirner did to the Victorian economy. They know the mess in which the Victorian economy was left. They know that Victoria has a debt of $62 billion. They know that unemployment is worse in Victoria than it is anywhere else. They know that every household in Victoria will suffer years of pain before things are put right economically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government members should not imagine that, out of the industrial chaos and the social disharmony which they hope will overwhelm Victoria, they can gain some political advantage. That, plainly, is the political strategy of the Keating Government.

In a decade, the pride of the people of Melbourne was destroyed, attacked and undermined by this Government. Those of us who have visited that city over the years could only lament the terrible fate that had befallen a wonderful city that had enormous civic pride. Labor's hopeless mismanagement wounded and weakened the spirit of those people. But their spirit is not so weakened and wounded, they are not so stupid and so deceived, that they will not be able to see through what Labor is doing and what it has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few weeks ago the people of Victoria voted overwhelmingly to throw out the Labor Party. They voted in full knowledge that the incoming Liberal Government was going to reform the industrial relations system. For five weeks they heard Labor talk about the darkness and industrial debt that would befall Victoria if there were a change of government. They heard all its ranting and misrepresentation, and all its distortion about the slashing of living standards and the breaking down of basic conditions. Having heard all of that, they rejected every single thing that Labor had to say about industrial relations and voted overwhelmingly to install a coalition government in Victoria. </PARA>

My advice to Government members is that, if they have any sense of self-respect, they should, along with Joan Kirner, Wally Curran and John Halfpenny, go away and hide behind a rock for a couple of years, because by then they might have some right to re-emerge and re-enter the political debate in Victoria. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only interesting element in that quarter of an hour speech by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was that perhaps there was a portent for the future in his speech, in that whilst he was speaking the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) was sitting on the back bench. Maybe there is more portent in that symbolism than in anything he actually said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The speech by the honourable member for Bennelong was just empty rhetoric and absolutely devoid of any substantial analysis of the issues. I understand that today over 100,000 people have massed in Melbourne to protest against the legislation brought in by the Kennett Government&mdash;legislation which goes far beyond that which they sought a mandate for during the election campaign and which enormously damages the rights and the conditions of employment of Victorian working people. Let there be no doubt about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not just a piece of legislation which is an interesting sideline or some minor change in the industrial scene. This is a fundamental attack on the rights and the conditions of employment of working people in Victoria. For the honourable member for Bennelong to say that it is about the special privileges and the rorts of the trade union leaders shows that he knows absolutely nothing about what is in the legislation; either that or he is trying to grossly mislead the House in relation to what is in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell the House what is in fact in this legislation. Firstly, it imperils the basic conditions of employment of Victorian working people by depriving them of award coverage unless the employer agrees. They cannot have an award, after 1 March next year, unless the employer agrees that they can continue in an award. So they are entirely at the mercy of the employer. The legislation removes weekend penalty rates and holiday leave loadings from awards without that having been mentioned prior to the election. The legislation provides for individual contracts that contain lower than award conditions, except for a few basic elements. So it means that an employee can be forced, on the threat of the sack, by an employer into an individual contract, which greatly diminishes the standard of conditions of employment that prevailed under the previous award situation. That is of direct enormous concern to many people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be particularly true of people who are the most in need of protection, the people who are in the weakest bargaining positions, who will tend to be the lower paid. Those people are going to be open to exploitation under this system which is exactly the position that is being pursued by the Opposition at a Federal level. There is also no provision in this legislation for any future review of minimum wages. So although the legislation says, `You can take your award wages into the individual contract', it provides no basis for any adjustment of that award in the future. It is just frozen in time and rots away in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the matters that relate to the basic conditions of employment, but the legislation also gives the employer the whip hand in developing individual contracts. Any system which says that each individual employee has to negotiate with an employer obviously means that the bargaining power is greatly transferred to the employer. What bargaining power does the school leaver have with any employer, even if it is only a milk bar proprietor, let alone some major company&mdash;as though there could be some meaningful negotiation? It is an absurdity and an affront to any sort of reasonable conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the basic assumption which underlies this legislation is that there can be some sensible bargain, but of course there cannot. But just to make sure that the employees are further disadvantaged, this legislation states that there will be no requirement for employers to recognise an employee's bargaining representative. So an employee might say, `I want this union to represent me'. The employer does not have to recognise that union, let alone bargain with it. The employer does not have to do anything like that. There is no requirement for the employer to recognise or bargain with the employee's nominated representative. There is also no protection for employees against harsh or oppressive contracts, or the procurement of contracts by harsh and oppressive means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both of those points are elements of the New Zealand legislation on which this legislation is modelled, but they are not in the Victorian legislation. It means that employees in Victoria can clearly be much more open to exploitation than is the case in New Zealand. Remarkably, it also enables the inclusion in contracts or awards of a provision requiring employees to pay the employer a sum of money if, in the opinion of the employer, the employee's behaviour, attendance or obedience is unsatisfactory. Can honourable members imagine a requirement in legislation that an employer can put into a contract a provision which enables him to fine the employee because he does not like the employee's behaviour or does not like the way the employee reacts in regard to some order he has been given? At his discretion, the employer can have in the contract, which he has obtained under the threat of the sack, some provision to fine the employee. What an extraordinary, outrageous provision! It is one which the honourable member for Bennelong and the Opposition support. They say they are 100 per cent behind Jeff Kennett. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, this legislation virtually completely outlaws any industrial action. Any industrial action during the term of an award or collective agreement is unlawful, for starters. Secondly, any industrial action in essential industries is outlawed. The legislation declares that essential industries are such things as transport, power, fuel and so on. Then it says that industrial action is outlawed in vital industries. What is a vital industry? It is any industry that the legislation declares to be a vital industry. It could be the ice cream manufacturing industry. It could be any industry at all which the Victorian Government can declare to be a vital industry, and then there is no right to take any industrial action whatsoever. It is an extraordinary provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the legislation, in respect of both essential industries and vital industries, where industrial action is outlawed, makes no provision for conciliation or arbitration. So the employees in those industries are, under this legislation, totally and absolutely subject to the whim of the employer. They cannot take industrial action; they cannot go to arbitration. Has anyone ever seen anything more oppressive and undemocratic than this absurd, bloody legislation which the Victorian Government is putting to the people of Victoria? And it is wondering why there are people demonstrating in the streets! It is absolutely extraordinary legislation. Those opposite should be ashamed of themselves for supporting it. This is their hidden agenda too. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw the adjective, Mr Deputy Speaker. Furthermore, if after all that there is some little crack of light, if there is some industry in which people can actually take some industrial action, there is another provision which says that if it causes damage to a third party it is unlawful. Industrial action almost necessarily, if it is effective, does some damage to a third party. But, if it has that effect, then it is unlawful. In effect the Victorian Government is completely wiping out any effective industrial action anywhere. It is saying to the working people of Victoria, `You have no right to take any industrial action in any real circumstance'. That is what this legislation says.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, despite all that, the employees are able to find some area in which they can still take industrial action&mdash;it beggars one's imagination wondering where that would be&mdash;the legislation says they firstly have to have a secret ballot. The secret ballot can authorise only five days of industrial action within a 28-day period from the close of the ballot. It means that after every five days of industrial action there has to be another ballot, which is obviously very restrictive. The legislation also says that each ballot paper must include the statement&mdash;I ask the House to listen to the statement which goes on this ballot paper, and which must be there under the law&mdash;`If you take part in a strike or other industrial action, you may be in breach of your contract of employment'. What an incredible, intimidatory provision that is to try to ensure that the ballot comes out against any industrial action. It says, `No comment on or qualification of this statement is permissible'. So people are not allowed to put anything on the ballot paper which might in any way say something about that statement that must be there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole thing is massively loaded against the employees in favour of the employers. It is all about massive power transfer to the employers of the State of Victoria. There are penalties for industrial action. For breach of an employment contract, the court can award a penalty against an individual employee of no more than $5,000. This is not a small amount, but it certainly seems to be open to the interpretation that each day may be a separate breach, so people could get fined $5,000 every day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are no limits for breach of an award. There is no protection against contractual action for illegal industrial action following the expiration of a collective industrial agreement. There is no protection against the claims for damages in tort resulting from unlawful industrial action. So people can still have very substantial common law action taken against them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of all of that there are criminal penalties. To take industrial action is a crime&mdash;like robbing a bank, pinching a car, and so on. On top of all of the other things, it becomes a crime. A criminal penalty of $1,000 for the first offence, $2,000 for the second and $3,000 for third and subsequent offences applies. This is for individuals and, of course, for unions the penalty is $50,000. That can apply not just to an individual who takes industrial action, but to anyone who aids, counsels, or attempts to induce an employee into unlawful industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What an extraordinary provision; one which goes totally against our international obligations as much as the rest of this legislation does. This legislation is an extraordinarily savage attack on the rights and conditions of employment of Victoria's employees. It is utterly without rationale given Victoria's industrial dispute record. In the period of the Fraser Government, Victoria had a level of industrial disputation above that of Australia&mdash;about 16 per cent above it. Since then industrial action across Australia has come down by 61 per cent. In Victoria it has come down by 74 per cent. The level of industrial disputation in Victoria is the second lowest of any State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People would think that it was some sort of industrial madhouse in which people were running riot and causing the whole Victorian economy to crack up by crazy industrial action. That is anything but the case. The whole nation has gone through an industrial relations transformation, but Victoria even more so than the rest, except for South Australia. Yet Victoria is being treated as though it was an industrial relations madhouse, and as though the unions had to be belted into submission when, in fact, they have been behaving on the whole with an unprecedented degree of reasonableness compared with historical behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is considerably more repressive than the New Zealand legislation on which it is clearly based. I will not go into the details of that but, on a whole variety of fronts, it is much more repressive than the New Zealand legislation. It is in blatant breach of ILO conventions&mdash;conventions 87 and 98&mdash;to which Australia is a signatory. The Opposition and the honourable member for Bennelong apparently do not give a damn about breaking our obligations to the ILO. They would say, `Let us go along, ratify these treaties and sign them all. It does not mean anything&mdash;it is just some place in Geneva. It does not mean anything at all'.

It is well and truly a political strike organised by the head of the Victorian Trades Hall Council, John Halfpenny, who is a mate and supporter of our Prime Minister. It is also supported by Mr Wally Curran, also a mate of our Prime Minister. It seems to me that this political strike is a pay-off for the ACTU Secretary, Mr Bill Kelty.

It received a mandate from the Victorian people on 3 October. We in Victoria live in a truly decimated State. We have over 300,000 unemployed, yet these union leaders have the audacity to call honest working men and women to strike against their government and their honest employers. A release in the last few minutes by Mr David Edwards, of the Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Trades Hall and the State Opposition are deliberately running a campaign of mis-information, but this will create a tremendous backlash on the union movement when employees understand the real contents of the Employee Relations Bill," . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He says workers are already beginning to understand that the legislation will not have the impact Trades Hall is predicting.</PARA>
<PARA>My understanding is that the turnout in the strike today was abysmal. Lots of public servants hit the street, but public servants feel that they are under attack today. They are in a highly unionised sector. I remind honourable members that, were it not for the high rate of union membership in the public sector, Australia would have an overall union membership of only 30-odd per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the private sector rejected the call of John Halfpenny and it rejected this strike today because it understands that the strike is about power. It is about John Halfpenny trying to continue to have the power he held over Joan Kirner for the past few years&mdash;a power which meant that every piece of legislative reform that she knew she had to implement was denied. Halfpenny and all the union officials on the Left pulled the strings to prevent any reform, which today has left us with this massive debt situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can talk about the Victorian loans scandal. We can talk about our Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) trying to hide from that because he was afraid Joan Kirner would lose. I tell this House that we will live with the effects of that for many a long year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this Parliament we now have some legislation about endangered species. I reckon that the dinosaurs, the John Halfpennys of this world, are the endangered species because when the Victorian public wakes up to the operation of that industrial relations legislation and the freedom and opportunity it will give individuals to negotiate with their employers for fair working conditions, for good wages and for modern enterprise agreements that will allow work forces to be effective, productive and play a real part in the development of our economy, then the workers will gravitate to enterprise agreements in a great rush. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister tries to make out that we have all the flexibility in the system that anyone could want. And, yes, there are some good agreements being struck today; but they are being struck with the agreement and help of sensible, modern-thinking unions&mdash;not the dinosaurs of this world like John Halfpenny and Wally Curran, and not the Jennie Georges of this world. I remind honourable members that last night on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> Jennie George talked of the award system as a safety net. It is not a safety net; it is a security blanket. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The award system which we have lived with for almost 90 years has left us in the position where our productivity is the laughing stock of the world. We talk of our competitiveness but this year, as I recall, Australia rated 16th out of 17 nations, according to the OECD&mdash;and our competitiveness is going down; it is certainly not increasing. We need flexibility. Even the Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance, who gave such an incomprehensible speech earlier, have talked about needing increased productivity, and they have said that their system will give it to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system has not given it to us: we have over one million unemployed in this country and over 300,000 unemployed in the State of Victoria. Talk about flexibility! We are talking about a dinosaurian system that has constrained businesses and enterprises, which has closed down those people who would be innovative and would build things, and those people who would try to provide new industry to provide new jobs for those Victorians out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead we have the John Halfpennys trying to hang onto their jobs and their power. They know they will not be able to control Jeff Kennett or Phil Gude the way they controlled Joan Kirner. There is no possibility that they will control Jeff Kennett. That is why the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) supported Jeff Kennett and Phil Gude, and that is why we support this legislation. It is absolutely the positive direction we need to take in this country to give working men and women a chance to enjoy higher wages and better conditions of employment and a chance to have some flexibility in the work place so that industry can be competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that respect there is no question that on 3 October the Victorian people gave a mandate to the coalition in Victoria. Yet this Prime Minister denies the mandate, as does the Minister for Finance. They reckon there was no mandate for change. Yet broadly the industrial relations policy was spelled out. We indicated we would give individuals the right to strike agreements with their employers outside the purview of the Industrial Relations Commission, and thank goodness for that. We indicated that we would guarantee that individuals did not have to belong to a union, nor that employers would have to belong to employer organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is true freedom of association, and it is long overdue. I can tell honourable members that compulsory union membership before 3 October was still alive and well in my devastated State of Victoria. The award system in this country, with its union generals, is like a boa constrictor&mdash;constricting the growth of a dynamic, forward-looking Australian economy. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think anybody doubts that tough economic measures will have to be adopted to meet Victoria's economic problems. However, the tougher the measures, the greater the need for consultation, cooperation and genuine sharing of economic burdens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is one group in the Victorian community that cannot be blamed for Victoria's economic difficulties it is the average worker, the average public servant; the average citizens out there on the street today who are basically defending their living standards and conditions. It is somewhat sad that honourable members opposite spend their time deprecating trade union leaders, yet at the same time believe and argue that over 100,000 Victorian citizens were on the street today simply at the demand of some trade union leaders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that if there is to be sacrifice, if we are to meet economic demands, then the first thing any Victorian government must do is ensure that those demands and those sacrifices are shared equitably. But what did we get in Victoria? We got a situation where the Victorian Government brought in legislation that is truly macabre. The details have been dealt with by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis). Let me say this: at the same time as the Government there is putting on regressive taxes and attacking the living standards of the average Victorian citizen, in the same breath, Government members gave themselves salary increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Gude, when asked on television, `What is the average wage of the average Victorian worker?', did not know. But he knew that he was about to get an increase. `Oh, yes', says the Victorian Premier, `we made a mistake in giving ourselves all those increases'. But his apology is a bit like the bank robber who says, `Look, I am sorry that I robbed the bank but I am going to keep the dough'. If there is to be any sacrifice, if there is to be any sharing of burdens, then the example has to come from the top. The example has not been set by the Victorian Parliament. The kind of political sleaze that was bandied around this House today by honourable members opposite has indicated that, whatever reservations they initially had about Mr Kennett's actions, they have now embraced them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time available I want to deal with this question of political mandate. Casting one's mind back to the Victorian election, the Labor Party and Mrs Kirner ran a series of advertisements in which they said, `Look, one of the things that Victorians have to worry about is the New Zealand model, the New Zealand example. That kind of industrial relations attitude will be introduced into Victoria'. What was the response of Mr Kennett and the Liberal Party on this issue? They produced a pamphlet, widely circulated, headed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Real Truth About Your Job.</PARA>
<PARA>It attacked what they described as `the Big Labor scare'. I will quote the slogan from it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What you have now, you keep.</PARA>
<PARA>The brochure said that under the coalition no person in employment would suffer any loss of award wages or conditions. And this is from a government that within a month banned holiday loadings and penalties in State awards, which will operate as the minimum safety net where there is no agreed employment contract. Mr Kennett was asked on radio on 25 September about his policy. I will quote from this man whom the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) now claims has a mandate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where they&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the employees&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">don't enter into an agreement on the contract, then their current conditions, all your shift work, all your penalty rates forms the basis for the new contract and therefore what you get today you keep, it's as simple as that.</PARA>
<PARA>If we are to believe this man, then how can he now say that he has a mandate for the political actions which he is adopting? How can the honourable member for Bennelong stand up in this House, act like a performing political prostitute and say, as he did today, that there was a mandate? The very same member, when he heard about it, immediately moved to distance himself from it. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 30 October, the honourable member for Bennelong said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal coalition's policy was to put the loading with weekend penalties and other conditions up for negotiation, "not to take it away unilaterally". </PARA>
<PARA>Let me repeat that: `not to take it away unilaterally'. On 30 October that was the position of the honourable member for Bennelong. He was supported in that to no little extent by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). Yet they were in here today having changed that position. Why? Because it was discussed in the Liberal Party and they were under attack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that any prudent employer&mdash;and there were employers protesting today&mdash;would understand and know that the one thing you cannot do is take industrial relations into the area of the criminal jurisdiction. Who is the employer&mdash;and I have been an employer&mdash;who wants to have the legal capacity to fine an employee up to $1,000 if he is late for work? It is a monstrous concept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These other concepts could have been the subject of negotiation, discussion and consultation, but they were not. They were the subject of discussion amongst the employers. A private firm of solicitors who had prepared this legislation for Mr Kennett as early as 25 August was running seminars at $300 an hour to tell employers what was going to be in the legislation. Having put itself in that privileged position&mdash;after all, I suppose it had to make some money because it had performed the job of drafting the legislation free for the Liberal Party&mdash;it felt that it was only proper that any person in the corporate sector who could afford to pay could get advance knowledge of what the Government had in mind. But there was no such advance knowledge for the trade union movement. </PARA>

Where is the honour in that? Where is the principle in that? At the end of the day, the people of Victoria as a community are capable of making economic sacrifice. They are capable of taking on existing and greater economic burdens, but they are not going to accept double standards, and this whole exercise is riddled with double standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have from the Opposition in this House today is a full endorsement not only of the legislation but of the dishonesty that was manifestly part of it&mdash;the breadth of any argument that there was some kind of mandate, a refusal to talk in a sensible and sensitive way with the working people of this community through their trade union leaders. The kind of venom and hatred which was shown in this House today to people who have been elected to office through their trade union leaders is a warning to the people of Australia. For all the glib talk of the honourable member for Bennelong, for all the attitudes shown by the Leader of the Opposition, the Liberal Party is a party of pain and penalty for the average working Australian and a party of privilege for its mates. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review found that there was a need to clarify the Council's role and functions. It found a need to improve communication of the Council's work. It suggested that the Council needed to be financially independent and that it should be staffed full time and located in Canberra. It recommended that there should be a minor adjustment to membership to better represent those with a direct investment in the industry, with associated interest groups being accommodated through working groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review also concluded that the industry needed to take a more strategic approach to securing its future. At the moment only about one per cent of domestic production is exported. Clearly, the future for the pig industry lies in developing an export orientation. The level of investment in technology in the industry needs to be increased, and greater efficiency and rationalisation in the processing sector achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review concluded that the Council would be in a better position to address these matters if it was brought under the Primary Industry Councils Act 1991. Under this Act provision is made for the establishment of a Council and the specification of its membership by amending the schedule to the Act. This Bill adds the Australian Pig Industry Council to the schedule and it is proposed that the new Council will begin its operations on 1 January 1993 or as soon as possible after that date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Besides the Chairperson, membership will include three persons nominated by the Pork Council of Australia, one person nominated from each of the Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia and the National Processors Association, and the chairpersons of each of the Australian Pork Corporation and the Pig Research and Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The anticipated operating costs of the Australian Pig Industry Council, which will be met by the Government, will be about $205,000 in a full year. The present Council is funded by industry levies paid to the Australian Pork Corporation. This arrangement is inconsistent with the principle of separating industry policy development from statutory marketing authority arrangements. Government funding will remove this dependency and will bring it into line with other industry council funding arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides for the termination of the Australian Pig Industry Policy Council and establishes transition arrangements for the orderly transfer to the Australian Pig Industry Council. These arrangements ensure that all outstanding liabilities at the date of commencement will be met by the Australian Pork Corporation. There is also a provision for the old Council to continue beyond the date of commencement for the sole purpose of preparing and submitting a final annual report to parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also amends the Pig Industry Act 1986 to recognise the Pork Council of Australia as the eligible representative producer body for the purposes of Australian Pork Corporation accountability and membership of the Australian Pork Corporation Selection Committee. The industry formed the Pork Council of Australia in March 1992 to supersede the Australian Pork Producers Federation as the sole nationally representative body of pig producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other amendment to the Primary Industry Councils Act provides for representation of the Food Committee of the Grocery Manufacturers of Australia Ltd on the Grains Industry Council. At present the Grocery Manufacturers of Australia Ltd is represented on the Grains Industry Council by its Chairman, as provided for in part 1 of the schedule to the Primary Industry Councils Act 1991. After introduction of that legislation the Grocery Manufacturers of Australia Ltd established a Food Committee, the membership of which includes major producers of grain based food products. It is more appropriate for this Committee, rather than manufacturers of grocery products generally, to be represented on the Grains Industry Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation Act 1977 and the Meat Research Corporation Act 1985 will change the requirements for passing motions at annual general meetings. Levy motions will now be passed on a simple majority on each of the appropriate registers. Currently it requires 75 per cent vote against a levy motion put by a corporation for it to be overturned. No-confidence motions will be passed by two-thirds of total votes cast. Additionally, at least 50 per cent of the votes cast on the two producer registers and 50 per cent of the votes cast on the processors register must be in favour of the motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will give effect to the Government's decision that levy motions at AGMs should be passed on a simple majority. This also has the support of the meat and livestock industry organisations. The new arrangements will ensure that any successful no-confidence motion, which represents a very serious step for the industry to take, is based on strong industry support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, this Bill will create an Australian Pig Industry Council that is responsive to the policy needs of the pig industry and is effective in coordinating policy input from all industry sectors to deliver an overall strategic policy direction for the benefit of the whole industry. In the case of the meat and livestock industry, AGM requirements give effect to both the Government and industry's desire to make voting requirements more democratic.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Health Insurance (Quality Assurance Confidentiality) Amendment Bill 1992 relates to the process of monitoring and improving of the quality of medical services provided. In essence what the Bill does is provide legislative protection from prosecution for those people undertaking QA activities&mdash;as they are called&mdash;and also to national projects and studies by medical colleges and suchlike which cover a number of States and Territories and, therefore, are outside the bounds of various current State legislation. It also provides statutory protection by making QA information confidential and grants immunity to quality assurance activities and committees which are declared to fall within that definition by the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say up-front that I am very disappointed about the amount of time that has been available for scrutinising the legislation since it was tabled in the House last week. Here we are, the following Tuesday, with a guillotine on, having an abbreviated debate. Obviously there has not been time for the general public or the interested organisations to scrutinise the legislation in its final form. This is ramrodding a piece of legislation, which is not without significance, through this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although we have some concerns, in essence we support the thrust of what the Bill tries to do&mdash;and that is, to improve the quality of care in Australia. However, we have some reservations about the way in which this is done. There are some unanswered questions about the Bill as it stands and also about regulations which might accompany the Bill in future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides, basically, that quality assurance activity is an assessment or a valuation of the quality of a health service, or a study of the incidence of causes of conditions or circumstances which may affect the quality of health services. There are a range of services which are identified as falling within the auspices of that definition. It can be declared a QA&mdash;quality assurance&mdash;activity because of the person doing it, because of the nature of the activity, or indeed because of the circumstances in which the activity is done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this Bill, information that comes to light as a result of these activities will be given statutory confidentiality. To fall under the auspices it must be in the public interest for the activity to receive statutory confidentiality and immunity protection, and a Minister must be satisfied that the person who is to engage in the activity is authorised by law&mdash;an educational, health professional or research institution or other prescribed body that may conduct the activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To offer the health professionals who are subjected to the QA activities some protection, the Bill prohibits the disclosure to anyone of any information collected as a result of those QA activities and prohibits the disclosure of that information, or relevant documents, to a court of law in general. There are some exceptions to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the concerns which have been raised in the brief time which people have had to peruse the Bill has come from some members of the medical profession. I have a lot of sympathy for their concerns, because if this is not legislated for correctly, this could turn into a potential star chamber. Some of their concerns do have some validity. Some have been dealt with adequately. There have been a number of drafts of this legislation in the past, although the Minister responsible has not had the courtesy to allow the Opposition to see them. I gather that as the drafts have come on some of the questions which have been raised have been addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One concern relates to immunity from suit&mdash;that is, that doctors will not have the right to sue. This is seen as a potential problem. However, the fact is that as long as the activity is entered into in good faith and there is no malice, those two requirements will address the problem raised by the doctors. There is immunity only if the laws of natural justice are followed, and it would seem that on this basis the potential for a star chamber-type approach may have been minimised. There are, therefore, excluding those definitions, many situations where suing can still take place, and indeed that is entirely appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern has been the question of public information disclosures. In essence, the public information is not disclosable to anybody or to any court but, as I said earlier, there are some exceptions. The Minister has discretion in some situations, in particular for serious offences. As I understand it, `serious offences' are defined as those offences which would carry a term of imprisonment of a year or more. There are going to be some regulations in terms of circumstances where the discretion of the Minister will be allowed to override some of these cases. Of course, as is always the case, those regulations are not available for us. I signal now that we will obviously scrutinise those regulations and, if they allow the Minister inappropriate powers, we will make sure they are disallowed. I am sure that we would have support for that in the other House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as we can tell, the Bill will have no impact on torts&mdash;cases where negligence is concerned, for example. I think it is fair to say that medical records, which are often the basis for cases in that category, do not fall under the auspices of this Bill since they were in existence prior to whatever the QA process might have been. Therefore, the concerns that these might be used inappropriately in this regard have been addressed, as far as we can tell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other issues from the States and I hope that some of these can be fixed during the passage of the Bill. Most of the States have expressed some concern to us that at present the quality assurance processes need approval by both the Commonwealth and the States. It would seem sensible for there to be some system of mutual recognition, rather than to duplicate, which is what will happen in many cases, that recognition process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another problem which I think needs to be addressed, and that is that there does seem to be a lack of appeal in terms of the peer review process. The peer review process, of course, does carry immunity. I think, therefore, that although there are some checks&mdash;the right of reply and natural justice need to be incorporated. In the short time available to us to scrutinise the Bill, we have not been able to satisfy ourselves that, in fact, there is an appropriate appeal mechanism. That is something which I hope the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) will address in his reply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other points which I think are worth making. One is the question of precedence. There are some precedents for this type of immunity. I understand that providing there is absence of malice, liquidators enjoy a qualified privilege in the performance of their duties, as do members of the Australian Broadcasting Authority and, of course, the Commonwealth, a Minister or any person acting with the authority of the ABA. I think it is also true to say that provisions within the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act mirror the provisions in this Bill even more closely by providing immunity to members of the Commission, provided their activities are in good faith, and prohibiting the disclosure of information obtained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the Opposition has concerns about the regulations, which are at present unseen, so although we will not oppose the Bill, we do reserve the right, in the first place, to look at those regulations when they are introduced. If they give the Minister inappropriate powers, we will move to disallow those. As I said, I believe we would have the support of the Australian Democrats in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that clearly needs to be signalled is that we will review this after the election. We will review the process and see whether it is working in the way in which it is intended to work. If it is, in fact, being utilised to create star chamber type approaches or inappropriate persecution of anybody, doctors or others, and it is not working to improve the overall standards of health care and medical services which are offered, then we will move to redress that particular problem and to ensure that the Act is either repealed or amended, as would be appropriate, depending on the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line for us is that there needs to be a balance. We support the thrust of encouraging quality assurance. It is a relatively new approach in many areas. It is covered by State legislation in the majority of States and there is therefore an element of duplication, but it is, of course, covered in terms of some of the activities which fall outside those particular pieces of State legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the bottom line is a balance between ensuring that there is a good quality of care, that quality assurance monitoring procedures are carried out in hospitals and other areas, and making sure that this is not used as a way of inappropriately pursuing, if you like, in particular members of the medical profession, but also others involved in offering health care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, therefore, we accept the Bill as it stands. Now that the Minister is actually at the table, I express our sadness that we were not allowed a sensible time to peruse the Bill; nor were we given access to the original draft legislation. It is typical of this Minister that he does not seek cooperative approaches in health issues. He has not been helpful in respect of this or any other Bill in terms of giving us access to it at an early time; nor in giving us access to the Department of Health and the officials and people who prepared the Bill. It is, of course, historically true that this has always been the case with this Minister and I think it is very sad that he is not able to pursue these matters in a constructive and cooperative way, but always seeks to try to induce confrontation and perhaps not necessarily constructive debate in these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that the Opposition will not divide on this particular Bill, but we will express reservations and concerns that it may not work in the way in which it is intended. I indicate therefore that we will review the legislation after the election when we are in government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), I am very pleased to see the Health Insurance (Quality Assurance Confidentiality) Amend-ment Bill introduced into the House, albeit without his reservations. I think that the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) and the people in his Department who have reached agreement in respect of this Bill have done a very good job. Quality assurance in the health area is an important aspect of consumer protection of people receiving assistance through the health system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill tries to balance three competing areas of interest. One is protection for professionals involved in quality assurance activities. The second is the protection of those people wishing to credential professionals and therefore leaving themselves open, without this sort of quality assurance and protection, to suits from their counterparts. The third is the question of the consumer right to information where, in fact, some negligence has occurred. It is therefore an area which needs very careful handling and I believe that the Bill has handled it carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ministerial discretion available in certain circumstances is necessary to achieve that public protection which we believe is required in situations where there has been blatant criminal negligence or other very serious risks to public health. As well, the confidentiality provisions contained in the Bill are necessary to secure the quite essential involvement of the professionals who, for the most part, want to see this sort of quality assurance legislation introduced. So it is a balance between ensuring quality of health care for the public good and protecting those professionals who wish to be involved in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill promotes the undertaking of a range of quality assurance activities by providing statutory protection in the form of confidentiality of quality assurance information and immunity to quality assurance activities and committees which are declared by the Minister. It provides the enabling statutory framework to complement State and Territory legislation, where it exists&mdash;and it does not exist in all States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we ask the question, what is quality assurance, it ought to be answered in the context that it is a formal and systematic exercise of identifying problems in health care delivery, designing activities to overcome the problems, and carrying out follow-up monitoring to ensure that no new problems have been introduced and that corrective steps have been effective. As honourable members will understand, doctors and other health care professionals within the health system would be unlikely to wish to expose their activities to such scrutiny without the substantive protection of the confidentiality provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to say that people have been negligent but, rather, that an error has been made. The information provided by health care professionals will assist patients within the health care system to achieve better treatment in the future; therefore reducing costs to the community and to the country in personal terms, health terms and dollar terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill encourages rigorous clinical audits and mortality and morbidity reviews necessary to gain a true understanding of the factors which contribute to adverse patient outcomes. To participate in these activities, health officials must be confident that the information obtained in such processes will not later be misconstrued and used against them. The Bill assists these processes by making information obtained solely as a consequence of the quality assurance activity confidential. Of course, it will still be possible for consumers of health care services to access other sources of information, but they will not be able to access information revealed in the context of the quality assurance committee meetings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also facilitates other quality assurance activities, such as credentialling. The purpose of credentialling is to ensure that the treatments, procedures and surgery undertaken by individual health care professionals are only those that they are competent to perform. For instance, in the United States of America, credentialling is almost universal in hospitals, but in Australia it has been stymied by the fear of those who sit on credentialling committees that they will be sued by those who do not accept the outcome of the committee's deliberations. This is a very real problem in the Australian context, where we wish to have that sort of peer review, if you like, of a person's capabilities to operate within the area of health care that they are involved in. There may be a number of reasons why their peers may consider them not competent any longer to deal in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Royal Australasian College of Surgeons is to be congratulated on its recent determination that surgical credentialling ought to be happening in all hospitals. This Bill will facilitate the implementation of that particular recommendation. There is widespread support amongst medical practitioners and consumers alike for open, positive and voluntary participation in quality assurance activities to prevent adverse patient outcomes and raise the quality of health care delivery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quality assurance has become a major concern of the Australian health care sector over the last two decades. Although by world standards the quality of Australian health care is extremely high, it is generally understood that health care consumers can suffer adverse outcomes from health services. Some of these are known and accepted risks of certain procedures and treatments, even when these procedures and treatments are expertly performed. The key to this legislation is that in the main we are dealing with situations where there may be problems occurring in a procedure which doctors and surgeons may wish to acquaint their colleagues with, but would be afraid to do without this sort of confidentiality being provided because it would leave them open to some sort of action by the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of Australian hospital separation data, it is estimated that between 95,000 and 150,000 avoidable adverse patient outcomes occurred in 1991. This represents between 3.3 and 5.3 per cent of all hospital separations. The cost of the extra duration of stay in hospital, even if it is only five days, is between $143m and $225m. It is certainly not a small amount of money that is involved. The House would be well advised to consider the personal cost to consumers in terms of their future health and security as well as their confidence in the health system. Given the obviously huge costs of adverse patient outcomes to both the health system as a whole and the individuals concerned, prevention should be given the highest priority, and that is what this Bill does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some concern in the Caucus committee about this matter. For instance, I think the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) has a view on this Bill which is now resolved. He was concerned about the question of consumer sovereignty and the ability of consumers to pursue an action against those people who had negligently performed their duty as health professionals. He has since been convinced that the Minister's intentions are correct and that the quality assurance legislation is necessary in the quest to improve our health care system and to open it to some scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The scrutiny that we need to open it to in the first instance is definitely that of other professionals to allow them to learn from the mistakes of their colleagues. The whole question of quality assurance in Australia is one that definitely needs undertaking. I congratulate the Minister and the people in his Department who have brought this legislation to the House today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) and the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) for their contributions to this debate on the Health Insurance (Quality Assurance Confidentiality) Amendment Bill 1992. Essentially the purpose of this legislation is to enable quality assurance activities to have the protection of Commonwealth legislation. It will provide a very important protection or immunity to enable these activities to take place with a recognition of the importance of confidentiality, as the honourable member for Cowan has mentioned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is extremely important that we are able to develop a process which means that we can investigate the quality of the interventions that take place within the hospital system and within medical situations and that people feel they can participate in those quality assurance activities without feeling some uncertainty about what protection they have. While there is some existing State and Territory legislation, essentially the Commonwealth has taken the advice of a number of the professional groups that we ought to act at the Commonwealth level. There has been considerable support from the profession and from the colleges for the Commonwealth to act and to become involved in terms of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One reason for that involvement is that, at least in some States, adequate legislation is not in place. This is an area in which it is important that we have a national approach. We have been able to learn some lessons from those States where effective legislation has been in place, such as in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. When the States adopted their legislation they were delving into uncharted waters and were unable to predict events which occurred after the legislation became operative. One weakness in the legislation of these States is that it does not allow for the disclosure of aggregated and non-identifying information. For example, if the quality assurance committee in a large teaching hospital amasses considerable data about standards of care, it cannot be released even in a non-identifying form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By comparison, the Commonwealth Bill has been drafted to make confidential only that information which would directly or indirectly identify either the health care provider or the patient. Consequently, activities authorised under the Commonwealth Bill will permit the disclosure of data which can then be used in a very public sense to improve the quality of health care. This area goes to issues of records and issues of information. This is important not only because of the individuals who might be involved but also because of the value that can be obtained from aggregate data. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another reason why Commonwealth legislation is appropriate is a concern that State legislation cannot prevent the disclosure of confidential information in the Federal Court. This has been an issue of concern for St Vincents Hospital in Sydney. In considering having its quality assurance committee authorised by the New South Wales legislation, St Vincents Hospital sought legal advice as to the capacity of the New South Wales legislation to protect information in Federal Court proceedings. The advice provided was that only Commonwealth legislation can prevent the disclosure of confidential information under subpoenas issued in the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final reason why Commonwealth legislation is appropriate is the change in attitudes within the health sector to credentialling. Credentialling is the process by which the clinical privileges of individual health care providers are determined. The purpose of credentialling is to make sure that only those who are appropriately qualified can carry out particular procedures or surgery. In particular, the credentialling of surgeons in hospitals is highly desirable. Credentialling of surgeons is in fact widespread in North America, but it is only just starting to happen in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One reason why credentialling is not common in Australian hospitals is the fear that health care professionals who participate on credentialling committees may be personally liable if an individual professional chooses to sue the committee for its decisions. The Royal Australasian College of Surgeons recently resolved its position on surgical standards in hospitals. A key element of that position is the statement that credentialling should occur in all surgical departments. This Bill will provide a framework within which health professionals, particularly the medical profession, can develop effective credentialling. The Bill will provide immunity to health professionals who participate in credentialling committees in certain circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerns have been expressed that credentialling will result in witch-hunts and arbitrary and unfair decisions which restrict the clinical privileges of individual practitioners. The Commonwealth is not attempting to impose credentialling on health professionals, nor is it attempting to mandate how credentialling should occur. These matters are for the professions themselves to resolve. However, the Bill will protect professionals who participate in credentialling in good faith when the process adopted is a fair one. The effect of the Bill is that protections will not be available unless those professionals who have been credentialled have been provided with procedural fairness. Procedural fairness is a lawyers' term of art, but it translates roughly into the right to know the substance of any concerns, the right to respond to those concerns and the right to a fair and unbiased hearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is possible to put in place appeal requirements for credentialling activities. As one of our criteria for ensuring that the granting of protection is in the public interest, the medical profession and State governments are to be consulted on this and other regulations. The concern of the honourable member for Lowe in this area can be addressed. In the process of regulations, there will be, as there has been in the preparation of this Bill, quite wide consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Bill has the support that it has from the colleges and the medical profession generally because they understand that these measures are part of a process of providing greater protection to the profession from unnecessary litigation. The Government has in mind that we should carry out a very extensive process to see, ultimately, whether we can deal with litigation, which has become an extremely important issue in this country. What occurs in this country is relatively insubstantial compared with the massive costs associated with litigation in countries such as the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is part of a process of reform that is built on very substantial investigation, research and inquiry. Publications have already come out of that process which indicate the options for continuing reform. There will be further development of strategy papers. Those papers will be public and there will be the opportunity for further consultation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Medicare Agreements Bill, a very important Bill and one of the foundations of our whole health system, has been available for the coalition and other interested parties to peruse for only a few days. This is the sort of Bill that should be on the table for weeks, if not months, to be debated at length, to be discussed and to be evaluated by people of all walks of life, from all parties, with all interest groups.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a national disgrace that a Bill as important as this, which will form the foundation of our health system for the next five years, should be skimmed through under the guillotine, with no debate&mdash;particularly when there is no need to do so. There is no deadline; the current Medicare legislation does not need to be renewed until July next year. We have plenty of time to leave this Bill on the table, to evaluate it carefully over the next few months, and then to debate it formally, perhaps in March or April next year, still leaving plenty of time for any complementary legislation which might need to be put in place. That would mean that the Bill would be superfluous, because I presume that by then there will have been an election and the whole Bill will be irrelevant anyway. I am sure that has not escaped the attention of the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been very little debate and discussion on the principles of the Bill. We were presented with this Bill with only a few days notice. It is a fairly comprehensive Bill, involving important matters of principle, and there has not even been an attempt at a bipartisan approach. I have to agree, as I am sure the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) will point out, that the likelihood of agreement on many of the issues in a bipartisan fashion was not that good, but at least in some of the issues we could have attempted to reach some understanding and improve the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Government, the motivation for this Bill is to ensure national policy consistency in the delivery of health services in Australia. Effectively, it sets out the legislative framework under which the individual State Medicare agreements will be negotiated and moneys appropriated. It enshrines the so-called Medicare principles and commitments about public hospital service delivery which the States must agree to before they receive financial assistance from the Commonwealth. States must also pass complementary legislation and agree to the development of a public patients hospital charter. Ostensibly, the principles and commitments are to improve public patient access to hospital services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill supports the negotiations which are occurring with each of the States at present by which the Commonwealth enters into Medicare agreements with those States for a five-year period commencing on 1 July next year. The agreement must satisfy the points detailed in `Heads of Agreements' at schedule 2A to the Bill, which states that the funding will be used, amongst other things, to provide for public hospital services; to encourage more effective provision of health services; to provide for the States to give Commonwealth statistical information; and to provide for the States to establish a public patients hospital charter. That charter should be distributed to the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides that financial assistance will not be payable unless an agreement has been signed. The five components of the financial assistance payable will be a base funding hospital grant, a hospital bonus payment, a hospital incentive package, a mental health incentive package and other health services funding. Financial assistance will not be payable unless the States give effect, or make reasonable attempts to give effect, to a series of Medicare principles and commitments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those commitments and principles include the choice to receive public hospital services free of charge and access to public hospitals on the basis of clinical need. To the maximum practical extent, the States will ensure the provision of public hospital services to all persons, regardless of geographical location. We have no problem with the principles of some of those. We believe very strongly that eligible people should be given the choice to receive public hospital services free of charge as public patients. We have always stated that access to a public hospital should be on the basis of clinical need. We believe that sorting out the geographical problems that many people have is a major initiative which the Government should undertake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the commitments associated with the legislation is that information must be made available on public hospital services which eligible patients can expect to receive. I believe that refers to the development of the public patients hospital charter. The second commitment is that both the Commonwealth and the States are committed to making improvements in the efficiency, effectiveness and quality of health services delivery. I understand that that focuses on the provision of public hospital services to eligible persons and operates in an environment in which those people have the right to choose private health care in public and private hospitals, supported by private health insurance. That is the only mention of the private health sector. This is one of the problems. I will come back to that a little later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a requirement that there should be an independent complaints body. Most of the States already meet that criterion. The agreements may be varied with the consent of both parties. If it is a significant variation, it must be approved by both Houses of parliament. This clause was clearly included in anticipation of a government defeat at the next election, in an attempt to make life difficult for us should the Democrats start to be bloody minded about some of these issues. They have indicated that they may have some differing views from those of the coalition in these regards. However, we will get around that as we have to face it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill relates to the negotiations between the Commonwealth and States about the new Medicare agreements which, as I am sure most honourable members are aware, have basically been a complete failure. The only State that I am aware of which has signed to date is Western Australia. Even Western Australia has only signed under duress because it has an election coming up in February. It has been pushed into signing this Bill, even though on many occasions Minister Keith Wilson, the State Labor Minister in Western Australia, has said how disastrously bad the Medicare system is in its current running. He said that there would be `dire consequences'. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The truth is that Hospital Medicare is not the fair and just system that it promised to be and has not been since its inception . . . It is quite outrageous of the Commonwealth to make a song and dance about hospital efficiency when it is perpetrating the most inefficient and ramshackle funding system one could imagine.</PARA>
<PARA>Elsewhere he suggested that the Minister might face up to the realities. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Medicare is meant to provide the least well off access to good care, yet there are long waiting lists.</PARA>
<PARA>This includes pensioners desperate for hip replacements. He also said that Medicare is not working and the main reason is that the Commonwealth is refusing to fund it adequately. The important question, following on from those sorts of comments, and there are many more, is: does this Bill and the associated agreements fix up the problem of funding? As I will come to later on, not only does it not fix it up; it makes it a lot worse than it is at present, and that is bad enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A $1.6 billion so-called incentives package was announced in the Budget, which the Minister claimed would reform State public hospitals. That package is partly funded by the increase in the Medicare levy, from 1.25 per cent to 1.4 per cent as of 1 July. The other major features of that package included $70m over two years for a hospital access program to reduce public hospital waiting lists. I have pointed out elsewhere that if the Minister really wanted to get rid of waiting lists and treated them on the current costings available, he would have to have about a quarter of a billion dollars put into public hospitals to get rid of them. Whichever way we do it, either by increasing resources in public hospitals or by transferring those patients into the private system, $70m over two years&mdash;that is, $35m a year&mdash;is a drop in the ocean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a $1.2 billion bonus incentive package over five years for State hospitals to increase the proportion of public patients. It effectively states that a higher proportion of those public patients will receive greater funding. If we reduce that to the per annum amount allocated, it is somewhere over $200m per year. As I will indicate in a moment, each of the major States&mdash;Victoria and New South Wales, in the first place&mdash;indicates that just to maintain the status quo they need $200m-plus. For New South Wales the figure is closer to $300m. Yet, here we have $200m-plus being given to the whole country each year. Clearly that is not going to address any of the problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The allocation formula used is such that it will mean that a sizeable proportion of the population will face even worse difficulties than they are facing at present. Let us make no bones about it, the waiting list at present is approximately 90,000, as far as we can determine. There are between 75,000 and 100,000 people on the waiting lists, mainly for elective surgery. That is almost entirely related to the lack of funding from the Commonwealth. These waiting lists have increased dramatically since the advent of Medicare. Waiting lists were never mentioned as a major problem prior to the advent of Medicare, and it is a question of the funding restrictions which this Government has imposed upon the public hospitals. If that is the problem the Government has for funding constraints, and it is using Medicare as a way of capping costs&mdash;clearly that is what happens because the Minister boasts so often when travelling around the country that the total costs of Medicare are kept at 8 per cent or 8.1 per cent of GDP&mdash;then, effectively, it is a rationing system. The price we pay for that rationing system is waiting lists. Waiting lists are a deliberate ploy of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is the problem, we have two ways of fixing it. There is a third way, of course, which is to improve the efficiency and, although the Government claims to be doing that, there is very little evidence that that is in fact occurring. Apart from improvements in efficiency there are two ways of addressing the difficulties of funding: either by increasing taxes, which is what the Government has chosen to do by bumping up the Medicare levy, or by encouraging people to put their own money into health. Encouraging people to put their own money into health is a more efficient way of allocating resources. It is something which will be more acceptable to the population. Clearly, we need to give people incentives to take out private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to go through a whole list of quotes again. Let me simply say that Keith Wilson, Maureen Lister and Carmen Lawrence have all indicated that the balance between the public and private sectors is inappropriate. The honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil), as I am sure the Minister is aware, urged the Minister to reconsider his approach to private health insurance and to adopt the coalition policy in this regard, which is to give financial incentives to take out private health insurance, something which I somehow suspect the Minister will not adopt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line in giving incentives is that major financial inputs can be put into the system. Every now and then the Minister complains that we are putting money into the pockets of rich private insurers, implying somehow that they just pocket the money and it does not get through into the health system where, by and large, all health insurers do is pay people who are insured when they go into hospital. Clearly the money goes into both public and private hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition policy will be to move, conservatively, a million people into the private health insurance arena. If we assume, in round and conservative terms, that they are each spending about $1,000, then we are looking at putting $1 billion into health without raising taxes, of which something like 50 per cent goes to the public hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the Minister's colleagues are telling a few fibs about us and saying that we are reducing the funding to public hospitals. They put in a few qualifications and choose their words very carefully, but, in essence, they wander around the country saying that we are going to cut public hospital funding. The consequence of that, which they sometimes go on to mention&mdash;the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) is particularly guilty in this regard of spreading these pieces of information&mdash;is that hospital beds will close and jobs will be lost. The fact is, of course, that we are absolutely increasing the funding. </PARA>

That is the information which is available to the public, the public has assessed it, and all reputable assessments have indicated that the amount going to public and private hospitals will increase by about half a billion dollars each. Yet the Minister still wanders around the country spreading misrepresentations and exaggerations about the coalition health policy, after every reputable health economist has said that this will lead to a resurrection of public hospitals. The States are clamouring for us to do just that. They are clamouring for the Minister to do it, and he has turned them down. His own State of Western Australia and the State of Victoria prior to the election were saying this. Every State in the country is saying, `Please encourage people to take out private health insurance'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has an ideological block about private health insurance. In this agreement the Minister cannot even accept the amendment put forward by some of the States, just to acknowledge that private health insurance, the private sector, has a role to play. He mentioned this in the preamble; that is all. A statement is needed to ensure that people have a right to utilise private health insurance in public hospitals. Is the Minister somehow suggesting that private patients should not be allowed in public hospitals? That seems to be the implication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is the case, is the Government going to fund the shortfall? Clearly it is not. It is talking about something like the same sorts of amounts of money raised into the hospital system by private patients as the Medicare levy, so the sequitur from that is presumably that the Government is going to double the Medicare levy. If that is the Government's secret plan, then let us have a look at it: put it on the table and we will examine it. If that is the case, then clearly we need to know about it so that we can debate it openly and in the public arena. What the Government is clearly doing is putting some little gesture&mdash;$200m&mdash;into the bonus incentive package over 5 years. Two hundred million dollars is not going to address the current problems let alone the future problems. Even if that were distributed in a fair and equitable way there would still be major problems with waiting lists and public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly the Government's agenda seems to be to run down public hospitals even more, because if that were not the case it would be either allocating money via private health insurance or it would be allocating money by bumping up the Medicare levy. It looks like the Government's secret agenda is to increase the levy even more. The Minister's predecessor gave an undertaking that the levy would not be increased, but here we are in this Bill, and in the next Bill, looking at just that. The Government has got around it slightly by saying, `We will leave it to July and that will be after this Parliament'. The good thing, of course, is that that will be after the election so it will never come in.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendment which is required, and which the Minister has turned down, is this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Eligible persons have the right to choose health care in public and private hospitals supported by private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister refused to allow that to be part of the legislation. Indeed, he has refused to allow it to be part of the individual agreements with the States. I do not understand what the Minister is complaining about. I often do not understand what he is complaining about, and neither do a lot of other people in this place or, indeed, in his own Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of issues which we really need to address. If the Minister would just keep quiet for a few minutes and allow me to address them in a sensible fashion, I would be happy to look at them to see what we can do to resolve them. Another concern with the proposed legislation is that it enables the enshrining of principles of Medicare agreements on the eve of seeking to implement a third Medicare agreement in isolation from other aspects of Medicare and other Commonwealth health programs. It contains a proposal for a public patient's hospital charter but has no reference to the other services available to the people of Australia under Medicare, including their right to retain the doctor of their choice if they elect to be a private patient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It fundamentally changes the whole basis on which financial assistance is provided to the States. This makes financial assistance to the States contingent upon complementary State legislation. The Commonwealth requirement for complementary legislation in many cases includes areas already covered in some States; for example, the independent complaints mechanism. It is really inappropriate for the Commonwealth to dictate to the States on many of those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation does not make any commitment to the development of a joint Commonwealth-State national health policy, as suggested by the States and Territories in Adelaide, which the Minister has conveniently ignored. It seems to be another attempt by the Federal Government to dismiss the very real concerns of States and Territories that the current delivery of health services in Australia occurs in a policy vacuum&mdash;despite the findings of the national health strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Financial assistance to the States is divided into those five separate components which I mentioned earlier. Each one of those requires separate administration and separate reporting requirements. It is contrary to the stated intent of all governments at previous fora to reduce the number of separately identified payment and reporting systems. It is contrary to the intent of the broad banding proposals contained in the proposed draft Medicare proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also includes a mental health incentives package despite the Australian Health Ministers Council having adopted a national mental health policy and agreeing in principle to an implementation plan subject to an appropriate allocation of Commonwealth funding. It introduces for the very first time the notion of some hospital services being funded directly by the Commonwealth, and extends beyond hospital services to other health services. There are a number of major issues in the legislation which really do need to be debated in detail not only in this place but in the other fora around the country by people who have an interest in the health area. This is the foundation stone for what the Government wants to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me at this point signal that we will oppose the Bill and we will, if appropriate, before the third reading if because of this terrible guillotine we do not have a committee stage&mdash;and obviously depending upon the result of the opposition to the Bill&mdash;have the amendments circulated in my name incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. They fix up at least some of the problems in this Bill, although it is second best to wiping out the whole Bill and starting again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the issues we really have to address is the question of the money. I have already indicated in general terms that the bonus payments offered are a nonsense in terms of improving the quality of services offered in the public system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at Victoria. The current problem in Victoria relates to reduced Commonwealth assistance, increasing costs and declining numbers of privately insured people due to the barriers put in the way of private health insurance by the ideologues in the current Labor Government, of whom the Minister clearly is one. There are close to 30,000 Victorians on waiting lists. Each year 65,000 Victorians fall out of private health insurance. That means that an extra 4,500 patients move into the state system every week, and they cost an extra $207m over the period in question. Eight years ago the Commonwealth contributed 55 per cent of State public hospital funding. Last year it was down to 42 per cent. The Minister cannot possibly challenge those figures. Clearly, the Commonwealth's share of hospital funding is falling; that is also true in New South Wales and, I understand, in most other States too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation discriminates clearly against both Victoria and New South Wales. If we look at the effects of the allocation formula for the bonus payments described in this Bill, which on the face of it might seem quite attractive, we can see that the two major States, New South Wales and Victoria, are seriously adversely affected. As a result of the increase in the Medicare levy, New South Wales will raise somewhat over $100m. Penalties associated with the sources of income represent some $21m. About $288m is going into the bonus pool, and the incentives package takes some $78m. But, when we look at the way that is distributed, because of the ratio of public to private patients in New South Wales and Victoria, New South Wales and Victoria will actually finish up worse off than they are at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The distribution on the basis of the agreements as they stand at present means that New South Wales will lose $104m each year and Victoria will lose $127m each year. South Australia will lose $9m and the ACT will lose $3m. The winners are Western Australia&mdash;which is one of the reasons why it has signed the package, of course&mdash;Queensland, which gains $69m, Tasmania with $18m and the Northern Territory with $37m. An amount of $87m remains in the penalty pool; the Commonwealth has $15m and unallocated is $14m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we put these figures into the broader context of the five-year package, they are horrifying because it means that public hospitals in New South Wales and Victoria&mdash;60 per cent of the health system&mdash;will be severely penalised. Over the five years New South Wales will lose $544m. Victoria will do even worse; it will lose $711m. These are figures from the Department of Health in New South Wales. There is no doubt that they are accurate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is little wonder that the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) has filled his presentation this evening with such fabrications and misrepresentations about the Government's agenda in this Medicare Agreements Bill. He has been pedalling backwards at 1,000 miles an hour away from his own policies. I am not surprised because, in his travels around this country pursuing his own policies, he has found that the vast majority of Australians reject the Opposition's package. They are rejecting it soundly, and they will reject it at the next Federal election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Health will be a very important issue at the next Federal election. That is because the Australian people overwhelmingly support the Government's Medicare policies and programs, overwhelmingly support the retention of Medicare, and overwhelmingly reject what the Opposition has to offer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal with a couple of the fabrications and the misrepresentations that were in the presentation from the honourable member for Lowe. He tried to reject the fact that his own Party's Fightback policy clearly espouses an intention to slash 5 per cent across the board from all State allocations. Health is a very important part of the allocation of moneys to the States. Those opposite should understand the fact that, if they were to slash 5 per cent across the board, that would have a major impact on States' capacities to fund their public hospital systems. No matter how much the honourable member for Lowe tries to back-pedal on that, it is clear in black print in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>. Everybody has read it and everybody knows it. The State governments know it, and they do not want a bar of Fightback because they know exactly what would happen to them if we ever had the unfortunate situation of having those opposite elected to government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important issue is about the amount of money that will be allocated to the public hospital system. The honourable member for Lowe also failed to outline the fact that there is an $8 billion difference between what this Government is prepared to provide to public hospitals and to health care over the next five years and what the coalition is providing in Fightback. That $8 billion difference would have a major impact on all of the issues that the honourable member for Lowe has been outlining as issues of concern. He was pouring out crocodile tears, worrying about waiting lists. Not one step and not one element of the coalition's Fightback policy will have any positive impact on waiting lists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the legislation that we have in the package of proposals that was outlined in the Federal Budget, we see that this Government has a real commitment to dealing with the waiting lists. Additional funds are being provided to each State government to tackle that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the coalition's policies, as espoused by the honourable member for Lowe, will lead to a direct transference of money out of the public hospital system and into the pockets of those people in this country who can afford private health insurance, which is only about 40 per cent of the population, and a direct transference of about half a billion dollars into private health insurance funds. That transference of money into the pockets of those people who can afford private health insurance and to the private health funds will not do one single thing to reduce waiting lists in public hospitals. It will do not one thing to improve the efficiency of public hospitals. It will not do one thing to provide one extra bed or one piece of equipment to public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has a very strong commitment to the public hospital system, and that is emphasised by this legislation. The provision of health care services to all Australians under Medicare is the single most important feature of our health system. It forms a fundamental part of this Government's commitment to social justice. Medicare was established in 1984 so that all people, regardless of their location, age or health status, and particularly regardless of their financial status, could enter the health care system as equals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Medicare is based on the five principles of universality, access, equity, efficiency and simplicity. It has proved to be an outstanding success&mdash;and I think that is the thing that galls the honourable member for Lowe the most&mdash;in keeping expenditure on health at a level that Australians can afford without compromising these fundamental principles. The Medicare agreements to be established under this Bill introduce reforms to our hospital system that will build on the foundations of Medicare to make it more flexible and responsive, to focus on consumers and to sustain the Australian health care system into the next century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Medicare Agreements Bill before the House seeks to achieve four main objectives. They are: firstly, to provide a funding guarantee to the States and Territories for the life of the agreement by a special appropriation; secondly, to enshrine the principles and commitments of Medicare in Commonwealth legislation, and to require steps towards complementary legislation by States and Territories; thirdly, to establish some minimum conditions for payment to States and Territories under the Medicare agreements, including signing an agreement, developing a public patients hospital charter and agreeing to adopt, or to make attempts to adopt, the principles and commitments in complementary legislation; and, finally, to establish the structure and framework of the new Medicare agreements for the five-year period 1993-94 to 1997-98. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Medicare principles and commitments are a statement of the fundamental elements of an effective and equitable health care system. The Medicare principles and commitments set the framework for the agreements and the operation of the bonus and incentive payments. They are designed to be adopted as guidelines for the delivery of public hospital services to public patients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principles and commitments have been developed in consultation with the States, and the wording reflects State suggestions. While the principles focus on the provision of public hospital services to eligible persons, it is acknowledged that they operate in an environment where eligible people have the right to choose private health care in public and private hospitals supported by private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the proposed amendments of the honourable member for Lowe. He suggests in one of his amendments that we should include as a fourth principle eligible persons having the right to choose health care in public and private hospitals supported by private health insurance. That is already outlined in the preamble to the Bill. But the honourable member for Lowe seems to ignore the fact that this is a Bill about funding public hospitals, about the distribution of public funds to support public hospitals in this country. It is not appropriate to espouse a commitment to private health insurance or private hospitals in the principles about Medicare and the public hospital system, and that is why this particular amendment by the honourable member for Lowe will be rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be noted that, although the honourable member for Lowe tried to indicate that there is some poor attempt here by the Government to steamroll States and Territories in this matter, in fact this suggestion to include this part in the preamble was made by the Northern Territory Minister for Health, Daryl Manzie. It was his suggestion, and it was supported by the other States, that it be included in the preamble. It was not supported that it should be included as another principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one actually looks at what is happening with the negotiations, despite the comments by the honourable member for Lowe that certain States have been placed under duress and all sorts of threats are occurring, in fact very successful negotiations are occurring with six of the eight States and Territories. The fact that two of the States are posturing for their own personal political purposes does not mean that they will not eventually come to the party, because they recognise that what this Government is offering in this Bill is a far better deal than what those opposite will be offering. That is why they will be prepared to sign this agreement and get the flow of funds from the Commonwealth through to the States and into the public hospital system: they know they will get a far better deal from a Labor government than from any coalition government about public hospitals and public health care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us deal with the bipartisan question. The fact is that Liberal governments in this country&mdash;State Liberal governments and State Liberal-National Party governments&mdash;are supporting the Medicare agreements. Honourable members will find that by the end of this year all State and Territory governments will be supportive of this because they know they will get a much better deal from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the three principles which are important to this Bill. The first principle is that eligible persons must be given the choice to receive public hospital services free of charge as public patients. The second principle in this Bill is that access to public hospital services is to be on the basis of clinical need. Of course, that is not disputed by the Opposition. The third principle is that to the maximum practicable extent a State will ensure the provision of public hospital services equitably to all eligible persons, regardless of their geographical location. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are three very important principles. They articulate the concepts of choice, equity and access in public hospital service delivery. They give expression to the security that every Australian resident is looking for in our public hospital system, and they are the reason that our health system is so much better than that of other nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is also a very important point. It is in fact to the Australian health system that President-elect Clinton is looking to see whether he can adopt our important principles into the Medicare system for the United States, because the Australian health system under Medicare is recognised around the world as one of the best health systems that can be provided. It will be interesting to see the coalition's response when the United States starts to adopt some of our policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also outlines the broad conditions for funding that will apply to the Medicare agreements. The most fundamental of these is that receipt of funds is conditional upon signature of the Medicare agreements. These conditions include taking steps towards passage of State and Territory legislation that is complementary to the Commonwealth Bill and will enshrine the Medicare principles and commitments. Under the Medicare agreement both levels of government will undertake to implement the principles and commitments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth does not expect the States to implement the principles and commitments alone, but to recognise that both levels of government have an interest and duty to maintain our public hospital services and to ensure that public patients get the most comprehensive and fairest health service possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of this provision involves the delivery of information to eligible public patients. This is reflected in the first commitment, which requires the joint Commonwealth and State development of a public patients hospital charter. The Commonwealth's vision for such a charter is that it will be a plain English guide to what Australian residents can reasonably expect as public hospital patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth does recognise that immediate passage of complementary State and Territory legislation may not be possible in some States despite the best endeavours of governments. It is for this reason that the Bill allows some scope for definition in the agreements of what constitutes reasonable efforts towards adoption of the principles and commitments in the legislation. But most State and Territory governments, including the New South Wales Government, do agree with the public patients charter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second commitment encompasses efficiency and quality in public hospital service delivery. This is one of the priorities of the Bill and Medicare agreements and will be supported by the incentive package reforms. These reforms include continuing the development and implementation of Casemix systems in hospital service delivery, ensuring elective surgery for public patients is organised efficiently and fairly, and investigating with the States and Territories better ways of developing capital strategic plans for hospitals and providing hospital services that meet local needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is particularly important for me as the member for Moreton because within my electorate I have three hospitals, with a fourth major public hospital very close by. So the provision of public hospital services is very important to my constituency, and I certainly welcome this agreement because I know that for the residents of my electorate and the residents of Queensland the additional financial support provided in this Bill to the Queensland Government will very largely improve its capacity to provide top quality public health care to all residents of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not achieve this level of reform without the States and Territories. Improvement in our public hospital services involves Commonwealth, State and Territory commitment of effort and money. I also know that the Queensland Government has already indicated its intention to commit additional funds through the establishment of the additional tobacco levy. A lot of those moneys will be provided to the public hospital sector in Queensland and will complement the additional funds being provided by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth is providing a funding increase of approximately 7 per cent over the base hospital funding grants to make our public hospital services more efficient and effective. This legislation will demonstrate to the Australian public that both levels of government are committed to excellence in health care. Indeed, since 1984 the Labor Government has developed a model of equitable and technologically advanced public hospital care. From 1993 this Government intends to build upon this solid achievement and remain responsive to the future health needs of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by reinforcing the point I made at the beginning: this Bill is an important Bill for public health in this country. It complements our previous work in Medicare. It goes a long way towards ensuring that Medicare stays a permanent feature of Australia's public health system. This is very strongly supported by the vast majority of Australians. Australians recognise that through Medicare since 1984 they have had a fair, equitable service available to all Australians regardless of income level. They recognise that Medicare is a very important part of the Labor Government's social justice policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians will reject totally the coalition's policies on health. They are already doing so. That is why the honourable member for Lowe, as the shadow health spokesman, is back-pedalling so rapidly, avoiding discussion about his own policies, avoiding concentration on some of the features of Fightback and their adverse impacts on health care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must realise that in Australia the Labor Government, and the next Labor Government, will continue to fund health care to the tune of $8 billion more than the coalition offers. I think all Australians need to be aware of that figure. The coalition is offering an $8 billion slash over the next five years to public health care in this country. This Government is committed to increasing the provision of health care over the next five years to the tune of $1.3 billion more than it currently provides. I believe that this Bill is worthy of support, and that this Government is worthy of re-election for its health policies alone. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) pointed out in debate yesterday that it is not our wish that the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 1992 and the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 be debated cognately, but the Government has ruthlessly applied the guillotine. To get even a cursory examination of what it proposes, we have had to go along with it. It is just another example of the executive imperialism we find under Labor in Canberra these days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) makes a number of changes to those provisions of the tax law dealing with occupational clothing, dividend streaming arrangements, the taxation of limited partnerships and the prescribed payments system. Amendments are also made to the gift provisions and the exemption from income tax of the family payment advance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bills seek to deny the deductibility of expenses incurred in the purchase of certain corporate uniforms or wardrobes that are non-compulsory in nature. Under these proposed amendments, employees will only be able to deduct expenses incurred in purchasing and maintaining uniforms or corporate wardrobes where the wearing of this clothing is expressly required by the employer as a condition of employment. The Bills signal the intention of the Labor Government to tighten up the extent of the deductibility available for corporate wardrobes and uniforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although deductibility will still be available for non-compulsory uniforms and wardrobes, the Australian Taxation Office is in the process of developing strict guidelines to establish whether tax deductions will be allowed in particular cases. These guidelines will, however, be published after this Bill receives royal assent, once again conferring discretion on the Commissioner rather than on this Parliament, the legislature of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will be moving an amendment to the Bill in the committee stage to give effect to its proposal. In other words, the Bill before us is hot off the press and already the Government is proposing an amendment. The amendment and amended amendment reflect the considerable pressure the Government has been under from certain manufacturers and textile, clothing and footwear council members, which saw the original legislation as a major threat to the profitability of some. In addition, the commencement of these measures is to be pushed back from the originally intended date until 1 July 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments proposed pose a number of problems in the context of the self-assessment of income tax, even if one supports the Government's policy objectives in this matter. These problems arise from the fact that, while it is the employee who is denied the relevant deductions in the circumstances set out in the Bill, it is the employer who must satisfy the relevant criteria for the existence of either compulsory or non-compulsory uniform or corporate wardrobe in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A self-assessing taxpayer may have great difficulty in establishing whether his employer has satisfied all the necessary conditions to be laid down. The circumstances in which an employee may be entitled to a deduction for the cost of a compulsory uniform or corporate wardrobe must be ascertained from an interpretation of the definition of `non-compulsory uniform/wardrobe' in the Bill. This poses problems because it is difficult for both employers and employees to determine at any given time when there is a relevant policy preventing an employee from substituting items of the uniform or corporate wardrobe `except in special circumstances' as provided for in the Bill. There is also a practical difficulty in establishing whether the employer has in fact been enforcing such policies where they are held to exist for the purpose of the proposed law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many cases, this change to the law may well be unenforceable and, therefore, will be inequitable in its application. This is just one of the many cases in which the tax law is out of step with the requirements of our partial self-assessment system. While it is common for the existing law to be out of step with the new requirements of self-assessment, it is less common for the Government to introduce new measures that come into this place which are also out of step with self-assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, while the Tax Office bombards us with all the rhetoric of self-assessment, we see very little of the reality of self-assessment in the design of new tax legislation. This is something which I urge the Tax Office to give more attention to and to which the ATO will give more consideration under a coalition government and our proposed reforms for the system of tax administration in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also seeks to amend the dividend streaming provisions to ensure that they work as intended in the case of international dividend streaming arrangements. Under these amendments, resident companies will be able to preserve a portion of their available franking credits to be offset against the franking debit that arises under the dividend streaming provisions when a non-resident associate pays a related dividend under the streaming arrangement. These provisions will apply to franked dividends paid by resident companies on or after the date that the Bill receives royal assent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a measure that is essentially unobjectionable and will not have a significant impact on the revenue, given the small number of companies affected. The Bill also gives effect to the Budget announcement that limited partnerships formed on or after 19 August 1992 will be subject to the same taxation provisions as those that apply to companies. The basis for these provisions is the Tax Office view that limited partnerships have more in common with companies than with partnerships generally, and so should be taxed accordingly. Limited partnerships formed prior to 19 August 1992 will be subject to the same tax provisions as companies from the 1995-96 income year. If they do not continue to carry on the same business, or if their ownership changes to a significant extent, then they will be treated like companies for the year of income in which they change their circumstances and in all later years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those limited partnerships that are subject to the new arrangements will be known as corporate limited partnerships in future, according to the second reading speech of the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin). We are told that these measures are designed to deal with a number of actual and potential tax avoidance schemes that take advantage of the existing limited partnership provisions. The existing provisions allow limited partnerships to pass losses through directly to investors and to make tax free distributions to resident and non-resident investors. There is considerable debate as to the merits of the existing tax provisions for limited partnerships, with many people arguing that they provide an appropriate mechanism for small businesses to avoid the complexity of the corporations law, without the risks of full personal liability found in ordinary partnerships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with this legislation, as proposed, is that it adopts a blanket approach to a problem that might conceivably have been addressed with amendments more narrow in scope and directed at specific schemes that the Government wishes to counter. Instead of adopting a more narrow approach it might be preferable to deal with any tax avoidance schemes that take advantage of the existing limited partnership arrangements through the use of the general anti-avoidance provisions of part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act rather than use the blanket approach adopted in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Institute of Australia has pointed out that, if it is Labor's policy to deny the benefit of losses in the early years of a project to participants in all infrastructure projects, the amendments proposed simply do not achieve that goal. For example, the Taxation Institute cites the fact that the amendments do not preclude the use of a partnership or joint venture arrangement under which losses incurred in the early years of the project may be effectively passed on to the participants. Furthermore, the Taxation Institute has said of these proposed amendments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would appear that the amendments have been hastily prepared and contain a number of serious drafting errors.</PARA>
<PARA>According to the Institute, some of those errors result in parts of the legislation being rendered nonsensical. Labor clearly needs to give more thought to what it is trying to achieve in these arrangements. The danger Labor faces in taking the approach that it has with this legislation is that some genuine limited partnerships may suffer in the attempt to crack down on a variety of tax avoidance schemes. This approach is inconsistent with the goal of promoting business activity and economic growth&mdash;something which limited partnerships may facilitate in many cases. Unfortunately, the needs of business are often forgotten by Labor in the design of its tax legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also amends the prescribed payments system as announced on 1 July 1992. These amendments are designed to reduce the compliance burden of the prescribed payments system by replacing current monthly reporting arrangements with annual reporting. Amendments are also made to those provisions dealing with deduction variations and exemption certificates and approvals to quote reporting exemption numbers. Once again, these amendments are unobjectionable from the point of view of the coalition. The coalition has said that when it is in office it will review the prescribed payments system to ensure that the withholding rate is commensurate with its proposed new income tax scales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992-93 it is estimated that the prescribed payments system will collect in advance some $1.3 billion. That will be an increase of 10.3 per cent on the figure for 1991-92. The Bill also amends the income tax law to exempt the family payment advance from income tax. As the law currently stands, regular instalments of family payment are exempt from income tax. These amendments will extend this exemption to the lump sum payments of up to six months in advance. This will begin to operate from 1 January 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also considering cognately the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992. This Bill will increase the rate of the Medicare levy by 0.15 per cent to 1.4 per cent from 1 July 1993. This measure is expected to raise an additional $300m in revenue in 1993-94. This is on top of the amount the Medicare levy already raises which is expected to amount to $2.5 billion in the financial year 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I had occasion to remark last week in this place, the Medicare levy is one of the more fraudulent of the Labor Party's range of taxes. It promotes a fiscal illusion whereby people are led to believe that they receive subsidised health care in return for what looks like a small levy on their income. In reality, the Medicare levy does not even begin to cover the costs of Medicare and the difference is made up with other tax collections through the rest of the tax system. The Medicare levy pays for barely one-eighth of the combined expenditure of Commonwealth, State and local governments on health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Medicare levy does not even pay for the Commonwealth's medical benefits payments, much less all the other categories of health expenditure. In 1990-91 the revenue the Commonwealth collected by way of the Medicare levy represented less than 60 per cent of Commonwealth medical benefits payments and only 27 per cent of Commonwealth payments for all medical and hospital services, not to mention the health services provided by other levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the Medicare levy is just another kick in the teeth for taxpayers which bears no relation whatsoever to the funding of the health system. If we were to inject some honesty into Labor's Medicare levy concept and levy it at a rate that reflected the real costs of Medicare, while reducing other taxes by a similar amount, then we would need a levy of around 5 per cent just to cover the Commonwealth's health expenditures. In order to fund the approximately $20 billion in total government expenditure on health in Australia each year we would need a Medicare levy somewhere approaching 10 per cent. Australians would then appreciate, I suggest, the true costs of our grossly expensive health system and take an appropriately dim view of Medicare and the income tax burden it thrusts upon those same taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in the Medicare levy provided for in the Budget is just another tax hike that will be levied at a flat rate across all incomes, excluding only low income earners exempted by the provisions of the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill which was debated only last week. The low income exemption still leaves large numbers of low income earners having to foot the Medicare levy each year on top of their income tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor is not just guilty of misrepresenting the costs of Medicare to taxpayers. It is also guilty of a serious distortion in what it says about the impact of the Medicare levy on Defence Force personnel under a coalition government. The Government's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Poles apart</EMPHASIS> document claims that Defence Force personnel earning more than $45,000 would have to take out private health insurance or pay a surcharge on the Medicare levy. That is a scurrilous lie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has clearly stated that Defence Force personnel will be exempt from the coalition's Medicare levy surcharge if they are currently exempt from the Medicare levy. Defence Force personnel with dependants who have a pro rata liability for the Medicare levy will also have a pro rata liability for the Medicare levy surcharge, but only if their family income exceeds $50,000 and they have failed to take out private health insurance which, under the coalition, will be rewarded by a generous tax credit. Labor's claims about the Medicare levy and Defence Force personnel are just another example of the outright lies and misrepresentations contained in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Poles apart</EMPHASIS> document. The coalition will be opposing this increase in the Medicare levy and with any luck at all will be in office before this increase in the levy comes into effect on 1 July 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has given an undertaking not to increase the Medicare levy above its current 1.25 per cent, unlike Labor, which seems determined to implement a steady increase in the levy over time, partly to pay for the blow-out in health care costs that its health policies have generated. The coalition has pointed to a number of difficulties with Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) as introduced by Labor. While we still will not be opposing that Bill, we will be encouraging its referral to a Senate committee to iron out some of the difficulties which the coalition has identified. Unfortunately, the use of the guillotine in the debate in this chamber appears to have ruled out detailed consideration of this legislation at the committee stage, so once again it is left to the Senate to exercise the prerogatives which were once also the purview of this House, but which have long since been usurped by the Executive under Labor. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been pointed out, the Bills before the House&mdash;the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) and the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No. 2)&mdash;increase the Medicare levy from 1.25 to 1.4 per cent, and there is good reason for that. The mix of private and public patients has undergone a fairly rapid transformation since Medicare was introduced. At the time of its introduction in 1984, about 60 per cent of Australians were covered by private health insurance. I do not have the tables that go back that far, but in September 1986, 48.6 per cent of Australians were covered by private health insurance. That figure has now plummeted to 40.7 per cent. So you can see that, given a choice, Australians are getting out of private health insurance and relying more and more on the Medicare system. What the people of Australia are telling us is that they like Medicare, that there is a fairness about it which appeals to them. The basic unfairness of private health insurance is driving more and more people out of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) ran the old line about the fact that the Medicare levy does not pay all the health bills. It was never intended to. All the levy was supposed to do was make up for the shortfall that would exist from the introduction of Medicare and the provision of health care for public patients that went into the system. If the honourable member says that the levy should rise to 5 per cent, or even 10 per cent, to cover the costs of health care, maybe it is illustrative to look at what private health insurance costs would have to rise to to cover the total cost of health care in Australia. If we had a totally private system, it would cost each family $250 per week to take out private health insurance. So if you want a direct comparison, that is it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Medicare has its advantages, one of which is in the Bill before us today. The Bill raises the threshold under which no Medicare levy is payable at all. For individuals the threshold will rise from $11,745 to $11,887. For married couples it will rise from $19,674 to $20,070. One of the advantages of Medicare is that low income people do not have to pay the levy but they are still afforded all the benefits that it provides. It is very important for people on low incomes, such as pensioners, not to have to pay the Medicare levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are other advantages. Medicare is based on people's ability to pay, so people on high incomes do pay more. It is a very progressive way of funding that part of the health bill for which the Medicare levy has the responsibility. Medicare is also convenient for people. If for some reason people are late in paying their private health insurance and are unlucky enough to have an accident, they are left stranded. With Medicare that does not happen. Payments are made automatically and that is much more convenient. The other advantage is that it is a universal system; everybody is covered. That was not the case with private health insurance. Under the Opposition's proposals, Medicare is the only thing that will make sure there are people out there with private health insurance. Its proposals on private health insurance do nothing for universality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one area in which Medicare has never lived up to its ambitions is that of giving equal access. We have never had equal access, and I do not think we ever will. But that is certainly not helped by private health cover which allows people to buy access. I noticed at the weekend in Perth, and I think in other capitals around Australia, that television advertisements run by private health insurance companies portrayed a person needing medical treatment. The first question asked was, `Do you have private health insurance?'. The answer was, `No, I'm a Medicare patient'. The response was, `Well, you can wait 12 months'. However, if the answer was, `Yes, I do', the person could have treatment straight away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question that is raised by such television advertising is whether medical services are being delivered on the basis of need, on the basis of ability to pay, or on the basis of classification. As I said before, it seems to me that Australians are waking up to the unfairness of private health insurance. People pay the Medicare levy plus private health insurance. Then, when they go into hospital&mdash;usually it is a private hospital, but it does not have to be&mdash;as a privately insured patient, they get large bills on top. The basic unfairness of all this is that this area is unlike any other area of people taking out insurance cover. When people take out more insurance they expect to pay less when they claim whatever they are insuring themselves for. This is one area where people take out more insurance so they can pay more money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic unfairness of this is being recognised by the Australian people and more and more are getting out of private health insurance. It costs about $35 a week to take out top private health insurance cover. There are not many families in Australia, I would venture to say, that could afford that. Certainly there are many pensioners who are going without many of what we would call the necessities of life&mdash;not luxuries&mdash;so they can take it out, but the only advantage is that it buys access. There is another advantage, to the extent that people can exercise it, which is that people can choose their own doctor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed in the debate leading up to the Bills being placed before the House today that the Opposition spokesman on health matters, the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), spoke about waiting lists. Part of the money raised by the Bill will go towards assisting in reducing waiting lists. I have before me an article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of 4 July stating that the Federal Government gave $8m to the State Government of Western Australia to reduce waiting lists. The article states :</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Brennan&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Health Commissioner in Western Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">confirmed that not one private hospital had tendered for the $8 million put up by the State Government last year to allow extra elective surgery to be performed on public patients.</PARA>
<PARA>What he was talking about there was a scheme whereby the Federal Government, through the State Government, gave $8m to reduce public waiting lists, but they were going to use private hospitals to do it. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AMA President Mick O'Halloran said it was unacceptable to treat public patients in private hospitals, where they would be lying next to people who had paid $1500 a year for private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr O'Halloran's sums are a bit wrong: it is a lot more than that. The article went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme would remove one of the main remaining incentives to take out insurance, he said.</PARA>
<PARA>So, it is more than just a battle about money; it is a battle about ideology. The fact is that, according to the AMA, you cannot treat a public patient in a private hospital. Yet it is the AMA that raises the issue of waiting lists. The Federal Government, through the West Australian Government, is saying, `We will give you money to reduce the waiting list`, but the AMA says, `No, you can't do that. Because they are public patients, they can't be treated in private hospitals'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My view is that the Australian people are trying to tell us something. They are getting out of private health insurance, and we should recognise that. The Government has recognised that, because of the mix of private and public patients&mdash;that is, 60 per cent private down to 40 per cent and falling&mdash;it has to raise the Medicare levy. There are more patients to treat in public hospitals. There has to come a day when we get rid of this distinction between private and public; when we have Australian patients. We must break down the barriers that stop people from getting into a hospital to get treatment. That is what the present system does. It does it for no good reason at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only reason I can ascertain, from taking an interest in this area, is that privately insured patients, of course, are worth more to doctors. The doctors can charge them virtually what they like. I suppose the other area that may help explain it is that some of the medical professional bodies do not like being reliant on one insurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take a fundamental view about the role of health insurance. I think it is there for the patient, more than the doctor. I think it should be there to suit the man in the street. The man in the street is not getting full value out of the current arrangements. A significant number of people in my electorate are waiting for what are relatively minor operations. There are empty hospital beds in Western Australia, but people cannot get the treatment because they are public patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Dr O'Halloran said, when we gave the AMA $8m to reduce the waiting lists, it would not accept it; would not use it; would not put public patients in private hospitals. He says it is unfair. I think it is unfair to make people wait longer than they should for these operations. This can seriously impair a person's quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's policy on private health insurance is to go backwards and not forwards. It is not to listen to what the people of Australia are saying about private health insurance. People are voluntarily leaving private health insurance, and not always because of cost. Any honourable members who speaks to their constituents would know that. The basic unfairness about which I spoke earlier is one reason why many people get out of it. The other reason, of course, is that a lot of people do not see why they should be in it. They do not see the need. There is no need to be in it if you are young and healthy, so why pay an extra $35 a week, or up to $35 a week that could be used somewhere else?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Opposition wants to go backwards and try to resuscitate the old private health insurance industry. It is very interesting to look at the way in which it intends to put more money into hospitals. The Opposition's proposals would raise from the Australian public an extra $2,113m. Of that, $1,591m will go straight to the doctors. An amount of $200m will go towards the increased utilisation of waiting lists. So, less than $1 in $10 of all the money collected will go to hospitals. In fact, more will go to the private health insurers to be soaked up in administrative costs. The Opposition proposes to provide $274m for administrative costs; $200m to the hospitals and $1,600m to the doctors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the increases are quite dramatic. A dermatologist, for instance, will get an increase of $132,000 a year under Fightback. That is $132,000 a year on top of the $279,000 he is already getting, making a grand total of $411,000. Honourable members might like to compare that with the nurse who may be working alongside that doctor in Victoria. That nurse has just lost the 17 1/2 per cent leave loading and the penalty rates. There is a basic unfairness about all of this which I think the people of Australia are recognising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the legislation to increase the Medicare levy. As I say, I do not think it will be the last increase. I think the people of Australia are embracing Medicare more, and as we get more Medicare patients and less private patients, then I think the future is entirely predictable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great pleasure to have such a substantial audience of Government members present. We are discussing here tonight a very significant piece of legislation, the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 1992. This legislation seeks to implement many of the proposals which were announced by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) on 30 June last in his statement <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Security in retirement</EMPHASIS>. Many of these proposals are fundamental to the Government's approach to retirement income policy and were built around the superannuation guarantee charge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of initiatives which are of some significance. I should place it on record that the Opposition does not oppose all of them, although we believe that our retirement income policy is a significantly more viable document than that proposed by the Government following significant reforms dating back to 1983. In fact, there has been almost a decade of constant change in superannuation policy, which I regret to say has had a major impact on people's confidence in long term investment as a viable means of assuring them of retirement income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major initiatives relates to the question of limits on deductions for superannuation contributions. Currently employers can contribute unlimited amounts on a tax deductible basis. The self-employed can obtain tax deductions for contributions of $3,000 plus 75 per cent of any amount exceeding $3,000 up to the maximum of their reasonable benefit limits, otherwise known as RBLs. These arrangements for the self-employed have been remarkably generous in the past. They have led to some instances of high income earning professionals taking advantage of the system as an effective tax haven in which to deposit contributions of many hundreds of thousands of dollars, resulting in substantial pay-outs on their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the proposed changes go too far the other way. The amendment will impose an age-based limit on employer and self-employed contributions. For example, an employee under 35 years may have only up to $9,000 a year; between 35 and 49 years, $25,000 a year; and aged 50 and over $62,000 a year. These, of course, will be indexed to average weekly ordinary time earnings. A formula applies for those years in which an employee has a birth date at which the deduction limit applies and in which contributions are made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If employers do not want to use these age based limits, they may elect to use a standard contribution limit for all employees. If the employer has 10 or more employees for whom the employer makes superannuation contributions and if the employer elects to adopt this method, the standard contribution limit will be determined by the number of full year employee positions multiplied by the indexed amount; namely, $25,000 a year. The new arrangement is clearly generous, particularly when compared to the new regime for wage and salary earners, which I will come back to later. On a lifetime basis this would mean that a person taking maximum advantage of these limits between ages 20 and 65 would be able to contribute approximately $1.5m on a tax concessional basis, compared with a maximum of $300,000 for individuals and $600,000 for couples under the Fightback proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the reality is that Labor's generosity to the high-flying professionals&mdash;do not forget it is only the wealthy who really benefit from these Labor proposals, not the ordinary workers&mdash;is in stark contrast to its treatment of ordinary wage and salary earners. People on average weekly earnings or less, which represents some 70 per cent of all taxpayers, will be able to claim a maximum rebate&mdash;this is the most horrifying part of this reform&mdash;of $100 a year compared with an average of $33,000 a year for somebody who has significant resources to invest and who is self-employed. If Government members regard that as an equitable proposition, I do not and the Opposition certainly does not. The Government claims that it is going to achieve savings of some $20m in 1994-95 from this proposal, together with the other changes also proposed in the package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the question of deductions and rebates for personal superannuation contributions. Currently there is a range of different taxation concessions for wage and salary earners in the various categories. For example, those with no superannuation cover can claim tax deductions on the same basis as the self-employed; that is, $3,000 a year plus 75 per cent of the excess contributions up to their RBL limits. Those with award superannuation only are entitled to a deduction of $3,000 a year. Those with incomes of less than $25,000 a year, tapering off at $31,000, and with modest levels of employer support&mdash;say $1,600 a year&mdash;are entitled to a rebate of up to 25 per cent or a maximum of $750. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment will effectively replace those different levels of tax concessions with a uniform rebate at a token level, as I said, of a mere $100 a year, being 10 per cent on a maximum contribution of $1,000. Even this will be fully available only to those with incomes less than $27,000 and will phase out at $31,000 a year. Effectively, these changes will dramatically and adversely affect an estimated 1.3 million people who are currently contributing to superannuation plans and particularly personal plans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They involve a contractual arrangement using a set period of at least five years. These people will suddenly be confronted with the obligation of effectively contributing a higher net amount or be found to have breached the contract. One can appreciate that the Opposition has received a considerable number of complaints and expressions of concern from many contributors to superannuation funds because of these proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The giving of less than 24 hours notice is in stark contrast to the other provisions of the Bill, which involve two years. This is a matter which I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca), who is at the table, will explain to us in some detail, as no doubt he is an expert in this field. There has been widespread speculation as to the Government's motives, but it would seem quite consistent with its view that employers should bear the full responsibility for superannuation contributions and that employees should be effectively discouraged from making their own arrangements. This, of course, is in direct contrast with the whole principles for superannuation under the Fightback proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, this is a totally unacceptable situation, as a current generation of employees will receive nothing like an adequate level of retirement income under the SGC proposals. On the Government's own calculations, for an individual on average weekly earnings to receive 40 per cent of AWE, there would need to be 12 per cent contributions made over a 40-year period. Most workers will not be in the work force for anything like that period, and they would be fortunate to be employed at present at all, as a result of the failures of this Government's economic policy. Consequently, the majority of the work force are currently aged over 30 years and are still being effectively encouraged to retire at age 55. Women also tend to work 10 years less on a full time basis than men. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to dinner I was talking about the Government's proposals in relation to deductions and rebates for personal superannuation contributions. I made the point that the Opposition regards it as a totally unacceptable situation that the current proposals for retirement income in terms of the SGC timetable will not be achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overwhelming majority of the current generation of the work force will also not have the benefit of anything like 12 per cent of contributions, whatever length of time they are in the work force. Some 850,000 employees are not covered by awards at present and, therefore, have not been receiving the first 3 per cent award superannuation. A further 600,000 award employees have not received their entitlements as a result of employer non-compliance. It is estimated that there must be an additional 100,000 public sector employees who have not been receiving award superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the SGC is to be phased in over a 10-year period, it follows that even those already receiving the first round of 3 per cent will not reach 9 per cent until the year 2002. Goodness knows when they will reach the 12 per cent advocated by the Government. Consequently, in those circumstances, we believe it is ridiculous for the Government to remove any top-up incentive which is currently in the law, and such incentive will be removed by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move onto another issue in relation to superannuation&mdash;pensions and roll-over annuities. Currently there is a 15 per cent tax rebate payable on the post-1983 portion of a superannuation pension paid from taxed superannuation funds and annuities purchased wholly with roll-over eligible termination payments&mdash;ETPs. The rebate is paid only on those pensions and annuities which become payable after 1 July 1988 to a person aged 55 or more. It was originally introduced as a quid pro quo for the introduction of a tax on a fund's earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rebate is paid on the income component of pension or annuity payments, and the capital component is therefore free of income tax. The income component is determined by dividing the undeducted purchase price by the term of the pension or annuity and then subtracting it from the annual pension or annuity payable. This consists of that part of the purchase price of the annuity or pension prior to 1 July 1983 for which the taxpayer did not get a tax deduction or rebate plus that part made after that date for which a tax deduction was not claimed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed changes in this Bill will introduce a new 15 per cent rebate on superannuation pensions paid from taxed superannuation funds and on annuities purchased wholly with roll-over ETPs to replace those existing rebate arrangements. Consequently, the rebate will apply to all such superannuation pensions and roll-over annuities payable to taxpayers who are aged 55 or more, irrespective of when the pension or annuity commenced to be payable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also seeks to amend the definition of ETPs so that rebatable superannuation pensions and rebatable ETP annuities will be limited to post-June 1993 undeducted contributions. In many respects, the Opposition believes that this new rebate is simpler than existing arrangements, as it does not differentiate between annuities and pensions which were payable prior to 1988 or prior to the individual reaching age 55. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those with a high pre-1983 component, the new rebate will provide a greater incentive to take a pension or annuity over lump sums than before. On the current tax scales, the rebate will mean that no income tax will be paid on any rebatable superannuation pension or roll-over annuity under approximately $17,300. Overall, these measures are supported by the Opposition and are broadly in line with our approach to superannuation, in that they represent a simplification of current arrangements and encourage the choice of annuity or pension over the taking of lump sums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the election to roll over eligible termination payments. Certain primary lump sum payments from superannuation funds are taxed as ETPs. For taxation purposes they are broken into various components which are taxed at different rates. A typical example is the splitting of an ETP into pre- and post-1 July 1983 components. Currently, individuals wishing to withdraw less than the full amount can elect which components of an ETP are to be rolled over and thereby minimise the amount of tax that is immediately payable. This Bill will prevent individuals electing which part of an ETP will be rolled over and, subsequently, provide formulae for determining the components of the retained amount and the roll-over amount for the purposes of calculating tax liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many respects, the amendments do nothing to reduce the complexities associated with the maintenance of the pre- and the post-1983 regime. They will also operate retrospectively. Seen in a context of Labor's unsatisfactory approach to superannuation, surely this initiative in itself is therefore unsatisfactory. In comparison with the Fightback proposal, the superannuation policy allows for the abolition of the pre- and post-regime, as well as lump sum taxes, which would render the changes foreshadowed here unnecessary when we come to government. But it does demonstrate yet again that the Fightback proposals for superannuation are infinitely more simple and straightforward than the complex arrangement that we have had to live with since 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 90-day roll-over period is also worth referring to. Currently, a roll-over must generally be made within 90 days of the ETP becoming eligible to be received; otherwise the individual will become liable for taxation on it. The 90-day roll-over period is currently being abused, in that the ETP is received and invested for 90 days and then rolled over. It has been suggested, for example, that there are cases in which people could take the money and put it into a risky investment. They could lose their entire ETP in such a situation, and therefore get no benefit at the end of it and be required to go on the age pension. There is a lot to be said for reform in this area. Therefore, we support the proposals contained in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also makes some reforms in regard to taxation of redundancy, early retirement and invalidity pensions. In addition to superannuation payouts, there are other payments which are currently given concessional treatment as ETPs; for example, a bona fide redundancy payment, an approved early retirement scheme payment or an invalidity payment. The current taxation of these payments is on a concessional basis, in that they are treated as if they were pre-1983 components of an ETP. Consequently, 5 per cent of their value is included in assessable income, with their taxation being able to be deferred if the amount is rolled over. Currently, there is no limit on the size of these contributions, although the amount is not being counted against a recipient's RBL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed change in the legislation places a limit on redundancy payments of $4,000 indexed, plus $2,000 indexed for each whole year of service with the employer concerned. These amounts will then be tax free. For amounts in excess of the tax-free element, taxation will be on an ordinary ETP basis&mdash;that is, the amount will be split into its pre- and post-1983 components and taxed accordingly. The tax treatment of invalidity payments will stay broadly the same; however, the post-June 1984 component will be tax free and not assessable against the individual's RBL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These new arrangements would appear to represent a warranted tightening up of the system, especially in so far as golden handshakes are concerned, as these have often been used as a way of circumventing the reasonable benefit limits. The coalition is yet to fully address how it will treat the taxation of these elements of invalidity payments. Strictly, they are not to be seen as superannuation payments, but they are currently treated as such for taxation purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I want to make some observations about the commencement arrangements and their financial impact. Exemptions from tax of the post-1984 invalidity components of those amounts which are within the limits will cost $20m in 1995-96. Other costs at this stage are insignificant. There are, however, some significant changes in relation to reasonable benefit limits involving the maximum amount of benefit a person is entitled to receive on a concessionally taxed basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RBLs are currently calculated as a multiple of a person's highest average salary in any three consecutive years. They vary as follows: for example, up to $42,980 the lump sum RBL is 7; the pension RBL is 0.75. These vary up to over $79,810, where the lump sum RBL is 3 and the pension RBL is 0.35. Consequently, a minimum RBL also operates. The base lump sum for an RBL is $188,180 and the base pension is $302,420. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this legislation the Bill proposes to introduce a flat dollar RBL amount, which is a significant improvement in the system&mdash;it is certainly less complex&mdash;and the limit on lump sums will therefore be $400,000 indexed, with a total RBL of $800,000 indexed. Excess benefits will be taxed at the individual's marginal tax rate, as is currently the case. People who have already accrued benefits that are within their existing RBLs, but in excess of the new limits, will be allowed to retain those entitlements as their new RBL.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also transfers the administration of the RBLs from the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to the Australian Taxation Office, which is probably a step in the right direction, in view of the massive complexities and difficulties which many people who have retired over the last two years have found in their dealings with the Superannuation Commission over their entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The flat dollar RBLs represent a very significant simplification of the system&mdash;as I outlined&mdash;and a substantial clamp down on the level of subsidy provided to individuals' retirement incomes. Nevertheless, the lump sum RBL is still very generous and will do little to address the problem of double-dipping for the vast majority of workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's retirement income policy in fact abolishes the RBL regime altogether. We have replaced it with the first $60,000 indexed of an accrued benefit to be taken as a lump sum, and 50 per cent of the remaining benefit thereafter subject to a maximum lump sum of $300,000 indexed. Unlike Labor's proposed regime, there will be no maximum on accrued benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transitional arrangements proposed by the Government are much tougher than those proposed by the coalition, especially for high net worth individuals. For example, an individual with an accrued benefit of $400,000 as at 1 July 1994 will face a maximum lump sum limit of $400,000 after that date under Labor, but a maximum lump sum limit of $700,000 under the coalition. Furthermore, an individual with an accrued benefit of $800,000 on 1 July 1994, who experiences growth in that amount, will be liable to pay tax at the maximum marginal rate on that real growth when the benefit is received, but under the coalition will only pay a maximum of 5 to 10 per cent tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to confirm that senior executives who are currently under arrangements which may have been in place for some years will be fully protected under the coalition's proposals. In fact they will be better off than under some of these proposals outlined by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental proposal contained in the coalition's policy is directed at the need to give everybody in the work force, whether permanent or part time employed, whether male or female, adequate access to superannuation. One would have to say that after nearly 10 years of constant reform, that outcome has still not been achieved by the present Government. I will give a small example of this: a female in the work force who may be covered by superannuation&mdash;and she would still be the minority of females in the work force, I should hasten to add&mdash;who leaves the work force, say, for family reasons, is only able to continue to remain in what I describe as mainline superannuation for up to two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's approach to females in the work force in relation to superannuation is far more liberal. We have effectively said that, whereas the lump sum contribution benefit is limited to $300,000 for an individual, it is in fact $600,000 for a couple. We really do not mind how that second payment is made. For example, if a woman leaves the work force, either on a part time or temporary basis or permanently leaves the work force, and her husband wishes to continue to make some contributions towards her superannuation, he may continue to do so and his wife will benefit, therefore, from having her own private superannuation upon retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the current rules, the woman who leaves the work force may only remain in superannuation for a maximum of two years. This has raised a number of very important related issues, that is, whether or not there are in place sufficient bridges to assist women who may have broken periods of service in the work force. As a direct means of assisting those women, especially the majority who are in part-time or temporary less than permanent occupations, many of whom at the present time have no superannuation coverage, we have introduced a new concept called retirement savings accounts. They are effectively like bank accounts. They are managed like a bank account. Money is put into the account; it gains interest; the interest will be under the very generous tax arrangements under Fightback, which effectively provides a 25 per cent rebate. At the end of a period of being out of the work force, or if a person transfers to an employment opportunity where there is access to a normal mainline superannuation scheme, he could transfer the resources in the retirement savings account into that fund. Alternatively, it could be the other way around: a woman may have an RBL which she is particularly happy with and be prepared to continue with that arrangement, which her employer would be able to fund directly into her retirement savings account if she so wished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are aiming for a fair and equitable system of superannuation which covers and gives opportunities to everyone in the work force. We believe it is absolutely unacceptable to persevere with a system where the average worker gets a benefit after tax and superannuation of less than 16c in the dollar, whereas the high income earner has a benefit in excess of 33c in the dollar. Under the proposals which we have introduced&mdash;the rebate system of 25 per cent on contributions&mdash;all income earners will be effectively put on a similar taxation base, and surely that is what it should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For far too long in the Australian superannuation system we have had a case of the haves and the have nots. The haves have tended to be people in the higher income brackets with access to superannuation as a normal component of their salary packages. Regrettably, this has not been the case for the vast majority of workers for far too long. While we support the extension of superannuation into the whole work force, as has been the objective of government policy over recent years, we do not support the belief that it should be compulsory up to 12 per cent contributions by employers as is proposed by the Government legislation. Quite the contrary. The point has been made, both by industry and by members of the Government, that, under current circumstances in particular, additional add on labour costs mean people's jobs. Various estimates of between 60,000 and 80,000 lost jobs will be the direct outcome of having a compulsory superannuation system covered in this Bill tonight. This means that the employer will make the major, if not the total, contribution. A pathetic level of compensation in terms of taxation is provided to lower income earners under this legislation and simply guarantees that, unless the employer makes the contribution, it will not be worth while for the employee to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps that is the most fundamental point on which the Government and the Opposition part ways in this critical area of social policy. We believe that people should have access to tax rebates on an equal footing, irrespective of the level of their income. That is something the Government has fundamentally denied in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the changes in this legislation are important. Some of these changes are welcomed by the Opposition; others we regard as retrograde steps. But fundamentally we believe that, while we are accepting that the current level of compulsory contribution will remain in place as at the next election, after that date continuing increases in superannuation should essentially be the subject of negotiation between employers and employees. Side by side with that, we believe that the ideal system of superannuation is one where the employer and the employee agree to make a contribution, both towards their ultimate retirement income support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad result of the legislation we have before us tonight is this: for the vast majority of low income workers, even under the proposals in this Bill, based as they are on the presumption of being in the work force for up to 40 years, it simply means that while the Government says the objective of its proposal is to take people out of the welfare system,  so they will not be required to receive pensions, most of those people will still get pensions, because many of them have broken periods of service in the work force. They have not been offered proposals such as retirement savings accounts to act as bridges for those periods out of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, in many respects we believe that this legislation is not truthful to its purpose. It is not genuinely saying to the Australian people: these are the facts, and this is what your contribution should be; this is the level of benefits you should accept. We believe, under current circumstances especially, that to place in the hands of the employer virtually the total responsibility for providing superannuation must ultimately mean a lowering of standards of living and a lowering of take-home pay for workers. Employers cannot extend and expand the base of superannuation contribution, especially up to 12 per cent, and at the same time talk about increasing wages unless there is a substantial increase in basic national productivity and productivity in the individual workplace to make that attainable. One would have to say that, on the record of the last decade or so, the level of productivity in this country leaves much to be desired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this legislation does contain some advances in this very complex area of national policy, we regret that the Government has not been ambitious enough to take and face the realities facing both the work force and employers for the benefit of a retirement income for all Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill is yet another chapter in this Government's proud record of reform in the area of superannuation policy, as it has been in a number of areas where the social justice elements have been at the forefront. The Keating Government believes in enabling lower income workers to live better in retirement through a mixture of the pensions. Superannuation is one of the fundamental social justice issues facing Australia today. On 30 June the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) released a statement, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Security in retirement&mdash;planning for tomorrow today</EMPHASIS>, which outlines a coordinated and comprehensive framework for retirement income policy in this country well into the next century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are now three clearly defined ways in which people will have income in their retirement provided for. The first way is through the age pension and a social security system. Although those opposite have always been quick to characterise people in receipt of social security payments as parasites and undeserving, they should recognise that in the past, due to the neglect of previous conservative governments, superannuation was simply not an option for many Australians. The proposals that they have in their so-called Fightback package do nothing at all to improve the opportunities of Australians to live a better life in their retirement and to provide for their retirement&mdash;in particular, when one considers the voluntary aspect that the Opposition wishes to bring to superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until this Government came to power, superannuation benefits were restricted to those in upper and middle income areas and workers generally in the Public Service or some white collar areas. Very few blue collar workers had superannuation available to them. While the reforms introduced by this Government have meant that most Australian workers will be able to provide adequately for their own retirement, this Government will not walk away from helping those unable to secure such a nest egg for their retirement. In addition to this part of the retirement incomes policy, the other two tiers of the policy are the compulsory and voluntary superannuation arrangements. This Bill introduces the measures announced in the Treasurer's statement on superannuation in June that will introduce changes to the voluntary and compulsory superannuation systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first area of change is in relation to rebate and deduction arrangements for personal superannuation contributions. The changes to rebates of superannuation contributions will provide greater support to low to middle income employees who receive support from their employers for superannuation contributions. The new rebate will be 10 per cent of personal superannuation contributions up to $1,000, with this maximum gradually being phased out once the employee's income is greater than $27,000. A rebate is no longer available once a person's income is more than $31,000. This new rebate regime is simpler and more equitable than the one which existed previously, with a person's eligibility for tax concessions no longer depending upon the support received from the employer for the provision for that person's retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that some people will receive reduced tax concessions on their contributions. These people should keep it in mind that they will receive other tax concessions in the area of superannuation. The introduction of a superannuation guarantee charge has seen the extension of superannuation to many workers not previously covered. While the reduction of tax concessions will save the Federal Government around $230m, the introduction of the SGC will cost the Federal Government around $400m in revenue in the next financial year. The Government is continuing to invest in a strong superannuation system as a cornerstone of its retirement incomes policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing taxation deduction arrangements will continue for people who do not receive employer superannuation support, and for the self-employed. These amendments to rebates and deductibility will come into effect from the beginning of this financial year. Another important feature of this Bill is that it will introduce limits on deductions allowed for superannuation contributions allowed to employers and the self-employed. From 1 July 1994, the amount of deductions available to an employer will be $9,000 for employees under the age of 35, $25,000 for an employee between the ages of 35 and 49, and $62,000 for people over 50 years. If an employer employs 10 or more people, an employer will be able to use a standard contribution limit, to be an amount calculated by multiplying $25,000 by the lowest number of employees employed during the year. These measures, along with the changes to the reasonable benefit limits, will increase revenues by $20m in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also contained in this legislation are changes to the rolling over of eligible termination payments, better known as ETPs. At present, employees can elect the amount of each component of the termination payment that they want to roll over. This in effect enables people who began contributing before 1983 to avoid a large of amount of the tax on the post-June 1983 parts of their eligible termination payments. The changes contained in this Bill will close this particular loophole. People will still be able to roll over their undeducted contributions and concessional payments, but they will have to take a number of steps to identify the extent to which the roll-over amount is made up of their components. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation also includes measures that will increase the attractiveness of pensions and annuities as a form of taking superannuation. Annuities provide a stable source of retirement income for many Australians, ensuring that they have enough to live on comfortably for the rest of their lives. It is often considered that most Australians just wish to take a lump sum and become some sort of investment people themselves. But many Australians who worked in a nine to five or seven to four job, or whatever the hours may have been over their working life, and who have been used to getting a weekly, fortnightly or monthly pay cheque, when they retire and get this huge lump sum in many cases finish up with extensive worries about how they are going to invest that money. What people want in retirement is a simple retirement and a regular income, as they have been used to all their life, so they can get on with enjoying their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We often consider things are wrong in our society when people just want to take that lump sum. From my own experience with people I have encountered in this areas, I do not believe that they want that at all. They would rather have a simple retirement, as long as their retirement income is guaranteed, and that is the important part. This Government's commitment to superannuation will ensure that, as distinct from the policies of those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill simplifies what has until now been a complex taxation law surrounding pensions and annuities through the introduction of a flat 15 per cent rebate on superannuation pensions that are paid from tax superannuation funds and on annuities that are paid for through rolled over determination payments. This change means that no tax will be payable on rebatable superannuation pensions and annuities under $17,300 in today's terms. This new rebate will be introduced from 1 July 1994. By encouraging people to take their superannuation pay-out in the form of a pension or annuity, the Government is not only helping people to provide for a decent lifestyle in retirement but is also reducing the cost of pensions and other social security payments in the future. In effect, people who are able to benefit from superannuation in retirement will have a better lifestyle through having a guaranteed payment, and they will be able to get a better income than they would from social security benefits. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I thought that he might like to jump up and explain a few of his actions as well. The amendments proposed by the Government are very important and form a very integral part of the legislation before us tonight. The amendments extend measures in the Bill that allow superannuation contributions based on earnings of a `standard employee' to be acceptable when calculating for the superannuation guarantee charge to apply to all employers that made contributions under industrial awards in place before 21 August 1991. These amendments increase the effectiveness of the operation of the superannuation guarantee charge and increase its fairness.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is important to note, too, because there are a lot of employers who do the right thing by their employees and provide for their retirement, and have been doing so for some time. They will not be affected in the main by the superannuation guarantee charge, because they have already had very strong commitments to their employees.

That has failed continually in this country and overseas, and it will always fail. The voluntary aspect of superannuation contributions cannot and will not work.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) provides for financial assistance grants to the States and to institutions for higher education purposes. The measures in the Bill that relate to the funding of higher education are, in a number of cases, drawn directly from the Opposition's Fightback program, and I shall identify those. The Opposition is pleased to see that this Government, which has run out of its own ideas, is prepared to accept ideas which have been put forward by the Opposition to improve the higher education system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill, however, also has another purpose: to seek to entrench compulsory student unionism. The provision in this Bill, in clause 66, is quite unacceptable to the Opposition, and in committee we will be moving to delete this clause from the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition will be drawing the attention of the House to the fact that the funding framework which is represented in this piece of legislation has been a drastic failure in terms of, and measured against, the need to produce a higher education system of world class standard. We propose an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill. I now move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not opposing the passage of this Bill, the House condemns the Government for persisting with its flawed funding framework for universities, a framework which has led to overcrowding, staff shortages, huge unmet demand, and a severe decline in research infrastructure, and for its continuing attack on students' rights to freedom of association".</PARA>
<PARA>A number of aspects of this legislation have been taken directly from the Opposition. The Opposition has led debate on reform of the higher education system, particularly on measures which are necessary to retrieve the system from the disaster which fell upon it following the White Paper of 1988 and the so-called Dawkins changes which have done it a great deal of damage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill rolls capital funding into recurrent funding. We believe that this is a measure which should have been taken some time ago. It is a measure which the Opposition has advocated for some years, and it is a measure which has the advantage that it allows institutions to plan their own capital developments without being dependent on political discretion, on the political whims of the day, to decide whether they receive those capital funds. The Opposition has no complaint about the rolling in of capital funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also increases the number of postgraduate research awards by 200. This was advocated by the Opposition in the Fightback package. However, the Government's measures do not go the full distance towards the proposals put forward by the Opposition. They fail in this respect: the Opposition advocated not only that the number of postgraduate research awards should be increased but also that the stipend for these awards should be increased by some $2,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our view this is necessary to attract not merely students into the postgraduate research areas, but to attract the very best students. It is true that there is a big demand for these awards. Unfortunately it is not the case that the best students in all cases can be attracted to apply for these awards because they can be better remunerated elsewhere. Hence, we believe that there should be an increase in the stipend going to students, as well as an increase in the number of awards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be said, however, that one of the reasons this is so essential is that the reforms and changes that the Government has made to higher education since 1988 have had a very demoralising effect on academic staff and have significantly reduced the attractiveness of an academic career, particularly for the very bright young students who find that they can be better rewarded outside the university system or better rewarded internationally. Of course, we are losing many of the brightest of our research graduate students and academic staff to the United States, to Canada and to Great Britain where academic salaries have not declined in the way that they have in Australia relative to international standards. While we welcome the number of postgraduate research awards being increased, the Government has still not adopted a satisfactory approach in this area to address the problems which the upheaval induced by the former Minister for Employment, Education and Training has produced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides for direct grants to institutions. That is a measure which will be very useful to the Opposition when it comes into government because it will facilitate the introduction of the funding of higher education through the national education awards system or, as it is sometimes called, the voucher proposal. It avoids the bureaucracy of the States and takes away from the States the opportunity which the more financially stretched amongst them have used, particularly the late Victorian Labor Government, to hold onto those funds for a period in order to obtain the benefit of the income from interest on those funds before passing them to institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further measure in this Bill which was also directly taken from the Fightback package was the decision to increase the discount on the up-front payment of HECS from 15 per cent to 25 per cent. We believe that is a more realistic discount rate, given the cost and the financial implications of paying those fees up front. It is an advantage to the community to encourage the payment of fees up front in that way. We are not surprised to see the Government taking over the Fightback initiative. We might think from this list that the Government has largely run out of creative ideas in this area and that it has come to rely very heavily on the coalition for any good ideas which may come forward to improve the quality of the higher education system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another idea of the Government is funded in this Bill which, it is quite clear, the Government does not understand the implication of, but of which I make mention here; that is, the open learning initiative. This is a provision which was described by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in the Budget as making a university degree available to everybody with a television set and a letterbox. This is an absurd notion. It shows the total lack of grasp the Treasurer has, as exhibited during his time in this portfolio, of what is required to provide a university education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is aiming at university education on the cheap. Indeed, if it is true that a university education can be obtained through the letterbox and the television screen and that it can be provided as cheaply as the Government apparently believes it can, the higher education system will be in a good deal of anxiety at the prospect of significant further cuts to its own funding to bring the funding for on-campus courses into line with the funding for off-campus courses. There appears to be absolutely no difference in quality, yet the difference in cost is something like $7,000 per student. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very obvious to anybody who thinks about this that there is a major hole in the Government's thinking in this area. The hole is that the Government is proposing simply to fund the open learning initiative for several years and then to make it self-funding. Can it be self-funding on the fees which the Government has set for it&mdash;fees of the order of the HECS charge&mdash;$2,500?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer, which everybody in the system knows, is that it cannot be self-funding at that level and that there will have to be a deregulation of fees. That means that the Government is pursuing a policy which inevitably will lead to a deregulation of fees for undergraduate courses. The Government's funding arrangements for higher education&mdash;which the Industry Commission described last year, in the most thorough examination which has yet been made of those arrangements, as fundamentally flawed&mdash;are breaking down. Those arrangements are not viable. The Government is hoping to keep them afloat until the election and to represent falsely to the public that it has the answers to the problems that its policies have caused. But, if there is one clear message in the open learning initiative, it is that the funding arrangements are on the way out, because the Government has already accepted the principle of fees charged by universities for undergraduate courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is also misrepresenting to the public the fact that the open learning initiative will in some way or other make a contribution to the unmet demand. The unmet demand problem is, of course, another of the problems caused by the current funding arrangements, because the Government has taken the stand that it will not allow universities in this country to create additional places for Australian students. It will allow them to do so for overseas students&mdash;and there are some 17,000 of these students in the system now for whom the universities have created additional places&mdash;but there are 50,000 qualified Australian students, on a conservative estimate, who cannot get places, and the Government will not allow the universities to create places on campus for these students. It is now saying that those students can pay for places off campus for the open university courses, even though it knows that these students will not be able to get a degree through the open learning initiative in the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A total lie is being told to the community about the implications of the open learning initiative for unmet demand. The Government is not facing up to the problem of unmet demand. It will eventually have to face up to it. Any government would have to face up to it. The coalition has put forward the only proposals which hold out the prospect that Australian students will be able to get additional places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot leave this point without making the further point to this House that at present many year 12 students in this country are sitting down for their end of year assessments and the pressure on them is enormously increased by the Government's approach to this issue. They know that they face a sudden death cut-off if they do not reach the quite arbitrary cut-off marks for university admission which will have to be imposed by the institutions because of the Government's policies. Under a freeing up of this system, if the Government were to allow universities to create additional places on campus for Australian students, those students would know that there would be no sudden death cut-off. They would have a chance if they did not get a government funded place to get a place if someone would sponsor them or if their family were prepared to make a financial effort. They could get a place and there would be a prospect of them continuing their tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the present time that is not so. These students are suffering very grievously at the present time because of the very rigid policy of regulation of universities, contrary to the wishes of the universities. Quite contrary to the views of the Australian Vice-Chancellor's Committee, these students are suffering because this Government, for ideological reasons, will not shift in this aspect of its policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an obvious solution to this, and that is the solution that I was very interested to see Professor Peter Karmel, probably the most respected educational administrator in this country, advocating in his recent Robert Menzies oration. He said that there is no doubt whatever in his mind that in terms of the resourcing of the system, in terms of the number of places, in terms of the quality and diversity of the system, the deregulation of the universities and the need to have their traditional freedoms restored to them is absolutely essential. The Government will not do that, but the Opposition will. That is why we are able to commit ourselves to a higher education system which addresses these issues, which has genuine incentives for quality, which will create more places and which will be better resourced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to draw the attention of the House particularly to clause 66 of this legislation. This is a disgraceful attempt to channel taxpayers' money to the Government's mates in the student unions, with the very obvious intention of locking in their support for the Government for the next election campaign, at the taxpayers' expense. This clause states that if a State successfully legislates to give students freedom of association; if a State legislates as, for example, the new Victorian coalition Government might do, to give students the right to join or not to join a student organisation; and if students exercise their right to decline to join and the union loses funds as a result of the fact that it cannot appeal to students when they are free to choose or not to choose to join the union, the Government proposes, through this section of the Act, to make up the shortfall in the union's income with taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two aspects to this provision. One is that the Government has a completely hands-off attitude towards students' rights. It will not act to ensure equal rights for students. If students' rights are infringed upon by institutions, that is okay so far as the Government is concerned. If a university decides that it will deny a student the right to enrol, to get his exam results or to graduate in order to force him to join a union, as far as this Government is concerned that is all right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government defends this on the totally spurious ground that if it were to act to defend the human rights of students it would be infringing on university autonomy. Have we ever heard the Government argue in any other circumstance that the autonomy of an institution, any institution in this society, is more important than the defence of basic human rights? No, we have not. Yet in this case the Government is trying to convince the public that the reason it will not give students equal rights to freedom of association with every other section of the community is that it does not want to infringe on the autonomy of universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The universities themselves and the Australian Vice-chancellor's Committee have recognised that there is a very significant issue of principle here, but it is not one which the Government has any interest at all in advancing. Of course, the reason is very obvious. These student unions are generally dominated by the student ALP Left. Remarkably, this is the very faction of the Labor Party of which the present Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) is a member. Of course, he would not act to defend the rights of students when he believes that from these student unions he will be able to get significant support during the election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Suppose a State government decides to give students the right to freedom of association. The Minister's view is: even if the students will not join or support the union, the union's income must not be allowed to be diminished. The Government will use the taxpayers' funds to bring the income of that union up to the expected level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill insists that institutions produce audited accounts to the Government to show that they have given the money to the student union. The Government is brooking no financial hanky-panky in that regard&mdash;that money is to flow straight through to the union. Is there any requirement in legislation to audit the union?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know what those purposes are; we have seen what they are. Every member of this House knows that student unions fund a very wide variety of causes. Many of them are highly political causes which have little support in the general community. For example, they may choose to give their funds to support a political organisation such as the Palestine Liberation Organisation. They may use them to fund a sexuality festival. They may use them to produce a handbook such as the one produced at the University of Technology in Sydney giving students a guide to the latest drugs that are available. Indeed, $15,000 was spent by the student union at that university on such a handbook. The Minister apparently believes that it is entirely appropriate that taxpayers' funds be used to fund these sorts of activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is money for out and out political campaigns. We have seen some of those campaigns recently. We have seen the campaign mounted against Dr Chapman's recent report on the reform of Austudy. A very revealing article by Mark Whittaker appeared in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> which talked about the decline of mass student involvement in the activities of the student unions.

<PARA>The article discusses the campaign by the National Union of Students against the Chapman report. It notes Dr Chapman's comment that he `faced what he saw as a massive campaign of lies'. The Minister thinks it is entirely appropriate that taxpayers' money be used to fund and support campaigns of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Union of Students has a budget of $1.5m, much of which, according to this article, it proposes to use in a campaign against the coalition's Fightback package. In particular, it will be campaigning against the coalition's policy to give students equal rights with the rest of the community with regard to freedom of association. If the Victorian Government, or any other government in this country, were to guarantee students the right to freedom of association and the students decided not to support these campaigns, the Minister believes it is entirely appropriate that taxpayers' funds be provided to the student unions so that they could mount these campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not overlook the hypocrisy of these unions who campaign against a freeing up of the system while imposing a compulsory up-front fee&mdash;which is very regressive in its impact&mdash;on all students.

So much for their concern about a policy which allows students to invest in their education.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 and to oppose the amendment. Despite the speech that has just been given, this Bill is another step on the road to the expansion of the higher education system in this country which has been undertaken since 1983 by this Government. When this Government came to power, higher education was still the preserve of the minority&mdash;and a small minority at that&mdash;of the population. There was very restricted access to the higher education system even from among those one-third of students who completed year 12 at secondary school.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a very elitist and hierarchical system of education that moved to a pinnacle in higher education and in the postgraduate sector of the higher education system. I will not say that was solely the fault of the parties opposite. It is quite true that under the Menzies Government the higher education system was expanded in this country. When I first entered an Australian university Sir Robert Menzies was still Prime Minister and he clearly had a commitment to the expansion of that sector&mdash;but not to an extent that was consistent with aspirations for Australia to become a modern industrial society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also true that under the Whitlam Government a commitment to higher education was entered into and in an effort, which was largely unsuccessful I must say, to expand access to the tertiary education system the Whitlam Government abolished fees for individual students and took over the funding of the higher education system from the States. However, at that stage the development of the higher education system languished, like the Australian economy, and then entered the Fraser coalition Government during which time there was stagnation and indeed, in some ways, a contraction of the higher education system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be pointed out in regard to the amendment that the Opposition is suggesting, which talks about a huge unmet demand, that the condition faced by the higher education system in much of this country when this Government came to power was an inability to meet its quotas for the admission of students. Such was the demand for higher education that many universities were unable to attract enough students to comply with the funding arrangements. The Fraser Government at various stages proposed to close down sectors of higher education, including some engineering faculties, for that reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the last nine years this Government has constructed the equivalent of 12 new universities. It has witnessed the retention rate at year 12 rise to over two-thirds of young people, and this is not due to the present recession since the climb in retention rates was in evidence well before it occurred, during the period of the 1980s boom; it has witnessed a huge increase in the participation rate by women in higher education, who now make up about 53 per cent of all students; and it has successfully implemented an equity and access program for various categories of disadvantaged students, including Aboriginal students. The Aboriginal people of this country now have an educated cadre of tens of thousands of Aboriginal people trained in tertiary education that will stand them in good stead over the next couple of generations as they take their place in the sun, fully in this community; among people of non-English speaking backgrounds, among people with disabilities, among people from remote locations, who are dealt with to some degree by the remote learning processes funded in the Bill, and also among people from lower socioeconomic categories, which is the polite way of talking about working class people in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As against these being the principal objectives of the Bill, I wish to make some remarks about the Opposition's moving of the amendment. I was interested to note that the Opposition claims that it has led the debate about tertiary education in this country, against a background, as I have pointed out, where this Government had to pick out a stagnant, languishing higher education system unable to meet, in many instances, its student quotas, grabbed it by the scruff of the neck and pulled it, with much cooperation from within the sector, into a modern mass higher education system. To say that this Bill steals many of its ideas from Fightback is another instance of one of the members of the front bench of the Opposition walking away from Fightback, and instead of saying, as occurred during the brave new world of 12 months ago, `How different we are; what radical reforms we have proposed', saying, `We have the same ideas as the Government, except it has taken them off us too quickly'. What are we going into&mdash;a bipartisan policy on tertiary education? Of course we are not. There are differences. There are differences of size, there are differences of equity and there are differences of access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hear people talking about the demoralisation of the staff. It is very difficult to be categorical about the morale of a staff in a sector that consumes about $4 billion of public money. I can find areas of academic staff that are demoralised for a whole variety of reasons. I can also find other areas of academic staff in universities in my seat&mdash;and there are two&mdash;who are enormously energised by the reforms that this Government has undertaken, particularly women. I had the great privilege of meeting three women professors&mdash;almost unheard of in the higher education sector&mdash;in one room and presenting them with a research award in order to write a biography of a political woman, Mary Lee, almost unknown by political scientists and historians until this time and to be celebrated as a result of her achievements in political activism 100 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear that the academic career is now no longer as attractive, which would make it very difficult to explain the large number of applications that are received by every academic position that we see advertised. We find that standards in our universities have declined and we find that in the same paragraph of a speech in which it decries the fact that so many of our successful postgraduate students have gone overseas to study in their leading universities where no doubt their substandard academic achievements are recognised at the highest level. I do not want to be flippant about academic standards. It is a very important subject. I note that in the newspaper only today it is reported that Minister Baldwin is addressing this problem, which is a complicated and difficult one to deal with. The advice that he is receiving from the Higher Education Council is to establish a committee for quality assurance for higher education because, left to itself, the record of the higher education system in ensuring its own quality has been something less than perfect. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A higher education system&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I am quoting from the HEC&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that justly prides itself on its deep analysis of issues of consequence is sometimes strangely reluctant to examine its own process equally publicly and comprehensively . . .</PARA>
<PARA>And so we have puzzled as to how to deal with that problem. A special committee comprising persons from all the sectors who have an interest in the maintenance of the higher education system's quality&mdash;that is, the Vice-Chancellors Committee; FAUSA; the National Union of Students, so lambasted, and I will return to that; and the Business Council of Australia&mdash;will have an input into this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We find the criticism that there is an arbitrary cut-off point above which you enter universities and below which you do not. Does the Opposition seriously think that there is anything new in this process? Of course there is not. This has always been a characteristic of universities, except for the period 10 years ago when they could not get enough students into some of their courses. But it has typically been a condition of universities that they have to have entrance requirements and these are usually to be found in cut-off scores that are not arbitrary but are determined by the number of places that are available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is now proposing that in order to get around that proposition there be another arbitrary mechanism for entering university. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed) </EMPHASIS>The Opposition, in its amendment, says that the cut-off scores that determine entrance into universities and higher education are arbitrary. I have pointed out that it has always been the fashion to determine entrance into universities by intellectual quality which is traditionally, for better or worse, measured by the academic scores achieved at year 12 and matriculation or its equivalent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is now suggesting that we move to a different way of determining who gets in. That is not on the score achieved, accessible to everybody, but on the basis of what you can pay; that is, that the scarce resource provided by $4 billion worth of public funding across a sector that has been hugely expanded, in part to provide access and equity for the people of this country who have not hitherto had access to higher education, be determined not on the basis of intellectual merit and academic achievement, but on the basis of buying your way in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are we surprised at this proposition?  Of course we are not. It is precisely the same intellectual apparatus and mechanism which arrives at the same conclusion for other sectors of this economy. It is the same conclusion that the Opposition has reached about health:  you buy your way in. It is the same conclusion that it has reached about schooling: you buy your way in. It is the same conclusion that it has reached about child-care:  you buy your way in. It is the same conclusion as it would reach about housing:  you buy your way in. It is the same conclusion as it would reach about public broadcasting of information in this country:  cut public provision and funding for access to information and produce it on a solely commercial basis of buying your way in. This is a withdrawal of government and public responsibility for the provision of scarce and important cultural resources and a reversion to market mechanism which for centuries produced an extremely hierarchical elitist and inaccessible system of higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about traditional freedoms of universities, it must be recognised that this involves not just the capacity of scholars to criticise and critique society and its powerful, including ourselves&mdash;a traditional freedom that I would not for one minute seek to withdraw from university scholars&mdash;but also includes the traditional freedom of universities not to be accessible, to be elitist and not to be responsible to the public purse. In a situation where the taxpayer is providing over $4 billion worth of funding for universities, some responsibility and responsiveness to national needs must be accorded by the university sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to note that an Opposition speaker went overboard when discussing these traditional academic freedoms. He suggested that there be full autonomy for one of our universities. Since that university is funded to the tune of almost $200m worth of taxpayers' money every year, I greeted his comments with somewhat bemused surprise&mdash;and some of my constituents with great pleasure&mdash;believing, wrongly as it turned out, that were this proposition to be carried, $200m would be liberated from that university and distributed proportionately to those universities, including two in my electorate, that were in need. Unfortunately, I found that this was neither the purpose of that proposal, nor did it reach the satisfactory conclusion of being passed by this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before making some general remarks about the purpose of this Bill, I point out that the Opposition spokesman on this subject spent much of his speech&mdash;although I did not clock it precisely&mdash;possibly 50 per cent, dealing with the issue of student unions. There are problems with respect to student unions. Looked at from different perspectives, these problems manifest themselves in different ways. But the honourable member opposite resolved it in this way:  there is Reds under them beds in them student unions! Some of them indeed&mdash;how scandalous&mdash;seek to overthrow the State.

On the whole, the proposed amendments are for the good and for that reason, the Opposition will support the Bill as a whole. But the time allowed for the passage of this legislation is inadequate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill was presented by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) on Tuesday last week and is being debated today. It is being guillotined through this Parliament with 51 other Bills, with only 40 minutes allowed to debate it. Forty minutes has been allowed in the Parliament of this country to debate a Bill that the Attorney-General has proclaimed&mdash;not entirely accurately, may I say&mdash;the most significant piece of legislation in terms of Australia's corporate law introduced during the life of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the rush that has been involved, there are numbers of interested parties in Australia who are still seeking to make submissions and changes and amendments to the Act and who will not have the opportunity to do so. Indeed, as late as this afternoon I received submissions on defects in the Bill, defects that will need to be remedied at a later stage. If the Parliament had allowed adequate time to debate this legislation, we would be able to go into committee, move those amendments and have them debated and fixed now. We cannot because of the guillotine, that procedure of the Parliament that says a certain period of time, altogether too short a period of time, will be allowed to debate the Bill with no extension of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, this continues a sorry pattern in relation to corporations and securities legislation in this Parliament. When the current scheme was first enacted back in November 1990, debate was resumed after a week and the legislation guillotined through the Parliament with 39 other Bills. Eight months later, the Government did exactly the same thing with the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill of 1991. It brought the Bill on for debate a week after its introduction and guillotined it through the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) of 1991 and the Corporations (Unlisted Property Trusts) Amendment Bill 1991 fared no better. Those Bills were introduced one week and guillotined through the Parliament the next. Forty-five minutes were allowed to debate the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill and three minutes for the Bill that froze unlisted property trusts in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 215 pages in this Bill which has been allowed a total time for debate of 40 minutes. The Attorney-General cannot complain that this is the responsibility of somebody else. After all, he chairs the legislation subcommittee of the Cabinet. He is in a unique position to ensure, if he so chose, that there could be adequate and full debate in this Parliament, and he has failed to do so. Clearly, this is inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons the Commonwealth took control in this area under the current scheme of Corporations Law was so that it could be said there would be one parliament in this country responsible for Corporations Law. Under the previous cooperative scheme six State parliaments were responsible through the Ministerial Council. One of the great selling points of the new scheme, a scheme which I have supported, was that there would be one parliament responsible and indeed one Minister responsible&mdash;the Minister being the Attorney-General who I believe sometimes regrets that he is responsible for the whole of the Corporations Law now as the current scheme operates. </PARA>

That is what the Attorney-General was quoted as saying in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> earlier this week. I have in my mind's eye getting him alone without his Department and administering the same set of questions to him. I do not think he would do any better than Senator Beahan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the question of directors' duties. An exposure draft of this Bill was released in February 1992. It proposed some major changes to subsection 232(4) of the Corporations Law which deals with directors' duties of care and diligence. In addition to rewording the subsection, the Government proposed to introduce a shopping list of matters to which a court would be required to have regard in determining whether a director had breached his duty of care and diligence under the subsection. The changes proposed were hotly criticised by the Opposition and by business groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were three main areas of concern:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> first, the Government intended to introduce an objective standard for that part of the company director's duty of care which relates to skill, in the sense of knowledge, experience and competence. There was a strong implication in the explanatory paper that judges would not be required to consider the director's circumstances when determining whether the director had breached his duty of care and diligence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Effectively, the Government proposal could have set a uniform objective standard of skill for every director of each of Australia's 900,000 registered companies, which might range from the $2 shelf company to BHP. This, of course, was ludicrous. The diversity of boards of directors, consequent on the diversity of activities of Australia's companies, is inconsistent with a uniform objective standard of skill. It is nonsense to suggest that the same level of skill is expected of every director of every one of Australia's 900,000 companies. Boards, particularly of major companies, should and do include a range of skills and experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, a uniform objective standard of care for directors can work both ways. Just as it would be saying that the same skills that are required of a BHP director would be required of a $2 company, which might be an over-requirement, it could also work as an under-requirement because some companies do have specialists&mdash;they might be accountants, financial advisers or lawyers. We would expect of those people who have special qualifications that they would bring to account their special expertise in exercising their skill. We would hope, for example, that somebody who is on a board because he or she is a qualified accountant would be expected to show a little more skill in that area than the ordinary lay company director in the ordinary $2 company. An objective uniform standard of directors' duties could require too much from some people and too little from others who have been held out to shareholders, being directors of companies, as having special expertise and of whom shareholders would be expected to use their skill or competence in their particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second defect with the Government's proposed check list of factors relevant to the duty of care was that it failed to improve the clarity of the content of the duty and arguably imposed new substantive duties on directors. Thirdly, in practical terms, the check list could have led to a situation where directors addressed themselves to the process rather than the substance of their duties&mdash;where directors focused on the check list which they went through one by one rather than focusing on the substantive part of their duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After a good deal of argument, the Attorney-General came to the conclusion that his original proposal was wrong, at least in respect of the proposed check list. The proposed check list has been discarded, as has the proposal to introduce an objective standard of skill for directors. The decision to discard that proposal was the right one. It means that the Bill as it comes into this Parliament is better than the original proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has come to the position where it does not really intend any change to the law as regards directors' duty of care. While the Bill still proposes to reword subsection 232(4), paragraph 83 of the explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government considers that proposed subsection (4) does not change the law, but merely confirms the present position . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is an interesting position to have&mdash;to come to the Parliament with a proposal to change a section of an Act which is explained as not changing the law. In fact, one might really wonder why we are changing the wording of the Act if the intention is not to change the meaning of the law, which is a puzzling question. I suspect the answer lies in the fact that the Government, originally having proposed quite a major change which, as it turned out was a bad idea&mdash;in the end it was recognised to be a bad idea by the Government&mdash;still felt it had to do something, so it came to the Parliament with a proposal which it explained was not intended to change the law at all; nonetheless, it was a proposal. I think the best explanation of how this particular section came about is that it ought to be seen as a face-saver. However, it is better to be landed with a face-saver than a proposal that was more substantially flawed, as was the Government's original proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, the Government has not seen fit to include a statutory business judgment rule in the Bill. Whilst the explanatory memorandum and the Attorney-General's second reading speech endorse statements in cases such as Harlowe's Nominees to the effect that a court should not second guess commercial decisions made by directors in good faith and not for irrelevant purposes, the Government should have gone further and introduced a business judgment rule into the statute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a rule was recommended by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs which looked at this matter under the chairmanship of Senator Cooney; it was recommended by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs chaired by the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch); and it was recommended by the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee. There is no good reason why it is not included in the statute&mdash;it ought to be. The argument against it, which the Government has used, is that the courts can develop a business judgment doctrine through the case law and, therefore, there is no need to include it in the statute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In justification of that, the proposition has been put that in the United States it was the courts that developed the business judgment rule. But it overlooks one key difference, and that is that almost all of the law in this country in relation to corporations is now in the statute. Why should we leave one aspect to be developed by the common law when we have chosen to regulate nearly the whole of other corporate regulation in a statute? If the statute is intended to be a code and to codify all the responsibilities, rights and duties of a corporation, it should&mdash;if it is believed, as I believe, that a business judgment rule is desirable&mdash;include a business judgment rule as well. The fact that the Government's Bill does not include a business judgment rule means that the Bill is lacking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue I wish to raise is civil penalty provisions. The Bill also decriminalises certain directors' duties by providing that breaches of those provisions are no longer subject to criminal sections unless committed with dishonest intent. When a person contravenes one of those provisions, the court will have the power to make a civil penalty order prohibiting the person from managing a corporation for a specified period, or imposing a pecuniary penalty of not more than $200,000, or both. An application for a civil penalty order will generally be made by the Australian Securities Commission, and the matter will be tried in accordance with the civil standards of proof, the civil rules of evidence, and the civil practice and procedure. The Opposition will support these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the statute should draw, throughout the statute&mdash;not just in respect of those provisions that are dealt with in this Bill&mdash;a clear delineation between conduct that is considered criminal and conduct that is considered civil. In respect of conduct that is considered criminal, which would be conduct that involves an element of moral turpitude of some kind or another, there should be criminal sanctions and criminal procedures. In respect of negligence and the like, which involves a breach of duty but no moral turpitude, there should be civil proceedings and civil sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation should draw a distinction between civil enforcement and criminal enforcement. Once that clear distinction has been drawn and regulation has been separated, even if it is within one agency, we can avoid the situation which we most recently had of arguments breaking out between the Australian Securities Commission, which would prefer to be a civil regulator, and the Director of Public Prosecutions, which would prefer to see the ASC concentrate more on criminal proceedings, where there was a turf, an ambit or a jurisdictional argument which held back the operation and enforcement of Corporations Law and led to the most unwieldy of solutions in the end&mdash;yet another body elevated over the two agencies, the National Steering Committee on Corporate Wrongdoing. If we drew that delineation in the statute and then in the administration, we would avoid those sorts of situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now come to the part sometimes called `related party transactions', which relates to public companies giving financial benefits to related parties. The Government's proposal is to repeal section 234 of the corporations law, which deals with loans to directors, and replace it with 33 new sections dealing with financial benefits to related parties of public companies. Essentially, the provisions prohibit two types of related party transactions: that a public company must not give a financial benefit to a related party and that a child entity of a public company must not give a financial benefit to a related party of the public company. There are some exceptions to these general prohibitions, the most important being that an otherwise prohibited transaction will be permitted if it is submitted to and approved by a general meeting of the shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions have had a long gestation. In December 1989, the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee produced a discussion paper proposing legislation dealing with loans to related and connected companies, and executive and intra-group remuneration. The paper met with criticism on the ground that it did not provide an adequate justification for sweeping and complex new legislation. Nonetheless, the Committee persisted with the proposals and produced a report in July 1991 with a draft Bill of 55 pages. The report justified the proposals on the ground that dishonest related party transactions were the cause of many corporate collapses in the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By February of this year, the Government had a draft Bill; it had 60 pages of legislation on this topic. It ran into hot criticism from business groups and from the Opposition. Reliance had been placed on long and detailed black letter prescription, with the draftsmen attempting to specifically deal with every conceivable situation. The Government did not put forward hard evidence to justify the form in which the legislation stood, and the explanatory paper did not explain the necessity for the particular way in which the proposal was worked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government responded to criticisms, for which I congratulate it, by setting up a part time working party to simplify the proposed provisions. That simplification has led to the proposal which now comes before the Parliament. While the Opposition concedes that the working party has been successful in simplifying it in some respects, we are concerned that there remain serious deficiencies in the provisions. More fundamentally, there is still no clear-cut, hard case example evidence of the kinds of transactions that are sought to be covered by these proposals and no explanation as why the current provisions are unable to cover them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum almost builds a case against the proposal. It acknowledges that the real problem of the 1980s was lack of enforcement of the corporate laws that did exist. One must observe that directors of companies have always had an obligation to exercise their duties with due care and skill. If a company is giving a benefit that is on more generous terms than the market to a related company, the directors have an obligation to ensure that the interests of the giving company are looked after. There are examples in which directors properly discharging their duties brought cases to light. In the Quintex case it was the independent directors who finally belled the cat and blew the whistle on exorbitant remuneration to the management company, which brought an exposure of the affairs of that group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said before, the public company cannot give a financial benefit unless certain provisions are observed, one of which is that it is an arms length transaction and not giving a benefit that is better than market value; another is that there is a shareholder authorisation of the proposal. These provisions are very wide. The definitions of `child companies', `parent companies', and `related parties', which includes spouses, parents, sons, daughters, directors, parent entities and sibling entities, and the concept of control, which is picked up from the accounting standard, mean that there is a very wide class of transaction that can be brought into the net. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The combined effects of the definition of `indirect financial benefits' and the related party concept will mean that public companies and their subsidiaries will need to scrutinise every proposed transaction to ensure that it does not breach the Act. It will mean that these companies will require a great deal of advice and scrutiny, even where there is no suggestion whatsoever that something was being done for the enrichment of a related party, to ensure that they do not fall foul of the Act. Some less scrupulous companies will try to avoid the shareholder authorisation provisions by getting independent advice to say that this is at arms length, which is an easy way of getting around the whole transaction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other companies that will not take that way out will be forced to hold general meetings when they might be straightforward financial transactions between the companies, with all the costs that are associated with that. I believe there are other ways that we could look at to cover these sorts of situations. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One of the ways in which it might be possible to cover these sorts of situations would be to empower the shareholders themselves to take action in the name of the company where the suggestion arises that a benefit is being given to a related party at better than market value.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is sometimes known as a statutory derivative action, where a shareholder can bring an action in the name of the company to stop that benefit going ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That proposal has been regularly recommended by parliamentary committees which have looked at the matter. I believe that it is a very strong proposal. It even enjoys support from the business community, or some sections of it. It would empower shareholders themselves to scrutinise activities, and engage in a little bit of private law enforcement, if you like, in this particular area to cover those situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the insolvency reforms. As a whole, the insolvency reforms proposed by the Bill will significantly improve the law and are welcomed by the Opposition. The new procedure for the administration of insolvent companies is set out in new part 5.3A. Under that part, directors of a company facing solvency difficulties will be able to appoint an administrator, who will have the benefit of a moratorium on actions against the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary task of the administrator will be to investigate the financial position of the company, with a view to making a recommendation to a meeting of creditors about what should be done in the longer term. I believe that this will be welcomed by business, and small business in particular, as currently where a company is going down it gets into this situation: if it trades on a director could be personally liable; if it is decided to stop trading the company will go down. A company will reach a certain stage where it cannot go on and cannot go back. Many of these companies go down, particularly in small business. It is a good proposal to give another alternative. I welcome the work in relation to this issue by Mr Harmer of the Australian Law Reform Commission, which was the genesis of this proposal to give the directors another option, to call in an administrator and try to do something to keep the company going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But proposed section 436E would require an administrator to hold, within five days of his appointment, an initial meeting of creditors to possibly appoint a committee of creditors and/or to remove and replace the administrator. We are concerned that this provision will add unnecessarily to the cost and distract from the efficiency and the essential purpose of the administration. In the case of a large company placed under administration, it will be almost impossible for the administrator to hold a meeting of creditors within five days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also concerned about other aspects, such as the personal liability of the administrator. The exposure draft made an administrator responsible only for debts incurred by the administrator during the administration period, but proposed section 443A now extends that liability to `liabilities and obligations . . . whether arising under an agreement, in tort, under a written or unwritten law or otherwise'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extension of personal liability of an administrator, including the extension of liability in tort, could seriously jeopardise the whole of the administration procedure. Few good insolvency practitioners will be prepared to take on administration where they may be liable under product liability laws&mdash;the same product liability laws which the Government is ill-advisedly still trying to extend, to the eternal risk of Australian manufacturers&mdash;for product liability, environmental damage and so on. The Opposition considers that it would be best to return to the provisions in the exposure draft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note that there is no provision in part 5.3A to avoid provisions in agreements which provide for termination or modification upon a company being placed in administration. If the object of the new administration scheme is to assist in saving the business of a company, or to otherwise provide for a better result than if the company were immediately wound up, it seems to me it would be highly desirable for companies to be protected against provisions in contracts that operate to terminate or materially modify those contracts simply because the company has volunteered itself to administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to say something about proposed section 588G, which will alter the circumstances in which a director may incur liability for insolvent trading. This is the problem I spoke about before. People can be personally liable if they allow the company to trade on when they have reasonable grounds to expect that it will be unable to pay its  debts. They get into a situation where they cannot trade on and, of course, if they stop trading the company goes down anyway. The proposal is actually to stiffen that problem, because at the moment people incur personal liability if they allow a company to trade on when there are reasonable grounds to expect it will not be able to pay its debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is changing that to reasonable grounds to `suspect' that it will not be able to pay its debts. `Suspect' is a very different word; it is wider. It will mean that directors are in a much more difficult position. They will have to sit around at the board meeting and say, `Should we be suspecting something here? Let's go out and look for a suspect. Let's go out and look for a suspect transaction, because if we don't find that suspect transaction, or if we had reasonable grounds and we should have found it, we may incur personal liability'. We are concerned about that. We do not believe that that is necessary. It is something that the Government has probably not turned its mind to, and I think it ought to, and it ought to reconsider its position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of stock exchange settlement procedures, the Bill makes amendments to the Corporations Law necessary to enable the Australian Stock Exchange to introduce a new clearing house electronic sub-register system. This will make the Australian Stock Exchange more competitive internationally and speed up security settlements. The reforms will benefit Australian business and are welcomed by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the real game at the moment in respect of corporations law is simplification&mdash;re-thinking it and making sure it is a coherent whole. The Government's approach has been to knit these little patches, which it hopes one day to sew into a patchwork quilt, which when put together lack direction, lack cover and lack foresight and forethought. The great task is to start thinking back from basic principles as to what we need in our corporations law, how we are to simplify it and how we are to harmonise it to economic objectives. They will be the features of the coalition's approach in government to corporations law. We will have a complete review of the way in which it should operate as a prelude to simplification and clarification and enable the corporations law to encourage investment and recovery in the economy in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make two points in relation to the Corporate Law Reform Bill. The first question is in relation to directors' duties. This aspect of the legislation certainly did need improving. I say to the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) that there are substantial examples of directors not performing their duties. So proposed subsection 232A(4) of the Corporations Law is in my view a very important reform. I remind the House, as someone who comes from Western Australia, that the breaches of directors' duties are everywhere to be seen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also make the point that under proposed section 588G, in relation to insolvent trading, there are some cases that I am currently dealing with where there are breaches by directors of their duties, and there would certainly seem to have been breaches by directors in relation to trading while insolvent. It comes down to the situation of people losing their superannuation entitlements. In fact, they have never been paid across to a proper fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I applaud the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) for the reform in this area. I also make the point about related party transactions. Very clearly, the management companies that operated under the names of Alan Bond, Christopher Skase or Laurie Connell were there to do nothing more than milk the assets of the parent company. I believe this is a very important reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Subsection 232A(4), in relation to directors' duties, is of great substance. Directors should not be taking on the business of being a director in a corporation unless they carry with them the responsibility of carrying out their duties properly. In relation to related party transactions, Alan Bond's liquidator is trying to recover money that Bond has put into a superannuation fund to take it out of the reach of the liquidator. I believe this is a case where the public and the former shareholders want to see some justice done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general thrust of this legislation is to improve the standing of corporations law. I applaud the Attorney-General. I also make the point to the honourable member for Higgins that there are substantial consultative mechanisms now in place through the Joint Statutory Corporations and Securities Committee and the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee.

I wanted to take the time of the House to support these very important reforms in relation to directors' duties and related party transactions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards). I misunderstood my conversation with him on timing. I start where the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) finished. May I say that, apart from his usual complaining about time for debate and all the rest of it, he did at least concede late in his little outburst that this Corporate Law Reform Bill was put out for an exposure draft in February, and probably the amount of exposure and consultation that it has had is unprecedented. Although many people may find this surprising, I thought that tonight his speech was almost gracious by his standards. We had the usual performance, but at least he did concede some things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last matter the honourable member mentioned was of course the stock exchange settlements, the CHESS scheme, which was at the request of the stock exchange, and that was naturally accepted by both sides of the House. Also, I want to spend a moment or two on the Harmer reforms; that is, the general insolvency provisions in the Bill which, as the honourable member for Higgins pointed out, came out of the Australian Law Reform Commission, and the work done by Mr Harmer. The honourable member did say that as late as today some representations had been made to him on some matters, and I think probably on the Harmer matter. Those representations were also made to my office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to record how grateful we are for the enormous personal commitment that Mr Harmer has made to insolvency law reform in this country. He has continued right up until today to provide input. He has suggested a number of possible enhancements to this Bill before it is completed. The Government is looking at the suggestions, which I think were probably the matters raised with the honourable member for Higgins. It may be that some of them may be taken on board in the current Bill as Government amendments in the Senate while others may require some further public consultation, but those matters have been taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter in that area that concerns the honourable member for Higgins is the personal liability of administrators. The Harmer report considered that that question of personal liability was essential to provide assurance to persons who engage in business with a company under administration that they will be paid. In reaching that conclusion the Commission took into account various matters&mdash;in fact, there were four specific matters that it adverted to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter which the honourable member for Higgins has always shown a good deal of concern about&mdash;misplaced in my view, but he has been consistent about it&mdash;is the business judgment rule. That of course does have its origin, as he indicated, in the United States. Not even the American Law Institute&mdash;I understand the honourable member spelt out a difference between our law and that in America&mdash;has proposed that the rule be legislated for. It is extremely difficult to legislate a business judgment rule here, and the courts have recognised in this country that directors are not responsible for honest errors of judgment. That is the fact of the matter and that is, I think, where it should be left. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The courts here have always shown a reluctance to review business judgments which are taken in good faith. Honourable members opposite know&mdash;and therefore I will not quote it tonight&mdash;what the High Court said in Harlowes Nominees Pty Ltd and Woodside. It was quite clear. In part, the Court said:</PARA>

<PARA>We consider&mdash;and it is a difference between us&mdash;that the development of principles of common law liability is best left to the courts. It is noted, as the honourable member referred to it, in the explanatory memorandum that Australian courts have been prepared to exercise their discretion to excuse directors who have acted honestly and who ought fairly be excused.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have the depressingly familiar rush of primary industry Bills and, for that matter, other Bills through this House in the dying stages of the session to beat the Senate deadline. I am not critical of the Senate for having a deadline but I am critical of the Government for not being able to program its legislation better. A number of major primary industry Bills were introduced into this House last week, and several of them are being debated this evening. That means there is not adequate time to research all the detail in these Bills. Therefore, it is impossible to say definitively whether the proposals of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) are the best way to proceed in this natural resource area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in the Minister's second reading speech on the Natural Resources Management (Financial Assistance) Bill there were some positive aims. On the basis of that, the coalition is prepared to support the Bill and to monitor the progress of the consolidated arrangement. The first proposal in the Bill that the Minister refers to is his aim to combine the ministerial councils for agriculture, water and soil. His aim is to provide a more comprehensive or integrated approach to these related aspects of sustainable development in agriculture, and that certainly is a worthwhile aim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of that broad proposal is to merge the national soil conservation program and the Federal water resources assistance program into the one; and that is basically the content of this Bill. The budget for this year is to be $77m. We are talking here generally about what is commonly known to the ordinary person as land care. There are, really, separate programs. There is a separate Landcare Ltd, a private company that is in a very positive way getting in private sector finance, company finance, to further promote the total soil conservation and land care ethic, and there are the water programs that are concerned with salinity, high water tables, et cetera. They have their own community groups separate from the land care groups. In fact, because my electorate is in an irrigation area, there are far more of them than there are land care groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to one side again, although it is part of the water program generally, the Murray-Darling Basin initiative, and some of the programs coming through that. They all have the aim of raising community awareness of soil, water and vegetation problems. They concentrate on community programs more than they do on particular problems on actual farms. That is where the major action actually has to occur&mdash;on farms themselves. I will come back to that later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If these changes, or this consolidation of the legislation, simplify the application procedures and reduce the administrative delays and costs, the change will be positive because there have been confusion and complaint about this in the past. There has been a further problem in the past where the finance from these two programs has gone via the States, or through the State system, and where the States themselves have been the recipients of the programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, and I have said it for quite a number of years, far too often the States have changed their own financial arrangements for their soil conservation officers, or whatever they may be, and put them on the Federal payroll. I know of examples in my area where the responsibility for not only officers, but research programs and even sections of research stations, has been taken from the States and loaded onto Federal programs by changing the names. That is wrong. It is a farce. In the past the Federal Government has been too soft on the States, in my view, in not requiring them to maintain in real terms their expenditure that existed in those areas prior to the Federal assistance arrangements commencing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I have understood correctly the aims in the Minister's second reading speech, this is where a third element of his proposal, the partnership agreements, comes in&mdash;the Minister can make comment if he feels that this is not right&mdash;which, hopefully, will overcome or reduce this weakness. I hope that the Minister is tough enough to make sure that the States are required to maintain in real terms their own expenditure while at the same time&mdash;and this is sometimes the opposite part of the problem&mdash;not establishing too much duplication at the Federal level with regard to checking how the money is spent, applications and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Land care, in the broad term, has been bipartisan and continues to be bipartisan. But there have been times recently at particular functions when the original arrangement has not been maintained, when there has not been recognition of the bipartisan nature. Where announcements are to be made relating to an Opposition member's electorate, the practice should continue where that member is given the opportunity to make that announcement, while acknowledging that it has come from the Minister and the government of the day. I make that point because I think it is very important that a general bipartisan nature be maintained. I am pleased to have been part of the original arrangements to get that bipartisan nature. I commend the National Farmers Federation and the Australian Conservation Foundation for the work that they did in those earlier days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a concern that the level of budgetary provision for land care, in this broader term, remains flat&mdash;that is, it has not picked up in real terms. In fact, it is declining in real terms. With it comes another problem&mdash;and I am not saying that it is unique to this Government. For example, if one looks at just the last three years of expenditure, at the expenditure estimated for a financial year as proposed in the Budget for that year, and the figures in the Budget documents for the following year, which show what was actually spent, one sees that they are quite different figures. For example, in 1990-91 the Budget estimate for this area we are talking about was $88.5m, but in actual fact $73.5m was spent. In 1991-92 $70.8m was budgeted for, but $60.2m was spent. This year the Minister refers to $77m. I would hope that very close to that $77m would be spent. I recognise that it is silly to spend money for the sake of spending it just to meet a budgetary commitment if it is not sensible and cost beneficial to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at the Decade of Landcare and that figure for the national soil conservation section of around $25m a year for each of those 10 years in real terms, the actual commitment is declining. Talking again irrespective of which side of Parliament happens to be in government, I believe we have to do better than that for the remaining years of that Decade of Landcare. For a start we have a number of land care groups. I have indicated earlier that there are other types of groups as well as those referred to as land care groups; there are over 1,300 of them. They have increased dramatically. Presumably there will be further increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the money that they may want may not be able to be provided, there obviously is a continuing and growing commitment in that area. But separate to that and additional to it is the real problem of encouragement to farmers for in some cases quite costly on-farm remedial measures. This is where section 75D of the Income Tax Assessment Act has been quite important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Talking again from my electorate, which is the Goulburn-Murray irrigation area of northern Victoria, which also has some dry land problems, I am pleased that, when this Government did remove some of the tax incentives for on-farm works&mdash;for soil conservation or for irrigation improvement&mdash;the write-off in the year of expenditure for lasering and related measures was never removed. That has been tremendously important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some anomalies that have been subsequently sorted out concerning tree planting and fencing, and some things have been clarified and improved again in recent years. But just to consider my area as an example, and it is only one example of different areas around Australia, about $25m each year is being spent by farmers in lasering and the associated better drainage, as well as the better irrigation practices&mdash;more efficient water use and less drainage access to the water table that comes with that, better recirculation of the drainage, et cetera and less, therefore, into the drainage system and into the Murray. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That $25m has been spent in some difficult years, and now close to 50 per cent of the total irrigation area of northern Victoria will be covered with these improvements. That is a tremendous achievement. That really is doing more to help in the slow but sure improvement in the quality of Murray River water from that part of the State in the sense of the drainage of irrigation water that goes into the Murray than anything that has been done by communities through land care groups, SPAC groups&mdash;the salinity program action groups&mdash;or whatever we like to call them. They are tremendous groups, all of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am making is that the real action is and always will have to be on the farms themselves. If one looks north of the river to New South Wales, there is a tremendous amount of lasering going on in the rice country. That is also very important because of the particular problems for water tables with regard to rice production in certain soil types. Any on-farm activities are very expensive. We talk thousands of dollars for any worthwhile project. It is fortunate that the dairy and rice industries have probably had a better cash flow than many other agricultural industries, including some irrigation related ones of previous years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is a low cash flow it is very difficult, even with section 75D tax deductibility, the write-off in the year of expenditure, to provide any real incentive. I believe we have a challenge here to provide incentives and encouragement for those on-farm practices so they may proceed to a greater degree than they have so far. The future of sustainable agriculture in these areas and, for that matter, in dry land areas or wherever it may be in Australia&mdash;and one can think of some other areas where there has not been such a positive cash flow compared with a couple of these irrigation areas&mdash;has to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The land care programs and so forth which provide community awareness, which do very good things&mdash;and I would not knock them at all&mdash;have to be maintained in real terms. Additional policies or programs need to be put in place to ensure that more farmers are encouraged to do what they themselves would naturally want to do; that is, to improve the state of their farms so that, as every farmer would want, they can leave the farm to the next generation or sell it to whoever they wish in a better sustainable position than when they started. As I said, there has not been time to obtain the detail of all the ramifications, but some aspects of this do appear to be positive, and hopefully will be positive with regard to the future of the program. </PARA>

I would sum up this Bill by expressing it as the maturity of a phase that we have been through in recent years whereby there has been a blossoming of a whole set of programs to do with land, particularly soil and water conservation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I tend to see these issues from the environmentalist's perspective, being a member of the Australian Conservation Foundation, as I have been for a decade or more. A number of issues grew from the initiatives of farmers and conservation activists with similar concerns who worked well together over a number of years, and we have now reached a point where many of these programs have proved themselves. However, there was a need for them to be brought together under one umbrella to ensure the best return for hard-earned taxpayers' dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to comment about the considerable amount of money which this Government has devoted to these sorts of programs. These land care and water management programs are examples of what we describe as ecologically sustainable development in practice. People are actually seeking not only to till the land and make it more productive, or to keep production levels up, but also to secure a quality in the environment, as the honourable member for Murray suggested, which will enable the producer to pass on that land in a condition presumably as good as the condition in which that person found it originally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Murray used the term `the land care ethic'. This is an excellent term because this is all about changing the culture, about getting used to doing a better job of conservation while getting on with the business of making a reasonable return from the farm. A number of times the honourable member contrasted the efforts of the farmer and the costs borne by the farmer on his or her property with those borne by the land care group, which can be a combination of producers and non-producers, people in the local area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate those comments, but it seems to me to illustrate a more general point. Certainly this Government has encouraged the use of community and producer ideas and voluntary effort, and that voluntary effort has been amplified many times over by the application of public funds. We need to caution here that it is the massive application of Government funds that has brought about an enormous blossoming in the work of farmers, conservation groups and community groups on the question of conservation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me refer to some figures to give an illustration. I might say that good ideas come from the community and farm sectors. A lot of hard sweat and toil from good volunteers goes into conservation, but we will not get very far without the application of hard cash from the taxpayer. If we go right back to 1974-75 when Labor was previously in government, we see that the amount devoted to soil conservation and land care, excluding the water elements, was just $0.154m, but by 1992-93 the Budget allocation for soil conservation and land care by the Commonwealth was $26.01m, which is a substantial increase in anyone's language. There was a substantial increase between 1988-89 and 1989-90. In 1988-89 we spent $10.6m, and there was a massive jump in 1989-90 to $23m&mdash;and we have improved on those levels again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So let me make the point that I think we have used the best ideas about integrated conservation&mdash;that is, for instance, to take people in a river catchment area, a dozen farmers or producers, and have them work together on the problems of that river catchment. But all the goodwill in the world and all the best ideas in the world will not produce a great result in the end if we do not have the application of these amounts of over $20m. I congratulate the Commonwealth on that effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of groups involved in both soil conservation and better water management has blossomed. I refer particularly to the land care groups which now exist in considerable numbers. In 1991 I think 941 land care groups were established, which is an extraordinary number. I think I will have to ring some people in the Queensland office, though, because the growth in community land care groups across the States is very uneven. I note that in Queensland there are 139 groups, but in smaller States with lesser populations and probably fewer producers there are more. For instance, in South Australia there are 200 groups, although that State probably has larger conservation problems; in Victoria, 319 groups; and, in Western Australia, 345 groups. For my own interest I might take up the issue of why Queensland only has 139 land care groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, it is the maturity of the system that we are dealing with here. The Minister and the Commonwealth have been able to bring together a number of programs such as the Federal water resources assistance program, the national soil conservation program, the one billion trees program and save the bush programs as well as the community natural resource programs of the Murray-Darling Basin initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those have now been brought together, and the Bill now establishes a National Landcare Advisory Committee so that we reconcentrate our effort on the nature of integrated land and water conservation, because only if we think in these integrated terms will we actually solve the problems of the intimate relationships between the movement of water and soil and the coverage on soil, et cetera. Whilst the Bill establishes the National Landcare Advisory Committee, it also seeks to abolish the Soil Conservation Advisory Committee, which, of course, had a narrower focus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Murray also made a point often made in this place that wherever the Commonwealth seeks to introduce a new program or to lift the community's effort in an area the States often use those moneys to substitute for their own Budget allocations. I certainly hope that the States have not been doing that in this case, and I know that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy would be monitoring that fairly closely and smartly. The fact is, certainly in my experience, that wherever we write these programs we make sure that the State governments are not using the Commonwealth Government to substitute for their own Budget efforts, and nor should they. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the Opposition for its very wise support for the Natural Resources Management (Financial Assistance) Bill. I thank the Minister for his foresight in bringing together a number of Commonwealth programs. These programs, all of which have been heralded by conservation groups, the National Farmers Federation and farmers organisations, have made a significant difference to the ethic, if I might borrow the term, of integrated land care management and conservation. It means that Commonwealth taxpayers' dollars, hard won, I might say, in addition to the efforts of producers and the community and volunteers together, are really beginning to resolve some of the most difficult questions of soil, soil degradation and water quality that we have seen in this country over the years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The data-matching program, which is the basis of the legislation before the House at the moment, was introduced two years ago by the Government as a methodology for reducing the amount of fraud and overpayments taking place not only in the Department of Social Security but also in a range of other departments; in particular, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the then  Department of Community Services and Health, the Department of Employment, Education and Training, the Australian Taxation Office and, since then, the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and the State Department of Corrective Services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1990, the Government introduced the data-matching legislation into parliament to extend the use of the tax file number to enable the detection of incorrect income support payments and possible tax evasion. Since that time, the Department has so far conducted some nine data-matching cycles. Its conduct is regulated by requiring agencies to follow a six-step framework set out in the Bill. Time limits apply to the completion of the cycle and the use of certain information which affects individuals, and they are notified before corrective action is taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since December 1990, there have been two reports on the progress of the program; the first in October 1991 and the second in October 1992. At the time of the original legislation, the Opposition was concerned at the need to ensure that there was an adequate balance between the need to protect privacy on the one hand with the obvious need to ensure the integrity of the welfare system and the payment system on the other. To achieve this we agreed, with the support of the Democrats in the other place, to place in the Bill a two-year sunset clause. That was introduced to enable the operation of the new scheme, including to actually achieve savings, to be properly reviewed by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The object of the legislation tonight is effectively to end that sunset clause. That is not something which the coalition supports. We believe, in fact, that the sunset clause should continue for another 12 months&mdash;that is, until January 1994. That would give the opportunity at the end of October 1993 for a third report to be tabled by the agencies which are using this facility so that the Parliament would have the opportunity to ensure that the matching agency provisions are being adequately met, that the privacy requirements continue to be met&mdash;I should state that, as I understand it, the Privacy Commissioner is satisfied with the level of privacy at this stage and will be so reporting in due course&mdash;and also that the costings which were wrong right through the process to date can in fact be effectively justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett) claimed on 11 September this year that the social security system is `as tight as can be in a democratic society'. If this is so, the question has to be asked: how can we believe the Department's claims that it can capture an extra $153.7m this year and $213.8m next financial year if the data-matching system continues?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matching program has been in force, as I said, for nearly two years. The Department has saved $25.3m in 1991-92 compared with estimated savings of $290m in the same period, a massive shortfall by anyone's analysis. The results were $266m less than estimated; nevertheless, the Government has congratulated itself, saying, `Substantial savings have been achieved and will continue to be achieved'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The estimated savings for 1992-93 have been downgraded from $300m to $153.7m, despite a record increase in the number of pensioners and beneficiaries who are currently drawing from the social welfare system. Consequently, how can we believe the new estimates which the Minister tells us the Department can now meet. These estimates are, of course, from the Department of Finance. They are presumably supported by the Department of Social Security but, nevertheless, as we have said throughout the last two years, they continue to be grossly inaccurate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area of concern with the legislation relates to privacy. Concerns relating to privacy are important. The Secretary to the Department of Social Security has already claimed before a Senate Estimates committee that departmental officers face a `nightmare' trying to safeguard the Department's extensive databanks. The questions which this Bill generates are whether the data-matching program has been successful and whether the national interest sufficiently outweighs privacy concerns for it to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far privacy conditions have been met and the Privacy Commissioner has been cooperating with the Department on this program. We are pleased that this is so and we trust that it will continue. However, it has been reported that the Commissioner is concerned about the expansion of dealing in personal privacy information, and he has expressed these concerns to the parliamentary inquiry into the protection of personal information. Bernard Lagan from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> has reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One picture to emerge from the Lavarch inquiry is that the ICAC's findings&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the New South Wales inquiry&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">on the illegal information trade have been treated less than seriously by the Federal Public Service as it devises ways to gather yet more information on Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>The worrying thing about the ICAC inquiry in that most of the evidence suggested that the Department of Social Security was a major source of this information. Lagan also reports:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The DSS has complained that the ICAC report painted a remarkably negative picture of the security of its files on Australians and it maintained the ICAC had no evidence to support allegations of the unauthorised and corrupt release of information.</PARA>
<PARA>Nevertheless, that was the outcome of the ICAC report and we have not yet seen an adequate response from the Minister, who is now at the table, as to what the Department proposes to do about those problems. The coalition remains concerned, therefore, about erosions to privacy which may flow from the data matching programs and any other agreements the DSS may have with other departments, including now State departments such as prisons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of data matching within the Department is also worth some serious consideration. When considering the risk to privacy posed by the data matching program, the coalition is concerned that the comparatively low level of savings has not demonstrated sufficient evidence for keeping the program, especially now that the Department is down playing its importance in the whole scheme of overpayment identification measures. I gather, from a close examination of the figures, that most of the savings have come from the fact that the data matching program is now being superseded to some extent&mdash;and this is actually in the report&mdash;by other proposals which are now being utilised by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, the evidence is quite clear that much of the success of data matching has effectively come from the deterrent effect of the tax file number system. People have dropped out of cheating the system voluntarily because of the effect of the tax file number, which is not necessarily part of the same exercise. The data matching program's October 1992 report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the savings are not as high as originally estimated for a number of reasons. The most significant reason for this is the better than expected performance of the Department's other control measures. The Australian social security system is very tightly controlled and minimises, as far as possible, incorrect payments and fraud. It contains a series of filters which detect incorrect payments and fraud at various stages. The Data Matching Program is a major element in this filtering process but as other measures become more effective,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and that is the important point&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the number of discrepancies which remain for detection through data matching is reduced.</PARA>
<PARA>However, in 1990 the Minister said in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The advantages of matching data on income, family structure and tax file numbers are enormous. This facility will virtually eliminate a major cause of social security and tax fraud.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, the emphasis is clearly different to the previous statement. Senator Richardson, when he was Minister, claimed repeatedly that `$400m was being ripped off Australian taxpayers by cheats and bludgers'. Some two years later we need to ask the Department: where is this $400m? Why can it not be captured and roped in with all of this new technology and law which are at the disposal of the Department?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The data matching program was lauded as the centrepiece of the Department of Social Security's fraud identification techniques. My colleague Senator Patterson has pointed out that when the Senate proposed to change one word in the Bill the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, wrote to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) claiming that some $150m would be lost and alleged that we, the Opposition, would be held accountable for this loss. Every time Senator Patterson questioned the savings she was again given assurances that the estimates were accurate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the first data matching report was released and Senator Patterson expressed doubt about the estimates, she received a letter from the Minister for Social Security claiming that the annual savings were based on the operation of a fully implemented program and the program was not yet fully operational. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you know, action is proceeding to achieve these outcomes and the results so far suggest that when they occur, actual savings will be close to those estimated.</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 21 to repeal the Act in January 1993 was suggested by the Opposition to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . enable the operation of the new scheme, including the actually achieved savings, to be properly reviewed by Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the fact that we have had access to two worthwhile reports fully justifies the action taken by the Opposition parties, with the support of the Australian Democrats in the Senate at that time. Our scepticism was clearly justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think this Parliament has had the opportunity to review the scheme properly. The point needs to be made that while it can be said by the Minister that it has been in operation for two years, in fact that is not strictly true because much of the first year was used just getting the system into place. Therefore, we have not had a full two years of the scheme operating at maximum efficiency, which is another reason why there should be an additional 12-month period for the final review process. The current Minister stated in his second reading speech for this Bill that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . progress has been slower than anticipated in 1990 because of the time it has taken to allot a Tax File Number to every recipient of Commonwealth assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>However, the Department, in an answer to a question on notice in September this year, claimed that the recession has meant that it is more difficult for people to find work and therefore opportunities for incorrect new claims are reduced. I have some difficulty with the logic of this statement. Clearly the Government is now saying that it is the fault of the recession that not as many people are trying to cheat the welfare system and that is why the data matching program did not meet its estimates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These vague statements have not satisfied my colleagues, and the coalition therefore wants to know exactly why the savings were not met and why they were so massively inaccurate. We want to know whether the new savings can be believed, when they can be believed and what worthwhile changes, if any, will be incorporated in the foreseeable future to achieve the objectives set by the Government. We need the Government to clarify the data matching program's significance in detecting the total overpayments of the Department. We are therefore amending the Bill to extend the sunset clause for another year and to require a further report on the progress of the fully operational program in October 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the other amendments, I understand that these have been approved by the Privacy Commissioner and his staff have had an input into making these amendments. The 24-hour time limit for step 5 to take place will be increased to seven days. I think it will be necessary for this to be teased out in the Senate so that members of the Senate&mdash;regrettably, this House will not have the opportunity&mdash;can understand why seven days was chosen; why it was not longer or perhaps even shorter. The evidence needs to be before the House. Step 5 is the stage where the data matching agency puts together all the data and compares it in order to establish whether people are receiving inconsistent payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other amendment relates to the 28-day appeal period against an adverse decision. The period will not apply to decisions which arise from a mistake by the agency. I understand that the Privacy Commissioner also approves of that amendment, and my colleagues in the Opposition will not object to those proposals at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the actual report of the data matching program, I want to draw attention to two points. The Department has referred some 115 cases, identified through the data matching program, to the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration and prosecution action. When this report was tabled an additional 121 cases were being considered for referral to the DPP. A major case of multiple fraud was detected through the data matching program, and it is referred to in the report. The pensioner concerned had been receiving no less than 10 payments, using assumed names, for many years and the moneys to be recovered amounted to nearly $591,000. This is one of the biggest single cases of social security fraud ever detected in Australia. So one would have to say that, on balance, there have obviously been some advantages in the system as it currently works. But, as I have said, we need to keep it under closer examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another interesting observation in the report was in terms of the effect of the tax file number requests on the rate of voluntary surrender of payments. I made the point earlier that, for example, in 1991-92 the Department saved $8.4m as a result of clients who were sent requests for their tax file numbers voluntarily surrendering their payments in the period following issue of the letters. Because of the timing of the mail-outs, savings and outlays are apportioned across financial years. In other words, the point is that as soon as the TFN system became effective, as was expected, in its own way it made significant savings which were quite separate again from the whole question of the tax file numbering arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall be moving the appropriate amendments at the committee stage of the Bill. I urge the Government to give the Parliament the opportunity to once again review this very important piece of legislation in an additional 12 months. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in support of the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Amendment Bill 1992. I think, first and foremost, we need to look at the Government's whole belief in terms of the Social Security Act and the philosophy behind what this Government is about in terms of its delivery of programs within the Department of Social Security in particular. In fact, our Government is about targeting. In that capacity, this Government is committed to assisting those people in need&mdash;those people who are deserving of assistance and those people whom we believe have a right to government assistance. Indeed, the whole range of data matching is based on that premise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this data matching program, as the Opposition rightly points out, we are looking at the question of the Privacy Act plus the integrity of the program. However, I find it somewhat extraordinary that members of the Opposition continue to debate the whole notion of the data matching program in relation to this question of integrity when it is they who go around the countryside constantly making claims about the number of people who are in fact rorting the system and are perhaps not entitled to their payments of social security. Yet when the Government is attempting to address the issue constructively through the data matching program, yet again we see Opposition members trying to stop the program continuing and trying to create situations whereby they can block it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The data matching legislation was debated in 1990 and an amendment was moved in the Senate, and accepted by the Government, to provide a sunset clause. We have heard all of this. The idea was to take stock of the operation of the program in a reasonable time after it had commenced, given the concern about the role of tax file numbers in the program and the cooperation of so many operations in the exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I find quite extraordinary is the opposition at times by honourable members opposite to the whole question of tax file numbers. Indeed we saw quite a debate on that when they were pursued as being de facto Australia cards and a whole range of other things. At the same time, the Opposition was suggesting to us that there were many people who were receiving payments from the Department of Social Security who did not have entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is important, and what we recognise in the wider Australian community, and what in fact the Australian community is about, is a fair go. It is significant that the data matching program has not been controversial in its implementation. There has been little public comment or criticism of the operation of the program and there seems to have been no appreciable number of representations about the program. Many people who are social security recipients welcome the notion of data matching because they recognise that they have an entitlement, they believe the Government considers them to have an entitlement and they want to acknowledge that they, through the provision of their tax file number, are doing the right and correct thing. There is no doubt, partly because the program has been managed carefully but also because of the privacy protection included in the Act, that there has been very little public controversy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps it is useful at this time to look at the kinds of protections that are included in the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act. The first of these worthy of mention is section 5 of the Act which, among other things, ensures the operation of the Privacy Act alongside the provisions of this Act. The Privacy Act allows an individual who considers that his or her privacy rights have been breached to complain to the Privacy Commissioner, who can investigate the allegation and may even order compensation for loss. Thus, the Data-matching Act exists within a web of legislative protection of privacy. That is very important because, given the role of government and the role of the Department of Social Security Department and others&mdash;the Australian Taxation Office and other agencies within the whole complexity of the provisions of the Privacy Act&mdash;we need to see the data matching in that context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Act describes in detail how data matching is done. Thus an individual can find out what information about him or her from what sources is compared as part of the program. The use of tax file number data is strictly regulated by the Act. This also cuts down on freedom of movement of government agencies involved in the program. In short, they must follow the Act in doing data matching, not do what they might consider to be convenient or what many members of the public would demand, which is active pursuance of those people they believe are in breach of the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Act requires that all transfers of data between agencies are to be by means other than on-line computer connections. This is to guard against the creation of composite Commonwealth databases of personal information accessible by several agencies. The Act limits the aggregation of databases and limits agencies' access to such data as is aggregated. The Act also ensures that any aggregation of data is for a strictly limited period and purpose. That is a very important and crucial fact which is often overlooked by many in the Opposition. The Act is quite clear and specific about what it sets out to do, what it hopes to do and what it knows it can do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Act prescribes time limits for: the length of a data matching cycle; the time taken to match the data; the time taken to act on a discrepant result; and the time allowed to destroy data found to be of no use or not yet assessed. This means that data matching products do not lie around for possible fishing expeditions at will by the agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Act requires that an affected person must in most cases be notified before adverse action can be taken as a result of a data matching cycle. The affected party has up to 28 days in which to show cause why action should not be taken. Payments continue during that period. Should payment later appear not to have been warranted the money can be recovered. But in many instances the money is not recovered. I would say to members of the Opposition that it is that 28-day period which has also meant that some of the savings which it was believed we would make through the data matching were not able to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 12 of the Act deals with the obligation of all agencies to comply with data matching guidelines issued by the Privacy Commissioner under the Act and appearing in the schedule. These replicate a number of the above privacy safeguards and require the production of a program protocol by the agencies to assist the Privacy Commissioner to assess whether the program is being conducted properly. They require also a technical standards report to assist the Privacy Commissioner to monitor technical aspects. Sections 13 and 14 deal with the processes for the handling of alleged breaches of privacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Privacy Commissioner's staff have been intimately involved with the program. They have been present at crucial stages of the Data-matching Agency matching procedures and they have been satisfied that the program operates as it should. In 1991, the Department of Social Security made savings of $25.3m. It is estimated that in 1992-93, $146.9m will be saved by the Department from the program, and that figure rises to $161m. It is a fact that the 1990 forward savings estimates were higher. However, the full implementation of the program is predicated on all recipients of Commonwealth assistance having a tax file number and on clients providing their tax file numbers to the Department of Social Security. The Department has been careful to give people every possible opportunity to provide their numbers before taking any action to stop payment. This has limited the savings until this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many honourable members opposite would recognise the concerns which many of our age pensioners had in this regard. It was out of the interests of compassion and care for our age pensioner population in particular that the demands of tax file numbers for the Department of Social Security were not implemented in a heavy-handed way but taken over a period. This has, of course, limited the savings until now, but we recognise that people can be confused at times and we are prepared to ensure that their payments are made over a period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides for two other amendments to the Data-matching Act. The first of these is to extend the time available for completion of step 5 of a data matching cycle from 24 hours to seven days. We have heard some discussion about the nature of that and of the problems in relation to the 24-hour limit. Experience has shown that adherence to the current 24-hour limit is in no-one's interest. It allows only one hurried computer-run to generate match results. Should there be a minor imperfection in the match algorithm, an artificially high or unrealistically low number of discrepancies will be generated. The amendments to sections 7 and 9 to extend the time limit will allow a source agency to test sample match results and suggest changes to the algorithm so that the final results are as reliable as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Privacy Commissioner has been fully consulted on this amendment. He agrees that the current time limit is too severe, given the value of a testing element to improve the quality of the results. I think all of us would agree that what we are about is ensuring the integrity of the system while ensuring that individuals' rights are maintained. As we have said, the Privacy Commissioner is involved in this. It is crucial that we have the very best result. The amendment to move from the 24-hour limit to the seven-day limit takes cognisance of all those facts. As a government we continue to remain committed to the integrity of our Department of Social Security, because we believe that government has a very important and crucial role to play in the life of the citizens of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not believe, as many members of the Opposition do, that government has a very limited role to play in the life of the country. We are not about laissez faire. We are not about the survival of the fittest. We are about ensuring that everybody has a fair go. We are about access and equity and, as such, we are about ensuring that people who have rights have those rights maintained through the Department of Social Security, but that those people who do not have rights also need to be caught within our system. It is not in the interests of taxpayers in general or of the wider community that people rort the system, as it is commonly known. Indeed, it is simply through this data matching program that those people who, in fact, abuse the system are caught. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill amends section 11 of the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS> As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, the data matching program is part of this Government's commitment to ensuring that those people who have an entitlement through the Department of Social Security receive that entitlement and that those people who set out to abuse the rights and privileges that being a member of the Australian community brings will, in fact, be caught and not be able to participate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The data matching program has operated successfully for almost two years. It represents a practical example of a measure achieving a proper balance between the financial interests of government, the individual's right to privacy and the individual's right to protection by this Government. These amendments will ensure the program's continuation and improve the operation of the Act. I commend the Bill to this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that the Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett), in his second reading speech on the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Amendment Bill, failed to give a satisfactory reason for the repeal of the sunset clause that would have seen the cessation of the data matching program on 22 January 1993. The Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that experience with the program for the best part of two years has shown that, while for the reason outlined earlier, savings have been less than anticipated, substantial savings will be generated by the program with, at the same time strong privacy safeguards applying.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister cited the data matching program report to substantiate the continuation of the program. The report acknowledged the comparatively tiny amount of savings generated through the operations of the data matching program. The original estimates of savings touted at the time of the introduction of the principal Act were $290m for 1991-92 and $300m for 1992-93. The actual results achieved by the program were significantly less, amounting to $25.3m in 1991-92 and a downgrading of the 1992-93 estimate to $145.9m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Data-matching Agency in its report attributed the shortfall in savings to a number of circumstances. Those circumstances have already been canvassed by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), in particular the reason outlined about the recession making income matching less effective. It said that as the economy improves and employment and incomes rise, it is reasonable to expect that savings from the program will also increase. Also, there was talk of a delay in the passage of legislation which affected the timing of the issue of the request for tender for high speed matching equipment. In fact, according to the Data-matching Agency, the early cycles were undertaken using the Department's existing hardware.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not at all convinced that the privacy provisions are now operating satisfactorily, notwithstanding the Minister's claims that a balance has been achieved between the conflicting interests of protecting public expenditure and protecting individual privacy. I would have thought that the poor results in savings using the Government's own estimates as a guide require the sunset clause not only to be retained, but also to be extended, as proposed in the amendment circulated in the name of the honourable member for Bradfield, to allow proper scrutiny by the Parliament before the program continues and as it does so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to a matter of concern in my own electorate, where data matching has apparently failed. Not only has it failed, but as a result it may also have cost law abiding constituent businessmen and a valuable export industry a large amount of money in failing to provide a more satisfactory and effective method of detecting social security and taxation fraud alleged by the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Social Security to be rife amongst casual employees of the strawberry growing industry in the area to the north of Wanneroo in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 27 November 1991 Federal Police and officials from the Australian Taxation Office conducted raids, or site inspections&mdash;as they like to euphemistically term those raids&mdash;on strawberry farms operated by a number of my constituents. As a result of the raids, many of the employees fled. They had national backgrounds where there was the presence of policemen and officials, usually enforcing strict communist government policies back in their home countries. This wreaked havoc on the harvesting of the strawberry crop that was then under cultivation. This caused an estimated loss of $1.5m to those growers in the area affected by those site inspections. It dealt a telling blow to a valuable niche export market of Australian fruit to South East Asian customers, a trade valued at around $5m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of those raids or site inspections, as they are called, which came after some years of discussions about the best methods of detection of social security and taxation fraud, I wrote to the office of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) requesting information as to who was responsible for these site inspections, why they were undertaken, and what alternatives had been discussed prior to undertaking those raids or site inspections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, replied and told me that the site inspections were initiated jointly by the Department of Social Security, the Australian Taxation Office and the Federal Police. That letter also stated that nine people were charged and convicted of 12 offences under the Taxation Administration Act. I specifically asked why raids were conducted instead of using alternative methods, which I mentioned included data matching of computer records and inquiries with the Department of Social Security with which my constituents were prepared to cooperate. To this, Senator McMullan responded that `expensive data matching was undertaken prior to the site inspections'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also asked what happened to work undertaken by my predecessor, Mr Allen Blanchard, to arrive at a satisfactory resolution to the problem of stamping out the use of false identities by workers to avoid taxation and also to fraudulently claim unemployment benefits. I would like to acknowledge the work undertaken by my predecessor when he was the honourable member for Moore. Senator McMullan responded that the Taxation Office had no record of any correspondence from Mr Blanchard concerning any matters of that nature and that the Australian Taxation Office was unaware of any offers of assistance from any grower prior to the raids. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was told by my constituents that the Strawberry Growers Association had had discussions with the Tax Office officers as early as 1986. In furthering the representations on behalf of my constituents I would like to add the following comments. As asserted by my constituents, who have tried to do the right thing at all times&mdash;at all times they have asserted to me that they have undertaken to comply with the letter of the law&mdash;surely there must be a more effective way of investigating the allegations of social security and taxation fraud attributed to some casual workers employed in the strawberry growing industry; an industry that employs a considerable number of people during peak growing times?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The requests of those growers for an act of grace payment as compensation for the financial losses caused by the conducting of those raids or site inspections on their farms rather than more discreet and effective alternative methods of detection was rejected by the Treasurer. As a result of what occurred, I initiated a cooperative council in my electorate between the industry and the various agencies of the Federal Government which have an interest in the detection of alleged cheating by employees in the industry. That council comprises members of the Strawberry Growers Association; representatives from the Department of Social Security, and I acknowledge to the Minister for Social Security, who is present at the table, that his Department was cooperative in coming to help form that particular council; representatives from the Australian Federal Police; and representatives from the Commonwealth Employment Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That council, originally chaired by me, has met on a number of occasions. I will continue to take a great interest in the outcomes from its discussions and from those consultations between the strawberry growers and the agencies of the Federal Government that have an interest in the detection of the particular allegations of fraud that have been perpetrated on the Department of Social Security and the Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, there is a need for an ongoing review of the data matching program as a means of detecting cheating and fraud of government payments, as well as in the interests of protection of the rights of citizens and their individual privacy. The Opposition's support for the retention of section 21 of the principal Act not only reflects our concerns for the protection of rights of citizens vis-a-vis their privacy and the exchange of information that is pertinent to their affairs between government agencies; it gives us the opportunity to review the operations of the Data-matching Agency before the expiry of the two-year life of parts I and II of the principal Act. I support the Opposition amendment for the sunset clause to be extended to 22 January 1994, as indicated in the amendment circulated in the name of the honourable member for Bradfield. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I will take up the last general points made by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing). I welcome methods that do not have some of the effects he was suggesting in relation to dealing with the problem of social security fraud and taxation fraud, although I must say that those issues have nothing to do with data matching. None of those sorts of activities could have taken place in relation to a data matching activity. Obviously we will take on board the comments that he has made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major criticism that the Opposition has launched in relation to the proposal to remove the sunset clause has been the fact that the savings fall well below the estimates that were originally made. We accepted that. We pointed out both in the report and briefly in my second reading speech the reasons for that. I will just reiterate the reasons why those estimates were not achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first and most important reason is that the collection of five million tax file numbers from clients of the Department of Social Security was an operation that took much longer than we had anticipated. This was partly because we wanted to be particularly sensitive to that collection. Therefore, the whole system cannot be at its most effective until we have all of those tax file numbers in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, as honourable members have noted, at the same time as the data matching operation was under way, other control measures were developed. Perhaps the most important new measure was the accelerated claimant matching system. I notice that no member of the Opposition has pointed out that that accelerated claimant matching system saved $88.4m more than was estimated. That obviously affected the benefits we could have got from data matching. It should be noted that this other major program, which came in roughly at the same time, brought $88m more in savings than we had anticipated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, I point out that in recessionary times it is more difficult for people to secure other forms of income, which is the chief source of the problems within the social security system. Therefore, I think one would naturally expect that a matching system would have a reduced effectiveness because it is not so easy to get other jobs and to receive other incomes in recessionary times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, as honourable members noted, it is impossible to estimate what effect voluntary compliance had. There is no doubt that the introduction of the tax file system and the data matching system have led to an increase in voluntary compliance. There is a pattern of reasons why the estimates were not realised in this initial period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have great confidence, on the basis of what has been achieved and now that we know the system, in our ability to achieve the estimates that have now been laid down, based on this experience. We are also confident, as is the Privacy Commissioner whose officers have supervised the data matching process, that the privacy considerations in this area have been met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to take up one other issue before returning to the amendment that has been proposed by the Opposition. On the ICAC findings, which were introduced by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), the Department of Social Security and the Federal Police have looked at the cases of all DSS staff named before the ICAC inquiry. It is significant that only one Department of Social Security employee admitted to improper release of information in that inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A small group of others admitted to releasing slightly too much information under the DSS client confirmation scheme which operates to confirm to State and local authorities that a person receives Department of Social Security fringe benefits. This is to assist State and local authorities. Those were innocent releases in relation to addresses and none of those would have been amenable to prosecution. However, we do need to tighten even that system, which is designed to assist both local government and State governments, in order that people might get their fringe benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Social Security employee who admitted fault has been successfully prosecuted, and ICAC's inquiries into other Department of Social Security staff did not disclose any basis for prosecution. I and my Department do take the ICAC implications seriously, as is exemplified by the follow-up action already taken. I have asked the Department to cooperate fully with the Privacy Commissioner and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, chaired by the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), in their separate inquiries into matters related to the ICAC report. I have no doubt that my Department will cooperate in those matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the amendment that has been moved. We are confident from our experience that we will make this system work effectively. We are confident&mdash;as far as we can be confident on estimates based on our experience; and our discussions with the Privacy Commission confirm this confidence&mdash;about the way this system has enabled us to deal with privacy issues in relation to data matching. We are so confident in the system that we are prepared to accept the Opposition's amendment to allow a further period of time for the Parliament to confirm completely that this is a major weapon which we can use against fraud, not just in social security but also in a number of the other major systems. Therefore, the Government will not be opposing the amendment to have a sunset clause for another year. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is limited time available because this debate has been guillotined as part of a guillotine of no less than 51 Bills as we draw to the end of this Budget sittings, and I will have to truncate my remarks accordingly. It is a great pity that some minutes before midnight this veterans legislation has to be dealt with in a rushed way. It does not allow for proper consideration of legislation, and as a consequence quite often things slip through. We have just had amendments accepted by agreement after a period of confusion. I know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you are a stickler for the correct forms in these matters. We need time if we are to properly address the legislation before the House, including these two veterans Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the measures in the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill are welcome and the coalition will not oppose this legislation. Included in its provisions are adjustments to the defence service home loans. As the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) has pointed out repeatedly, the age of the veteran population today is such that many veterans are seeking to make practical adjustments to their residences, particularly enlarging bathrooms and altering bathroom railings. This provision represents worthy changes whereby DSH loan provisions will be extended to allow use of a loan for repairs or modifications to properties already owned by the holder of the loan. The Bill will also allow DSH loans to be used for the purpose of discharging an existing mortgage where convenient. That is a degree of flexibility which I find most satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides some special arrangements for dependants of former prisoners of war. No Australians suffered more greatly, in many ways, than our former prisoners of war, whether they were in World War II or in other conflicts, notably those who served in the Malaya campaign and in Singapore, and were subsequently imprisoned in Changi and then sent to the Burma death railway. In some cases, those who survived that were then sent by train through Bangkok to Phnom Penh, and then, by one method or another, to Saigon, loaded onto Japanese ships and shipped to the coalmines in Japan, if they were not sunk by Allied submarines in the process. There are some extraordinary accounts of those who survived both the Burma death railway and the Japanese coalmines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all the circumstances, the coalition recognises that prisoners of war, and more particularly their dependants, deserve the special recognition which is afforded them in this legislation. That is welcomed within the constraints of responsible Budget arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also included in the legislation on the Budget Bill, as opposed to the Bushell Bill, is a measure to provide, for the first time, for investments to be brought into account for the treatment of capital gains and losses from listed shares and other listed securities. This legislation is parallel to measures in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill. Some of these Bills will not commence operation until 1 September next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make the point that embedded in this legislation is a move to take into account notional gains in share prices over the course of a period and to adjust downwards in certain circumstances service pensions as far as this legislation is concerned, and age pensions as far as other legislation is concerned, where the share prices go up even though the veteran or the pensioner may not sell the shares. So it should not be forgotten, and I highlight it to the Parliament, that this legislation is introducing a form of notional capital gains tax and one which the coalition undertakes to study very carefully, especially in relation to the fairness and the actuality of the implementation of this proposal. We will examine its implementation on a technical basis when in government. We will have the chance to do that in government prior to the commencement of this Budget related measure. I highlight to the pensioner community and the veterans community that this legislation introduces the notional capital gains tax form in terms of reducing income of veterans and pensioners who have a notional gain in share values. That should not pass without comment. It will be very carefully examined by us in government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the Bushell Bill, which is actually entitled the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill. It overturns the effects of a recent High Court decision in the case known as Bushell v. Repatriation Commission. Dare I say that I have the presence of mind to suggest to the House at this late hour that it is this Bill, rather than the previous Bill, which causes the advisers box to be well staffed on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the House is considering a very serious measure. It goes to the core of a determining system and what might constitute a fair go for those who served their country during time of war. Of course, those who did serve their country in time of war are entitled to the maximum generosity that a responsible government can afford and provide in terms of all that might be made available for looking after those veterans and their dependants, the ex-service men and women of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential that the determining system be overly fair to our veterans. Many have served with great difficulty, many have been disadvantaged in one dimension or another in the period following their service. I emphasise that, to provide a fair go, the legislative framework quite often has to go that step further to ensure that people do not drop through the system and get unfair treatment. Equally, I accept that the determining system must have credibility, must be a system operated effectively, responsibly, and that is available to be accessed by the veteran but not lead to any form of rorting. I know that the veterans community and the organisations that represent it are responsible. Some of the most difficult panels constituted by the VRB and other related organisations are occupied by ex-service personnel because they have an ability to examine a claim very carefully and they are the first to deal with any erroneous claims where they are forthcoming. No-one denies that erroneous claims are made, but equally our responsibility as a parliament, and the responsibility of the government of the day, is to see that all genuine claims get genuine treatment from the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We examined this legislation against that background. There are complex legalities involved in relation to definitions. Senator Jocelyn Newman, the shadow Minister for veterans affairs, will be dealing with this legislation in more detail in the other House. There is nevertheless a suspicion that the Government has achieved a stated objective with indecent haste&mdash;namely, to overturn the effects of the recent High Court decision in  Bushell v. Repatriation Commission&mdash;but through an unintended consequence it may do something more than that. That, of course, would be of acute concern to members and senators of the Liberal and National parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context I would like to quote from two communications, the first of which is a letter from the National President of the RSL, Brigadier Alf Garland, dated 10 November 1992. I note, to his credit, that he is in the gallery at this late hour watching the progress of the debate and consideration of this legislation. On page 2 of the letter he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amending legislation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>namely, the Bushell Bill before the House&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has such linguistic and practical difficulties that it will be incapable of being applied intelligently or consistently by most decision-makers in this area, including at Board and Tribunal level. It will inevitably generate much litigation, noting that it has taken seven years to obtain a cogent explanation on how to apply the 1985 amendments.</PARA>
<PARA>It is against that background that I move on to quote from another document which has been made available to me in the form of legal advice and consideration in respect of the Bill. This document says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation is very poorly drafted and will be a field day for the lawyers. Money will be wasted in legal expenses that should have been spent on sick and disabled veterans.</PARA>
<PARA>The difficulty for members of the coalition, and members of the House more generally, is that in the circumstances of the guillotine, in the relatively short time the Bill has been made available, there has been a limited opportunity to tease out and establish in absolute form what the impact of the new definitions will be in practical terms in respect of the determining system. I know this concern is shared by the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), and by the shadow Minister for veterans affairs, Senator Jocelyn Newman, who is in the gallery at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is against that background that the Opposition will not oppose the legislation in the context of its deliberations before the House. But it will provide that the legislation on the so-called Bushell Bill&mdash;the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 1992&mdash;be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for very proper and detailed consideration, especially with regard to the legal exactitudes extracted by the Bill and what the end outcome might be in relation to this seemingly hasty drafting of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could well be that after consideration the Committee will find that the Bill does no more or no less than seek to provide for returning the system to where it stood with the original 1985 definitions. But it could also emerge that the practical impact of the definitions and amendments contained in the Bill could do far more than that and knock out those genuine cases which are seeking proper and fair determination under the determining system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is against that background that the coalition has determined that this Bill should go to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. It is not as a delaying tactic and not as a point of prevarication but as a point of responsibility to those whom we represent: veterans who served their country in a time of war and conflict. I declare an interest; I am a veteran. This is serious legislation requiring this approach from the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned at the speed with which the fundamental provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act are sought to be altered. We are concerned about the Government's total lack of consultation with the ex-service community in the formulation of the Bill. I understand and accept that there were briefings in the very late stages of the process with representatives of the RSL, AVADSC and others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To some extent there still has been a legislative process by stealth. That is a little unusual because over the years the Department of Veterans' Affairs has sought to consult comprehensively. Perhaps the argument is that, as the court's decision came down only on 7 October 1992, this process had to be truncated on this occasion. That is another reason why the Bill should go to the Senate Committee to be properly sourced out to ensure that errors which could be injurious to the veterans community are not going to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our third concern is that the Government says that this Bill will achieve the elimination of the Bushell decision&mdash;the so-called Bushell anomaly which some would argue is not really an anomaly. I simply say that I am not a lawyer and I would never seek to be a lawyer. Let me place on the record of this Parliament that I have concern at times, dare I say, that there may be one or two lawyers too many in this Parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join with the honourable member for Farrer and Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) in noting that this debate is taking place immediately prior to Remembrance Day. I suppose in Australia  greater emphasis is given to remembering on Anzac Day the sacrifices made by veterans and their families. It is very correct and proper that Remembrance Day in our country is the day when we pay just tribute to those who have served their country in a time of war. I join with the Leader of the National Party in noting this fact as we are discussing this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the most important part of this debate is the bipartisan nature of the debate on the proposals which are before the House. The Leader of the National Party has indicated that there will not be a division in this House tonight on the two Bills. He has made it clear that he has some concerns about the proposals in the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill and that it is his view that it should be investigated further by a Senate committee. I will make a few comments about the merit of that proposal later. The important point is that there will be no party political division in this House on these proposals tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One may well ask why the Parliament needs to pass legislation to overturn a decision of the High Court. It is not the first time that the Australian Parliament has sought to pass legislation altering the interpretation of Acts of parliament which govern the rights and entitlements of veterans. As a member of the Parliament elected in 1984, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware that there was a lot of debate about the proposals which were introduced during the term of Senator Arthur Gietzelt as Minister for Veterans' Affairs in 1985. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time the Government introduced legislation because it believed that a number of decisions had been made by the courts which would have virtually allowed almost every veteran who applied for certain entitlements to receive them, irrespective of the merits of each case. I know that in those days I had a number of constituents tell me that they believed that people who were not entitled to TPI benefits were starting to receive them because of those decisions by the various courts. In the past there were very strict requirements before people could receive the TPI entitlements. Because of the various court decisions during a certain period, it was clear that the tests which were being applied, or the legal standard which had to be met, were very different from those which applied both before 1980 and after 1985. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the Opposition has not sought to undo the changes that were made in 1985 demonstrates that neither side in politics in Australia will seek to go back to the situation that existed in that time&mdash;that is, after the O'Brien decision where it was virtually impossible for the Repatriation Commission to disprove some of the claims. In certain categories, virtually all applicants could be entitled to the benefits which the Parliament originally intended to be paid only to those who had genuine war caused disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the Opposition has not committed itself to repealing the changes that took place in 1985 in subsequent elections, when people such as the honourable member for Farrer were the spokesmen on veterans affairs, demonstrates that there is a bipartisan view of the Parliament that, as the Leader of the National Party said, a fair go should be given to those people who served their country in time of war. A fair go does not mean that a TPI pension is given to those with very serious disabilities and the same TPI pension given to those who have relatively less serious injuries. I know that is a view that extends across this chamber in both parties. Governments do not have an unlimited capacity to obtain money from taxpayers, and it is our responsibility to ensure that the scarce resources are directed to those who have suffered most in time of war. That is the theory behind the views that many of us put in this House, not only on this issue but on many others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is the Parliament looking at overturning the decision of the High Court which was handed down on 7 October 1982 in Bushell v. Repatriation Commission? The reason is that the advice which the Government has received argues that this decision virtually means that a person no longer has to provide a reasonable hypothesis of the relevant war service connection before a claim is granted. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that was a test which was inserted in 1985 to try to ensure that those people who have a genuine claim are successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that that requirement for having a reasonable hypothesis was inserted because of the O'Brien High Court case. That was before 1985. It was the intention of the Parliament to seek to ensure that the O'Brien case was overturned by inserting the requirement for a reasonable hypothesis. The reason we are debating this legislation tonight is that the advice that the Government has received is that the Bushell case virtually means that a person no longer has to provide a reasonable hypothesis. A person virtually has only to obtain the hypothesis of one medical practitioner qualified in that field. In those circumstances, it is virtually guaranteed that the veteran making the claim will be successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, you may well ask how much money that will cost. In the second reading speech of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), he had some estimates which, I take it, had been prepared by his Department&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Tim Fischer" NAMEID="DG4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr Tim Fischer</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Leader of the National Party points out, they are estimates. Estimates are often wrong. Estimates made by people day after day on both sides of parliament are often proved wrong as days go by. But it is certainly clear that&mdash;and I am sure the Leader of the National Party would concede me this point&mdash;if the Government and the Opposition had not voted together to make the changes in 1985, there would have been a much higher expenditure on veterans affairs than is the case today. I hope that the Leader of the National Party will concede me at least that point. It is clear that, if this legislation is passed by the Parliament, some people are less likely to be successful with their claims than if the Bushell case is simply entitled to stand unaffected by legislation in this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The estimates which were contained in the Minister's second reading speech stated that, in 1992-93, a sum of $10m to $15m would be required to provide additional program expenditure. This would rise to $60m to $105m in 1993-94 and to $235m to $440m at the turn of the century. These are quite substantial sums of money. It is right that the Parliament is seeking to discuss whether we should let the High Court decision stand, or whether we should try to ensure that, as the Leader of the National Party said, there should be a fair go for veterans so that those who have the greatest entitlements and the greatest need are those who receive the scarce resources that are available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legal advice given to the Government is that this legislation will bring us back to where we were in 1985. That is all I am prepared to accept, as a member with a very large veteran community. The Minister, who is at the table, knows that and he has given assurances that that is the advice that has been received from the experts in this field&mdash;that is, we are simply trying to go back to the position we were in when there was a requirement for a reasonable hypothesis. That situation was supported, as I said, by both Government and Opposition people in 1985. I hope we will again get bipartisan support at some time in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the National Party stated that he wished the advice given to the Minister to be tested in the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I do not have total objection to that process. I would prefer for there not to be a large loss of money to taxpayers by allowing some people who in the past would not have received TPI pensions and other claims to receive them. I hope we will not get a flood of applications going through before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee examines this issue, because it would be unfair for people who have less worthy claims to be successful today when more worthy claims lodged perhaps six months or a year ago were unsuccessful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can imagine what would happen if the Senate Committee looked at this matter and supported the Government's proposal, the law was returned to where it was in 1985 and worthy claims were again unsuccessful. If only those which were processed in a very short time, with less worthy arguments, were successful, that would be unfair to everyone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I am sure that veterans will be very keen to ensure that this matter is resolved speedily so that we have some certainty in the system. If this legislation is referred to a Senate committee I hope that it will do its job as quickly as possible, while discharging the obligations which the Senate might give to it. But, as I said, it is the advice to the Government that the proposal before the House will return us to where we were in 1985. That is something for which I  hope we can obtain bipartisan support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), I am very pleased to see that veterans and their spouses will be receiving a one-off increase on 4 February next year, an increase which has been brought forward from March. That will be welcomed by many in my electorate&mdash;an increase of $6 a fortnight for single pensioners and $10 a fortnight for married couples. As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that maintains the Labor Government's commitment to maintain these pensions at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. We are certainly determined to ensure that, unlike the Fraser years when pensions fell from 25 per cent to only 21 per cent of average weekly earnings, we maintain that target of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. Whatever happens at the next election, I will bet that because of the actions of the Hawke Labor Government and Minister Gietzelt and Minister Humphreys in veterans affairs no future government, Labor or Liberal, will ever be allowed to let that pension rate fall below 25 per cent of average weekly earnings without facing the wrath of the Australian community, pensioner and non-pensioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to compliment the Minister for introducing in this legislation proposals which will allow for a special grant of war widows pensions to the widows and widowers of certain ex-prisoners of war. I know that on both sides of this House there is a very high regard for those Australians who have served as prisoners of war in any conflict. I believe that this is special recognition which they and their spouses deserve, and something which I know will be welcomed by many. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope I can claim one or two successes in Budgets during my years in politics. One measure which I do hope to claim some authorship for is the decision to extend fringe benefits to all service pensioners. This is a proposal which has been around for many years. When I had the honour to be a member of the Prime Minister's task force on retirement incomes, I worked very hard to seek to ensure that all age pensioners and service pensioners received fringe benefits entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the social security and veterans' affairs legislation which has been discussed since the Budget we have agreed to provide Commonwealth fringe benefits to all these pensioners. The acid test will now apply to State governments to ensure that these pensioners are not discriminated against and that they receive the motor vehicle driver's licence, electricity and council rate concessions, for example, which are provided to other pensioners and should be provided to these pensioners as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure Mr Alf Garland, the National President of the RSL, who is in the gallery tonight, would be very keen to ensure that all service pensioners receive the fringe benefits to which they are entitled and that we do not have a two-tier system where some service pensioners receive full concessions and another category of service pensioners do not receive full concessions from State governments. I hope that is a principle which the various State governments around the country can adopt very quickly, because from 1 April next year the new fringe benefits cards will be provided to service pensioners and aged pensioners. I hope by that time all State governments will have ensured that all pensioners receiving those Commonwealth fringe benefits will get all the State fringe benefits as well. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2E4">Mr LLOYD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a very accurate comment. When one looks at these in total, I think it is logical to start with the income equalisation deposit scheme because the better the IED scheme, the less need there is for a rural adjustment scheme. One of the major criticisms that we have had of the Government in this whole area is that it basically ruined the IED scheme that we had put in place. In the 1970s, it started off with the drought bond scheme from the 1960s. It made changes in the mid-1980s on coming into government; it recognised the failure of that a couple of years ago by changing the scheme, but once again did not allow the scheme to operate properly. Remember that the purpose of the scheme is to encourage farmers to self-insure so that they can put money aside in good income years and take it out in years when there is a natural disaster of some form or for some other reason. There has to be an incentive for them to do that. The Government removed that incentive when it made those changes in the mid-1980s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it announced that it would be improving the scheme again, it gave 12 months notice before it commenced. Had the scheme been allowed to commence from the time of the Budget announcement, there would have been a considerable investment by wool industry people because at that time the reserve price was still in place. By deferring that introduction, the Government did very well with the provisional tax that came from the wool industry and also prevented considerable investment from the industry, which would have been to the value of those woolgrowers now and would have meant, of course, less call on the rural adjustment scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that we now have further changes to the scheme indicates that the Government has recognised the inadequacy of it. It has in fact brought in two schemes, including a farm management bond scheme as well. When one looks at the combination of the two schemes, the better elements of both could be the basis for a worthwhile scheme. First of all, if there is to be a worthwhile scheme, really there should be no withholding tax because the farmer has already paid provisional tax. In one of the two schemes, the withholding tax comes down to 20 per cent. Secondly, to be part of an incentive, there should be interest paid on as high a percentage of the investment as possible, of the deposit as possible, and that goes up to 80 per cent with one of the two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the recognition that if we are going to get more people to take on the scheme, we have to broaden the criteria. One of the two schemes reduces the minimum deposit to $1,000 and then lifts to $300,000. It has been suggested to me that $300,000 still does not take into account the big money we are talking about with the larger farmers, particularly the crop producers who require big amounts to be available to take on, if you like, a planting after a failed crop the year before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Farmers Federation, in its recommendations for a worthwhile scheme, linked what it saw as reasonable criteria, and that is why the Government has the superannuation arrangements with payment on 85 per cent of interest. Of course, the NFF also makes the point very clearly that, if we are really going to encourage people to take part in it, there is no point having a withholding tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is to be a worthwhile scheme, those points all have do be taken into account. I remind honourable members of these three points: why should a farmer get interest on only 61 per cent of the money that he deposits in IEDs when his normal tax rate would almost certainly be less than 39 per cent; why should a farmer in a desperate situation such as a severe drought pay 20 per cent withholding tax when he draws out of either scheme, when he has already paid provisional tax; and why should a farmer who experiences a personal tragedy suffer a loss of interest on 19 per cent of his farm management bonds deposit because he draws out at a time that is not designated to be a drought or a serious natural event? If we are going to be serious about this, we have to take these into account. The coalition will be announcing its policy on income equalisation deposits in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With rural adjustment, the proposals by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) in this legislation simplify the existing scheme by implementing a single interest rate subsidy scheme of up to 50 per cent subsidy on interest rate for those considered viable, and there is to be an additional interest rate subsidy in exceptional circumstances, such as severe drought, but the extent of that additional subsidy will depend on how much the States are prepared to provide. It seems to me that as usual the States are not prepared to provide too much. I believe that the States have not been as forthcoming in this scheme over the years as they should have been, and I do not say that as any criticism of the Minister about this scheme. I just think the States have not accepted their share of the responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is a simplification of the scheme with a single interest rate subsidy type operation becomes complicated because the application of the household support component&mdash;that is, for those considered not viable&mdash;is transferred to the Department of Social Security and away from the State rural adjustment authority. Household support, as now has been put forward by the Minister, recognises the failure of the Government's previous attempts to tinker with the Job Search allowance. Honourable members will recall that in this place about 12 months ago 2,000 farm families, or farmers, were to become eligible. The rural sector said at least 5,000 needed to come within the criteria if it were really to make an impact. My understanding is that eventually only about 300 came within the scheme and it has been dropped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is sensible that it has been dropped because the Government has finally recognised what we recognised as far back as 1977; that is, when one is dealing with a self-employed group&mdash;in this case the farmers&mdash;the ordinary schemes for the salaried and wage earner sector do not fit for those who are in this separate sector. That is why we went to household support and away from unemployment benefit as long ago as 1977. Of course, in those days there was not even an assets test. Since then the assets test has come in to complicate, together with the work test, the applicability of the ordinary unemployment benefit or Job Search allowance to this high capital, self-employed sector of our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, in general, the Minister's household support proposals move closer to the coalition policy and I think that is sensible. They provide some horizontal equity, if you like, between the self-employed sector and the salaried and wage earner sector by providing an income tested and off-farm asset tested equivalent for a nine-month period as a grant, provided that the farmer then leaves the farm. They also increase the rehabilitation grant to $45,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Minister for that because one of the real problems that a farmer faces in making that very hard decision as to whether or not to leave the farm property is the problem of a home for the family. This situation is quite different from a family living in a town or city where, generally speaking, the house is separate from the business and where there is still a market value for that house. In the farm  situation it would generally be absorbed onto a neighbouring property. There would be no market value for that house for practical purposes and the farmer in that situation would have no ability to provide a home for the family somewhere else without this type of assistance. I believe that is a very realistic and sensible part of the total proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are some problems with the proposal. I am talking about rural adjustment and household support together because they have to be considered as two parts of the same problem. The first problem is that by having this separation it seems to me that a decision has to be made at a point in time as to the future of that farmer. It is as if the farmer goes up to a drafting gate and is immediately drafted as viable or non-viable. I do not believe that is a fair or realistic situation. If we are taking into account&mdash;as I understand the Government is in this scheme&mdash;a greater emphasis on productivity, how do we assess productivity in a drought if a farm is facing that situation at that time or if there is a downturn in commodity prices for the product which the farmer sells? How do we calculate at that time whether a farmer would have a viable future in 12 months time?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2E4">Mr LLOYD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government should accept that if the farmer is not accepted for an interest rate subsidy he is then shunted off to Social Security for household support. I do not believe that is a fair way in which to handle a farmer in that situation. He needs time to be able to work his way through that situation. The market or climatic situation which could help to determine his future may sort itself out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I believe the breathing space that the coalition policy provides&mdash;that is, a nine months income tested welfare grant equivalent to the Job Search allowance which is not conditional upon whether or not the farmer finally leaves or not; in fact it puts our original policy of many years ago back into place&mdash;is a far fairer, more sensible and more equitable approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second problem concerns the splitting of two parts of the one problem between two different institutions&mdash;the State rural adjustment authorities and the Department of Social Security. I know that the State adjustment authorities are very happy about that because they have only the good news part. They will deal only with those people who will have viability positively determined and they can then work their way through the interest rate subsidy. I believe it is better if the farmer in this difficult situation remains with the one institution, irrespective of what part of the process he is finally placed in&mdash;whether it is viability and therefore he continues in farming, or non-viability and he is assisted out of farming. This is an area that I will be watching very closely in order to see whether it is working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no confidence whatsoever in the Department of Social Security with regard to the farm sector. This attitude comes from fairly long and bitter experience over 20 years in parliament. I have been close to these particular problems of adjustment over these years, I have been very much a part of all the problems which have confronted farmers over those years and I have seen how they have been handled by different authorities. I hope that I am wrong on this occasion, but this Government's previous scheme with regard to social security was an abject failure. One can say that that is not the fault of Social Security; it is the fault of the Government. But the total result has not been of any value to the farm sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have here a welfare equity situation which is of great concern. Farmers are in hardship situations with no real cash flow and there is a problem of putting food on the table at short notice and doing this in a way which does not prejudice them from day one with regard to their future decision making. I have many doubts about what is being proposed in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third problem concerns the drought aspect of the rural adjustment scheme. The Government has refused to implement the recommendations of the task force concerning incentives for drought proofing. It is allocating some money for management and so forth, but I say again that I do not know how someone from Brisbane, Canberra or wherever can go and talk to a Mallee farmer about risk management. I really find that laughable. I cannot think of any group of people who have had to adjust themselves to risk&mdash;climatic risk, market risk and so forth&mdash;more than people in some of our farming areas. They can be compared with people from secure employment situations who have no practical knowledge of what is confronting these people. But somehow or other as part of this scheme we will be improving the risk management of this group in our society&mdash;our farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the drought section of rural adjustment, the Minister has recognised that the Government cannot walk away completely from providing some assistance to States, and through the States to individuals, in times of severe drought. Hence there is the allocation of $14m to New South Wales and Queensland. But the Government has steadfastly refused to put severe drought back into the natural disaster arrangements. I believe that is a further weakness in the total scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that an interest rate subsidy is a reasonable way of handling, at an individual farm level, the different problems that a farmer would face in working his way through a drought. But there is a budgetary limit each year on the rural adjustment scheme and that budgetary limit cannot handle the shock loading or the additional requirements of a severe drought coming on top of the ordinary adjustment requirements through the rural adjustment scheme. In fact, the Minister acknowledged that fact by way of the additional budgetary commitment of $14m. That is why the coalition will be putting severe drought&mdash;and I emphasise that it is only severe drought, not ordinary dry periods&mdash;back into the cooperative Federal-State natural disaster arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not oppose the legislation. I believe the Minister is sincerely trying to overcome some of the problems that exist now and I commend him for the action he has taken. I doubt whether some of the changes in the legislation will work to the extent that he would hope they would work and believe that there will be a better way of handling this very difficult problem. Therefore, we will be monitoring the situation and, in government, changing the scheme where necessary and in line with the policies that we have announced over a period. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is worth noting that this legislation will pass through the House with the support of the Opposition. That is to be commended. I will not go through the detail of the legislation again. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) covered that adequately in his second reading speech. However, I would like to pick up on a few of the comments made by the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) and see whether we can clarify some of his points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that we have been dealing with modifications particularly to the rural adjustment scheme and income equalisation deposits for the whole term of this Government. There are reasons for that. I think the honourable member would understand that the starting point from which this consideration began was the scheme that had been left behind by the Opposition, a scheme that was being widely rorted through the farm sector. In my early years as a member of this Parliament and a member of the Prime Minister's country task force, we had a number of discussions with organisations such as the National Farmers Federation and it was conceded that the structures that were in place, left behind by the former Government, were a mess, along with all of its tax legislation. These were being widely rorted. It is true to say that in the initial clean-up this Government had to set in place some new basic parameters and to work through from there. Nobody could say anything other than that this Federal Labor Government has been very sensitive to these farm related income support issues during its term. That is worth noting and understanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth noting, as the honourable member for Murray did, that the States have not played the game when being given the rural adjustment scheme to administer on behalf of the Government. There have been a number of examples of the States taking grants and lending them to farmers with interest rate premiums added, and with quite strange judgments about viability. Overall they made it very difficult for the Federal Government to have a consistent and fair scheme in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can remember that when the current Minister for Primary Industries and Energy took over that portfolio, at one of his very first meetings with the Caucus primary industry committee there was a discussion about the means by which we could make adjustments to household support for farmers and their families who were suffering difficulties. A number of modifications have been made since, on the Minister's initiative, to display that sensitivity. That is demonstrated most in the formal form of the Farm Household Support Bill, which is part of this package of legislation. We have reached the point where the Government is formally acknowledging the need to recognise farm household income as a special case and to deal with it as such. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before going to the main point that I want to make&mdash;and that is, in a sense, contrasting the sensitivity of the Minister and the Government to perhaps the attitude of others&mdash;I would just like to pick up on the observation made by the honourable member for Murray about the Department of Social Security. In the last Parliament I had the role of chairing the Standing Committee on Community Affairs. One of that Committee's tasks was to do an analysis of the service provided by the Department of Social Security at the counter and office level. We found that the officers of the Department had great difficulty in dealing with these sorts of issues and particularly in dealing with the small business and farm sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is that? One of the reasons is that most income support structures&mdash;and these measure are the same, and so they should be&mdash;are based on trying to determine household net income after taking account of ordinary business expenses and the tax situation. Whenever farms are being dealt with, what we find is a broad range of, if I could use the term, corporate structures. We can have someone wander in who is still a sole proprietor but who might as well to all intents and purposes be an ordinary wage earner for this kind of treatment. We can have partnerships, trusts, family trusts and companies. We are entitled to ask ourselves: why are all these farm households structured in all these strange ways?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course there is a reason for that, and I do not need to explain it too broadly. But the simple fact is that these structures have been set up to maximise the use of whatever measures are around to reduce tax. So it becomes very difficult when, on the one hand, one is structuring one's family business in a way to minimise the income one earns in order to minimise the amount of tax one pays, but then, on the other hand, presenting to the Department of Social Security a measure that shows that that income really deserves more household income support. That is a very difficult situation for the Department of Social Security and the Government to work its way through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the measures that have evolved during the last eight years have been honest attempts to meet those changing circumstances. I noticed, for instance, in the recent round of local government capital works that substantial amounts of funds were made available to rural councils to supplement the job programs that the honourable member for Murray mentioned. Again I commend the Minister for his heavy lobbying within the government process to ensure that these second incomes could be available to the farm sector. Because most farmers are in some corporate structure or other, it is very hard for them to be recognised as unemployed. So special treatment had to be made, it has been made and, again, the treatment has been sensitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the honourable member for Murray may lack confidence in the Department of Social Security in its administration of these things, I would ask him to take note of the fact that the farm sector does present its affairs in a very difficult and technically structured way because of the various tax measures that it does its best to make the best use of&mdash;and that does make it difficult for the officers of the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I think there is a contrast here in sensitivity towards these issues. I want to make that contrast particularly in relation to the events that have occurred in Victoria today. Members of the National Party, in particular, wander around Australia telling country people that the Labor Party is totally uninterested in country areas, that it does not care about farmers, that it does not care about country people&mdash;and, in fact, I think the term that is most often used is that the Labor Party's interest ends at the end of the tram tracks in the city. Yet for the entire term of this Government, every attempt has been made to approach these issues sensitively and the legislation has continually reflected that, as does this legislation which we are debating tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened in Melbourne today? Following the change of government in Victoria, what has been the very first step taken by the new State Government, the Liberal-National Party coalition?

The Victorian Government has not taken a sensitive approach to try to address incomes and income support; it does not have fair measures to deal with these things. There has been a straight out attack on the workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry that my colleagues have been disturbed from the other activities they were involved in around the House. My colleagues have been brought in here simply because the honourable member for Murray is a little embarrassed that I am able to say in this chamber that, for eight years, various Ministers&mdash;through the Prime Minister's country task force&mdash;one after the other have worked their way through these issues of household support for the farm sector, income equalisation deposits and rural adjustment schemes. They have sensitively helped families all across Australia. We find the contrast to that with this rhetoric that builds itself into a kind of a hatred and contempt for ordinary workers who can do nothing but defend themselves; they are not people who are in trusts, partnerships, companies, family trusts and all sorts of other tax measures. Some of my colleagues were not here before, but had they been they would have heard the honourable member for Murray say that he does not trust the Department of Social Security in its administration of these schemes. What he does not understand is that just about every farm household that comes along and presents for assistance presents with some kind of fancy corporate tax scheme aimed to reduce the tax that is paid. </PARA>

Now what about finetuning it?'. That is what we have done year after year&mdash;finetune it sensitively.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because these Bills have been guillotined, it is necessary to be very brief in my remarks on the States Grants (Rural Adjustment) Amendment Bill 1992. There is a general concern in the community that the Government has inadequately responded to basic household support needs of the rural community. In the first place, the Government once boasted that its program to give cash strapped farmers access to unemployment benefits had been a turning point in rural household support. It is not and never was. The program is near to collapse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme had been designed to allow farmers to take up the Job Search allowance to see them through difficult times but official statistics show that the plan has essentially bombed. The Minister at the table, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), will recall his prediction last October that some 2,000 farmers would be eligible for the allowance. Yet, by the first week of March 1992, only 42 farmers nationwide had received the granted assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this is that the eligibility test for the scheme had been poorly designed and paid no regard to farmers' real circumstances. Unemployment benefits, as the Government ought to have realised, are inappropriate for self-employed, heavily capitalised farmers. They are frequently disqualified from obtaining assistance because of the assets tests, work tests and working capital limits which apply to Job Search allowances. As at March this year the rural adjustment authorities had received 321 applications for assessment for entry to the new unemployment scheme promoted so vigorously by the Government, but the Department of Social Security had only granted 42 new allowances to farmers across Australia. The stunningly low response rate reflects the difficulties in determining asset wealth for farmers. This has been cited over and over again as the main stumbling block for expanding the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government would have done better by farmers if it had adopted the income tested household support scheme of the National and Liberal parties. The scheme provides for non repayable direct assistance to struggling farmers and avoids the administrative nightmare which has sunk the Government's program. Rather than have farmers queue up for a battery of assets and other tests, a direct household support policy puts food on the table straightaway. That should have been the Government's priority but, instead, it has buried farmers in a bureaucratic quagmire at the time of their greatest needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, it has done the same to rural families seeking access to Austudy. What we want from the Government is not complicated rural policy, just plain commonsense. Many farm families suffer very serious hardship. They are unable to obtain any government assistance&mdash;that is, Austudy, family allowance or other household income entitlements&mdash;because they are subject to the assets test which is not in the least bit relevant to their present financial position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue has been on the political agenda for years, but the Government has refused to give ground. In these circumstances, a simple income test is all that is needed. This would ensure that welfare goes directly to those in greatest need. The Government should drop the assets test altogether and rely on the National and Liberal parties' policy of direct household support. </PARA>

We have spoken about household support and rural adjustment, but I also want to bring to the Government's attention yet again the impact of squeezing families out of the entitlements system because of the Government's approach to rural household support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plight of the Legge family was widely publicised through the pages of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekly Times</EMPHASIS> in the middle of this year. Members of that family are known to me because they are my constituents and live in East Gippsland. Their story is very common throughout the rural community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Legge family run Australia's biggest Poll Dorset stud. It is called Ridgehaven. The Legges will have to borrow money to send their eldest daughter, Ruth, to the University of Melbourne next year. The reason for this is that the Legge's income is negative, but Ruth cannot qualify for Austudy because of the assets test. This is a story that anybody representing a rural electorate comes across on a daily or weekly basis at worst. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Legge family has suffered more than its fair share of bad times. There was the drought of 1972, the cattle price collapse in 1974, fire in 1978 and flood in East Gippsland in 1990. Moreover, Mr Legge underwent a triple bypass heart operation very recently, and that cost the family approximately $15,000. During his stay in hospital away from the farm his wife and two eldest daughters helped to run the farm; the girls had to mix running the farm with their school work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Legges have pruned their debts and cut their running costs, the fact is that they still cannot afford, on their income alone, to send any of their children to tertiary education because they have a negative income.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many families in the same situation as the Legges.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the honourable member's question, I have arranged for research to be undertaken, with some difficulty and at considerable expense, into available sources of information about the Hilton bombing which occurred 14 years ago, when the Fraser Government was in office.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Apart from the Defence involvement as outlined above, the Deputy Commissioner, Operations, of the Australian Federal Police has advised me that the bomb explosion outside the Hilton Hotel involved offences against the laws of the State of New South Wales. Responsibility tor the investigation of those offences rests primarily with the New South Wales Police. Neither the Australian Federal Police, nor its predecessor the Commonwealth Police, carried out investigations into the incident.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(22) The reference was clearly not to the Protective Security Review (PSR), which was not a Royal Commission and which had reported by the date of Senator Evans' letter to Mr Griffiths. Senator Evans expressly referred to the Royal Commission on Australia's Security and Intelligence Agencies (RCASIA) which reported in December 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(23) The report of the PSR lists 26 submissions presented to it, most coming from people outside government. The PSR files, which are held in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, contain over 150 records of conversation held in association with the PSR of which some 60 were with Commonwealth personnel. A preliminary examination of this large number of documents reveals that few relate to the Hilton bombing, which is to be expected as the terms of reference of the PSR did not include an investigation of the bombing. In view of this, it is unlikely that major expenditure of time and resources on detailed research into the files will yield information pertinent to the matters which the honourable member has raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member's question mentions only the PSR. Nevertheless, I believe he may have had in mind the RCASIA and so, as I wish to be as forthcoming as possible in addressing the issues of interest to him, I add the following. An examination of the index of the Royal Commission's records (and there are over 800 files) revealed one file apparently relevant to the bombing. One document from that file has been passed to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security in the context of the inquiry referred to in part 16 above. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(24) Yes. The undertaking still applies as I have made known to the former New South Wales Attorney-General in correspondence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(25) The former Attorney-General of New South Wales requested a joint Commonwealth/New South Wales inquiry into the Hilton Hotel bombing. I did not accede to that request because, as the honourable member will see from the answers I have given above, the matter is primarily one for New South Wales. The arrangements in place in 1978 between the Commonwealth and New South Wales for the security of the Sydney CHOGRM made the physical security of the Hilton Hotel area a responsibility of New South Wales authorities. Also, the investigation of the incident, as a matter of criminal law enforcement, was and is a matter for New South Wales. Accordingly, it is clear that, if the New South Wales Government believes there is a need for further investigation into the bombing, or for investigation of its investigation so far, it has the power and responsibility to initiate any inquiry. The proper position for the Commonwealth is that, in the event that New South Wales, pursuant to its view of the matter, decides to initiate an inquiry, the Commonwealth will co-operate fully with it. That is the position which I have expressed previously, and which I now re-affirm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's position is based on its judgement that the information available at the moment does not warrant incurring the expense of a major new inquiry. Nevertheless, I assure the honourable member that, if any material were to be put before the Government which changed this situation, it would naturally be willing to reconsider its attitude to an inquiry. The Government has no conceivable interest in suppressing or frustrating any inquiry which would be likely to cast any light on the shocking events of 14 years ago.</PARA>

Without wishing to be overly prescriptive as to the nature of any arrangements that may be appropriate for any new State inquiry into the Hilton bombing, the Commonwealth's position is that it stands willing to disclose any information relevant to a State inquiry into the bombing, subject to the need to ensure that national security considerations are not compromised.
