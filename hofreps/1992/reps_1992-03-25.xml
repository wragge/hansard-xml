<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the House censures the Minister for Finance for misleading the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>I seek the support of honourable members in respect of a matter of very great significance. A censure motion which asserts that a Minister of the Crown has misled the Parliament is one of very great significance. It is a serious matter which goes very much to the heart of the democratic system and institutions in this country. To say that a Minister has misled the Parliament does raise issues, and such an assertion ought to be defended and responded to by the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), who so far in the last 24 hours has twice avoided a debate on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Ministers are to be fully accountable, this Parliament must be fully informed. Regardless of politics, regardless of political views, all honourable members on both sides of this House have an interest to ensure that at all times the House is fully informed by Ministers. Without that, we have very little in this parliamentary institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter arises as a result of a question which was put to the Minister for Finance yesterday. The question related to advice which he had received from Treasury on the impact of the coalition's Fightback proposals. In his response, the Minister for Finance attempted to provide justification for the fact that on 16 December in a press conference he made certain claims about interest rates&mdash;claims which we now know were contradicted by advice given to the Minister in a minute from Treasury two weeks earlier. In other words, he was saying one thing publicly but being advised to the contrary by his very own Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Yesterday when the question was put to him during Question Time he basically fumbled the ball and we had an embarrassed Minister unable to explain the discrepancy between what he had been saying in public and the advice that he had been receiving in private. So it was that he struggled to explain this difference. Realising the struggle that he had encountered during Question Time, he obviously went back to his office, and his advisers told him that he was in hot water. Their advice to him was that he ought to go back into the Parliament to explain himself. That, of course, is a practice which many of us have seen over the years: if you make a mistake, you go back to your office, your advisers tell you the mistake that you have made and the advice will be, `Go back into the Parliament and correct the record so that the House is fully informed'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Minister went back to his office, sat down at about 3 o'clock when Question Time finished and for 2 1/2 hours received a full briefing on this issue from his Department. He then came back into the Parliament to explain the reason why what he had said publicly was different from the advice that he had received privately. When he responded at half past five, the Minister clearly misled the Parliament. He said that the reason for the discrepancy between what he had been saying publicly and the advice he had been receiving privately was that at the time of Treasury's advice on 2 December&mdash;and I will quote from what he said yesterday at 5.30&mdash;it `did not have available to it its own analysis of the revenue side of the Fightback package'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is just plain wrong. That is wrong on the face of it, and I will demonstrate that absolutely beyond doubt. If the jury in here is not certain, I can assure you that the jury out there will be&mdash;overwhelmingly so. He went back to his office, he came into the Parliament and he misled the Parliament about the state of advice and the advice that Treasury had available to it as at 2 December. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The charge goes to three matters. Firstly, the Minister said that Treasury did not have an expenditure analysis as at 2 December; it clearly did. Secondly, he said that as at 2 December it did not have a revenue analysis; it clearly did. Thirdly, he repeated the misrepresentations he made in a press conference on 16 December about this very issue and, thereby, misled the Parliament. Not only had he misled the Australian people back in December; he compounded his misleading of the Australian people by coming in here and reaffirming to the Parliament the very misleading statements that he had made at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Mr Speaker, let me take you specifically to the words of the Minister yesterday in the Parliament which go to the heart of the issues that we are raising. By way of a response and in an attempt to clean up his embarrassed answer at Question Time&mdash;and I want to put some of this on the record so that the matter is absolutely beyond doubt&mdash;he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The whole point of the comments that I made in the press conference of 16 December was that that assumption was not one which the Government shared. It did not believe that it was a realistic assumption. The Government believed that, if the GST were introduced, there would then be a flow on of further wage increases, particularly in the context of there not having been adequate compensation paid to wage and salary earners.</PARA>
<PARA>I pause there for a moment. One of the reasons that the Minister puts to the House for the difference between what he says publicly and what he has been advised privately goes to the question of wages assumption. We are happy to have that debate and we appreciate that it is a matter of debate and argument. He then went on to substantiate further the reasons for the difference. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other point that should be mentioned in this context is that at the time Treasury did this modelling . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I pause there. This is the modelling which provided the basis of a minute of advice to the Treasurer and to the Government on 2 December. So at that time he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it did not have available to it its own analysis of the revenue side of the Fightback package; nor. . . the finance modelling of the expenditure side of the package.</PARA>
<PARA>On both of those matters, Minister, you have misled the Parliament in the most open and shut, black and white, clearest case possible. Let me take you specifically to the minutes which you tabled on 3 March in this Parliament in a debate in which you participated. I know you were swamped with pieces of paper and that maybe you had not read the minute, but there is absolutely no excuse for you, Minister. You participated in the debate just a few short weeks ago in which the two documents which we today rely upon revealed that the Treasury had this analysis prior to 2 December. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is nonsense for the Minister to make a claim to the contrary, as he attempted to do yesterday. He claimed that on 2 December Treasury did not have the expenditure side analysis available. I take the Minister to document No. 27 tabled in the Parliament on 3 March, headed `Costings of Outlays Measures'. The Minister says that the Treasury has done no modelling of the expenditure side; yet he received a minute dated 26 November, a week or so before 2 December, which shows that Treasury has not just had a cursory look at the expenditure side, but it has done it to the nth degree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) says, the document is dated November, before 2 December. Treasury did not take a quick look at the expenditure side. The document is not flimsy or superficial; it is about 170 pages, would you believe. The Minister said, `We did not have anything on 2 December'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For heavens sake, the Government could hardly get out of its offices for the paper which had come across from Treasury explaining and detailing each and every aspect of the expenditure side of Fightback. For those who are in any doubt, Table 1 is headed `Outlined Savings in Standard Cumulative Format' and goes on for pages and pages&mdash;170 pages. This document that the Minister says does not exist, and did not exist on 2 December, has 170 pages. As I say, the document is not superficial. The health portfolio has been gone over in the most minute detail on pages 263 and 264. There is also page after page on industrial relations, immigration, industry and commerce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the tables we have a description blow by blow, line by line, of the totality of the coalition's expenditure package, and the Minister told us yesterday that Treasury did not have available to it modelling of the expenditure side. It has never had so much modelling. There is more modelling than you have had hot Sunday dinners&mdash;page after page on government advertising and promotional expenditure, political grants, ministerial councils, reducing expenditure on CDEs, ATSIC, enterprise programs, cultural heritage programs and communications. Do I need to go on?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Parliament yesterday was misled in the clearest case of misleading the Parliament we could possibly ever get. The truth is that the Minister had that advice. He cannot stand here and say that Treasury did not have it on 2 December; it had it in spades to the umpteenth degree. The expenditure side is charge No. 1 and, on that charge alone, he is clearly guilty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now refer to charge No. 2. I will take honourable members back to what the Minister said yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . at the time Treasury did this modelling it did not have available to it its own analysis of the revenue side of the Fightback package. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The minute to the Minister is dated 2 December. We find in the documents, contrary to the Minister's assertion that there was nothing, that days and days before 2 December Treasury had another minute on the revenue side. Let me take the Minister to the document&mdash;document No. 25, tabled in the Parliament in the debate in which the Minister participated. It is dated 27 November, nearly a week before he reckons Treasury had nothing. It is headed `Opposition Tax and Expenditure Document&mdash;Changes in Indirect Taxation'. Again, this is not some superficial, quick, cursory glance at the issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Page 4, attachment 5, has the heading `Difference in Revenue Estimates for the GST'. It also has a heading about the black economy. In fact, it has all of the substantial issues which formed the basis of the Minister's press release of 16 December which claimed this fictitious hole of $3.9 billion. For the Minister to stand in the Parliament and say that Treasury had nothing on the revenue side as at 2 December is patently and clearly an open and shut case. It did have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just in that minute. You can go to some of these other minutes which, again, pre-date 2 December. They give a detailed analysis of things like capital gains tax and there are pages and pages on superannuation which goes to the revenue side. How can the Minister stand in the Parliament and say that Treasury did not have it when just a couple of weeks ago he tabled the documents which showed that it did have it?  It is as clear as day; it could not be clearer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Charge No. 1: the Minister said that as at 2 December Treasury had nothing on the expenditure side; but it had 170 pages. Charge No. 2: he said that Treasury had nothing on the revenue side; yet it had an 18-page document dated 27 November, which is a clear exposition of Treasury's views in respect of the revenue side. So on charge No. 2 the Minister is guilty. It is as clear as day; it could not be clearer. It is just amazing that he could go back to his office, receive that advice and then come in here and say exactly the opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Charge No. 3 goes to the Minister's re-affirmation of the misleading comments he made in a press conference on 16 December. He was caught absolutely red-handed on two issues. I rely upon only two issues today. I take you to page 2 of the transcript of that press conference. It was very hard to get this transcript, by the way. It went on walkabout yesterday. It is just amazing how pieces of paper get lost, is it not?  The transcript reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">JOURNALIST:  You basically argued today about the macro economic impact of the Opposition's package. Is the Treasury also going to model how it assumes that package would affect the economy?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">WILLIS:  I have not asked it to do so, nor am I aware that my predecessor has asked for that to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">JOURNALIST:  Don't you think that's fairly worthwhile? I mean, the issue is starting to revolve around how many jobs there are, what. . . interest rates. And, at the moment all we've got is the claims and counterclaims between you and the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">WILLIS:  I'd be quite happy for them to do that. . . it's quite clear, on the basis of what we now know, indeed, it was clear even on the Opposition's own figures. . . that the proposals from the Opposition must involve a large increase in interest rates in year 2. . .</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister said, `I have not asked them to do so, nor do I believe that my predecessor has asked them to do so'. For heaven's sake, Minister, if you read the minute dated 2 December&mdash;two weeks before that press conference&mdash;you will see that it starts with the words, `as requested'. He says, `I haven't asked them to do so and I don't think anybody else has asked them to do so'. Yet we have a minute that you tabled&mdash;you participated in the debate&mdash;which says, `as requested'. It has both the modelling and the macro impact. The second point I pick up on in respect of 16 December is this little exchange:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">JOURNALIST:  Mr Willis, that's just your assertion. Couldn't you give us some idea, or couldn't you ask your Department, what they think would happen to macro policy?  What would happen to interest rates?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">WILLIS:  Well, I'm quite certain what the advice would be.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">JOURNALIST:  Do you know that. I mean, have they told you?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">WILLIS:  No, I've not had a detailed economic discussion with my Department about this matter.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know what the nature of his discussions might have been with the Department, but he did not just have a discussion with it, he had a minute from it. He sat there in a press conference and said, `I am quite certain what the advice would be'. That is not bad. The advice was that, under us, interest rates would go down and he was deliberately attempting to create the impression that the advice would be that interest rates would go up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have been caught out, Minister. That was a clear misrepresentation. Yet yesterday you came into the Parliament and misled the Parliament by reaffirming that misrepresentation. You have been caught out misleading the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, there are a lot of other matters that flow from this Minister's duplicity on this issue, but for the case that this Minister has misled the Parliament I rely on the documents which, on the face of them, make this matter beyond doubt. The Minister claimed that on 2 December Treasury did not have an analysis of both the revenue side and the expenditure side. The truth is that Treasury did, and you provided us with the documents that show that. In fact, the documents show that it had had that material for about a week at least prior to 2 December. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know what your response will be, Minister. You have already said, `Well, you know, we were all playing musical chairs at the time'. But you are not going to rely upon that fact, nor should you, because you have a responsibility to the public at large and, regardless of the musical chairs going on at the time, the fact is that you were in this debate on 3 March at which time these documents were tabled. Yesterday you went back to your office and you must have received a full briefing on this matter. You then came into the Parliament and misled the Parliament, and that goes to the heart of our system. You have an obligation to tell the truth in this place so that we can have a fully informed debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that you have never denied one simple fact, which is the political end of this, and that is that interest rates under us will fall. That is the advice you have had and that is an objective assessment which you have received from your Department which you have not yet contradicted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have been playing games with this. This is a good policy move&mdash;the GST and Fightback&mdash;and you yourself supported it some years ago. I think you do this Parliament a great disservice when you play silly political games, when you mislead this Parliament. You deserve to be censured for misleading the Parliament. I urge the support of all honourable members for this motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say at the outset that there is no charge to answer in respect of this motion. The Opposition engaged in a scurrilous exercise in trying to make something out of an issue which it knows to be a non-issue. Honourable members opposite are desperate to try to retain some credibility in regard to their Fightback package, knowing that that package is vulnerable on a host of fronts including, of course, not only the fact that there is a $4 billion hole in it which they have never been able to make any response to, but also because its implications for monetary policy are indeed severe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis of the allegation against me is that the Opposition has a Treasury document dated 2 December which produces the results of an analysis of the key elements of the tax switch and government expenditure elements of the Opposition package using the Access Economics Murphy model, assuming that the Opposition's claims about wage behaviour under such a package were correct. It was asked to do that. That was the request: to do it on the basis that the Opposition's assumptions about wage behaviour under the package were correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was a request made for a particular purpose, but it was certainly not an indication of the Government's belief that that was the likely wages behaviour that would come with the introduction of such a package; nor do the results indicate in any way that this is the Treasury's belief.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This minute was requested to be produced on a basis which assumed that the Opposition's wages policy approach was correct. The document of 2 December reported those results. As I have said, they in no way represent either the Government's view of what wages behaviour would be under such an approach as the Opposition's Fightback policy, nor do they indicate in any way that Treasury believes that. Treasury simply did what it was requested to do. When it did that exercise it produced the outcome which showed that there were interest rate falls for a couple of years and then some subsequent increases. But essentially that is an irrelevancy in terms of how we would expect the package to eventuate, because the wages outcome is simply going to be very different from that. Let me make it quite clear what Treasury was actually doing. It said in its document:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As requested, we have attempted to simulate the main components . . . the monetary policy has been set to allow a one off increase in consumer price inflation of around 5 per cent . . . No direct wage flow-ons are allowed:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">these monetary policy and wage assumptions are critical in the simulations&mdash;ie the results (especially in the short-run) are sensitive to the assumed behaviour of monetary policy and wage outcomes:</PARA>
<PARA>But the assumption that Treasury was making was an assumption it was asked to make. In respect of further detail on that, Treasury said on page 2 of attachment A:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Adjustments were made to the wage equation residuals in order to discount wage increases for the direct inflationary impact of the GST.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Treasury is saying that when it did this model and put it through the Murphy model, it was throwing up higher wage increases as a result of this 5 per cent impact from the GST. Once it saw them it said, `That is not allowed'. It went back into the model and took those wage increases out because they are not allowed under the assumption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what sort of analysis is that? What are those opposite making out of this? Is it that it is the Murphy model pure and simple? It is not, obviously, because the Murphy model was throwing up wage increases that the Treasury went back to and took out as the assumptions on which it was asked to make the analysis did not allow for them.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So one could not say one could not have under that type of analysis further wage increases and higher levels of inflation, which of course would have great implications for the macro-economic policy stance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the basis upon which this modelling was done was the basis upon which the Opposition's assumptions were assumed to be correct in relation to wage behaviour and inflation. That is not an assumption that the Treasury shares. There is certainly no evidence in this document that that is what the Treasury believes, nor is there any belief by the Government that that would be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to actual wage behaviour, what could we really expect? Surely we could expect that we would get much different wage behaviour from that which is assumed in this document. The Murphy model itself was throwing up higher wage increases, which were then taken out. The ACTU has said that, as a result of this package, there would be additional wage claims. A total of 70 per cent of wage and salary earners have been shown by the Treasury analysis to be worse off. Is it expected that they are not going to make additional wage claims?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole assumption that the Treasury document of 2 December represents some kind of credo which the Government is locked into, and that anything we say in contradiction to that is evidence of duplicity on my part or the Government's part, is a complete and utter nonsense, a complete and utter fabrication. It is simply an analysis, a piece of advice, based on certain assumptions which Treasury was asked to use. It was asked to give us an analysis based on those assumptions. They are obviously assumptions which would not be borne out in reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no way in which I or the Government would accept that the Treasury document of 2 December represents a pure analysis of the Fightback package and the results that it is likely to achieve. On the face of it, it is not a pure analysis, because Treasury went back to the model and threw out the bits that did not accord with the Opposition's assumptions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Who has been playing with words? The other element concerns the fiscal policy stance. The Opposition is saying that the approach we have taken in respect of that is not in accord with the advice. In fact Treasury, in undertaking this analysis, made it clear that in respect of its fiscal policy analysis it assumed a $1.3 billion reduction in government expenditure in net terms for each of three years. In other words, it would happen in a balanced way over that three-year period. That is not what the Fightback package proposes. It proposes substantial cuts in the first year. It proposes cuts in expenditure, in net terms, of $3.2 billion in year one, growing to $4.5 billion in year two and falling in year three.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasury assumed that the Opposition's figuring of $4 billion net reduction in government expenditure would apply. But the analysis done by Finance indicated that there would be no such reductions; that there would be a $2.6 billion hole. Instead of there being over $4 billion in savings, the figure would be more like $1.7 billion. It was $2.6 billion short. So the assumption on which the fiscal policy modelling was undertaken by Treasury, as reported on 2 December, was not in accord with the package, either as proposed by the Opposition or as, in fact, it would have been if proper costings had been done&mdash;as they were done by Finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There would not be a $1.3 billion reduction in government expenditure for each of the three years. On the basis of the figures we only ever get a figure of $1.9 billion, and that is in year two. That figure is cumulative. In year three the amount drops back. We never get anywhere near $4 billion in savings. So the fiscal policy assumptions in this modelling are totally out of line with the assumptions which the Opposition made in its package and what they would have been if the Opposition had done proper costings, as Finance did. In regard to both wages policy and fiscal policy, the whole analysis proceeded on a basis not in accord with the reality of the Fightback package. There is no doubt that the package, as modelled, simply does not represent a package analysis which accords with reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make a couple more points quickly about what the Opposition is saying in this respect. Honourable members opposite seem very anxious to embrace this Treasury document because they see some advantage on the interest rate side of things. The document says that interest rates would go down for a year or two&mdash;even though, of course, that Treasury analysis is patently inappropriate in terms of how the package would operate. If honourable members want to be tied to that package, what about some of the other aspects of it? If honourable members opposite want to grab hold of the interest rate side and say that that is really important and that they should adhere to that because that was their advice, what about the rest of it? What about the employment side? Did honourable members look at that? What that shows is that their two million jobs&mdash;</PARA>

The analysis shows that job increases reach 30,000 or 40,000 in about year five but then drop back to zero. So, do not tell us that there will be two million more jobs. In so far as the two million more jobs has any basis at all, as you know, it comes from the application of the Murphy model, which does not include the GST; it is not even there.

The point that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) made is the point we need to focus on here; that is, that the Minister for Finance misled the House yesterday when he came into the House at 5.30 p.m. or so to make a statement. I was sitting in here at the time. The Minister for Finance did not address this issue once, yet this is the whole point of the censure motion. This is where you misled the House, Minister. Yesterday you said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Did you say that, or did you not?  Did you?  You did. Of course you said that. The whole point that we are making is that you claimed that the Treasury did not have that information available to it&mdash;that is what you said yesterday; but it did. And you did not address that issue. You spent 15 minutes on the sanctimonious, self-righteous criticism of Fightback that we get from the Labor Party now, which I must admit could be described only as risible. In that 15 minutes you did not once address the issue of this censure motion&mdash;and I must admit there it is a question of relevance. In other words, did you or did you not, or did the Treasurer or did the Treasurer not, at the time of 2 December have that analysis from the Treasury and the Department of Finance?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You said yesterday that they did not have it. Is that true?  The answer is that it is not true.

You said yesterday that the Treasurer had not received that by 2 December. That is what you said. You are wrong.

But the fact is you never answered the main question in this censure, the question about whether the finance expenditure estimates and the revenue estimates had been received before 2 December&mdash;which they had.

The Government's distributional analysis claims there will be a wages blow-out in the community if the coalition's Fightback package is introduced. You say that all these people are going to be worse off, the sky is going to fall in and so on. That is all built on some assumptions. Do those assumptions on which your distributional analysis is based include a wages blow-out? Are those assumptions included or are they not? The fact is they are not. The Treasury never assumes a wages blow-out, because it did not expect one under the Fightback package.

That is not a wages blow-out.

That is one of your great claims; but the funny thing is that, when it comes to doing a distributional analysis, it is the reverse. According to your figures, there will be a 3 1/2 per cent decline in real wages under the coalition. One of the Labor Party's greatest boasts&mdash;and it is extraordinary that its members are so proud of it&mdash;is that it has been able to reduce real wages year by year while it has been in office. It boasts that; it is very proud of it. You claim when you are doing a distributional analysis that the coalition will reduce real wages by 3 1/2 per cent a year, but you also claim there will be wages mayhem under the coalition. Come on!

You just hid it like a little boy hiding his toys under his bed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The strategy has been quite clear from day one. As soon as the Treasury documents came out, Opposition members decided they would have a three-point strategy to deal with them. First of all, they would attempt to disparage the authors. They would say that this was a political exercise. I will indicate the justification for that. Secondly, when that did not work, they would quote selectively. They would use the bits that suited them whilst they would deny the bits that did not suit them. Thirdly, they would embark on an exercise of diversions whenever they were proven to be vulnerable in this area. We only have to go back to what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had to say as soon as these Treasury documents came to light. He said:</PARA>

<PARA>He was saying that this was not a credible exercise but that it was a political put-up job, a propaganda exercise. He goes on to talk about the Treasury's GST scare campaign. The Opposition said that the Treasury forecast, particularly given the political nature of this document and the other documents which we have seen, will undermine the credibility of it in the public's eye. Opposition members said, `There is a group of political hacks over there in Treasury doing the bidding of Treasurers&mdash;not doing a proper job of work'. That is obviously not true, because today and yesterday the Deputy Leader of the Opposition gave the evidence, holding up the work of this `propaganda team' over in the Treasury, saying that this is terrific; it justifies everything those opposite have been saying about Fightback. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The style of the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) is quite different; but he is still wrong. Therefore, I want to turn to the central point of this censure motion. That is, that the way this matter has been handled by the Minister for Finance at his press conference on 16 December, at Question Time yesterday and then later in the afternoon has led to the impression being created in this Parliament and outside it that the Treasury itself, just like the Government, was of the view that the Fightback package, on its own assumptions, was wrong. Yet the Treasury clearly says that it is not, and that is the central point I want to stress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say again: the impression has been created that Treasury says that the Fightback package is wrong and misleading on its assumptions. That is wrong. The Treasury did not say that. The Treasury modelled the expenditure and revenue effects of our package&mdash;not the whole package, which is very important in relation to a point I want to make in a moment when I come to jobs&mdash;and confirmed the Fightback conclusions that there would be a fall in interest rates in the period of the Hewson government's programs, as assuredly there will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that, when the Treasury was doing that, the model threw up a wage increase, which it subsequently explicitly took out in order to model the Fightback package. It threw it up because that is a model based on years of past experience. It should have been trying to model something which is always a once over, whenever it occurs. Whenever a goods and services tax is introduced to replace a large swag of income tax, that is a once over; it only happens once. So there is no model based on past experience&mdash;a Murphy model or any other. We have to put that expected outcome&mdash;that with the once over increase there will be no boost to subsequent inflation&mdash;explicitly into the calculation, which is what the Treasury did. When Treasury did it the answer was, `There will in fact be, as we, the coalition, claim, a fall in interest rates in that period'.

<PARA>That is the position. There was no way that the model used would not throw up some wage increases, as the Minister for Finance said, but it could not possibly do otherwise. It could not be modelling the circumstances of the Opposition's case . Were there time, I would like to enlarge on the circumstances in which the Opposition will be introducing the goods and services tax. Let us look at our account of the sequence of the implementation of our program. It starts off with the implementation of our industrial relations program, which has, as its centrepiece, the conclusion of workplace agreements to increase productivity. That is the positive and central feature. The other feature of it is that there will be stronger measures against irresponsible industrial action. In a situation where everybody, including all taxpayers, will be adequately compensated, action in pursuit of wage increases merely in response to that initial price increase would indeed amount to an irresponsible industrial action. There are very good reasons, therefore, why we believe that this will be a once over effect. When you put that into the modelling, the Fightback conclusions are justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Finance also referred to the Treasury's expenditure and revenue estimates which were in fact available by 2 December. They were out in the public domain in December, we were debating them in various forums around the country. The Treasury analysis was widely known and was supposed to show a $4 billion hole: we had overestimated revenue, Treasury said, by about $1.2 billion and we had overestimated what we would achieve in expenditure cuts by about $2.7 billion. That is the $4 billion hole. In all cases, in the estimates which the Treasury came up with there were either differences in assumption, or they were based on assumptions which were just plain wrong. I expanded on that in my speech in the last week of sitting. Some honourable members might care to have a look at that. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, when discussing them, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department's analysis did not reveal any errors of the kind which have destroyed the credibility of policies in the past.</PARA>
<PARA>It still has not destroyed the credibility of those policies. The $4 billion hole is a figment of the Government's imagination. Honourable members should look at the 170 pages of analysis that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to and make up their own minds who is right. They can feed in different assumptions. We feed in, for instance, that when bulkbilling is ended there will be a very significant reduction in the overuse of medical services; they feed in a reduction of only about 2 per cent. Honourable members can make up their own minds. I invite the Australian people to make up their own minds. There is no such hole on the revenue side. The $1 billion difference is nearly all attributable to simply ignoring the black economy and not coming up with a different estimate. In the passage that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to concerning the black economy, they say, `It is unknowable. We will put in no figure'. Because one is trying to measure the immeasurable, that is no reason for ignoring the best efforts of authorities in the past, including government departments and the Treasury, to try to arrive at an estimate. But the estimate we put in, which virtually makes up that difference in the revenue estimate, is a very reasonable one. </PARA>

If you look at what it says about jobs, it is not in line with the coalition's estimate. Let me make the point&mdash;it is a bit technical maybe&mdash;that reality is very complex. It is not always possible to embrace every point in the one model, just as it was not possible to pull in a model that modelled the once over effect of the introduction of a GST. The fact is that the Treasury, referring to the simulations, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The simulations are based on our best attempts to use AEM to model the tax expenditure measures contained in the Opposition's package. The Opposition's material does not attempt to model this type of package using AEM. Rather, scenario C'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which is not precisely a model of, but its best exposition of, what the Fightback package will achieve&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">essentially drives off the assumption that micro economic reform (including the efficiency effects of tax reform) adds 0.4 percentage points to labour productivity. . . </PARA>
<PARA>And they are not going to take that into account. So the model you have got here is modelling one aspect of reality, namely, the expenditure and revenue effects, and the model in scenario C is modelling another aspect, namely, taking into account that which is central to the Fightback package, namely, the total program of fundamental structural and taxation change in land and sea transport, on the wharves, electricity pricing, communications and so on, and the potential for the extension of that to the private sector, to the achievement of best international practice in every corner of the nation. That is the central feature around which the Fightback package revolves.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Apparently now the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) has come out with the suggestion to me across the table that the honourable member for Berowra provides the substance while he provides the persiflage. Were the Opposition to actually get into government, we could rely on the Treasurer to run around the place humming tunes while his back bench actually ran the Treasury. That is a very interesting model of government from the Opposition's point of view. We are happy enough to live with that explanation as to how members of the Opposition intend to run the country. It would be of a piece with what they have had to say in recent times about the head of the Reserve Bank, what they have had to say about the Public Service generally, and what they have had to say about the media. They obviously are going to have the Government principally focus, as far as its leading exponents are concerned were they to get into office, on demonising everybody while the back bench would actually do the ministerial job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate arises out of two central problems for the Liberal Party and the coalition. One is long term and one is one which they have immediately had to confront following an embarrassing statement made by the Opposition spokesman for Treasury matters to Laura Tingle. That I will deal with in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first one comes from the fact that they have attempted to devise a total picture of their economic policy, their propositions for the reform and reconstruction of this country, around a 15 per cent goods and services tax. There is no country on earth which has introduced a goods and services tax on the basis that by doing so it is going to improve the productivity of the economy. That has not been the reason why countries have introduced a goods and services tax. They have introduced it sometimes to pay for heinous agricultural subsidies, which tends to be the case of the value added taxes that operate in Europe. The Opposition has introduced this as a revenue raising measure for general government outlays&mdash;one good way governments of the day think of getting into the pockets of the taxpayers. But nobody has ever seriously suggested until now that a goods and services tax, which fundamentally operates on the assumption that every time you add value to an article you will be taxed for doing so and you will scramble to grab that tax back from the next person who adds further value to that until it finally arrives in the hands of the consumer who actually ends up paying the tax plus an increase in price along the way which impacts on the inflation rate, actually constitutes an act that is aimed directly at improving the productivity of the economy. It is a novel theory, but it is an extraordinarily difficult one to explain to the electorate because most reasonable people cannot see that outcome. That is the central difficulty of the Liberal Party. Its members impose upon that all sorts of other objectives such as their objective which was arrived at not under any assumptions about the likely impact of the goods and services tax on the economy but by the operations of another series of their prejudices, and the Reserve Bank will be tasked to arrive at a 0 to 2 per cent inflation rate and rendered independent of government so that that will be its principle charge, not the maintenance of full employment&mdash;we will drop that from the Reserve Bank's charge. The Reserve Bank simply will be obliged to retain a 0 to 2 per cent inflation rate. They keep reiterating that. Of course, the consequences of that in the sort of environment they are talking about here would be devastating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The substance of the attack by members of the Opposition on the Finance Minister in this particular exercise goes to a suggestion that, in stating that the inevitable impact of Opposition policy would be an increase in interest rates, he was in some way misleading the House. That is the central feature of their attack. What they base that charge on is a Treasury document that we tabled here in this place which is supposed to demonstrate that, in coming forward and saying that there would be an interest rate impact from this, he was speaking outside the material that was available to him. What does this Treasury document say? It is headed `Macroeconomic implications of a change in the tax mix : AEM model simulations'. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In interpreting these simulations, the following provisos should be borne in mind.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes through a series of them and it comes to this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Monetary policy has been set to allow a one off increase in consumer price inflation of around 5 per cent in the year of implementation of GST. No direct wage flow-ons are allowed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-these monetary policy and wage assumptions are critical in the simulations&mdash;ie the results (especially in the short run) are sensitive to the assumed behaviour of monetary policy and wage outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA>I would think that the Finance Minister, or Treasurer as he was at the time, in making some sort of statement of what he thought the overall impact of the package was going to be on the inflation rate, is entitled to step aside from a simple simulation of the Opposition's model. All Treasury did was effectively replicate the Opposition's position as far as that was concerned. He was entitled to do that, and include all the other factors that Treasury had made in its interpretation of what the actual impact of a goods and services tax would be on his assessments of whether or not interest rates would rise. Indeed, the fellow who provided that model&mdash;Murphy&mdash;does himself indicate to us what would be the impact if the wages assumptions referred to there as kept out of it were in fact played into it, and what he says is this, `Unemployment rises sharply to be 2.1 per cent above a baseline after five years. This is partly due to the increase in real wages. Consumer after tax real wages are up 2.6 per cent by the end of the first year and producer real wages would be up by a similar margin. The other factor is the de facto tightening of monetary policy which sees the 90-day bill rate rise 2.3 percentage points per annum above the base line by the end of the second year'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is Murphy's own figuring of his own model if you actually include in it the sorts of wages assumptions that the Treasury would subsequently include in it were it to make a real life assessment of what the particular outcome would be as opposed to simply that model. Indeed, Murphy provides it with advice on that himself; that is to say, `Well, expect the rates to rise 2.3 per cent'. He also makes other interesting implications on employment which I will get to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that, irrespective of whether Treasury had available to it at the time its own assessments of the holes in the Opposition's GST and whether it sought to put that into the package, it chose not to do so for this particular paper. There is no element in the assessment by Treasury or Finance&mdash;on their own estimates&mdash;of the Opposition's package, the impact of the GST, that there is effectively a $4 billion hole. It chose not to include that in the way in which it treated the Opposition position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, Treasury accepted at face value in that particular exercise the Opposition's view that there would be an even spread of the impact of cuts and increases in expenditure over the four-year period, and not the front-end loaded way that was revealed when Treasury subsequently produced documents on the impact of the Opposition's proposition. So in fact the Treasury in that particular document was dealing with unreality&mdash;unreality in terms of the operation of the Australian economy overall but, above all, unreality on any reasonable assessment of what Opposition policy actually was, and unreality in terms of its own assessment of what Opposition policy means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, if the Opposition really wants to hang that particular model around its neck, I point out that there is an interesting feature of this particular piece of unreality, which is that it is assumed that, with the operation of this particular model, there would be no increase in employment&mdash;none. If members of the Opposition really want to take the totality of this picture around their necks as their proposition, then the estimate as far as employment is concerned is that there would be no increase in employment&mdash;not the two million that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has been touting about the country. But, if this particular model were to actually be applied, and if this were the outcome, then we would have two million jobs less from the point at which the Leader of the Opposition predicted we would be. Indeed, that is one of the most farcical elements of the Opposition's position as far as the goods and services tax is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the great scenario C for the GST was announced by the Leader of the Opposition, almost sotto voce, sort of mumbling under his coat, it boiled down to the good doctor saying to us all, `Well, I hate to say this to you all, but scenario C does not in fact include any modelling for the operation of a goods and services tax. But don't worry about it because everything else that goes into making up scenario C we will actually put in place'. What a ridiculous position to finally arrive at!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You are throwing this mad, massive dead cat into the middle of the Australian economy, and then you produce a set of flowery assumptions about what its impact will be! Then you have to confess at the end that the stinking dead cat in the middle of the road actually is unrelated to the flowers on either side of it, but it is essentially related to what it is that you intend to do. What you intend to do is to scoop up that dead cat and make a cat hat out of it. You will wear that cat hat down the road yourself to demonstrate what you intend to do. That stinking cat hat that you will then be wearing will mean, of course, that at the end of the day the situation will be that 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers will be worse off; the unemployment assessments that you have made are totally out of court and will not be achieved; and the inflation rate in this country will mean, inevitably, that interest rates will rise. Then you will say to the Reserve Bank, after you have been confronted by all these horrifying things, `Look, what we would really like you to do, boys, is to establish your control of the economy independent of any democratic processes. We will legislate to make you totally independent, except for one thing: we will remove from your charter the obligation to ensure the economy moves towards full employment and include simply a line which says that you must keep the inflation rate between 0 and 2 per cent'. Will that not have a doozey little effect down the line so far as people are concerned?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer might well be right in those circumstances. That actually may be the critical point. The critical point in ensuring that the outcome the Treasury has here modelled is actually achieved is that 0 to 2 per cent element, because that will actually guarantee that no jobs will be created in this economy over the next five to 10 years&mdash;none at all. If the Reserve Bank has to impose those sorts of inflation targets on top of this mess of the Opposition's GST package, then we are guaranteed to have a good 15 to 20 per cent of the Australian public whiling away their time&mdash;not on the dole queues, because they will be removed from that&mdash;in some form of starvation. That is where the Opposition would get us, and this is the central problem with Opposition policy and with the Fightback proposal. It is massive in size and utterly confused in content.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Opposition cannot handle is the fact that the Finance and Treasury departments have gone straight to the heart of the problem of the exercise and pointed out the extraordinary effects on the livelihood of the Australian people. That is a matter of some regret for Opposition backbenchers because they wished simply to follow David Lange's advice to the Opposition in the circumstances in which he figured the Opposition found itself here; that was to remain warm and breathing and to hope that government would fall into its lap. It would have been a better idea for those opposite had they attempted to do that because, in displaying their hand to the Australian public, they displayed to the Australian people a suggestion that they intend to economically devastate those people. The problem for those opposite is that the Australian people are beginning to figure this out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If anyone ought to be censured here, it is not the Minister for Finance, who has made amply clear the basis on which his comments were made. Those comments were perfectly adequate in terms of any charges made in the censure motion in this place. The people who ought to be censured are the clowns opposite who have wandered across the country presenting these absurd propositions which do not balance and which are not matched. They ought to be censured for debauching the economic debate in this country while they do that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the House take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>Over the last six months the House of Representatives Select Committee on the Print Media has conducted the most wide-ranging and exhaustive national inquiry ever conducted into the Australian print media. Over three thousand pages of written submissions were received, more than 70 witnesses appeared at public and in-camera hearings, and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> transcript exceeded 1,600 pages. During February and March the Committee spent more than 40 hours finalising our 438 page report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">News &amp; Fair Facts.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the Committee I wish to thank the many individuals, organisations and corporations who provided submissions, especially those who also gave evidence. Our five-person secretariat has had to burn the midnight oil over many months. Our thanks go to Malcolm Aldons, our Committee secretary, who was a source of much wise advice and good counsel; Sue Morton, who prepared chapters two and eight; and Sally Dunn, who assisted with most chapters and also suggested the snappy title of the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We extend our thanks also for the generosity of the Trade Practices Commission and the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics. The Committee had the benefit of the expertise of Susan Johnson, who prepared chapters five and six, and Franco Papandrea, who prepared chapters four, seven and nine and coordinated other chapters. Without the hard work during December and January of our Committee secretariat, and Franco in particular, I suspect that our report would not have seen the light of day before the end of the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report acknowledges many others who have helped the Committee, but I would like to place on record our appreciation of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard,</EMPHASIS> the Sound and Vision Office, the Parliamentary Library, the House Duplicating Service and AGPS. The Committee also appreciated the invitation from News Ltd and the John Fairfax Group to inspect their premises in Sydney and Melbourne, as this gave Committee members an opportunity to speak to some newspaper staff informally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I wish to thank the other eleven members of the Committee for their contributions. The honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) was a very able Deputy Chairman. I appreciate his very positive approach, despite my own personal disappointment at the polemic views put forward in the minority reports. Anyone reading the minority reports may underestimate the lengths to which both Government and Opposition members went in seeking to find common ground and to minimise differences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues know that, when we started this journey some six months ago, many pundits were predicting that Labor would produce three minority reports, in addition to any Opposition opinions. The fact that at the end of that journey all seven Labor members have reached agreement without dissent, while the Opposition has produced two dissenting reports, is testament to a constructive approach which those of us on this side of the House intend to ensure continues during the debate on the Government's response to our report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many ways the Committee's journey has been as important as the final report, coming as it did during the bidding for control of the John Fairfax Group. In our first meeting, the Committee unanimously resolved to request each of the bidders for John Fairfax to appear before the Committee to answer questions on oath. My aim in suggesting this course of action to the Committee was to have the bidders' promises and assurances, which at that time were being given only to merchant bankers and some interest groups, given on oath in public hearings of a committee of this Parliament. The minority report described this as a `sideshow' and went on to claim:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee in an inappropriate manner was absorbed in a matter in which it should not have been involved.</PARA>
<PARA>For the record, I point out that no Opposition member raised any objection to this course of action at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our 400-page report puts forward proposals which our Committee believes will improve competition and diversity over time by strengthening the Trade Practices Act. Our report also puts forward recommendations on limits on foreign ownership and cross-media ownership. The establishment of the Committee followed increasing debate about the concentration of ownership in the print media, fuelled by the takeover of the Herald and Weekly Times group by News Ltd in 1987 and by the appointment, of course, of a receiver for the John Fairfax Group in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report discusses various overseas inquiries which have investigated newspaper ownership concentration and made recommendations to encourage competition and diversity of opinion. However, in most cases the governments which have received those recommendations have not implemented them. We are pretty confident that that will not happen with this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the establishment of this Committee, the only major inquiry into the print media in Australia was conducted in Victoria in 1981. The Norris inquiry found a very high and increasing concentration of ownership and control of newspapers in Victoria and warned of several associated dangers. But the recommendations of the Norris inquiry were not implemented by the Thompson or Cain Victorian governments. To date, a similar fate has befallen the recommendations of the Working Party into Print Media Ownership, which reported to the Victorian Attorney-General in December 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The print media industry is not as highly regulated as the electronic media in most Western countries. In Australia, the print media industry is subject to the Trade Practices Act and cross-media ownership rules set out in the Broadcasting Act. Advice from the Attorney-General's Department to the Committee indicates that the Federal Parliament has the constitutional power to regulate corporations involved in the print media. The question which this report addresses is what, if any, additional regulation of the Australian print media is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concentration of the ownership of the print media appears to be driven by economic forces which inexorably favour monopoly newspapers in a particular market segment and group ownership of newspapers in different markets. These forces arise from economies of scale inherent in newspaper publishing. While there is some competition between newspapers and other media for both audiences and advertising, the level of competition is not high, as advertisers use the different media for largely different functions. For example, a national fast food chain which uses extensive television advertising to promote the association of its products with a desirable lifestyle would be unlikely to redirect this advertising to newspapers if television advertising rates increased. Similarly, newspaper classified and supermarket display advertisements would be unlikely to be transferred to television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's analysis of the print media was hampered by the lack of data on the industry. The Committee has recommended that the Australian Bureau of Statistics regularly collect and publish information on the characteristics and performance of the Australian print media industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian print media industry is highly concentrated. In almost every sector of the industry, one or two groups dominate in terms of the number of publications and the related circulation under their control. The highest level of concentration exists in metropolitan and national newspapers. Suburban newspapers are also highly concentrated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although ownership of the national magazine sector is widely dispersed, many magazines have a relatively small, specialised readership. Ownership of the major high circulation magazines is concentrated within two groups. A high level of concentration would not be a problem if the print media market were highly contestable. In such a situation, the mere threat of entry into the market by a new publisher would act as a constraining force on the activities of established proprietors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was general agreement that the barriers to entry are high for aspiring publishers of metropolitan or national daily newspapers, but that enterprising publishers could break into niche markets. Although there are virtually no regulatory barriers, apart from cross-media ownership rules, economic barriers to entry are relatively high, particularly for newspapers. Until a new entrant achieves economies of scale, the average cost of production and distribution will be substantially higher than those of its established competitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Readers' habits and their loyalty to established mastheads will make it difficult to attract circulation and increase the risk of failure. Furthermore, the need to commit large amounts of capital to specialised equipment and facilities means that failure would be accompanied by very large losses because the equipment and facilities are not easily adaptable to alternative uses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The high fixed cost of newspaper production, including virtually all the costs of collecting information and preparing a newspaper for printing, means that the average cost of production per copy declines rapidly with increases in the number of copies printed. This gives an established newspaper a relatively large cost advantage over new entrants with lower circulation. In addition, since advertisers favour higher circulation and are prepared to pay a premium for it, the new entrant will receive a lower return per copy sold. Similar scale factors apply to the distribution of newspapers. Additional benefits accrue to publishers of more than one publication at the same or different locations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These benefits arise from the ability to share production and distribution facilities, and other facilities and services such as computers, facsimile machines, library services, copy swapping and foreign correspondents. The Committee is convinced of the existence of formidable barriers to entry which militate against the successful establishment of new metropolitan or national daily newspapers. Entry to other segments of the print media market is not as difficult. Although the prospect of entry to magazine publishing and suburban and regional newspaper publication is less daunting, it should not be forgotten that the predominance of the major publishing groups will see new publishers entering at a distinct disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Vertical integration represents another barrier to entry to the print media industry. Some degree of vertical integration is a relatively common feature of print media groups, particularly those engaged in the publication of metropolitan newspapers. I do not need to tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, of News Ltd's investments in ANM, the only newsprint manufacturer in Australia, as well as AAP, the main independent source of news, which also shares a significant degree of control over the distribution of print media products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Vertical integration may provide substantial competitive advantages over rivals if it confers preferential access to scarce supply or facilities or access on especially attractive terms. The main advantage enjoyed by News Ltd in purchasing newsprint from ANM is security of domestic supply. The advantage, however, reflects the size and importance of News Ltd as a customer of ANM rather than the part-ownership link and is available to other customers entering into long term supply contracts with ANM. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee received no evidence that indicated ANM gave preferential treatment to News Ltd on newsprint prices or delivery times.  The Committee was concerned about the effects of the AAP pricing policy, which sets a price for each metropolitan area based on its population. That policy does not encourage new entrants and acts to reduce the cost of the news service to established producers when a new entrant seeks access to that service in that city. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, since the pricing policy does not take account of the circulation of the subscribers' publications, it generates further economies of scale for the established publication. There was no suggestion, however, that anyone had been denied access to AAP. There is no doubt that the current newsagency system provides definite competitive advantages to incumbent publishers by members of the newsagency councils. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the one hand, the advantages include the ability to influence the business operations of newsagents, such as opening hours and home delivery conditions; influence on the range of publications stocked by the newsagents; and access to customer base details for marketing purposes. On the other hand, the newsagency system encourages the carrying of a large range of publications, some of which have low circulations unlikely to be attractive to other retailers such as supermarkets. In addition, newsagents claimed that loss of exclusive areas will threaten the home delivery service. Overall, it is not suggested that vertical integration by the major publishers has been set up to deliberately discourage new entrants. Rather, it is a feature of the industry which inhibits new entry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the most important recommendations of our report, which aim to improve competition and diversity in the Australian print media. It is the view of the Committee that competition and diversity of views are inextricably linked. More sources of information are likely to offer readers wider diversity than are fewer sources. While the range of views offered by a wide circulation newspaper has to be necessarily broad, it is unlikely that such a newspaper will offer views which appeal to minorities but which may offend the sensitivities of some other readers. Also, it is likely that two newspapers will regularly interpret the same stories differently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some members of the Committee concluded that there was a connection between the unprecedented high concentration of media ownership and the lack of information and ideas in the Australian press, and that the former is likely to be a significant cause of the latter. However, a majority of the Committee considered that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the current high level of concentration in the Australian print media has resulted in biased reporting, news suppression or lack of diversity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All members of the Committee agreed that concentration of ownership is potentially harmful to plurality of opinion and increases the potential risk that news may be distorted. The Committee considered but rejected calls for some form of divestiture and the imposition of some numerical limits on the number of newspapers or magazines which any proprietor can own. The Committee decided that in addition to the argument that such drastic action would be inherently unfair, it would be difficult to implement and would raise questions about the continued viability of some units that would be created as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee therefore concluded that the preferred course of action was to encourage greater competition in the Australian print media and wider diversity of ownership over time by recommending amendments to the Trade Practices Act. The print media industry, like other industries, is currently subject to that Act. The provisions of the Act are essentially economic in nature. However, at authorisation hearings wider examination of the public benefit or detriment of proposals are taken into consideration by the Trade Practices Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee concluded that the process, as distinct from the criteria, for ensuring competition and thus ensuring diversity is adequate. However, whether the application of this process ultimately leads to adequate levels of competition and diversity depends entirely on the criteria which are used. The merger test was weakened by the Fraser Government in 1977 with legislation introduced by the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). The Trade Practices Commission has argued strongly for a tighter merger test both in evidence to our Committee and before the Cooney inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser has described the current dominance test, which his own Government introduced, as a complete and absolute disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current dominance threshold for mergers has failed to preserve a desirable level of competition in some sections of the print media, particularly metropolitan daily newspapers. Further concentration of the ownership of metropolitan daily newspapers is unlikely to be in the public interest. Consequently, the risk that it might occur has to be minimised. In doing so, we have tried to be careful that we do not introduce unnecessary distortions to market forces.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A tightening of the merger test threshold would satisfy these requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee concluded that there was very strong justification for the adoption of a substantial lessening of the competition threshold for future print media mergers. This report examined the print media industry only and therefore makes no recommendations on whether the merger test should be tightened for other industries. However, if the Government implements the Cooney report and the Martin report on banking from the House of Representatives  Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, which also recommended a tighter merger test for that industry, then our recommendation which would ensure that the competition test apply to print media mergers would have the advantage of being consistent across all industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A substantial lessening of the competition test, on its own, may not dispel community concerns about the public detriment which may result from undue concentration of print media. Diversity of opinion and truth and accuracy in reporting are of fundamental importance to the public interest. While no law will be able to guarantee these ideals totally, steps can be taken to ensure that any potential threat to them which may arise from a merger or acquisition is fully evaluated in a forum which allows all interested parties opportunities to air their concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has therefore recommended that the Trade Practices Act be amended to incorporate a new section specific to print media requiring that, during authorisation hearings, the Trade Practices Commission should examine and take account of the likely impact of a merger on three things:  firstly, free expression of opinion; secondly, fair and accurate presentation of news; and, thirdly, the economic viability of the publication if the merger does not proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee also considered that print media mergers or acquisitions which were likely to raise community concerns should be subject to mandatory notification. The report contains further details on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In chapter 8 the Committee addresses the question of editorial independence. While it considers that charters of editorial independence offer something which may be desirable, the Committee has concluded that newspaper proprietors should not be required by legislation to sign charters of editorial independence. Rather, the Committee has concluded that the AJA code of ethics provided a practical framework for editorial independence. It believes that proprietors and editors should join with journalists in agreeing to adopt the code as the overriding principles governing the performance of their duties and that consideration should be given to having that code incorporated in contracts of employment in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also contains a proposal for restructuring the Australian Press Council. It believes that there is a perception that the current structure is not working, particularly since the AJA terminated its involvement in 1987. Further details are contained in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On cross-media ownership, the Committee has determined that both print and electronic media have the power to influence public opinion. Cross-media ownership rules which limit common ownership of television, radio and newspapers have been very effective in breaking up the conglomerates which existed before 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment national newspapers are not included and a majority of the Committee members are not proposing that they be included. Some members of the Committee argued strongly that a zero or 5 per cent limit should apply to cross-media ownership but, in the final analysis, the Committee agreed that the emphasis should be placed on whether or not control was being exercised, as proposed in the draft Broadcasting Services Bill. The Committee strongly supports the retention of the cross-media ownership rules, including those which apply to radio. However, the Government may need to review this matter as new technology expands the number of radio services available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of foreign investment, the Committee considered that it is contradictory to seek increased diversity of newspaper ownership on the one hand whilst, at the same time, seeking to prohibit any foreign investment in Australian newspapers. Such a ban is not practical. The Committee recommended that the FIRB continue to examine all foreign investment proposals in the print media. The Committee also recommended that, subject to normal national interest requirements, proposals of up to 20 per cent foreign control should be approved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recognises that the present 20 per cent limit on foreign ownership is an arbitrary figure consistent with the arbitrary figure for television. However, it is of concern to some members of the Committee that that has become a benchmark figure. The best reason for using such a figure is that it acts as a guideline for prospective investors but alerts them to the important policy considerations of this issue. The 20 per cent limit should be viewed in this context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposals involving higher levels of foreign control should be approved only if the Government believes that a strong case has been made that it is in the national interest or that other arguments apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, given the importance of the print media, the Committee considers that the Treasurer should always publish reasons for accepting or rejecting proposals for foreign investment in the print media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope these wide-ranging recommendations have the support of every member of this side of the House and that they will be speedily implemented by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Deputy Chairman of the Select Committee on the Print Media, I have to give the Chairman of the Committee a word of congratulations. This was a very difficult political and, indeed, physical task to complete in the very short timeframe which was reluctantly extended by the Government. From our point of view, the Committee has produced a report that will add greatly to the level of debate about the media industry and particularly the print industry in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend to speak for a long period of time because other Committee members also want to contribute, but I think that there are some remarks that need to be made. I would like to put on record, on behalf of the coalition members, the thanks that need to be extended to the Committee staff. The honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has already done so and I join him in those remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report required a great deal of economic analysis. There was a massive number of submissions and the Committee thanks all those people who made submissions. The task required work above and beyond the normal demands on staff. Of the many reports I have been involved in, this was certainly the most challenging for staff, and indeed members, in its complexity and in the breadth of the issues that the Committee had to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it would be fair to say that I am a person possessed of a generous spirit. I do not want to enter into discussion of some of the remarks that were made by the Chairman about the polemic nature of the dissenting report other than to say that I guess that in respect of this industry, like no other, the differences of opinion within the community were brought to bear in this Committee. How Committee members respectively deal with these differences of opinion is a matter for their own particular judgment. It reflects not on the personalities of the people involved; it reflects on the sharpness of focus that one has to bring to bear in assessing these issues. It is a matter of how best we deal with what we have jointly identified as a potential problem, and that is that increasing concentration in print media undermines the plurality of opinions that need to be seen in a functioning democracy, which all of us in the place take pride in working with and for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that point, I think we can dismiss some of the more pointed remarks that I am sure will be made today and try to concentrate on what the broad issue was. The issue was how one addresses, in a competition policy sense, the question of ensuring that there is going to be a diversity of opinion through the mechanism of the print media and how one ensures that those who own the print media, when they move into other media, do not use that position&mdash;and it is only potential&mdash;to direct the formation of opinion in a way that would not be in the long term interest of the development of our democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate about how to do this is really brought together in this report, but it is an ongoing debate. It has been going for some considerable time. The first report that dealt with this was the report of the 1989 inquiry into mergers, takeovers and monopolies. It made a recommendation that there should be no mandatory notification of an intent to merge and that the test, the dominance test to which the Chairman referred, ought to stay where it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a more recent report that went in another direction. If one looks at the Trade Practices Commission's recent bulletin, one will see an interesting article by the Deputy Chairman of the Commission, Professor Johns, in which he responds to Dr Pengilley, a former TPC member who took a contrary view. The immediate past Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission, Professor Baxt, took a different view. I want to make the point that this issue is still being debated. In evidence to the Committee we got various views, from sources ranging from Attorney-General's to Treasury. The Business Council of Australia has a view that the test ought to stay as it is. On that central issue which the Chairman has identified, chapter 7, there are still many and varied views. The Opposition puts its view in the dissenting report, which my colleague the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), the shadow Minister for this area, will detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I may go back to the broader issue, there was clearly a cocktail of interests that had to be addressed. That in itself, at the time the Committee was established, was all to the fore and generated great community interest. Of course, the Committee was established to deal in part with the factional difficulties of the ALP that grew out of the national convention in Hobart. At the time the Committee was established back in August 1991, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> recorded the Opposition's view: that we felt that this was the wrong inquiry for the wrong reasons at the wrong time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to say that it was not necessary that the issues be dealt with; it was. Back in 1989 I, as a member of the Parliament, raised with the then Attorney, Mr Lionel Bowen, and the subsequent Attorney, Mr Duffy, the issue of the Commonwealth's role in the print media. We finally got to this report but we were driven by the necessity for this report because of the dilemmas that the ALP faced within its factional make-up at the time prior to the change of prime ministership. I think that is the fundamental concern that we expressed in the dissent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if we step beyond that and go to the centrality of the issues&mdash;and of course we have a different view about the question of competition test&mdash;the whole debate about Fairfax was subject to great discussion by this Committee. We had before us some of the big men of Australian politics and Australian business. They were obviously flexible in their views. To see a former Prime Minister stating in evidence that decisions he had made whilst Prime Minister were something that he now regretted was, of course, of interest, but it shows the fluid position of this area of policy and the difficulties which we as a Parliament have to grapple with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But whether we should have this inquiry right at the time of the Fairfax bid&mdash;the biggest business battle for a considerable number of years in this country&mdash;was something that, of course, this Committee could not decide. We were put in the position&mdash;right or wrong, I think it is regrettable that we were in that position&mdash;of being involved in a matter that really was not within our province. Out of that grew a lot of criticism of the Parliament. There are clearly some lessons there for the Parliament about how it addresses these types of complex issues, and many have made the point that additional specialist counsel and so on would be required. But we were dealing, to term a phrase, with the gentlemen cannibals of the business world circling a prize asset. We had to accept that there would be intensities of views and that, of course, spilled over into the debates that raged around the Committee in the course of its deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would just like to pick up on a couple of points we make in our dissenting report. The first of these relates to the matter of cross-ownership rules. I have the strong personal view that the cross-ownership rules are an adjunct to competition policy. One would hope that over time they are not necessary as we get greater competition within this particular industry. But they are an adjunct to competition policy, in my view they are necessary, and that is why we support the continuation of the cross-media ownership rules in their generality, seeing it as it is&mdash;as a temporary necessity&mdash;given that ultimately competition policy ought to be dealt with in the general sense reaching over all industries in the Trade Practices Commission area. But we specifically believe that in the radio industry there is no longer a need for cross-ownership rules; they ought not to apply. That is the proposal in the Broadcasting Services Bill that is now in circulation. Indeed, the Chairman of the Committee says that, in recognising the dramatic changes in technology, one has to assess more carefully the requirement that cross-media ownership rules continue to apply in radio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent decisions in Spain from the WAR conference about digital audio broadcasting will accelerate the Parliament's necessity to step away from the cross-media ownership rules in the radio area. That is the position we take. On the question of foreign investment, which is a more difficult area for the Government than it is for us, we are quite clear. We do not believe that percentage limits are meaningful at all. We should deal with each application individually and the underlying test ought to be that, where any proposal manifestly leads to a greater increase in market concentration and a decrease in competition, it should not enjoy support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We certainly agree that the decisions of the FIRB, the Foreign Investment Review Board, ought to be made public. Indeed, the furore that took place over the decisions of the Government recently in the Fairfax battle to change from one position to another indicates clearly that to have some consistency of approach the publication of decisions by a Treasurer of the time would be&mdash;certainly in our view&mdash;a necessity. There is the temptation to allow political whim to prevail, and that, of course, does not make for good government or consistent government. When a country such as ours needs to accept that foreign investment is a feature of economic life, there needs to be some certainty for people who are contemplating investment. We reject the proposal that is in the recommendation of the majority. It is interesting, though, to recognise that that is a more flexible position from the Government and it will be interesting to see the consequences in this particular industry of its decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my understanding that in Western Australia the recently floated <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper has well above 20 per cent of accumulated foreign ownership. As to the suggestion that the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics could have an ongoing role, we simply reject that possibility. We do not believe that there ought to be an ongoing print media inquiry&mdash;occasional research by all means. We go back to the 1989 report which I was involved in where we recommended that the Bureau of Statistics gather up a line of data. Certainly we accept that, but I do not believe that the BTCE should be put in the position of conducting a rolling media inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned, chapter 7, the centrality of the report about improving competition and diversity, will be addressed. I have addressed that already in the broad and I still believe that those who rely on the heart of Professor Michael Porter's analysis need to look a little more deeply at the Australian context before embracing this. If one goes back to the mergers and monopolies report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs chaired by Senator Cooney, it is interesting to note that at page 69 the Committee recommends that there should be discrete legislation&mdash;that is, legislation separate from the Trade Practices Commission, to deal with the broader issues. The current proposal goes halfway; it is a halfway solution. It does not go quite as far as what the Cooney Committee recommends. So there again we have an example of the great diversity of views on how this particular matter might be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The print media inquiry will continue to be the subject of intense debate, which can only be healthy in a community such as ours. This report, with its catchy title&mdash;to which someone should claim credit, but it is not I&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">News &amp; Fair Facts : The Australian Print Media Industry</EMPHASIS>, will be one that many will go back to for a long time. I do not believe the Government would be wise to proceed to immediate legislation to give voice to the majority recommendations. I think that would be a backward step. It ought to listen more carefully to the great variety of views that are there. We ought to assess over time the impacts on this industry. We ought to recognise that this report came at a time that was difficult for the industry and for many in this place; it came at a time where the intensity of political debate overshadowed the importance of the issues, and this is reflected in the dissenting report. That may well be regretted by some, but it was certainly part of a scene with which we dealt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to my Labor Party colleagues: the fact that the Committee was extended from nine members originally to 12 was not directly to accommodate my colleague from the National Party, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), but to accommodate members from the different factions. That was regrettable but, understandably, necessary when a party is driven by factions. But let not that be the issue upon which we differ now. Let us try to differ on the issues and, in that way, we will be giving justice to what is a monumental report in terms of the data it collected from a very interested and informed industry. I would imagine that this report is being pored over by many of those upstairs with great interest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) is a very likeable man and we work together well on the Select Committee on the Print Media. Therefore, I was surprised and disappointed by what I perceived as being a very partisan and unnecessarily abusive minority report. Without wanting to return that in kind, I will just make a couple of comments on the points he raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What stands out about his comments and about the dissenting report is the fact that they are quite internally inconsistent. The first point I wish to make is that the Opposition was critical of the establishment of the Committee. Yet when I moved a motion in this House only a year ago calling for a royal commission on print media concentration, the Opposition speakers in that debate supported the idea of an inquiry but not of a royal commission. They recognised the damage of media concentration and the value of having an inquiry into that issue. For members of the Opposition to say that it was not a timely inquiry and that it was directed by factional issues, which in itself is quite inaccurate, is inconsistent and appears to be simply expedient. It appears to be aimed at mollifying media proprietors who might otherwise be antagonistic. It is also inconsistent to oppose the central recommendations. Members of the Opposition claim to be concerned with increasing competition, and I think that they are genuinely concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central recommendation of this report is aimed at increasing competition in print media and there is no doubt at all that the dominance test has failed to do that. Given that it has failed to do that, it was obviously necessary to change it. The proposal for change that was made was judged by many people&mdash;including Mr Malcolm Fraser, a former Liberal Prime Minister&mdash;to be an appropriate approach. The majority of the evidence we received supported the reintroduction of a substantial lessening of competition test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The proposals are inconsistent on that point. There was also division within Opposition ranks in terms of the evidence that Malcolm Fraser gave on the whole range of subjects we were discussing. Mr Fraser recommended divestiture, for example. He recommended opposing all foreign investment. The tone of the Opposition's dissenting report is quite disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now intend to be more positive. I believe this was a timely committee, a profoundly important committee and an entirely appropriate committee for this Parliament to set up. Parliament has to be concerned with the structure of our society and the fact that we have, in Australia, a higher level of ownership concentration than any other Western country has, or has ever had. This must be a cause of great concern to anyone interested in the quality of our democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt in my mind that the evidence we received showed that that high level of concentration had led to a reduction in the diversity of views that were available to the Australian people. The Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), has very effectively summarised both the analysis and the recommendations of the Committee. I will not repeat those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to compliment the Chairman on the quality of his work. Clearly, people may not have always expected us to have identical views, but by working hard and discussing the matters vigorously and openly we did come to an agreed conclusion. That is a significant achievement in itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of coming to an agreement is that we have prepared a report which, in our judgment, can be implemented by the Government in full and immediately. It is a moderate and carefully prepared report at every point. In the judgment of all the Government members of the Committee, it can be fully implemented this year. We look forward to that happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not repeat the recommendations which have been well summarised by the Chairman, except to outline a couple of points that he perhaps did not have time to deal with fully because of the time available to him. We dealt with the Australian Press Council and we recommended that the Press Council be restructured so that publishers and journalists are represented equally. Together they would choose a third person who would be a member of the public. There would also be a neutral chairperson. We also recommended that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Richardson) convene a meeting to get that process under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to conclude by congratulating the staff of the Committee. We had a remarkably effective staff, considering we were obviously working under pressure of time. The staff worked very hard and have great ability. The quality of the report owes a great deal to their effectiveness. I thank them and the other members of the Committee. It was a very interesting committee in which to be involved and I think the recommendations are so important that they should be immediately implemented. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The print media inquiry report contains a useful collection of facts and a useful description of the various regulatory laws that govern ownership and foreign investment in print, television and radio in Australia. I think it will prove to be a handy reference volume in the future for those who want to understand how the media is regulated in Australia and for those who want to get some empirical data on the current state of ownership of the print media.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it should be stressed that one will not find any original research in the report of the Select Committee on the Print Media. I do not think anyone would claim that this inquiry and this report have discovered something that was not known before. It has not set out to break any new ground and the views that it has encompassed are principally a collation of the views of others&mdash;and that is useful. I make that point at the start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it is the fault of the Committee that it was not able to engage in original research. It was put on a tight leash with a short time frame and was constituted in a way which was not conducive to inquisitorial examination of evidence and of finding out facts that people who came before it did not want to be known. If it had been intended to elicit from those involved in the media in Australia facts that they did not want to voluntarily disclose, it would have been necessary to set up some other kind of inquiry&mdash;either a royal commission or an inquiry&mdash;with counsel assisting, who would be in a position to examine and cross-examine, and with an independent royal commissioner who would be able to enforce answers to questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that parliamentary committees have wide-ranging powers. They can subpoena, put witnesses on oath and, if need be, if those answers are inaccurate, refer matters as  contempts of parliament. But the Committee was not operated so as to exercise those inquisitorial powers in full. As a result, one of the episodes that the Committee will be best remembered for is the live television appearance of Mr Kerry Packer. Whether that elicited any new information is a matter for debate. Most people would suggest that it did not find out anything that was not already known. It also displayed a weakness that bedevilled the activities of the Committee throughout, which was that the Committee had no coherent and unified view on the questions; there were differences between Government and Opposition members; and there were differences between Government members. When the Committee was confronted with that situation, it proved unable to acquit itself as well as we might have hoped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot help feeling that putting the Committee on a tight leash and operating it without using the full coercive powers of a parliamentary committee was intentional and secured what came out, which was more or less a collation of what was already known, rather than uncovering new facts, particularly new facts that principal parties did not want to voluntarily disclose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said&mdash;and I would agree&mdash;that the principal recommendation to come out of this particular report is the recommendation which appears in chapter seven. I took a particular interest in what was in chapter seven. That part of the dissenting report on chapter seven&mdash;in which I played a part in writing&mdash;has my wholehearted approval. But it is of disappointment to me that, after a full-blown inquiry into the Australian print media and after hearing all of these witnesses and taking all of these views, the principal recommendation that actually came out of the report was an old argument that has been reworked from several other parliamentary committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the old argument about what the test under section 50 of the Trade Practices Act should be. That test was introduced in 1977. After a full examination of it in 1986, Lionel Bowen, the then Attorney-General, announced in this Parliament that he did not think it needed to be changed. He said that in this House on 19 March 1986. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is firmly committed to the encouragement of efficient Australian industry. . . . It has been decided that the existing `dominance' test in section 50 should remain essentially unchanged.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the 1986 review. We then had the Griffiths review, a review of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. It reported in May 1989 that section 50 of the Trade Practices Act should not be changed. At that point that was the position of the Labor Government and indeed of people from all factions who were on that Committee. I think there was one dissent, but even some members of the Left on the Griffiths Committee endorsed that particular report. After two years of no doubt industrious studying of the Griffiths report, the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) finally came into this place in August 1991 to respond to the report of May 1989. The Attorney-General said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Like the Committee, it is not convinced that there is sufficient justification for reverting to the `substantial lessening of competition' test . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That was the Government's position as late as August 1991. So we had the recommendations of Bowen in 1986, Griffiths in 1989 and Duffy in 1991: three inquiries, and three recommendations not to change the existing section 50 merger test. Since then we have had the Cooney Committee, which has come to another  conclusion.  I  am  led  to  believe the Martin Committee went through it and came to another conclusion. Now we have the Print Media Committee, which has, by a majority, worked through it and come to a conclusion which involves altering section 50. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of some disappointment to me that, after all of the hearings and all of the evidence, the principal recommendation that came down is an old argument which has been reworked through various parliamentary committees. In this case it was reworked very hard by the Trade Practices Commission. It will not surprise anybody that as a result of this recommendation the Trade Practices Commission would not only extend its jurisdiction on mergers but would also take on a new element. This is one of the matters that concerns me very deeply, and it is referred to in the dissenting report. Not only would the Trade Practices Commission presumably have a wider field of inquiry under a new test, but on an authorisation application it would be directing itself to issues of an entirely new character. As recommended by the majority, it would direct itself to the likely impact of mergers on free expression of opinion and fair and accurate presentation of news. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether news is fair and accurately presented is a highly contentious issue. People with different political views invariably have different opinions. It is a highly contentious area. The majority of the Committee has recommended that a body which is appointed by government, the Trade Practices Commission, on a merger application investigate the outcome for the fair and accurate presentation of news. The first point I make is that, by reason of the qualifications of those on it, they are not qualified to inquire into those matters. Secondly, if they do start inquiring into highly contentious questions like that, the Trade Practices Commission itself runs the risk of being politicised and of people taking hostile political views on its deliberations. I believe that that will hamper the important work of the Trade Practices Commission in other areas, namely, areas concerning competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will also subject the Trade Practices Commission to all sorts of posturing and lobbying, as we know goes on whenever there is a media merger. Again, I believe this will threaten the independence, high standing and credibility which it needs to have when it is considering general competition issues. During the conduct of this inquiry and as a result of the sale of the Fairfax empire that was going on at the time, we saw some of the most naked lobbying activity by political interests that has ever been seen in this country. It was lobbying not just members of the Committee&mdash;the Committee was small fry&mdash;but Prime Ministers and Ministers, journalists and other proprietors. We saw the worst face of lobbying in full operation. It will be regrettable if the Trade Practices Commission is subject to that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This had better be good. I thank the honourable member for his question. There has been a great deal of debate in recent times about the consequences of the introduction of a consumption tax in Australia. Much has been made of various modelling exercises which have tried to generate the circumstances and the changes which might occur in Australia as a result of a massive tax shift, involving some $40 billion worth of government money, from one area to another. Of course, these models are only ever as good as the assumptions that are built into them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not have to rely just on theoretical modelling exercises. There are some real life examples of where taxes of this kind have been introduced into economies not that dissimilar to ours. When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was asked in Hobart last year how similar his proposal was to, say, the introduction of the VAT in Britain, he said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope he did take close account of what has happened in New Zealand as a result of the introduction of a consumption tax&mdash;that is, its model&mdash;which it introduced on 1 October 1986. In the year to September 1986, inflation in New Zealand was running at 11.1 per cent. In the year to December 1986 it had risen to 18 per cent; by March it had risen to 18.3 per cent; by June it had risen to 19 per cent and a year later it had subsided slightly to just under 17 per cent. In order to combat that inflationary surge which occurred as a result of the introduction of that new tax, the New Zealand Government had to resort to very tight levels of monetary policy to the point where by June 1987 the 90-day bill rate had reached 19.2 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Out of the 17 quarters since the introduction of the GST, the New Zealand economy has actually shrunk in 11 of them. Why did it shrink? It shrunk basically because there had to be paralysingly high levels of interest rates in order to combat the inflationary surge which came from the introduction of that particular income tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us not rely just on that. Let us look at what an accountant, much beloved of the Opposition, had to say about the introduction of the GST in New Zealand. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aim of these combined efforts was to ensure the introduction of GST affected all taxpayers in a manner that was tax neutral. Subsequent studies have shown that the introduction of GST and related income transfer measures has not improved the position of low income households in New Zealand. The combination of direct tax and benefits changes has worsened the relative position of low to middle income households which have also borne an increased burden from the introduction of GST.</PARA>
<PARA>One does not have to rely on Treasury models. One can look at the real life economic and social laboratory just across the Tasman to see what the consequences may well be in Australia of the introduction of such a tax. That, I might remind the House, was with a GST of 10 per cent, subsequently raised to 12 1/2 per cent, whereas, of course, the Opposition wants to have a tax of 15 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point to bear in mind&mdash;because international comparisons are something of an embarrassment to the Opposition&mdash;is that in most countries that have introduced a GST the rate has gone up at some point after its introduction.

How successful has Medicare been in restricting increases in medical costs faced by Australians who need hospital care? What would be the impact of alternative proposals seeking to increase the number of private patients in public hospitals?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1069" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; HEALTH, HOUSING AND COMMUNITY SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clearly, Medicare has been important in maintaining universal access to health care services for all Australians. Critical to its success has been the effective control on fees charged by doctors. The guarantee of free hospital care and the fact that almost two-thirds of all services are bulkbilled has ensured that out-of-pocket costs for average Australians are kept to a minimum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proof of this lies in the fact that 76 per cent of all services are billed on or below the Medicare benefit schedule with only 3 per cent of services at or above the AMA schedule. Further, public patients receive 56 per cent of all bed days in public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important when one goes to this question to remind the House again what the fundamentals are in the Opposition's policy. There are four fundamentals that the electors of Wills certainly need to be reminded about. The first is that the Opposition would abolish bulkbilling for all but pensioners. There would be no bulkbilling for people unless they are a pensioner or card holder. Secondly, the Opposition would reduce the rebate, that is, for those who pay the bills the rebate would come back from 85 per cent to 75 per cent of the schedule fee. Thirdly, the Opposition has said that there must be compulsory co-payments. There is no choice about it; if people are in the situation where they are not bulkbilled and are not pensioners, there will be a compulsory co-payment.</PARA>

What we are talking about is not the continuation of Medicare but a fundamentally different situation. That is why it is important to take time to explain that.

In all, that person will be up for $1,500 in out-of-pocket costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are talking about here is not Medicare; we are talking about an American-type situation in which people who have security and are out of work and suffer loss of income are faced with the possibility of massive costs on top of the levy which they have paid and on top of basic level private insurance which they might have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why Medicare is a universal health care system is that it is popular with the Australian electorate. Medicare has provided for certainty and it has provided for security. It creates a situation in which people who experience that kind of catastrophe are not faced with a series of charges that mount and create the possibility of a family being overwhelmed by those charges. Medicare does not create that situation; it provides very great security. Therefore, it is important that when we go back over these issues, we recall that there are fundamental differences in what the Opposition is proposing. It is not proposing some variation of Medicare. It is proposing a situation in which the costs currently borne by the public sector and borne fairly in terms of community rating and taxation would effectively be shifted onto the individual.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very curious that the Leader of the National Party should ask me about a recovery when the shadow Treasurer said that the reduction in interest rates in January 1990 was a political decision taken by the Government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the Government did it because it believed that it was the right thing to do at the time&mdash;as did the central bank.

Not only has the Opposition done that, but it has blackguarded the Reserve Bank for joining with the Government in making those reductions possible. In fact, at the Asia-Pacific Bankers Club last weekend, the shadow Treasurer accused the Reserve Bank of being politicised. This was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>

That is showing no respect for Australia at all, no sense of notion and no sense of camaraderie; it is simply trying to say to a most influential audience that the central bank basically was politically corrupt and that it responded to political manipulation.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I can remember when the National Party took a lot of interest in agricultural trade. I said in Brussels that it is now high noon for the Uruguay Round, but there is still a danger that it may turn out to be as exciting as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Midday Show</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ostensibly, the objective of all major participants is still to complete the Uruguay Round negotiations by April, but the continuing failure of the EC and some other countries to accept the agriculture package put forward by GATT Director-General, Arthur Dunkel, has stalled progress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly worrying that some countries are using this stand-off as a pretext for tabling draft schedules of commitments which depart significantly from the requirements set out in the Dunkel framework. Last week I met with Arthur Dunkel in Geneva; in Brussels and Bonn I had discussions with Mr Delors, President of the EC, Franz Andriessen, Vice President, Mr MacSharry, the Agricultural Commissioner, and German Government representatives. I am sure the Treasurer will be interested that the Belgian Government put up its VAT again by another half a per cent. It is 19-19.5 per cent now. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But back to the question: the EC leaders recognise the significance for world economic growth of an early and successful conclusion to the negotiations. They all indicated a determination to reach a conclusion to the Round with political agreement in April. This encouraged me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Washington I met with United States trade representative, Carla Hills, Agriculture Secretary, Ed Madigan, and people in the White House, including Clayton Yeutter, and they reaffirmed the very high priority being given by the United States to an early, successful conclusion of the Round.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was especially encouraged by their view that the issue of protectionism has diminished in the presidential election debates and that a successful conclusion to the Round would be a political plus for President Bush. Also last week the Prime Minister wrote to President Bush and German Chancellor Kohl, stressing the need for commitment to a successful conclusion to the Round at the highest level, and again highlighting the damage that will be done to the world trading system if this is not achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is heartening again that, following their meeting last week, both President Bush and Chancellor Kohl made a public political commitment to a successful conclusion to the Round. But I must again point out that there are still very difficult technical and political problems to be overcome before the deadlock over agriculture is broken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, my discussions and the events of last week indicate that the political will is firming up on both sides of the Atlantic for a successful conclusion to the Round. The real test is and continues to be the EC's commitment and whether that will come during the coming weeks. That is really the high noon. It is crucial that the EC find a more flexible approach to agriculture in order that the negotiations can be concluded, and in this Germany has an important role. The Dunkel package contains substantial gains in important areas other than agriculture. These are recognised by the German Government, especially in the light of the pressures it is experiencing from reunification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, for this reason, Germany has a central role in ensuring that the totality of the Dunkel package is not sacrificed on the altar of narrow, sectoral interests in the EC. Naturally, it is a matter of great interest to us and great concern to Australia that, if the present stalling of negotiations continues, the prospects for a successful conclusion to the Round within the present timetable will be seriously diminished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to end by saying that I have also met with Cairns Group ambassadors in Geneva and I am in regular contact with other Cairns Group Ministers to assess appropriate Cairns Group reaction to the state of negotiations. I reassure honourable members who are interested in agricultural trade, particularly on my side of the House, that, as leader of the Cairns Group, Australia will maintain the pressure on all parties concerned and through every channel so that an acceptable outcome can be achieved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The One Nation statement has demonstrated yet again the Government's commitment to science and technology as essential components of a competitive and advanced nation. One Nation ensures that we develop Australian ideas for the benefit of Australians. This Government is interested in science at the sharp end. We wish to address that part of the science system where most attention is needed; that area which takes Australian ideas and develops them into products and processes which produce national benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This country has a strong science base. We have a surplus of great ideas. We have to link these ideas to the market so that they do not wither on the vine and they do not have to be taken overseas to be developed. Of course, the improved business environment which will arise out of One Nation will, of itself, help to improve the research, development and innovation focus of business enterprises. In addition to this, the statement contains two important initiatives which are directed at better developing Australian ideas. These are: the creation of the Australian Technology Group and the pooled development funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give some details of the first of these initiatives which has sparked the most interest. The ATG will take technology developed by Australian researchers to the stage at which its commercial potential can be exploited by industry. It will then identify research capabilities and outputs with commercial potential, secure the protection of intellectual property, develop research outputs to the stage where they become of interest to investors, and market the technology. It will also be able to provide some of the funding required to establish the technical quality and commercial viability of intellectual property.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I expect the ATG to be fully operational by the end of the year. I will be appointing a steering group or interim board in the future and the preparation of a detailed business plan will follow the appointment of a chief executive. I have written to more than 80 higher education institutions and technology transfer companies outlining this initiative and seeking their views. I must report that the response has been overwhelmingly positive. I will give a couple of examples. Professor David Craig, President of the Australian Academy of Science, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I welcome the formation of the Australian Technology Group as a new means of promoting commercial development of Australian inventions and know-how.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Frank Larkins, Deputy Vice-Chancellor of Melbourne University, said:</PARA>

<PARA>Professor Chris Fell, Deputy Vice-Chancellor of the University of New South Wales, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was very pleased to learn. . . of the Government's initiative to establish an Australian Technology Group. . . The objectivity provided by the ATG will assist greatly.</PARA>
<PARA>The ATG will ensure that we get the best results for the taxpayers' substantial investment in science, technology and innovation. That is part of the proud tradition of this Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commonwealth support for science and technology is at an all-time high at $2.7 billion&mdash;29 per cent greater than when we came to office.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that the Government's support for a strong and effective science and technology system will continue through the development of a White Paper on science and technology to be tabled in conjunction with this year's Budget. The White Paper will canvass a number of themes, and I am looking forward to the full support of the Opposition in its preparation. The Opposition spokesman on science has recently been an enthusiastic advocate of Government science policies. For example, he recently launched a report showing that the Government's policy to persuade more girls to study science has been an outstanding success. He has also endorsed the Government's policy on the structure and direction of our premier science agency. I am sure, therefore, that his criticism of the initiatives in One Nation has been an aberration. His attraction to the Government's science policy is utterly understandable.

The Opposition sees science as a sideshow, an interesting game being played by absent minded professors in laboratories.

In the light of standing order 142, which uses the words `he is officially connected' and `for which he is responsible', is it therefore in order for Ministers to be asked questions inviting them to comment upon a matter or policy which his or her government has already announced that it does not already operate and, more importantly, has no intention of introducing?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the whole of its history this Government has failed small business in Australia. The Australian Labor Party&mdash;and it is quite understandable because it constitutes this Government&mdash;does not like small business in this nation, does not understand small business in this nation, and in fact has never participated in small business in Australia. One of the reasons for this is that it cannot control small business, it cannot stand over small business, it cannot manipulate small business and it cannot unionise small business. It therefore has no control over small business, which is a freethinking, hardworking group of individuals who simply want this Government off their backs so that they can get on with operating their businesses free of government interference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can clearly demonstrate this. Nothing has been clearer than the Government's recent statement. After two years it has presented a statement called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS>. Two years after the release of the Beddall report on small business the Government has released a statement entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> which is meant to promote jobs, but there is not one mention of small business, one of the major contributors to employment and employment growth. There is virtually no recognition of small business in this <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> statement. The statement is about one job and one job only, and we know whose job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Labor Party has been running a war with small business for years. I am pleased to see that the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) is at the table, because he staked his reputation on the introduction of his report in 1990. Some two years later the Government has introduced what it calls a job statement, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS>, but there is no mention of the role that small business can play in the creation of jobs in this country. The opportunities for the creation of jobs in the small business area are immense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to go over some of the history of what has happened in small business in recent years. I refer to the report recently handed down by the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate), which indicates that bankruptcies to the end of June 1991 increased by 53 per cent. During the 1990-91 financial year there were 13,091 individual bankruptcies. Of those bankruptcies 32.1 per cent were business bankruptcies&mdash;a staggering figure in this climate. We see a Government that could not even include small business in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> statement. It referred, of course, to the economic conditions. These economic conditions were outlined in the report tabled by the Beddall Committee, which described the economic conditions as the major cause of these bankruptcies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at them. Interest rates for small business were up to 24 per cent&mdash;24 per cent for small businesses struggling to survive. And who put the interest rates up? The man who said we had to have the recession. How on earth could a small business survive with interest rates at 24 per cent? The other areas of cost imposed on small business during that time included increases in government taxes and charges, overhead expenses, credit restrictions and competition and price cutting. We all know about that, but how could small business compete with interest rates at 24 per cent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABS survey in May 1991 showed that small businesses&mdash;businesses with fewer than 100 employees&mdash;make up more than 50 per cent of the private sector work force in this nation. More than 50 per cent of people were&mdash;and I say `were'&mdash;employed in the work force in small business. One has only to go along Sydney Road in Wills now to find out what has happened to small business in Australia. If one drives down Sydney Road one can see the shops that are closed, the shops which have been forced out of the business environment by 24 per cent interest rates from the man who was the Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), now the Prime Minister of this nation. These are jobs and job opportunities lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology expressed its concerns about the failure rate of small business back in January 1990. The Minister at the table produced the Beddall report&mdash;which probably should be called the `meddle report' because it does nothing but meddle in the operations of small business in this country&mdash;which put up 66 recommendations. Of those recommendations 43 have been partially implemented or not implemented at all. I will refer the Minister to some of them; I am sure he is familiar with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Minister looks at recommendations 11 to 26, he will see that these have been only partially implemented. Over the 12 months beginning December 1991 the ABS was commissioned to undertake a study of the Government paperwork burden. Paperwork! That is what small business wants out of its hair. Some of these recommendations have been partially implemented; some the Government has not bothered to implement at all. Recommendation 15 on page 14 has been only partly implemented. Once again it says that a case study program will be set up&mdash;a further study. Turning to page 15, recommendation 16 is that there be a study by the Administrative Review Council. What will it produce? More paperwork! It will mean more paperwork for small businesses, which will prevent them from getting on and making a living and surviving, and providing jobs for some of our one million unemployed young Australians. There are tremendous growth opportunities in small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 21 of that report recommendations 22 and 23 once again have been only partially implemented. They refer to standardised rental leases for commercial properties. They call for a further consultant to investigate and to produce more paper, more red tape, more restrictions and more regulations for small business. In recommendation 25 it is proposed that a comprehensive market research program be done. There will be more paper produced, interfering with the activities of small businesses and the opportunity to get on and make a dollar and to employ people in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister described this report as his blueprint. I want to quote from a tape entitled<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Business Essentials, </EMPHASIS>produced by Michael Schildberger in 1990. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Report is my blueprint and I'd hope over the term of this Parliament to implement the vast majority, if not all, of its recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA>We can see that the Minister has not achieved that. I think his performance in this area has been pathetic, and I think this stems from his lack of knowledge of what the business community is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to see a report, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Small Business Review</EMPHASIS> not long after the Minister was appointed, which described the Minister's background. It said that he had worked for the Commonwealth Bank for 12 years, finishing up in a lending capacity. People in the lending industry are the people who small businesses have to deal with at the moment. They are making life difficult for small business, and this is coupled with the high interest rates imposed on small business by the Prime Minister when he was Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Minister suffers from a lack of understanding of what small business is all about. His Labor back bench colleagues do not have confidence in him. There are honourable members opposite who know they can do better. We have only to look at some of them. There is the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton); he knows he can do better. There is the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) who is not in the House at the moment. There is the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price). The honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch) knows he can do better. He knows that he wants the job; he has got his eye on it. The honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) knows that he can do better in the job than the Minister. Even the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) thinks he can do the job better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seven of the report's recommendations relate to wholesale sales tax. Let us have a look at them. They were issues that the Minister identified in his report, from recommendation 27 through to recommendation 33&mdash;all relating to problems being experienced with the wholesale sales tax. Why does the Minister not follow the lead we have set under the Fightback package? He should have a good read of it. He should abolish wholesale sales tax, abolish petrol taxes and abolish payroll tax, which is the single most important issue working against small business and the creation of employment. Why does the Minister not abolish it? He should pick up the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> brochure and read it. He should read all of the policies we have set out to encourage small business to expand and to create employment opportunities for the one million people that the Government has put out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has really squibbed it on a number of issues, including eight major issues. If I had adequate time I would run through them. The Minister knows the eight issues he has walked away from. Those issues are staring him in the face. They are issues that he knows are important but he has not got the power in Cabinet. He has not got the backing from his Party. He has no support on the back bench. He has no support in Caucus. He cannot get those recommendations through.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just talk about what will happen should the coalition come to office. The coalition is talking about how it will bring in a goods and services tax. Many Ministers have talked about the difficulties and problems associated with business and the GST. I will talk specifically about the problems of small business. The honourable member for Bendigo referred in his speech to the fact that the Opposition would get rid of the wholesale sales tax. He said that this would be terrific for small business. However, there are 930,000 reasons why we should not abolish the wholesale sales tax and replace it with a GST. Currently there are about 70,000 wholesale sales tax collection points. Under the coalition's so-called Fightback package, there will be over one million collection points. Guess who will collect it? Small business will. What does that do to those small businesses? As has been pointed out, it puts an enormous burden on small business administration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable members opposite do not believe that, they should check the situation in countries where a GST has been introduced. Let us take the example of the United Kingdom. What is the burden on small business there in collecting the VAT&mdash;a sister tax to the GST? Some 2 per cent of turnover of small business goes in cost of administration. For big business&mdash;the mate of honourable members opposite&mdash;that percentage is 0.003 of turnover. In New Zealand 25 per cent of the GST goes in the cost of collecting it. The New Zealand Government collects, I think, about $5 billion. However, it costs $1.25 billion to collect it. Government does not pay that; small business does. That is what honourable members opposite are offering small businesses in Australia&mdash;a tax that will drive them into the wall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members opposite have lately been citing the example of Canada. The Independent Business Association of Canada, the largest small business representative body in Canada, surveyed its members. It got over 25,000 responses. What did those respondents say? After 12 months of a Canadian GST, 71 per cent of those respondents said that the GST has had a negative impact on their business; it has forced business out. What is happening in Canada&mdash;maybe we are a bit luckier in Australia&mdash;is that Canadians are shopping in the United States. People here probably think that it is great that we do not have a common border. The GST is the biggest and most onerous burden ever put on small business. It will drive small business to the wall. It is the one issue that will drive small business to vote for the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members opposite may think when they go to their local Liberal Party branch meetings and talk to people who purport to be small business people that they represent small business. However, I suggest that honourable members opposite get out and talk to the real people involved in small business, as I do. Talk to the people who represent them. Talk to the business people on the shop floor, as I do in every State in this country. They will tell honourable members opposite they do not support a GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What small people are concerned about, as was revealed in the report that was mentioned before, is the complexity of the GST. We are addressing those issues. They did not want to throw out the baby with the bath water. However, they want a system that is efficient and able to be administered. A GST would drive them to the wall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many other issues Opposition members have missed the boat. However, probably the way in which they have most missed the boat is that they have never really talked to the small business community. When I became Minister it became obvious to me that there was no real mechanism for talking to the small business community. The small business community in Australia comprises 800,000 individuals. It has never been a joiner. We have heard from Peter Boyle  of ASBA in Victoria on many occasions. ASBA has 7,000 members, so it is not really representative. I have often said to Peter Boyle that he should recruit as many people as he can so at least his organisation can be representative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we did as a government and what I did as Minister was to ask how we can create a better mechanism. We established an organisation called the Small Business Forum, comprising 35 industry associations ranging from the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber of Manufactures, ASBA, COSBOA and the Professional Women's Association. All of those organisations meet with me twice a year and set an agenda. They found it so useful that they themselves formed another organisation called the Small Business Coalition. That Small Business Coalition has the driving agenda for small business. It is the one mechanism that government has in order to talk to the small business community. It truly represents the broad breadth of the small business community in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Opposition has never really understood about small business is that we need to treat it as an industry. It has common problems. What we really have to do is look at what the industry is. Small business is 96 per cent of all business in Australia; it is 50 per cent of private sector employment; it is 40 per cent of GDP. If we treat it as an industry, we can attack the common problems&mdash;lack of management skills and lack of capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Australian Chamber of Commerce did its own survey of its membership it found that lack of management skills was the prime reason for small business failure. It is not necessarily the case that if someone is a good tradesman he can become a good business operator. Small business people need management skills. It is particularly important that we face these issues and that we face them across the whole area of small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to hear the honourable member for Bendigo say that small business did not welcome the economic statement. He may think that is the truth. However, the Motor Trades Association of Australia is a reasonably representative<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS> body of small business. It represents service station owners, motor car dealerships&mdash;people in all the motor trades.

When we started paying the banks, what  happened if we dropped over our overdraft limit?  Remember that when the Liberal Party was in power we paid less but now under Labor we pay a bit more; we pay a bit over the prime rate. It was the Labor Government which did that. Small business pays over the prime rate now, and it pays an extra little levy if it goes over its overdraft for a day of 5 per cent on the whole amount.

I refer to the speech made by the honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey) yesterday when she said that, whatever the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) postures about, he cannot hide the fact that `officially we have 920,000 Australians unemployed; that 1 1/2 million Australians cannot get a job or are working fewer hours than they would like'. If the Minister would like 50 examples, he should come to Dandenong in my electorate of Corinella and have a look at the people who are working one, two or three days a week where two years ago they had a full time job and were looking for overtime. The honourable member continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . hidden figures are 262,000 families which have the chief breadwinner unemployed; and that 218,000 children are living in a family where no-one has a job.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what this Government has done to Australia; it is disgusting. In today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> an article headed `Long term jobless won't change&mdash;study' states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian National University study found about 275,000 people unemployed for more than 12 months were unlikely to find jobs in the "medium term".</PARA>
<PARA>That is, if unemployment stays around 8.5 per cent. But if we have unemployment at 11.5 per cent, where we are headed under the present regime, the number of long term unemployed in Australia will rise to 425,000. It is a sad tragedy. </PARA>

But Terry Vine puts it beautifully by saying, `I have heard his own efforts'&mdash;that is, the Prime Minister's&mdash;`labelled as creative accountancy'. The Government is putting the Australian community on Bankcard, and small business will be the losers. </PARA>

It cited payroll tax and business charges as the reasons.

At paragraph 1.2 it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The meeting with the former Treasurer, the Honourable Paul Keating, in April 1991 represented a major step for the small business sector.</PARA>
<PARA>In the next paragraph it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this regard the SBC acknowledges the role and energy of small business Minister David Beddall in genuinely seeking to harness the participation of the sector he represents. The SBC considers David Beddall has, in a very short time, capitalised and cajoled action on a series of collaborative initiatives involving industry and Commonwealth and State governments in a range of interdisciplinary areas.</PARA>
<PARA>Then there was a presentation by the Small Business Coalition to the Federal Government earlier this year, on Thursday, 6 February. On that occasion it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that your interest in us is the result of the establishment of the Beddall Committee in 1988, the Committee's very fine report and the subsequent appointment of Mr Beddall to the first Ministry of small business. We are pleased that this process is continuing, most recently with the Government's response to the Committee report. Mr Beddall deserves a great deal of credit for the status we now have.</PARA>
<PARA>I am sorry to ruin the speeches of the oncers;  I am sorry I had to do that to them;  but I am even more sorry that I do not have more than 10 minutes in which to read more quotes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that the GST package is all about a Thatcherite English solution:  abolish the middle class with all the small business people in it&mdash;the newsagents, the publicans, the chemists and so forth&mdash;and divide it between the rich and the poor. I say this to honourable members opposite:  the first Hewson Minister for small business will be the last Hewson Minister for small business because, by the time those opposite have finished one term of government, there will be no small business left in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I find equally amazing is the scurrilous misquoting of the One Nation statement by the honourable member for Bendigo. He said that One Nation did not mention small business. Then when he got a couple of sighs from the Minister and me, he very quickly ameliorated that remark and mumbled something else. Just for the edification of the honourable member for Bendigo, I think he should get out the speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and look at page 9 and page 10, and page 19 and page 21. When he has finished that, he should get out the statement and look at pages 71, 74, 75, 77 and 93. When he has finished that, he ought to look at what the Australian Hotels Association said recently. It  said that, as an organisation of mainly small business operators, working in the tourist industry, it would seem that the disadvantages of a consumption tax are certain, and what is not certain is any of the benefits. It went on to conclude, `. . . then it is difficult to see why such a tax reform is necessary'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When those oncers opposite have finished looking at this, they ought to look at the last round of bankruptcies. The provisional data showed that the number of bankruptcies fell by 13.2 per cent, not seasonally adjusted, in the December quarter, the first decline since the December quarter of 1989. The fact of the matter is that this Government has not only got its act together on small business, but it is politically putting a big hole in what those opposite have wrongfully described in the past and thought of as their own natural constituency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time remaining to me, I just want to draw the attention of small business to two very stressful points for small business that are on their way in the Hewson GST package. Under the Fightback plan, all small businesses in Australia would effectively become agents for the Australian Taxation Office, completing consumption tax collection sheets after hours when the business is closed or on weekends. As we know, most small business people basically work seven days a week. Those opposite want to have them work the equivalent of eight days a week&mdash;unpaid on the eighth for the Tax Office. The shopkeepers of Kogarah and Rockdale in my electorate would become unpaid clerks for the Tax Office during their personal time&mdash;or their GST imposed quiet periods, I say to the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello).  The Minister for Small Business, who is sitting at the table, has already cited the Canadian Federation of Independent Business Studies. I bet those opposite will not circulate that information to their branch members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing I want to warn the small business community about is this other absolutely amazing impost on small business being proposed by the Opposition; that is, each fortnight the approximately 500,000 registered unemployed and getting the dole would have to obtain from business people two written certificates certifying that they were seeking work on their premises. That is a national total of about 26 million certifications a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Employment, Education and Training has estimated that a six-minute interview would multiply to about 1,824 person years per annum provided by the employers&mdash;that is, principally the small business community&mdash;at a cost of $72m each year. In my electorate, for instance&mdash;and for that matter, Mr Deputy Speaker, in yours next door&mdash;that means any people running a business within a few miles of the Hurstville or Rockdale CES office would be extending their volunteer service for the Tax Office to include CES duties as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that the Opposition runs about the country pledging a smaller, leaner, meaner Public Service because the Opposition will have the small business community doing the jobs of public servants&mdash;unpaid, after hours and on weekends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is not enough, I invite those opposite to consider the cost of their GST solution. In New Zealand&mdash;the Opposition's laboratory&mdash;the cost to the business sector of collecting the GST has been more than one-quarter&mdash;that is, 25 per cent&mdash;of the total revenue collected. Our Government has estimated an additional 600 public servants would be needed. In Canada and New Zealand, the tax office staff went up by one-third&mdash;and those opposite, supposedly, want to get bureaucrats off the back of small business!  That is their catchcry. What a joke!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is worth while quoting the experience of Canada yet again. For a small business with an annual turnover of less than $100,000, the compliance cost was 9 per cent of turnover. </PARA>

<PARA>The alignment of conditions on Christmas Island with mainland standards is part of a broader government policy aimed at the integration of Australia's Indian Ocean territories within Australia. This policy was formally expressed in 1983 when the Government decided that the objectives of the Government's policies be that the Indian Ocean territories be made permanent Australian territories and be integrated with Australia.

It has served the present population of approximately 1,500 people. However, this infrastructure is generally not built or maintained to current mainland Australian standards. Where the infrastructure was of an adequate standard, substantial repair and maintenance are now required. </PARA>

The Construction Industry Development Council will also be established to be a broad-based national consultative and advisory forum for the industry. The construction industry reform strategy was launched by the then Prime Minister on 3 December 1991. Its objective is to develop a reliable and internationally competitive industry through real and tangible improvements in performance standards. The reform strategy specifically addresses the significant and intractable problems that have impeded the development of this industry to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategy is broadly based, covering workplace reform, industry development and building regulation. The strategy is unique and innovative. It is the first time such a comprehensive national approach has been attempted for the industry in this country. The development of the strategy has been undertaken in consultation with the major parties, in line with this Government's cooperative approach to industrial relations and industry development. In this process it has become apparent that the industry considers that a strong and active role by government is an essential prerequisite to achieving substantial reforms in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has responded by approving a comprehensive industry reform and development strategy. It has also agreed to commit funding of $10.8m over the next 3 1/2 years to facilitate the implementation of the strategy. However, the Government believes the industry itself must make a fundamental contribution to the reform process. Accordingly, the Government has sought at the outset a genuine commitment on behalf of the parties to the achievement of reform. </PARA>
<PARA>As part of this commitment, the industry is being asked to contribute to funding for the strategy through financial and resource contributions. This could include possibly making experienced staff available to the Agency on secondment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A significant indication of commitment to the strategy has been the signing of the in-principle reform and development agreement by the major industry parties. The in-principle agreement commits the parties to improve the performance of the industry to world-class practices and standards. It identifies specific areas where improved efficiency and productivity can be achieved. This is to be pursued primarily through the development of performance standards, improved contractual arrangements and related improvements in project management. Priority is given to the need for improvements in training and skill levels for managers, professional staff and workers, and to the enhancement of the industry's export performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement also commits the parties to rationalisation of industry bodies and industry awards. It contains specific measures to resolve restrictive practices and the incidence of lost time on sites. It also gives priority to implementation of award restructuring; in particular, the adoption of the proposed new classification structure and associated skill related career paths and training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very significant that all major national industry bodies have signed the agreement, including the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors, the MTIA-National Construction Council, the Master Builders Construction and Housing Association of Australia, the Building Owners and Managers Association of Australia and the Building Industry Specialist Contractors Organisation of Australia. Every major national industry trade union, along with the ACTU, has also signed the agreement. In addition, the governments of Victoria, South Australia, the Australian Capital Territory and Western Australia have signed the agreement. It is likely that other governments will sign the agreement shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an industry that has been characterised by counterproductive conflict and internal dissension, this strategy represents an unparalleled approach to reform. All major stakeholders are committed to its success. It is on the basis of this ambitious and comprehensive strategy, together with the overwhelming support of all key sectors of the industry, that the Government now proposes to proceed with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main function of the Agency will be to promote and implement the reform strategy. The Agency is to have primary responsibility for ensuring that the parties adhere to the commitments contained in the in-principle agreement. The Agency will also be responsible for developing an industry code of practice, which is to be the basis for encouraging best practice standards in the industry. The Government has decided that it will commence to apply a code of practice for major Commonwealth public works construction projects from 1 July 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The code of practice will contain arrangements for ratings systems for those companies seeking to participate in major construction projects. This will involve the development and implementation of a range of performance standards covering such important areas as quality assurance, research and export performance, financial performance, time performance, safety record and labour relations. The aim of this code will be to enhance performance standards and delivery through a transparent and objective process. In carrying out its responsibilities it will be essential for the Agency to liaise closely with the key national industry and union bodies and with State and Territory governments. The proposed Construction Industry Development Council will provide one suitable forum for such consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government believes that reform must, and can, be achieved within the next two to three years. It therefore considers that the Agency should be established for a strictly limited period only. This will ensure that the momentum for change is maintained. Accordingly, the Bill provides that the Agency is to cease operations by 1 July 1995. Because of the urgency to press ahead with these reforms, the Agency has been established on an interim basis pending the enactment of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential to the success of the strategy that the Agency is strongly supported by the industry itself and is able to attract experienced and skilled people from the industry. The Bill therefore constitutes a board of the Agency that will enable people from the industry who have a proven record and enjoy a high reputation in the industry to be appointed to it. It is not intended to establish the board in a manner that simply represents existing industry bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ern Macdonald, former Chair of Civil and Civic, has been appointed as the Chief Executive Officer of the interim Agency. The Bill permits the Agency to employ staff or engage or second people from the industry to undertake specific projects. The Bill also establishes the Construction Industry Development Council. The Council will constitute an ongoing forum for the industry to consider ways of improving its performance and standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides that the Council will be chaired jointly by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) and me, the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs, thereby giving Council members direct access to the key Commonwealth Ministers responsible for the reform strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Council will advise the Government on issues affecting the industry and will liaise with the Development Agency, other industry organisations and State and Territory governments. The Council's membership will include representatives from all major national industry bodies and unions. To reflect their key role, each State and Territory government is to be represented on the Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is confident that the high level of support that has been demonstrated by all sections of the industry for the reform strategy will provide a sound basis for these two new bodies to make significant and durable contributions to the development of this vital industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before lunch I was addressing the report of the Select Committee on the Print Media and I was putting to the House that it is not enterprising that, after an inquiry into the print media with all of the time, effort and witnesses, the Committee should come up with a proposal which was not in any way original. It is a proposal that has been hawked around a lot of committees recently. The majority of members on the Committee swallowed it almost with relief, I believe, because it gave them something to report on; some recommendations to make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This illustrates the way in which committees can almost assume a life of their own. The thinking seems to be, `We have a committee to inquire into something, so we had better come up with a recommendation. Here is a proposition that's been around an awful lot of committees recently; let's grab it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee was uncritical in its appraisal of the proposals to change the merger test. It does not say how this would work in practice. It cannot say what a changed test would allow in terms of something that is currently prohibited; nor can it say what a changed test would prohibit in terms of something that is currently allowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many claims have been made as to the magical healing properties of a change to the merger test in the Trade Practices Act. Unfortunately, this change to the Trade Practices Act is now put forward as a cure to any malady that might be investigated from time to time by any committee. It has almost assumed magical proportions. It would be nice to believe that it has all of the healing properties that have been put forward on its behalf, but I am afraid I cannot believe that. I particularly cannot believe the proposition that is put forward by the majority of Committee members in this report that somehow changing the merger test will lead to more competitors in the print media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia today we have two substantial owners in the print media: News Corporation and the House of Fairfax. Changing the section 50 merger test will do nothing to introduce a third competitor; nor will it do anything to break up those two houses. How could it possibly lead to the introduction of more competitors in the media in Australia? The important thing that is needed to get competitors into the print industry in Australia is ease of entry, particularly entry of people who have experience in the news industry. Therefore, I cannot believe that the Committee's recommendations to restrict foreign ownership will promote more competitors in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned about few owners and few proprietors in the print industry. It is the power of a proprietor to influence what appears in print that creates the sensitivity. But the problem we should concern ourselves with is the problem of corrupt news reporting. It is not just proprietors who can corrupt news reporting; journalists have an enormous capacity to do the same. I believe that the best protection against the corruption of news reporting is afforded by having independent bodies, separate from government and not susceptible to government influence, police that particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the real problem we are concerned about is news bias and the concentration of political power brought about by a small number of owners in the print industry, we should not be setting competition policy to deal with that problem. It is a bit like using a hammer to put in a screw. Merger and competition policy looks at products and pricing. Political power and political influence is a very different question. It is a question that should not become the province and the domain of the merger test, nor of the Trade Practices Commission. It should be the province and the domain of very independent, non-governmental bodies to whom complaints can be made and by whom independent investigations can be conducted. It is for that reason that I dissent from the recommendations in chapter 7.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) is persuasive in his arguments. Indeed, he put these views before the Select Committee on the Print Media. But one should understand that the Liberals are not monolithic on this issue. I recently sat on the inquiry of the Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration into banking, at which a number of prominent members of the Opposition agreed unanimously that, in that particular inquiry, there should be a change to the merger test in order to lessen competition substantially. Indeed, prominent shadow spokesmen were amongst the Liberals who were unanimous in their acquiescence in that recommendation of the banking inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the structure of banking in Australia, one will see that there are four large banks. It is very clear that a merger of two of those banks would not result in a breach of the dominance test, but certainly could be construed as a substantial lessening of competition. It was the view of the Committee that there was value in the change, which is one of the recommendations in respect of the print media. The two significant differences within the recommendations are the requirement for mandatory pre-notification and the substantial lessening of competition requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to dwell on that issue any further, but the great problem in determining these issues is defining the market. I think when one comes to making these determinations, invariably one will find that they will have very subjective elements and that there is a great division of opinion on this issue. I do not stand here very confidently, knowing that my position on this issue is exactly in accord with that of former Prime Minister Fraser. But that is the case. It was the former Prime Minister who came before the Committee saying that it was a disaster that the then Liberal Government had chosen to change the merger test to a dominance test. He believed it should not have made that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the media are very influential. They have the opportunity to scrutinise everything that happens in this place: the way in which government is structured and the way in which it operates in this country. I think the electronic media, in particular, are very influential. It is my view that in many ways they are very dangerous, with their focus on looking for good pictures, the 10-second grab that seems to be essential for a news story, and indeed their focus on the flashy rather than the factual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, last night we saw an example of the way in which the electronic media operate in this country. We saw the obligatory phone-in poll. It is an indictment of the way in which Channel 9 operated that program that some credibility was given to the phone-in. It has absolutely no statistical legitimacy. I am sure that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who is a reasonable man, would agree that this sort of reporting and any credibility which is given to such polls is absurd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be all right to decide which was the best catch in the World Cup cricket series, but when it comes to important political issues and economic debate in this country it is totally unacceptable. I am very glad that Channel 9's program last night rated very badly. Perhaps that will be a salutary lesson to it. What we look for from the print media is greater depth in reporting of political events, greater insight and, indeed, a greater diversity of opinion. Very often the print media are the agenda setters. I refer to page 22 of the overview where it was concluded by all members of the Committee from both sides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All Members agreed that concentration of ownership is potentially harmful to plurality of opinion and increases the potential risk that news may be distorted.</PARA>
<PARA>It was the view of all members of the Committee that that was the case. Some of the events involving the Committee pointed up difficulties that do exist. I raised the issue during the Committee hearings of the evidence that was given by West Australian newspapers. It was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper&mdash;in Western Australia we only have access to one daily newspaper and so an unsavoury position, I would suggest, obtains there&mdash;generally along the terms `Bond never interfered', `Newspaper chief stands up and suggests what is happening', but the report did not reflect the questioning or the events that took place in the inquiry. I think this highlights the difficulty that exists, particularly in a place like Western Australia where we only have one daily newspaper, for there to be accurate consideration by the newspaper of its own management. Indeed, if we look at the ownership of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper by Mr Holmes a Court and Mr Bond and the way in which the newspaper became burdened with debt over the period that they were in control, then we should be concerned at events that took place in the management of the newspaper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am hopeful that, in the interim report on the investigation into the Bond Corporation holdings and related companies, some of these events will come to light. It is interesting to note, for instance, that Mr Mitchell and Mr Oates were mentioned as Bond principals. They were involved in many of the dealings which occurred through the Bond Corporation. During their time as Bond executives they were on the board of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper for a very short period. Their role as board members&mdash;one for only a couple of weeks&mdash;would make an interesting task for an investigative journalist to pursue. I wish to raise that particular issue because that was one of the things that was mentioned during the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to take up the issue of the dissenting report that some of my colleagues pursued. We spent many hours refashioning the words of the report, debating the evidence and submissions and trying to find a form of words which was acceptable to other members of the Committee. On many occasions we felt that we had come to some sort of agreement, but it was pointless to waste so much time if Opposition members always intended to produce a dissenting report. There was the suggestion by members of the Opposition that the requirement or the activity of the Committee in pursuing some of the Fairfax bidders and questioning them was a sideshow. That is absurd. What was occurring in the Fairfax bid was entirely germane to the Committee's activities. The machinations and the arguments that were put forward by the bidders, and the close up view that we were able to get because of our access to those bidders, was something that was important to members of the Committee. It allowed us to focus on some of the issues which were within the bounds of the report. It is absurd to suggest that members of the Opposition in any way dissented from that process. When the decision was made to pursue some of the Fairfax bidders, there was a unanimous decision made by the Committee to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to mention very briefly the fact that there was a dissenting report to the dissenting report, which was made by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), the father of the House, who will be speaking after me. His proposal that cross-media ownership rules were unnecessary is one that I must object to most strongly. I understand the local flavour with which the right honourable member for New England approaches this issue, but it is the case that if those cross-media ownerships did not exist, it is possible that we could have Mr Packer or Mr Murdoch not only owning a substantial number of newspapers and magazines in this country, but also electronic media, radio, tape&mdash;the lot. Then the issue of concentration of media ownership would be very quickly focused in the minds of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to talk particularly about foreign ownership. It has long been my view that when we talk about foreign ownership there is a certain xenophobia amongst members of parliament, and that has often been the case amongst members on this side of the House. It seems to me that if one looks at Australian media owners over the last decade, one sees figures such as Alan Bond, Christopher Skase, Robert Holmes a Court and Warwick Fairfax Jr&mdash;hardly a tale of expert management or proficient management of media enterprises in this country. The suggestion that Australian owners are intrinsically good and that all foreign owners are aberrant in some way is something that I would reject. It is my view that we need to have good management and sound economic management of newspapers, and that is the most important and critical thing for the health of the newspaper industry in this country. The suggestion that only Australians can provide that sort of management is something that I would reject. I was pleased when the Committee determined to add paragraph 9.90, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recognises that the present 20 per cent limit on foreign ownership is an arbitrary figure. While it is consistent with other arbitrarily determined limits (as for television) it is of concern to some Members of the Committee that it has become a bench mark figure. The best reason for using such a figure is to act as a guideline for prospective investors which alerts them to the important public policy considerations in this industry. The 20 per cent limit should be viewed in this context.</PARA>
<PARA>If it is viewed in this context, as a guideline rather than a benchmark, then it spells out for prospective investors that there is concern about the public policy implications, about national sovereignty, and about Australian ownership in sensitive and influential industries. But we understand also that it is important that these industries be economically viable and supported by owners who show, and have shown, that they have the expertise to manage them. In that circumstance we should not be xenophobic about foreign ownership and we should be flexible in the way in which we approach foreign ownership considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other issues were raised in the report, but time does not allow me to pursue them. I would like to say that it is clear that the print media has an important and critical role to play in preserving our democracy. We are all interested in the accuracy of reporting and diversity of opinion in the print media. The opportunity to serve on this Committee was something that I found very worthwhile and has enlightened me in many ways. I thank my colleagues and the staff of the Committee for the way in which they worked so very hard. I hope that the Government will act quickly to pursue some of the recommendations made by the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The preservation of a critical media and the opportunities within the media to express honestly and without passion, or perhaps I should say in dispassion, the views and attitudes of the community go beyond doubt and competition, as the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) and others discussed in the presentation of the print media report, and are matters that are widely accepted in this House. Of course, all of us as politicians have a particular interest in the media. We are inevitably those who hope that our views might be properly and fairly expressed through the media, and we rely very much on the media in interpreting those views to the wider public and to the audience which is our electorate. The creation of a parliamentary committee, and the manner of the creation of this report, has a number of fallacies. It is those and some of the background that I want to address in the few moments that I have, as they relate to the Committee and to its conclusions in the paper headed <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">News &amp; Fair Facts</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is that, while we all want to preserve competition, it is how to achieve it and the ways by which competition is effected that seem to me to be matters that really have not necessarily been resolved by the report. While I acknowledge and my colleagues assert that there is quite excellent documentary evidence and material included in the report, I do not think we constitute a committee just to come to a conclusion. Part of my trouble in the very difficult field that was the charge of the committee was that it is only part of the media. There was an expectation, almost because of the Fairfax collapse&mdash;and the offer of the Fairfax Group by the receivers at the time generated a feeling that there needed to be a legislative response&mdash;that resulted in the attitude that the majority of the members of the Committee adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern, really, is that it is going to be extraordinarily difficult for us to protect and preserve competition in the print media. We need to understand it is not just a matter of ownership that affects that competition, and I refer those who are interested to evidence given by Mr Greg Taylor, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the John Fairfax Group and Managing Director of David Syme and Co. Ltd, which is referred to at page 119 of the report in paragraph 5.20. He refers to the fact that in most major American cities now there is basically one newspaper in the market, and he goes on to explain that. This view was echoed by Professor Peter Swan, a consultant to News Ltd, whose evidence is referred to at paragraph 5.21. He said that in the United States the number of cities with more than one competing paper and more than one newspaper is virtually zero. There are certainly fewer than 15. In other words, we are looking at a changing economic environment within which there is a consolidation of ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further to that, it was also interesting to hear the evidence that was tendered to the Committee by Dr Brown. At page 97, paragraph 4.31, his evidence is referred to. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think Sydney and Melbourne are well served by the individual papers there which are competitive to some extent. . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The competition in Australia, curiously, is most vigorous between <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Australian</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Age</EMPHASIS> in a kind of national way; elsewhere it is pretty limited.</PARA>
<PARA>We have these economic forces which are leading to a consolidation of the media. We have got any amount of evidence saying progressively around the world, and certainly in the English speaking world, there is a consolidation of ownership of newspapers, and in markets much larger than Australia there is very little competition. So we get to the point where in order to preserve competition we are told that we have to change legislatively a number of pieces of existing legislation to try to protect and preserve competition policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned with the ways in which that competition policy is now directed and also with the way in which  through the Broadcasting Tribunal there seems to be a great deal of influence in one section, which to me is more intrusive than necessarily beneficial. To give an illustration, if there is a problem in the presentation of fair views with Australia's interest in mind, no-one can properly assert that that is necessarily always the product of views expressed on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Yet the ABC is not subject to the ABT. The ABC is able to produce programs which offend our neighbours; the ABC produces views which both sides of the House assert are prejudicial to their own particular point of view&mdash;and the ABC, like the SBS, is outside the control of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are looking at competition policy in the media, there are two fields of control&mdash;restrictive trade practices and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. Sure, we are going to have changes as a result of the draft broadcasting legislation, subject to the new Minister whose views seem to be subjective rather than objective in this field. But given that there is going to be control, let us not run mad by saying, `The only way by which you are going to control diversity is by looking at ownership'. That is the first thing I wanted to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the minority report which I signed with my colleagues, we have identified our concerns in a number of particular areas. We are concerned about conclusions that have been reached by the Committee majority in respect of: foreign investment; the research role of the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics; in particular,  chapter 7 of the report, which deals with improving competition and diversity and in respect of which the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) spoke a moment ago; and, of course, changing the market dominance test in section 50 of the Trade Practices Act.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons why I adhere to that is that, like the honourable member for Higgins and other colleagues, I fail to be convinced that the changes the Government recommendations propose are going to change the market forces which in my view very much determine the consolidation of ownership which we have seen not only in the print media here but around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area where I have dissented from them, of course, is that I can see no benefit at all in cross-media ownership rules. As I have stated in my particular part of the report, at page 353, where I dissent from the others, in my view there is little doubt that the changes made to the cross-media ownership laws in 1987 really had no major effect on the changes in ownership of the media in Australia. They were far more the product of factors that related to the decision by Mr Kerry Packer with respect to the sale of his interests in Channel 9, to decisions taken by Mr Warwick Fairfax and the Fairfax Group, to commercial decisions taken by Mr Rupert Murdoch with respect to the News Ltd group and to decisions that also related to the ownership takeovers of the Channel 10 and Channel 7 networks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look back, I cannot see that the cross-media rules have in any way benefited the competition field and it was for that reason that I made a dissenting report. At a time when television aggregation has placed such enormous pressure on commercial television stations, I have said not only do I agree with my colleagues that there should not be cross-media ownership with respect to broadcasting but I can see no advantage in it with respect to either television or print media. The historical antecedents show that the print media essentially was the genesis of the development of broadcasting in much of Australia and that the proprietors of those two media ultimately became the genesis of television. I can see that through that source we might be able to get some return to viability amongst the media generally, which might enable viability certainly of television stations that have been very seriously affected by the enormous capital cost of aggregation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other area that concerns me. I was delighted that in the report there was unanimity that we should not legislate to apply the charters that have been set up by various journalist organisations. There is an <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> charter, there is an AJA charter, an AJA code of ethics, about which a good deal of evidence was given in the course of the presentation of evidence to us. The reason is that, in my view, if there is a threat in this field, it is not just, as I have said, in the ownership of the print media but also to a degree in the role and attitude taken by journalists themselves. In the course of the hearing of evidence I received a number of submissions privately, apart from those that were before the Committee. One came from a Mr Adrian Lynch who, together with his brother, expressed concern about attitudes taken by the Australian Journalists Association. As we all know, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Journalist</EMPHASIS>, the journal of the Australian Journalists Association, promoted the charter and suggested that legislation should put an obligation on proprietors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, interestingly, the AJA itself apparently does not follow the same charter. I was interested to read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of Tuesday 15 October 1991 that there are accusations of censorship of journalists by members of the AJA in the preparation of a magazine called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Freelance</EMPHASIS>. This is regarding the Media Alliance. I gather that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Freelance,</EMPHASIS> which was published by AJA freelance members, had a different point of view from other members on the Media Alliance. The AJA itself sought to do anything but allow the freedom to its editor that it seeks for others. I think this is part of the trouble. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, as the submission put to me said, the AJA itself regularly censors copy critical of the union's leadership and that leadership's decisions; it suppresses the publication of AJA journals that might contain critical but not defamatory copy; and while advocating press freedoms and editorial charters it does not grant those freedoms and charters to the often voluntary AJA correspondents and editors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point at issue is really the extent to which we can for the future establish competition within the Australian media, and competition that allows diversity throughout an extraordinarily far-flung nation. Of course, there is a great deal of information in the report which relates to the different characters and nature of the media, and in that respect the report is a very valuable document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned, not unnaturally, that in rural and regional Australia the same concentration of ownership is occurring but, as I have suggested, cross-media ownership, which would allow each of the forms of media to be owned by individual proprietors, would be far better than allowing the concentration of ownership that is now occurring within particular sections of the media. In other words, a city owned country newspaper, a city owned country television station, a city owned country broadcasting station or, for that matter, an eastern State owned Western Australian newspaper or other media outlet, or an eastern State or main State ownership of, say, a Tasmanian media outlet, generates enormous problems in those communities. They are not immediately apparent, but there is a separate point of view, a point of view which needs to be protected and preserved with an opportunity provided for continued expression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for that reason that I have come to differ from my colleagues with respect to cross-media ownership, but I certainly agree with them in respect of the other elements of the dissenting report. I commend the staff of the Committee. I think they put an inordinate amount of work into a report which is fairly unique in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is extraordinarily important that from time to time there be an analysis in different areas of policy, and I think this report contributes to that end. As I have suggested, however, I do not see the solutions in the interventionary processes recommended in the majority report. Indeed, I regret that it is felt necessary, as a result of the considerations that we had, to find some new solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I and others have remarked, the genesis of the reference lay in concerns about the ultimate ownership of the Fairfax Group. As we now debate this issue the Fairfax Group is about to issue shares to the public. There is no doubt that under its new owner and new proprietor it would seem to be preserving that independence that we all sought. So the Committee's establishment and its recommendations have no bearing on the Fairfax outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have remarked, in the United States and indeed around Australia there has been significant consolidation of media ownership in the past. That is a product of market forces, and I cannot see that anything in this report will prevent by legislative action the actions that flow from predominantly market forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason I support my colleagues in dissenting from the major recommendations but say, like they do, that I trust that in changes that flow around Australia we will preserve competition and a reasonable opportunity for the private and public expression of views, whatever they might be, as long as they do not in any way offend Australia's national interest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to speak to the report of the Select Committee on the Print Media. At the outset, I want to congratulate my colleague the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) on chairing the Committee in the manner that he has and on ensuring that the report that has come forward, despite some of the suggestions from our colleagues opposite, was able to achieve the wholehearted support of those of us on this side. Many of us have had a variety of views about media issues but, in the final analysis, we have been able to reach positions which I think are constructive and sensible and which lend themselves to early implementation by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is no doubt, as other speakers have said, that the diversity of views and the right of people in the community to have a range of information provided are fundamental to a healthy democracy. I recall speaking in the debate on a private member's motion that the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) put forward about 15 months ago seeking a royal commission into media ownership. At that stage we were seeking that royal commission not because of the Fairfax issues but because of the broader community concerns about levels of media concentration and the need for parliaments and governments to take that issue very seriously. The response to that in setting up the Select Committee has, I believe, been a very useful exercise. The report that is being presented today reflects just how valuable that has been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The key things that are contained in the report, as other speakers have said, relate to the changing of the test as far as mergers and takeovers are concerned&mdash;moving from the dominance test introduced by the Fraser Government in 1977, by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who was Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs at that time, to a tougher test. I believe very strongly that the substantial lessening of competition test that is recommended by the majority in the report is a tougher test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot has been said about this, but it is certainly true that we can accept much of the evidence that was given by the Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission to the inquiry about what the effect of a tougher test under section 50 of the Trade Practices Act would be. I think it has the desired effect of addressing the concern about levels of media concentration and the potential for that to reach the levels of higher concentration that exist today. That being the case, I think it is right that the Government be asked to act to ensure that the test that has to be faced by any future mergers is a stronger test that takes full account of many of the things that the existing section 50 provides for, but as well as that adds a number of points that we have recommended in our conclusion in that regard relating to free expression of opinion, fair and accurate presentation of news, the economic viability of the publication, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think they are important additional facets to have to consider, because all of us have an interest in this issue. We take an interest in relation to Fairfax; we take an interest generally into the amount of concentration of media ownership in the print media, be it in national dailies or in suburban newspapers and the like. It is reasonable to suggest that the test that is applied, and the way that it is applied in the newspaper area, should be treated as a special category if the test is not going to be changed for other areas of industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recommended in the banking inquiry last year that the test in relation to banking for mergers and takeovers should be toughened as well. On that particular occasion, the Opposition was prepared to support it unanimously; there was no dissent from anyone in the Committee at that particular time from the recommendation for a tougher test. One has to ask the question: why would there be a reason to have a more stringent attitude to banking than the Opposition proposes to the print media? Surely the print media would be regarded as just as important and just as significant to the protection of democratic ideals, and if the matter was to be taken to its logical conclusion, one would have consistency in the approach that was adopted. It is regrettable that that has not been the case. Nevertheless, it is certainly my view that the majority report, which recommends the substantial lessening of competition, will be a more healthy outcome and it is one that certainly recommends itself to the Government to implement without delay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As well as that, in the report we focused on the restructuring of the Press Council. Having listened to the evidence throughout the inquiry, I think that there is no doubt that there is a genuine basis to be urging a strengthening and restructuring of the Press Council so that it can more effectively address many of the complaints that arise about the print media industry. Clearly, the Press Council has to be adequately funded to do that job and, clearly, it has to have the accountability that goes with that. It needs to have equal representation, as is outlined in the report, from the public publishers and the AJA, and it needs to be seen as a body that people who have complaints about the print media can go to and as one that will ensure that those matters are effectively considered and also ensure that the rationale and the reasoning behind decisions are adequately published in the media. That is something that I think we can all thoroughly support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matters relating to cross-media ownership have been canvassed in the debate to date. I do not wish to traverse those issues too greatly other than to say that, in the area of radio, the Committee has recommended that the rules that are in place in that area should not be left standing still in the face of changing technology and development. That is something again which lends itself to the Government for serious consideration in the context of the Broadcasting Services Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Foreign ownership is an issue that was addressed throughout the Fairfax question. The provisions contained in paragraph 9.90 give a sensible and rational way to approach levels of foreign ownership in the media. Clearly, it is important and desirable to encourage the maximum Australian participation and ownership of our media. Our culture, our desires and our national identity are all interrelated to both ownership and control of our media. In that sense it is desirable that we maximise Australian ownership in an area such as our print media industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a significant industry in itself and we need to try to maximise those concerns about Australian content and Australian ownership. The 20 per cent rule is one that we need to take account of in the context of other rules relating to the print media. We cannot be totally blinkered and black and white in the approach that we take to foreign ownership; we have to judge cases on their merits. The recommendation contained in the report enables future decisions about levels of foreign ownership in our media to be addressed in a sensible and more effective basis than perhaps has occurred on some occasions in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the other provisions in the report, we have addressed issues relating to small magazines and, indeed, the magazine area generally. I think the recommendations we have made reflect the differences in terms of the types of media we have. Some people suggested in the course of the inquiry that we lump magazines into one category, and that people could not be participants in that as well as other forms of the media. It is not a view that I have endorsed at any point, and I am pleased the Committee has come to the conclusions it has in that area. Nevertheless, it will clearly be reasonable as time goes on for the Parliament to continue to take an interest in questions relating to technology, advertising revenue and all those sorts of issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think one of the most significant recommendations in the report is the fact we are saying that the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics should develop a more effective data and information base in relation to our media industry. One of the things we noticed in starting out on this process was that there was very little information readily available in the community on issues that we debate frequently relating to the media; for example, the role of the media, levels of ownership, and the impacts of that set out in an informed and statistical way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those things in mind, I think the recommendation at the outset of the report, that there be regular collection and publication of information on the characteristics and performance of the Australian print media industry by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, et cetera, is important. It is clear that, as has been said in the debate, some of our colleagues on the opposite side do not necessarily see those concerns in quite the way we do. We have argued that there should be healthy competition in our media. We have argued that there should be informed and diverse debate in our media. How do we ensure that happens? Clearly, we ensure it happens by first being able to analyse where the industry is at at any given time and what the trends are in the development of the industry, and by having a capacity, having used that information, to then make informed decisions about the relationship between the print media and our other media, and about levels of concentration of ownership, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have attempted to do those things in this report. As I said at the outset, I think it is a report that lends itself in a practical way to the Government for implementation. There are matters within it that individual players in the media can take issue with, but our role as a parliamentary committee has been to look at those issues across the board and reflect the best environment for the future of our media industry in terms of its relationship to the people of Australia and our democratic processes. I think we have done that effectively, and I certainly believe that the approach we have taken, which encourages competition through the substantial lessening of competition test, is far better than reliance on the dominance test, which the Opposition has&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The free enterprise that our colleagues in the Opposition have supported but unfortunately are not able to be part of implementing because they will not allow the rules to be put in that enable a competitive environment and more competition in our media. It is a matter of regret that we have that in the report. The Opposition would have been far better to follow its free enterprise ideals and to support a substantial lessening of competition. There is no doubt in my view that that would have been a more effective way for this issue to be addressed in the coming decade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one can predict what will happen as far as individual media players are concerned. People would have said 10 years ago, before the introduction of the cross-media rules, `We have these arrangements here; major empires in the media have interests in radio, television and newspapers', yet today we see that a vastly different set of circumstances has arisen in the space of a very short period. Those who say the changes we recommend in the report before us today do not go far enough should judge our report in the context of time. Although we can be sure that we have a number of major media players today, there is no guarantee the same people will be around five years from now in the same form and in the same organisations any more than there was before the cross-media rules were introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all those reasons, I am pleased to be associated with this report. As I said at the outset, I pay tribute to my colleague the honourable member for Dobell for the manner in which he conducted the inquiry. It has not been an easy exercise from the outset. I think it is one that the Committee has handled constructively and in a very able manner. That has been a tribute to the Chairman's efforts. It has also been a tribute to the cooperation which has existed throughout the Committee. Except for a couple of things in the minority report that I have referred to which would be better not there, we accept that there has been an amount of a spirit of cooperation throughout. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was, shall we say, part heard on this matter until 10.30 last night when the House commenced the adjournment debate. The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) is an omnibus Bill, a seemingly simple measure amending three pieces of legislation, namely, the Judges' Pensions Act 1968, the Defence Force Discipline Appeals Act 1955 and the Family Law Act 1975. I dealt with matters that pertained to the Judges' Pensions Act, and was critical of the Government, justifiably, for the threat to judicial independence by the sloppy way in which it continues the method of determining remuneration and the fall behind, in real and other terms, of judges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Defence Force Discipline Appeals Act is a simple matter of resolving authority in a Minister and not the Governor-General. The last matter involves minor amendments to the Family Law Act. I advise the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), who will be following me, that it is not my intention to detain the House a great deal longer on this piece of legislation. I know both of us have been waiting a fair period to wind up the debate on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill represents fairly minor amendments to the Family Law Act. Section 112AA is amended so that the definition of `order under this Act' will provide that a subpoena issued under the rules of the court is an order under the Family Law Act. This amendment will make clear that the sanctions available to the Family Court for dealing with breaches of its orders will be available when a person fails to comply with a subpoena. The Bill will repeal section 116A and section 116B of the Act which provide for payments to States and Territories for financial assistance in family law matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These sections have been made redundant by new legal aid funding arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories. The legal aid bodies are now funded by grants under section 96 of the Constitution. Paragraph 123(1)(u) is amended to increase the maximum penalty which can be imposed for a breach of the family law rules to a sum of $5,000. The rules impose penalties for failure to comply with the summons or a garnishee order and for making false or misleading statements to the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports these minor amendments to the Family Law Act. But I take this opportunity in dealing with amendments to the Family Law Act to make a couple of observations on Government behaviour in regard to the family law legislation&mdash;both the Family Law Regulations (Amendment) 1991 and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Regulations (Amendment) 1991 which, in another place, the coalition and the Australian Democrats successfully opposed just a few weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) is aware, the regulations were part of a set of four regulations made by the Government on 12 December 1991 and due to come into effect on 1 April 1992. Most of us in this place are used to April Fools' Day jokes, but this was a rather cruel version of it, with the Government seeking to impose additional burdens on those people who are forced to face processes under either the Family Law Act or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal&mdash;with further imposts being dumped on them by this Government&mdash;but now not to be so dumped because of the actions taken in the Senate by us and the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regulations provided for a new setting down fee of $500 to be payable in proceedings in the Federal Court, the Family Court and the High Court, and $200 in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. As I have said, the coalition joined with the Democrats to disallow the regulations in relation to the Family Court and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. At a time when the Government is espousing the need to reduce the cost of justice, the coalition believes that it is hypocritical to introduce a range of fees in the Family Court and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which is nothing more than a tax on people who seek access to the courts to resolve their disputes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The costs associated with legal services and litigation today have become so high that many Australians are now effectively denied the opportunity of seeking the redress of wrongdoings. Access to justice has, frankly, become limited to the two extremes of the very wealthy, who can privately fund litigation, and the very poor who can qualify for legal aid assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These remarks have been passed by me time and again, but it is a shocking state of affairs in a nation such as ours that normally law abiding citizens have, in practical terms, very limited access to the law to redress wrongs or to correct manifest injustices. It is not entirely the fault of the Government. Rather than simply talking about its concerns about the cost, the Government should, in fact, be taking steps to ensure that the court procedures are such that excessive delays and other elements that are placed in the way of litigants are removed. However, the legal profession itself has a profound duty to examine itself and to ensure that the present process, which is becoming virtually an outrage for so many people faced with the prospect of litigation&mdash;either of their own determination or when brought against them&mdash;and is almost crippling in its effect, is not allowed to go on forever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a country which is overwhelmingly of middle income and low income people. Unless people are paupers, they cannot get access to legal aid. So much opportunity for the redress of wrongs is denied to average persons&mdash;those who are part of that vast bulk of people in the middle in this nation. That in itself is a manifest injustice. It is something which, as I have said, the profession and governments, in terms of streamlining the processes of justice, have a profound duty to tackle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter is being examined by a Senate committee inquiring into the cost of justice. In my own case, as deputy chairman of a committee examining the Family Law Act, we are looking at the cost of some litigation. Some of the evidence is displeasing, to put it mildly. However, it would be a contempt of the committee if in fact I were to reveal some of that material at this stage. The committee has to report by August and at some point will be directing its attention to the question of costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say in passing that one matter, which is not before the committee, illustrates what I am saying. There is a very well known firm of solicitors in Sydney which was acting for a woman in a family law matter. She received an order for, as I recall it, $580,000 from her husband. An amount of $580,000 was due to the divorcing wife from the divorcing husband. The firm charged her $500,000. It is almost unbelievable that someone can receive an order of $580,000 and be forced to pay legal fees of $500,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this matter was taken on appeal and also got some publicity, the firm properly took action. The partner responsible is no longer a partner of that said firm. But I cite that as an extreme example of what has transpired in our country over the last year. In fact, in the latter part of last year this matter received extensive publicity in some Sydney newspapers. It is an example of the burden placed on someone who had battled through to a successful outcome but then was faced with the horrendous costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, as the deputy chairman of the joint parliamentary inquiry into the operation of the family law and as a former practitioner in that field, I am well aware of the cases that come before the Family Court and the cost of such litigation. Few are as extreme as the example that I gave. Parties to family law disputes are not necessarily there by choice. In many instances they are compelled to seek a legal resolution of conflicts arising out of a marriage breakdown which so tragically involves access and custody of children. The Government had proposed to burden these people, at this most traumatic time of their lives, with an extra $500 fee that none would have been able to avoid and which, for most people, would have been just another burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law Council of Australia expressed very serious reservations in relation to the impact of the fees. The coalition and the Law Council were particularly concerned that significant hardship could result from the imposition of the new fees in the Family Court. For example, a fee would have been payable for applications by a party to remove a violent and abusive spouse from the matrimonial home or to gain proper access to a child when access was being refused by a vindictive custodial parent. There are dozens of examples of where the imposition of the proposed new fees would simply have been unfair and, most certainly, inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surprisingly, the Government did not appear to share our concerns. The Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate), who, frankly, has been extraordinarily vocal in his misrepresentations of the coalition's Fightback package, was strangely silent on this issue. The Minister has accused the coalition of completely undermining efforts to reduce the cost of justice, but has seemed to ignore the impact on the cost of justice of new and increased court fees&mdash;as did the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were also concerned about the imposition of a setting down fee in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Given the nature of the AAT and often smaller claims involved, it seemed absurd to charge a setting down fee even at the reduced rate of $200 and even with the proviso that it is refundable to successful applicants. The fact remains that if one is dealt with capriciously by a government department, one would not have been able to proceed with one's AAT hearing unless one could come up with this initial $200 fee to have one's case set down&mdash;which, of course, was on top of the $300 filing fee. Those were some of the reasons why we moved with the Democrats to have those provisions knocked out in so far as the fees would impact in the Family Court and in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not oppose the passage of the Bill. It deals, as I say, with relatively minor amendments. However, as a coalition, we are concerned at what is unquestionably an erratic and irresponsible approach to the cost of justice. We believe it is of paramount importance to the swift, cost-effective administration of justice that the whole federal system of justice be managed on sound, cost-disciplined administrative principles. However, in the case of the Family Court and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal regulations, the fees further put access to the courts, to justice and to liberty beyond the reach of ordinary citizens. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 is an omnibus Bill. I am pleased that we have bipartisan support for it. The shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), has covered very broadly the three amendments in the Bill. The Bill makes amendments of a minor policy nature to legislation within the Attorney-General's portfolio and also makes some minor technical amendments to legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first amendment is one to the Judges' Pensions Act 1968 to remove the current limitation that a pension payable to the surviving spouse of a judge or retired judge ceases to be payable upon remarriage. Provision is also made for the reinstatement, in certain circumstances, of a pension which has ceased to be payable on remarriage. The second amendment is to section 12 of the Defence Force Discipline Appeals Act 1955 to provide that the Minister, rather than the Governor-General, may approve leave of absence for members of the Defence Force Discipline Appeal Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third makes a number of minor amendments to the Family Law Act 1975. Firstly, it amends the definition of `order under this Act' in section 112AA for the purposes of part XIIIA to provide that a subpoena under the rules of court is an order under the Family Law Act; secondly, it repeals sections 116A and 116B, which are redundant as legal aid bodies are now funded by grants under section 96 of the Constitution; and, thirdly, it amends subsection 123(1)(u) to increase the maximum penalty which can be imposed for a breach of the family law rules to the sum of $5,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to financial impact, the amendments to the Judges' Pensions Act 1968 are expected to have only a minor revenue impact, as pensions which would have ceased to be payable will now be payable. It is expected that the number of additional pensions payable will be very small. The other amendments will have no financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take up only one point, a difficult one, made by the shadow Attorney-General. I acknowledge his genuineness in making his comments. I refer to the way in which remuneration for judges is set. It is extremely difficult in these times because things are tough for everybody out there. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge the need to make sure that we have sensible and fair remuneration for people who hold such a high, important and responsible position in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to make the observation, however, that the Australian Council of Trade Unions has shown not only discipline but also responsibility over the last nine years in that we have actually seen a reduction of some 8 per cent, in real terms, in the salaries of working men and women in this country. On that basis, we have to compare that with the level of remuneration of judges, and even if their remuneration has dropped behind, we have to take cognisance of the remuneration that working men and women in the community receive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the proposition put forward by the shadow Attorney-General that we do have an independent tribunal is taken into account, I have to say that I am not dramatically opposed to that,  but I think the outcome would be dependent upon who and how many people make up that tribunal. I would suggest that, if we do have such a tribunal, Archbishop Hollingworth and representatives of Australian pensioners should necessarily be on such a tribunal. That would certainly give a broader based perspective to the needs of this country and probably a better grass roots understanding of what society is about. We need to ensure that judges have a fair remuneration, but, I would stress, so should fitters and turners; so should people who work in sawmills; and, indeed, so should the Public Service. It is, of course, always going to be the case with regard to law that there will be need to be changes. </PARA>

I would hope that never again would a journalist be imprisoned under the same circumstances. I close with those remarks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addition to the Appropriation Bill (No. 3), the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill, the Government has blundered its way into this cognate debate with Appropriation Bill (No. 5)&mdash;a Bill that is totally without precedent and reflects the incompetence with which the Government manages its budgetary process in this Parliament. Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 1991-92 seeks funding of $87m for labour market reform assistance to job seekers and industry; $50m for residential fee relief for older people; and $66m for child-care fee relief.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the exception of those funds sought for child-care, these items are already included in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4), which we are supposedly debating cognately, and to which the Government has now moved a series of amendments to delete the items that are now to be included in Appropriation Bill (No. 5). We are told that this additional Appropriation Bill is necessary because the Government will run out of money in these areas before the passage of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4). Accordingly, the Government is seeking to rush through Appropriation Bill (No. 5), ahead of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4), having deleted the expenditures to which I just referred from the other two Bills, the original Appropriation Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a totally unprecedented state of affairs in this Parliament, given that it is usual for such shortfalls in funds to be met from the Advance to the Minister for Finance. The Advance to the Minister for Finance is designed to act as a contingency fund and is catered for in the relevant provisions in the Appropriation and Supply Bills. Traditionally, any unforeseen and urgent expenditures not catered for in the Appropriation Bills are met from the Advance to the Minister for Finance. Where the advance is used to supply funds to a government department, the department is required to seek parliamentary approval for those funds in the next Appropriation Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When those Bills are subsequently enacted the amount is then credited back to the Advance to the Minister for Finance. That is the way it is supposed to work; that is the way it has worked in this Parliament since the year dot. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) are usually the final opportunity a department has to make such a transaction. Any transactions made after the passage of these two Bills are normally charged against the advance and referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts for scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to ask the Government why it has not followed this procedure and instead deemed it necessary to pass an additional Appropriation Bill. The Government's action strongly suggests that there is a funding crisis of some sort in the Advance to the Minister for Finance. If there are no funds available in the Advance to the Minister for Finance, we need to know what the situation is with the advance because it strongly suggests that the funds are being used for other purposes which are yet to be subjected to parliamentary scrutiny. We also need to ask what relationship, if any, this funding shortfall has to the Government's unique payment of a one-off $317m in family allowance payments on 2 April, just ahead&mdash;I do not think by coincidence&mdash;of the Wills by-election on 11 April. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although funds have been appropriated for the purpose in the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 that was passed in the last sitting fortnight, the coincidence of timing does suggest that the Advance to the Minister for Finance may have been plundered to pay for this pre-by-election bribe from the Government. In any event, we are witness to what can only be described as gross financial mismanagement in the Government's conduct of the Commonwealth's budgetary process. The annual passage of the Commonwealth's budgetary legislation is meant to proceed through this Parliament in an orderly and timely manner. To this end, there are a number of measures made available to the Government to cater for additional appropriations that may be necessary from time to time in the event of unforeseen circumstances. The Advance to the Minister for Finance is the most important instrument in this regard and normally obviates the need for any additional Appropriation Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case we are asked to pass an additional Appropriation Bill without the benefit of knowing what has been happening with the Advance to the Minister for Finance. The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) has claimed that Appropriation Bill (No. 5) is necessitated by delays in the passage of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4). But every honourable member and every senator in this Parliament knows that those two Bills have only just been introduced into this House and that the normal practice is to debate them over the next few sitting weeks. As yet there have been no delays to speak of and there are to be no unexpected delays. So we have yet to hear a truthful explanation from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At best, the Government has been incompetent in not ensuring that the Advance to the Minister for Finance is able to meet the ongoing expenditures of the Government. This additional Appropriation Bill is undoubtedly further evidence of the continuing deterioration in the Commonwealth's finances. Commonwealth budgeting, once again, is exposed for the sham that it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's finances have been devastated by the recession `we had to have'. According to the most recent statement of Commonwealth Government financial transactions issued by the Minister for Finance, the cumulative budget deficit for the year to date in January was $11.229 billion. This compares with a figure of $2.994 billion for the same period last year. This is a variation of $8.234 billion which is clearly not entirely attributable to irregularities in government outlays and receipts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is little wonder that the Government finds itself running out of money in particular programs. The Government's original Budget deficit forecast contained in the 1991-92 Budget was $4.732 billion, a change for the worse on the outcome for the previous year, 1990-91, of $6.628 billion and giving rise to a net public sector borrowing requirement equal to 4.3 per cent of gross domestic product. This forecast in the most recent Government Budget was to prove wildly optimistic, as we have come to expect from this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the economic statement the Government issued a revised budget deficit forecast for 1991-92 of $6.3 billion. The ante goes up each day and each month, it seems. That was then quickly revised to a budget deficit forecast of $6.8 billion to reflect the new measures contained in the Government's `One Nation, One Job' statement. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4), together with the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2), seek additional appropriations totalling $1.117 billion. Allowing for savings in the appropriations made by Appropriation Act (No. 1) and Appropriation Act (No. 2) last year, these Bills represent a net increase of $971m in payments to be financed from annual appropriations this financial year. This is an increase of 2.8 per cent on the amounts made available in the 1991-92 Budget, or 2.5 per cent discounting for the additional expenditure contained in the `One Job' economic statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These appropriations are designed to meet increases in ongoing government expenditure not provided for in the original Appropriation Bills, as well as to fund some of the spending contained in the `One Job' statement. The `One Job' statement contains increased outlays and tax cuts worth $0.5 billion dollars in 1991-92; $1.8 billion in 1992-93; $1.6 billion in 1993-94; $5.1 billion in 1994-95; and $7.6 billion in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing that needs to be said about this new spending and revenue to be forgone is that it is totally unfunded. It is all new Commonwealth debt. The measures contained in the statement will, in aggregate, increase the public deficit for 1991-92 by $0.5 billion to $6.8 billion on the basis of the Government's own figures. The Government then projects the deficit to increase to $8 billion in 1992-93. These projections are clearly overly optimistic and beyond 1992-93 totally unbelievable, given that they are based on wildly hopeful economic and productivity growth forecasts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But even if we believe these crystal ball projections for the Budget deficit, the Government is forcing on Australia a massive public sector financing task in the years ahead. On the basis of its own figures, the Government will need to finance cumulative Budget deficits of at least $18 billion between 1991-92 and 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the period to 30 June 1994 we are looking at a financing task totalling $19.4 billion. This is on the Government's own figures. The `One Job' statement will thus see the Government issuing new debt of around $20 billion to pay for this unfunded spending spree. This is on top of the approximately $35 billion in Commonwealth debt currently on issue. The projected increases represent nearly a 60 per cent escalation in the value of Commonwealth government securities on issue at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a statement that promises to deliver 500,000 new jobs over and above the 300,000 destroyed by the Government's recession, this entails unfunded spending of $40,000 per job, plus interest, making it perhaps the most expensive job creation scheme in the history of the Commonwealth. The impact of this new debt will be to place upward pressure on interest rates and the exchange rate, with all that entails for the Australian economy, over the life of this `One Job' statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that the Government has understated the total cost of the statement and the subsequent financing tasks that it will generate, these problems will be even more severe. We already know that the Budget deficit to December 1991 amounted to $7.5 billion&mdash;although this is partly attributable to the pattern of outlays and revenue collections&mdash;which means that the result cannot be extrapolated to give a Budget outcome for the remainder of this financial year. But we do have private sector forecasts that are suggesting a $9 billion Budget deficit for 1991-92, even before allowing for the fiscal impact of the new measures contained in the `One Job' statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are thus faced with the immediate and medium term prospect of a huge blow-out in public sector debt, with adverse consequences for interest rates and the exchange rate under the `One Job' statement. The private sector will find itself competing for funds with the Commonwealth and the rest of the public sector, undermining the productive investment by the private sector that we need to ensure a sustainable recovery over the longer term. This compares most unfavourably with the anticipated reduction in public sector debt of $13 billion under the coalition's Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that the `One Job' statement contains a significant number of worthwhile spending initiatives by the Federal Government&mdash;measures which the coalition could perhaps be expected to support. Indeed, most of the worthwhile measures in the economic statement&mdash;the `One Job' statement&mdash;are lifted straight from the pages of the coalition's Fightback manual. However, we cannot uncritically condone a spending and tax package that is totally unfunded, as is the `One Job' statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the biggest contrast between Fightback and the `One Job' statement is the way in which Fightback has been fully funded down to the last dollar. The coalition would have rightly been subjected to enormous criticism if it had produced a package containing unfunded spending or unfunded tax cuts. Yet, by some peculiar double standard, the Government thinks it can get away with a totally unfunded package. In fact, the Government damns its `One Job' statement out of its own mouth when it makes allegations about funding holes in the expenditure side of Fightback, while at the same time presiding over its own totally unfunded package. The Government simply cannot have it both ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that while the Government looks for funding holes in Fightback, on the basis of the Government's own growth projections, the coalition could implement both the Fightback and the `One Job' economic package out of its fiscal surplus without increasing public sector debt. That gives an indication as to how conservative and fiscally responsible the coalition's Fightback package really is, especially when one considers that we have made no allowance for any possible incentive effects the Fightback package may have on the level of economic activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The `One Job' statement contains just over $1 billion in new infrastructure spending. The most important point to be made about this proposed new infrastructure spending is that it will not make up for the deliberate run-down in capital outlays by this Commonwealth Government since 1983-84, which has been one of the principal contributors to the Budget surpluses that the Government was able to deliver briefly up until the 1990-91 financial year. The surplus was, of course, built principally on increases in revenue collections, particularly PAYE tax receipts&mdash;the great tax grab of the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there was some restraint in outlays, this fell almost entirely on grants to the States, asset sales and capital spending. There was very little restraint in Commonwealth recurrent consumption spending. This occurred despite widespread recognition of the deterioration in the quantity and quality of Australia's national infrastructure over recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The run-down in this country's national infrastructure has had adverse consequences for our economic well-being. Economically viable infrastructure spending is the only area of government spending that can be productive. It is an important input into the production processes and the production capacity of the private sector, serving to enhance the value of national output. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government spending for consumption purposes, by contrast, does little or nothing to enhance national output. The run-down in Commonwealth capital spending is one of the reasons that private expenditure for investment purposes and the profitability of private capital has suffered so heavily under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's approach to fiscal policy since 1983 has been to favour consumption spending at the expense of public sector investment&mdash;that was one of the ways in which the Government delivered its much vaunted but short-lived surpluses. Now the Government turns around and announces a massive increase in capital works spending and expects to take credit for all the ensuing benefits that have been postponed by its neglect of the national infrastructure over the past nine years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public sector investment has often been neglected by government because it is easier to cut back on capital expenditure than to cut back on public consumption spending, for obvious political reasons. However, people are becoming increasingly conscious of the appalling state of the country's roads and other elements of the national infrastructure and the effects this is having on economic activity. Clearly, the Government now thinks there are votes in increasing public sector investment; votes which can be easily had because this new spending is not to be paid for by cuts in government consumption spending or by increased taxes under the Government's `One Job' statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it would be surprising if people did not blame the current Government for the present state of our national infrastructure and take a very dim view indeed of any attempt by the Government to claim credit for improvements subsequent to the increased spending which is envisaged in the `One Job' statement. They certainly will not be impressed by the higher interest rates and higher exchange rate that the Government's unfunded spending will force upon them in the medium term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From a macro-economic point of view, much of the capital spending and the fiscal stimulus contained in this statement is poorly timed. For any fiscal stimulus to be effective in supporting possible economic recovery it must be well planned and put in place early to contribute to any upswing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is widely recognised that governments should seek to smooth public capital and consumption expenditure over time, so as not exacerbate the peaks and troughs of economic cycles. This can be done only through the adoption of fiscal rules similar to the rules often advocated in relation to the conduct of monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that the Government has missed the boat entirely when it comes to making a contribution to recovery from the recession through the fiscal stimulus contained in its `One Job' statement. Any such fiscal stimulus needs to take place during the slide into, not the climb out of, recession. Scandalously, at the time the slide into recession was taking place, the Government was busy denying that any such recession was imminent, let alone doing something about it&mdash;for example, by way of the infrastructure spending which was warranted at that time. Instead, the Government claimed that we were meant to be heading towards a `slowdown' or a `soft landing'&mdash;quaint terms which I am sure are remembered by many people in this country. The Government got it dreadfully wrong then and it is now about to compound that mistake by applying fiscal stimulus too late in the economic cycle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The spending comes at the end of the most protracted recession in 60 years. We have had six quarters of negative growth, but it is only now, when there are some tentative signs of a weak recovery, that the Government slams down on the fiscal accelerator. It would be surprising if the new spending contained in the `One Job' statement did serve to stimulate overall economic activity to a significant extent in the foreseeable future. Instead, it will be more likely to serve to crowd out private sector investment during the crucial phases of the prospective economic recovery by forcing up interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fiscal stimulus may temporarily accelerate economic growth before monetary policy needs to be tightened and growth slowed due to the foreign debt constraint, thereby putting us back on the boom-bust cycle so beloved of this Government. The role traditionally played by this Government's mishandling of monetary policy is now to be taken over by the mismanagement of fiscal policy. Having totally abused one instrument of policy, which gave us record high interest rates and the worst recession in 60 years, the Government is going to have a fiddle with another policy instrument that is equally useless, if not extremely dangerous, when used in a discretionary manner. Economists now recognise that such discretionary use of policy instruments requires extremely accurate economic forecasting&mdash;forecasting which may be beyond what is currently achievable by the economics profession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The associated economic modelling must also exhibit a high degree of independence from the setting of economic policy for its integrity to be maintained; yet the `One Job' statement is built around an extremely limited model, constructed especially for the purposes of the very same statement, which clearly embodies a large number of imported and dubious assumptions. It is little wonder that the growth and other forecasts contained in the Government's scenario have been the subject of such heavy criticism. The integrity of this statement as a macro-economic policy instrument is entirely dependent on this modelling exercise; yet, by all accounts, this model&mdash;to use an expression of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;is not worth a bean, let alone a row of beans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the contrast with the approach taken by the coalition in Fightback could not be more stark. We did not build a model specifically to give us the desired results. We ran our package through an existing and highly-regarded model used not just by the coalition but by no less an authority than the Treasury itself. The results of this exercise are well known, as are the results generated by running the Government's `One Nation, One Job' statement through the same model, demonstrating the Government's package to be a disaster for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's modelling of its `One Job' economic statement includes the crucial assumption of unprecedented productivity gains&mdash;gains far in excess of anything we have ever before seen achieved in Australia. Between 1985-86 and 1988-89 gross product per hour worked in Australia increased by a miserable one per cent compound per annum. Somehow the Government thinks it can put this experience behind it and deliver a massive productivity growth over the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The `One Job' statement is almost entirely devoid of any new micro-economic reform initiatives that just might deliver such unprecedented productivity growth, so we can be forgiven for asking just where this increased productivity will come from. We know that it will not be coming from the labour market, in which the Government is held hostage by the ACTU to an even greater extent than it is in other policy areas. It will not be coming from any of the host of other areas of potential structural reform totally neglected by this `One Job' statement&mdash;areas that have been identified for some time now as crucial micro-economic reform initiatives. We also have the curious double standard whereby the Government has used one set of inflation and growth forecasts for its `One Job' economic statement and an entirely different set for its analysis of the coalition's Fightback package. Mr Des Moore said of the `One Job' statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The assumptions on which these projections are based are so implausible as to suggest that they have been constructed by starting with a desired result and then producing projections to fit. It is of serious concern that a government should seemingly attempt to deceive the electorate in such a way.</PARA>
<PARA>In the end, it is important that the increasingly arcane battle of models does not distract attention from the substance of the policies contained in each of the statements. Clearly, Fightback is the more comprehensive of the two packages. It is this commitment to comprehensive economic reform&mdash;not mere tinkering&mdash;that puts the Fightback package ahead of the `One Job' statement. Moreover, the Fightback package is not dependent on the realisation of a bogus economic scenario to deliver its promised benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is entirely appropriate that this House roundly criticises the Government for the failure of its `One Job' statement. The Government has had nine long years to get things right. In that time we have had dozens of economic statements, mini-Budgets and full Budgets. We have had three such statements in the last 12 months, not including the last Budget. Whenever things are going wrong, it seems to be a case of, `Let's have another statement'. We never see the results of it. We never see a reduction in the nearly one million people actually out of work and the nearly two million people either out of work or seriously underemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had three statements in the last 12 months, not one of which has come to terms with the major problem of unemployment in this country. There was the March 1991 industry policy statement, the November 1991 jobs statement&mdash;that was a misnomer if ever there was one&mdash;and now we have the `One Job' statement. I would think that after all this time the Government would have learned the lesson that half-measures and incomplete policy statements cannot by their very nature deliver what is required to return this country to prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is needed is a commitment to comprehensive economic reform. The coalition's Fightback package contains that commitment. The Government's `One Job' statement, regrettably, does not. It is extremely doubtful that it can save the one job it was intended to preserve&mdash;that is, the Prime Minister's. That would be the most positive outcome of the Government's contemptuously misnamed economic statement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating the Appropriation Bills cognately. The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), in his second reading speech, adequately covered the appropriations of a broad range of departments. I believe that today in</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>the debate on the censure motion he not only blew holes in the Opposition's arguments about models&mdash;and we have heard about several models from the other side of the House&mdash;but clearly indicated the substances on this side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several areas in the appropriations that I would like to discuss, particularly rural matters such as the rural adjustment scheme, funding and support, the extra appropriations in regard to RAS of some $33.9m, and a $25m increase in funding for the black spots road program&mdash;all of which I think are very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to cover some of the points made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). There will certainly be a comparison over time of the policies contained in the Government's One Nation statement and the Opposition's policies. The Opposition says that it is about reform. Reform means actually improving things. The Opposition's Fightback package is actually going back in time; going back to the Opposition's future. I think it is important to recognise&mdash;I have said this before in the House and I will say it again&mdash;that the One Nation statement and the Fightback package indicate the clear divisions in philosophy between the Government and the Opposition more clearly now than at any other time since the early part of this century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to go into that matter in detail. The One Nation statement is about recovery. We are not about talking down the economy; we are not about talking down confidence. It is disappointing that, from time to time&mdash;almost every day&mdash;we hear in the House the Opposition talking down the economy, talking down investment, and looking at and promoting negative aspects of the Australian economy. I do not think that is healthy, I do not think it is Australian; I think it is un-Australian. It is certainly not beneficial to this nation. There are many positive aspects we can talk about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation statement is about providing infrastructure for transportation&mdash;particularly for rail and for ports&mdash;in order to improve our export potential. Of course, we can be very proud of the money that will be going into TAFE and into education. In the last few weeks I have had the privilege of opening extensions to two private schools in my electorate. These schools will benefit significantly from the something like $1.3 billion which has been allocated to non-government schools in 1992. Of course, another $1.3 billion approximately has been allocated to government schools. The Federal Government has allocated something like $2.6 billion to education this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Education is the key to equality; it is the way in which we can open the doors to give people better opportunities. It is disappointing that the Opposition does not have a priority in education or training. Under the Opposition's Fightback package, only the wealthy will have access to a university education and the opportunity to progress and reach for the stars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other broad differences between the two packages. There is a broad difference with regard to industrial relations. We heard the previous speaker criticise the industrial relations policy of the Government. I think we can be very proud of our industrial relations policy. We have brought Australians together and, as a consequence of consultation, we have seen the Australian Council of Trade Unions adopt a responsible manner and play a very responsible role in bargaining and arguing for improved conditions for the men and women whom it represents. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is fair to say that the working men and women of this country have made a massive contribution to improving our competitiveness. We have seen a reduction of some 8 per cent in unit labour costs since Labor came to power. That is a massive contribution. We have seen inflation go down to 3 per cent, which improves the competitiveness of our mining sector and our exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is always interesting to note that those on the other side of the House&mdash;particularly those in the National Party of Australia&mdash;complain about the dollar and say that it should be lower. The dollar has traded lower under Labor than it ever did under the Opposition parties when in government. The National Party fails to recognise that we floated the dollar. This improved our competitiveness and improved our export potential. I think that is something it has forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things I would like to focus on in regard to the effect of revenue and taxation is the consumption tax, or the tax of 15 per cent, that would be levied on people across Australia, particularly those in provincial, rural and farming areas such as my electorate. In 1990 when we were involved in the embargo against Iraq and the military action which took place, we saw a massive rise in fuel prices, we saw grain prices drop, we saw drought towards the end of 1990. We saw the massive effect of all of this, as well as the consequences of surplus, on the rural sector&mdash;sugar, wheat, grains and the wool industry. We saw the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), in particular, and his fellow Party members running around Australia trying to regain some of the support they had lost through the corruption issues in Queensland by crying sympathy&mdash;nothing else; just sympathy&mdash;and saying that rural Australia was in crisis and that the Government was to blame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to recognise what the National Party now has to offer rural Australia. It offers a consumption tax of 15 per cent, which will mean that more than 60 per cent of all farming families will be between $4 and $22 per week worse off. In other words, the Leader of the National Party will tax 60 per cent of those farmers he said he felt for and cared for by between $4 and $22 per week. I do not think that indicates much compassion at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that, while 60 per cent of farmers will be worse off, the Leader of the National Party will get a tax cut of $150 per week. After bracket creep, he will receive a benefit of $68 per week&mdash;not just him, but all people on that level of income. I think that highlights the fact that the consumption tax will not benefit the rural community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night during a debate on the coarse grains legislation the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), rightfully pointed out that the average grain producer will have a net income of $30,000 this year. What will the Fightback package do for him? He will have to pay 15 per cent on all of the basic necessities of life. He will be worse off; he will not benefit one iota. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then move to an issue which is at the real heart of rural Australia. One of the most important issues, and one which was raised and debated during the last election, is that of roads and road funding. I think it is important to look at what the Opposition has to offer in regard to roads. The National Party Leader has run around Queensland, in particular, saying that the Opposition will abolish excise. But what will replace excise? Page 58 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the longer term, responsibility for road funding will be transferred to the National Road Transport Commission and roads will be funded through user charges as proposed in the current negotiations. . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, excise will be abolished and road user charges will replace road funding. I well remember approximately two years ago when the Butcher report&mdash;the ISC report&mdash;was presented containing the recommendation for road user charges in conjunction with excise for the maintenance of roads. There was a hue and cry from rural groups, local government associations and road transport associations to the effect that using road user charges in conjunction with excise would break the rural community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what does the National Party propose to do? It proposes to fund all roads by road user charges only. If part road user charges in conjunction with excise will be a massive impost on the rural community and on the beef industry in particular&mdash;some producers have to travel hundreds of kilometres from the Gulf to a railhead or a particular city&mdash;what will total road user charges do to the rural communities? <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far, the Queensland Local Government Association&mdash;which is run by a National Party stooge&mdash;has not said anything. But when this starts to bite and when farmers start to realise they will have to pay thousands of dollars on their own vehicles, and when the transport associations realise they will have to pay thousands of dollars in order to fund roads, there will be a hue and cry. If there is not and if the charges do not run into thousands of dollars, that means only one thing: the roads will fall apart, crumble and disappear. One of those two things will occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year the Federal Government will be spending $1.65 billion directly on roads. That is not counting untied grants that go to roads from States and local authorities. Those dollars will have to come out of road user charges if the Opposition is going to maintain the same level of funding for roads. I have publicly challenged the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party, who has gone dead quiet on this issue, to state what level of road user charges will be imposed in order to maintain roads. What has happened? He has disappeared. He has not said a word. The best way to get the Leader of the National Party to go quietly is either to mention the Fitzgerald inquiry or to mention road user charges&mdash;he disappears straight away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other aspects of Fightback which I totally oppose, and which is absolutely crazy, is the idea to privatise port authorities and promote competition within them. I say here and now that I have the best port authority in Australia in Gladstone. The Gladstone Port Authority, which handles 5 per cent of Australia's exports&mdash;30 million tonnes of shipping a year&mdash;is the best port authority in Australia. The amount of money that authority puts into the city of Gladstone is incredible. It is a massive and wonderful corporate organisation for the city and for central Queensland. I totally oppose the proposition of the Opposition, and of the State Opposition, in wanting to privatise organisations like the Gladstone Port Authority. It is absolutely crazy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another issue that really stands us apart. It is an issue that not only amuses me but also confuses me. The Leader of the National Party says in one of his releases that he wants in the longer term to abolish tariffs on imports of agricultural machinery and spare parts ahead of the ultimate abolition of protection by the year 2000. So in eight years tariffs are going to be abolished under the Opposition's Fightback, and the Leader of the National Party wants to speed it up. That is very fine if that is his point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Leader of the National Party in the Senate was running all around Queensland only a few weeks ago with a story, saying that the overall impact of tariffs coming off will be a flood of subsidised sugar coming into Australia. Senator Ron Boswell is opposing the reduction in tariffs. There is either a communication problem between the Fightback package, Senator Boswell as the Leader of the Nationals in the Senate and the Leader of the National Party in the House of Representatives, or Senator Boswell fails to understand plain English or is simply not telling the truth. I am not accusing him of telling an untruth; I am simply making the observation that what he is saying in regard to tariffs is diametrically opposed to what the Opposition is proposing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last few years the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) has been a backwoods regulator and public protectionist, along with his mate the editor of the Proserpine paper, who has criticised me for supporting freer trade and the abolition of the sugar embargo. He has cried puppy-dog tears every time tariffs have come down, but has embraced with open arms the Fightback package. I do not know whether he has been prepared to tell the sugar growers in his area that he supports the abolition of tariffs on sugar within eight years but, if he has not, I am certainly going to tell them, as I am going to tell all the sugar growers not only in my area, but right throughout the State, that what Senator Boswell says does not stand up and is totally and diametrically opposed to his own Party's policy and his own Party's position vis-a-vis the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Boswell disagrees with that, he should publicly walk away from the Fightback package. But what he cannot do, and what the Nationals in Queensland cannot do, like the honourable member for Dawson, is have a dollar each way. They cannot be backwoods regulators and protectionists at home and then come here and put their arms around the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), saying, `We are with you all the way'. They have been caught out and they are going to be made to stand to account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the general public rightfully makes a determination at the next election between the One Nation statement and the Fightback package, surely to goodness it will be incumbent on politicians on both sides of the House to tell the public exactly what their policies stand for and let the community make a rational judgment. I pose this question: how can any primary producers, particularly those who want to maintain some level of tariff or protection, formulate an opinion on the position of the Queensland National Party or the Federal National Party when we have Senator Boswell opposing tariff reductions, the Leader of the National Party on the record as supporting a speeding up of tariff cuts, and the honourable member for Dawson embracing the Fightback package, which means the abolition of tariffs in eight years?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian </EMPHASIS>of 16 April 1991 we saw the heading `Nationals split on backing tariff cuts'. Then today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> says there is pressure on the shadow Minister in regard to tariff cuts. That is all very fine. I really do not mind what sort of internecine warfare is held between members of the Opposition, but when we have some members&mdash;and senior members&mdash;of the Opposition promoting protection on the one hand, and another senior member of the National Party promoting the abolition of tariffs on the other, it is confusing to me and it certainly must be confusing to farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it any wonder that we really need to ask this question: will the Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), be prepared to stand up and state his position? Does he stand for the abolition of tariffs in eight years, as he said in his press release, and will he bring Senator Boswell in and tell him to tell the truth and stick to the Fightback package? Will Senator Boswell be allowed to run around Queensland telling whatever story he wishes, and maintain his position on the Senate ticket to please the League of Rights and the Ku Klux Klan, or will he be made to be accountable and stick with the Fightback package?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know it is going to be messy, because I have been criticised for supporting a reduction in tariffs. But ironically we will have a level of tariff protection, low though it may well be, under Labor. The Opposition is going to wipe it out. The irony is that the very argument that people such as Senator Boswell and the hillbillies in the National Party in Queensland have used for so long to hit us over the head with like a stick will be the very thing that convicts them. They will finally have to tell their own constituents that they support the Fightback package and thus support the abolition of tariffs in eight years. That is the point I would like to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That points to a massive break in the whole wall of the Fightback package, because if the tariffs do not stick, and if the Leader of the National Party in the Senate can say something on the public record that is totally contradictory to the Fightback package&mdash;and the Leader of the National Party in this House is not prepared publicly to discipline him and yet supports the speeding up of the abolition of tariffs&mdash;that means not only that there is a division, but also that we do not know which model or which aspect of the Fightback package in regard to tariffs the Opposition stands for. It then begs the question: what about tax, what about education and what about health? What about Medicare? What about the number of farmers who are doing it tough and cannot afford private insurance? How will they be treated under the new proposition of the Opposition, whereby Medicare will be torn apart bit by bit, limb by limb, arm by arm? As we go across all those other areas we will see it slowly fall down, brick by brick. Just as the Berlin Wall fell down, so too will the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today with the comments in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> we see that the problems in regard to tariffs are just the start. After all the rhetoric and the nonsense that have been used by the Boswells, the O'Chees and Senator Flo Bjelke-Petersen, all the nonsense over the last two years by the voodoo protectionists and backwoods regulators such as the honourable member for Dawson, now they have to stand up and say whether they really support that line or whether they support Fightback. They cannot do both. If they walk away from the nonsense they have peddled for the last two years, then they are in real trouble with their own constituents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Appropriation Bills before the House deal with certain funding arrangements in relation to the Government's overall budgetary policy. I take this opportunity to debate a broader range of economic matters and budgetary policies. In particular, it is important to consider the impact of the economic statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I will be concentrating on it from two perspectives: firstly, its significance to small business across Australia and, secondly, its impact within my own electorate of Forrest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to turn the attention of the House to the small business sector and consider what the Prime Minister's plans will mean for the single most important economic group in Australia.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of the small business sector must never be underestimated. Small business owners employ just on half of the private sector work force and contribute some 40 per cent to value added in this country. Notwithstanding this, the small business sector, which has suffered the most under this Government's economic policy onslaught in recent years&mdash;it has faced spiralling costs, including a crushing tax regime, an inflexible industrial relations system and drastic cuts in business activity due to the recession which the Prime Minister, the then Treasurer, said we had to have&mdash;has been decimated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most significant measures of the health of the small business sector is the level of bankruptcy. This vital economic indicator shows that the number of businesses forced into bankruptcy increased by 50.3 per cent in the 1990-91 financial year over the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My own background is in small business. Quite frankly, I believe a person has to be either brave or extremely stupid to go into business today. Of course, there is a lot of truth in the comment that any businesses which can survive, let alone prosper, in today's depressed economy will be in a strong position to gain when the economy turns around. The question is: when will this happen? When will the real interest rates be competitive with overseas rates and when will unemployment decline, thereby promoting retail demand? When will personal income tax rates be reduced sufficiently to give average Australians greater spending power and when will Australia reach its potential as a dominant exporter in world markets?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Prime Minister's economic statement is anything to go by, I for one will not be holding my breath waiting for these outcomes. Certainly it is encouraging that the Government has belatedly accepted the need for change in economic direction. After plunging Australia into recession because of its inability to do much apart from tightening monetary policy by pushing interest rates through the roof, the Government has at last been talking about the need for widespread reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ironic that the same man who gave us the worst recession in 60 years has now said `I am sorry' to the Australian people and has admitted that we need economic policy reform. The problem is that some of the Prime Minister's so-called reforms will do more harm than good. Undoubtedly, the most significant part of the Government's budgetary approach is its decision to go on a $2.3 billion spending spree. The Prime Minister says this is needed to kick-start the economy&mdash;the same economy that he strangled to death with his own hands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, some of the items of expenditure in themselves are commendable. For example, the emphasis on road, rail and electricity infrastructure is a ready admission by the Government of its failure to make improvements in nearly a decade of Labor leadership. These reforms do not withstand rigorous scrutiny. For example, what is the point of moving towards a single gauge rail system without first ensuring substantial productivity improvements are gained in the running of the railway system? What is the point of improving our roads without reducing freight operating costs, especially fuel prices?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most damming criticism I have of the Government's spending programs is that they are unfunded. The Prime Minister has locked Australia into a Budget deficit for the next four years at least. In other words, the Government will be spending borrowed money because it simply does not have the guts to put its own House in order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister and his new Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) have already demonstrated that they are unable to get their sums right. This hardly inspires confidence in their economic management of this country. Indeed, the Government has already taken the nation from a surplus of $1.9 billion this year to a forecast deficit of some $6.8 billion. Now we are told to expect a staggering $8 billion deficit in the year 1992-93. As if this were not bad enough, it is highly likely the Government's forecast could be wrong, in which case the forthcoming deficits would be even worse than the Prime Minister has admitted to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable members opposite that their Government has developed an extremely bad record of inaccurate Budget forecasts. In the year 1990-91 we were told to expect a huge surplus of more than $8.1 billion, but the actual result was in fact less than $1.9 billion. The Treasurer, now Prime Minister, scored just 23 per cent for accuracy in that case. He then forecast a deficit in 1991-92 of $4.7 billion but now admits the Budget will be as much as $6.8 billion in the red by the end of this financial year. In short, the Government will have taken Australia from a forecast surplus of $8.1 billion to a deficit of $8 billion in just two years. This is a turnaround of more than $16 billion and a clear demonstration of how unstable the Government's budgetary process has become. Of course, if the new Treasurer's forecasting is as inaccurate as that of his predecessor, we may witness an even worse result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that the Government is pushing up Australia's level of debt at a time when we can least afford it. With foreign debt at nearly $200 billion, it amazes me that the Prime Minister plans to spend borrowed money to take the nation even further into the red. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not pretend to hide the fact that the Prime Minister's economic statement was a clever political instrument aimed at clawing back some of the electoral support this Government has lost in recent times, especially after the launch of the coalition's Fightback package. It is also designed to appear tough while actually not treading on any toes. For example, there is much talk about the need for a response to resource developments, but there is still no commitment on Coronation Hill. Last month's statement was couched in terms which could persuade many people that this Government will free up the centralised industrial relations system. Also, there was considerable emphasis on the need for genuine tax reform and tax reductions for wage and salary earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Behind this facade is the truth of it all, and the truth is that the so-called economic statement is nothing more than a grab bag of ideas cobbled together and promoted as an economic strategy. There is no common theme and no broad thrust for reform. More importantly, some of the more appealing aspects of the statement have their foundations set in quicksand. Immediately after the Prime Minister finished his speech, financial markets fell, reflecting the business community's apprehension and mistrust of the statement. Since then the nation's peak welfare group has slammed the Government's proposed tax cuts because they would actually make low income earners worse off. Even families on joint incomes of around $30,000 would be worse off according to ACOSS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall there has been widespread scepticism of the Government's ability to deliver any of its long term commitments. The danger is that we will end up with a massive foreign debt and a crippling budget deficit with very little to show for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us consider where the small business sector fits within this scenario. Certainly the Prime Minister acknowledges the importance of small business and even goes so far as to say that many small businesses have experienced some difficulty in the present downturn. This is his understated way of describing the economic nightmare which has forced nearly 14,000 small businesses into bankruptcy in the last 12 months and has resulted in many more business owners simply closing their doors and walking away. Perhaps the Government's refusal to acknowledge the full extent of the situation helps explain why so little emphasis has been given to assisting small business in the Prime Minister's statement. While some measures will assist small business, the fact remains it is really too little too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Take changes such as the capital gains tax, for instance. Here we have the single biggest disincentive for small business owners to expand their operations. It is also responsible for stripping away the incentive and the reward for years of hard work by individual small business owners. Instead of major reform to the capital gains tax, the Government has tinkered around the edge by merely increasing tax-free thresholds from 20 per cent of goodwill to 50 per cent subject to certain eligibility criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What incentive is this for a business owner who is thinking about expanding to bigger premises, thereby enabling him to take advantage of a new plant, better warehousing facilities and even hire some additional staff? This opportunity is being stripped from him. In this case, selling up existing premises could result in a significant capital gains tax assessment which would reduce the level of capital available for reinvestment in the expanded operation. On the other hand, allowing a tax free rollover of these funds would ensure that the full value of the sale of existing plant and premises could be ploughed back into the productive objective of expanding the business enterprise in question. This, of course, is the coalition's policy and highlights our genuine concern to assist small businesses which are striving to get on but which have been held back by an excessive tax burden imposed by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By comparison with the Government's refusal to acknowledge that the capital gains tax takes away the reward for many years of hard work, we have decided to introduce a range of concessions to small business owners who sell up or retire. Under our plans, capital gains of less than $3,000 would be tax free, while a business owner aged 60 or over could sell up and retire with no tax on gains of up to 10 times average annual earnings. That is currently around $300,000. All this is in addition to tax-free thresholds on goodwill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> How do the capital gains tax changes proposed by the Government compare with the coalition's Fightback initiatives? Obviously, the bottom line is how much tax will be saved by the small business sector under each proposal. Under the Prime Minister's proposal, and by his own admission, small business will save just $10m annually as a result of his Government's fiddling of the present capital gains tax system. Under the coalition's Fightback reforms, small business will save considerably more&mdash;40 times more in fact. Indeed, our proposals will cut capital gains tax imposed on small business by $200m in a full year. Unlike the Prime Minister's grab bag of give-aways, the coalition's tax reforms are fully funded as part of our comprehensive economic reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other measure in the Prime Minister's statement aimed specifically at small business is the deferral of income tax for some companies. However, this has only been necessary as a result of the previous tax changes which impacted on the cash flows of small businesses. A number of new general policies will benefit some small businesses. For example, funding for export measures has been increased. However, the fact still remains that only 700 of the existing 800,000 small businesses will be encouraged to export over the next three-year period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some ways, the Prime Minister has actually discriminated against small business. For example, the move to reduce sales tax on passenger vehicles means that most business operators will be at a relative disadvantage over private buyers. By dropping the rate of wholesale sales tax on passenger vehicles to 15 per cent, the Government has reduced the prices paid by private individuals and by businesses which use the same sedans and station wagons. However, most small businesses do not use these types of vehicles solely for business purposes. The vehicles that are used principally or solely for small business are utilities, vans, delivery trucks, motorcycles for courier work, and other specialised vehicles. Yet none of these are included in the Prime Minister's statement of initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a clear indication that the so-called economic statement was in fact a political statement first and foremost. If we compare these hotchpotch tax changes with the coalition's concise commitment to abolish wholesale sales tax on all vehicles and to scrap fuel excise, it is easy to see why the Government's new scheme has caused little excitement within the small business community. Likewise, the Government's proposals in the field of industrial relations sound impressive but do not stand up to scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small business desperately needs a more flexible wages system so that each business can negotiate its own wages and conditions with its employees, subject to certain minimum wage safeguards. This is the only way to ensure that outdated concepts, such as penalty rates and restrictive work practices, can be discarded in favour of all-embracing employment contracts which suit the individual enterprise and which benefit productive and hardworking employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Unfortunately, the Government talks about workplace bargaining but its plans have little relevance to the small business sector, despite the significant bearing this issue has on the degree of competitiveness amongst smaller enterprises. More importantly, some would say that the massive burden of business costs has not been addressed by the Prime Minister's statement. For example, there has been no assault on the costs imposed by the wholesale sales tax, payroll tax, the training levy or the fuel tax, despite the crippling burden these taxes impose on business costs across the nation. We have to do something to reduce these costs if our private sector is to have any chance in keeping up with foreign competition, and yet the Government has done little more than pay lip service to this vital issue. The irony is that the Government talks about the need for business reform and the need to generate employment. Yet whenever it has the opportunity to take the tough decisions needed to address these problems, it runs a mile. The facts are very simple: these costs are crippling small businesses and costing jobs. Let us consider the taxes we pay today, especially payroll tax. This is a tax on the number of employees a business hires. There is no link to the profitability of a business or to any service the Government provides in return for the tax. The end result is that payroll tax reduces the private sector's capacity to employ. In harsh, cold economic terms, it makes people less competitive against other business inputs. In everyday English, it means that payroll tax costs jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now well known that the coalition committed itself to abolishing payroll tax along with six other taxes. Our plans include scrapping the wholesale sales tax in favour of a fairer goods and services tax and rebating all taxes paid on business inputs. Overall, our Fightback strategy will reduce business costs by some $20 billion. This will be of enormous benefit to Australian businesses struggling to remain viable or to compete with overseas competitors. Another aspect of crucial economic importance is the need to promote development within Australia's resources sector to stimulate exports and to reduce our balance of payments by increased import substitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this end, the Government has announced its commitment to a concept of resource security. Again, I welcome its belated recognition of the problems confronting our resources sector. However, this problem is entirely the Government's own doing. Instead of imposing a uniform, stable approach to resource issues, the Government all too often has acted according to short term political expediency. Senator Richardson's love affair with the Green movement saw a swing towards anti-development policies and killed off a number of major investment proposals. Now, faced with the stark reality of record unemployment and declining levels of new investment, down 14.5 per cent nationally on the latest annual figures, the Prime Minister would have us believe that his economic statement is strongly pro-development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, some measures were welcome, including relaxing foreign investment guidelines and introducing more favourable depreciation arrangements. But I must question whether some measures are more cosmetic than anything else. For example, the new unit to be established to facilitate major projects looks good on paper. However, even the Prime Minister admits that many resource development issues are complex and cross over State-Federal boundaries of authority. In any event, what good would this new unit have done when the Government blocked Wesley Vale or Coronation Hill? None whatsoever, I would suggest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, I do not blame our resources sector, particularly the timber industry, if it becomes more than a little disenchanted with its political representatives on the other side of the House. For instance, it is no wonder, after years of instability in the timber industry due to fluctuating levels of support from government, that the industry so desperately wants resource security cemented in place by legislation. Unfortunately, the Government's proposed legislation does not hold up to close inspection, as members on this side of the House pointed out during debate on the Forest Conservation and Development Bill. Coronation Hill, Wesley Vale and Marandoo, in my own State, have all become synonymous with the Federal Government's failure to come to terms with the importance of our resources sector and the damage that such poor decision making can cause to the nation's economic reputation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well to talk about the need for more favourable depreciation allowances and sustained lower interest rates to attract large scale investors, but where is the incentive to spend well in excess of $1 billion on a state of the art pulp mill if there is no certainty that the raw materials will be available in the quantity required in years to come?  The small business sector may not actually undertake a particular major resource project but the flow-on benefits to the small business sector are considerable. Orders flow-on to small businesses and their communities is vitally important in this country. In my electorate of Forrest the benefits will be substantial if the Government puts meaningful reforms in place. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Let me give one example: he talked very critically of the growth in the deficit during the present financial year and over the last year or two, arguing that this would add to government debt as though this were a terrible thing. The fact of the matter is that Australian government debt is the second lowest, as a proportion of national income, of any Western country.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KG4">Mr LANGMORE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indeed. I am disappointed that the honourable member is not prepared to involve himself in serious debate because he made some very serious mistakes. The fact of the matter is that our debt, as a proportion of national income, is one of the lowest in the Western world. The honourable member was confusing government debt with overseas debt. Of course we have a high overseas debt. That is a real worry. It is essential that we improve our current account position and, of course, this statement is aimed at doing that. I will come to the reasons why it will do it effectively in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an elementary mistake to confuse public debt with overseas debt and that was what the honourable member was doing. It is absolutely responsible for a government to increase its outlays at a time when the economy is recessed. It is absolutely essential that the Government do what it can to build up economic activity&mdash;and thus employment&mdash;at a time when there is a recession. The honourable member seemed to imply that he did not want that to happen. It is an extraordinarily irresponsible approach and that is consistent with the package of measures which the Opposition is now putting forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is suggesting that by increasing indirect taxes through a goods and services tax which will increase the rate of inflation it will somehow improve the state of the economy. The logical consequence of introducing a goods and services tax is that inflation will rise. The Opposition does not dispute that; in fact, it accepts that the rate of inflation will go up by around 4 per cent. That will inevitably lead to an increase in interest rates. An increase in interest rates will depress the economy further and unemployment will rise. It is an extraordinary package of measures to be putting forward at a time when the economy is already recessed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one links that to the fact that the Opposition proposed to cut back on public outlays&mdash;so that not only will the quality and extent of public services decline, but also the Government will reduce its impact on economic activity and so contribute to further recession&mdash;one can see that it is talking about a major recessionary package. It is an extraordinarily perverse macro-economic approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn to more positive things. It is true that we are only just beginning to come out of a very severe recession. We have very high unemployment: about 960,000 people out of work. That is a tragedy of the first order which the Government accepts as a tragedy of the first order. The question is: how do we recover from that as rapidly as possible? An elementary beginning must be the introduction of what are called counter-cyclical policies. The Government should do everything in its power to lift the level of economic activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, there are also some great strengths in the present situation. One of the very striking things is that, despite the fact that we are only just beginning to come out of a recession, our exports earnings, particularly for manufacturing goods, have been growing very rapidly. In fact, I have just received a recent analysis by the trade analysis section of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which is dated March 1992. This shows that export earnings reached record levels in the second half of 1991. That was due both to buoyant commodity export prices and strong growth in manufactured exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The analysis goes on to describe that in much more detail, but the fact of the matter is that the level and value of our manufactured exports have been growing rapidly and continuously for about six years. Certainly, it began from a small base, but the fact that that growth in the value of manufactured exports has continued so strongly whilst we have been in recession shows that the policies that have been in place during that time have made a direct contribution to that outcome. Our exports are rising quite strongly. Our commodity exports, which have not been doing so well in the last two or three years, are starting to pick up. This is particularly true of wheat; to a limited extent, wool; and it is true of a number of the mineral products as well. Both our commodity exports and our exports of simply processed and complexly processed manufactured goods are rising strongly and can be expected to go on rising strongly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, Australia has a very low inflation rate. That is an enormous benefit when trying to design policies which will stimulate economic activity. We now have a lower inflation rate than at any other time over the last two decades. That is of direct benefit in keeping our interest rates down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interest rates have fallen by about 10 per cent since they peaked and are now much lower than they were two years ago. It is true, as the honourable member for Forrest said, that they are still somewhat above those overseas levels but there is a very difficult juggling act involved. There may be scope for reducing them a little further but, at the same time, the honourable member should accept that activity in the housing industry, which is particularly influenced by interest rates, is starting to pick up very rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was at a function organised by the St George Building Society about a week ago. I was told that its lending in February was the highest it had ever been for any month. E<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>ven better than that, not only was it its highest lending ever, but also it was double the figures for its best month ever. In February St George lent $370m. In its previous best month, it had lent $190m. That may be partly because it increased its market share, but it was principally because in its traditional market&mdash;New South Wales and the ACT&mdash;the demand for funds had grown very strongly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very encouraging development if growth of that kind is going on. That is, of course, only anecdotal evidence; we will have to wait a month or two to get the comprehensive statistics to be sure that that is a general trend. But if anything approaching that&mdash;anything remotely like that&mdash;is general, then the Government would have to be fairly careful about further reductions in interest rates for fear of stimulating the housing industry too rapidly. In any case, interest rates are now much lower than they were a couple of years ago&mdash;10 percentage points, as I have already said&mdash;and that is having an impact, not only on housing but also on small and large business, thus creating the main condition to encourage people to invest further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this situation, where we have some desperately serious problems but also some great strengths, the Government has introduced the One Nation statement, which is a particularly well targeted statement. It gives me great delight to say so because I have not always affirmed everything that the Government has done. This statement seems to me to be just about perfect in terms of its sense of direction. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Forrest, described it as a grab bag of ideas. In fact, it is a particularly well thought out and well-targeted strategy aimed at stimulating economic activity, national productivity and growth of employment in the most cost-effective ways. I will give some examples of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most important initiatives in the statement was the major increase in funding over the next four years for technical and further education. There cannot be a more important sector at this time for increasing the skills of our work force than TAFEs. It is true that the proportion of students finishing secondary school has gone up from about a third a decade ago to about two-thirds now. That means that there has been a rapid increase in the number of students wanting post-secondary education. Some of them can go on to universities, some of them can go into apprenticeships, but many of them want to go to TAFE. We should be encouraging them to go to the TAFE. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, and with great foresight, about two years ago the Government commissioned a report from a team headed by a man named Finn. The Finn report was completed about six months ago. It outlines a strategy for upgrading and extending many areas of technical and further education. In the One Nation statement funds were allocated for implementing the first parts of the Finn report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another vital part of the statement concerns the increased allocation for infrastructure. I am delighted that the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) is in the House, because I would like wholeheartedly to congratulate him on his part in achieving this billion dollar increase in infrastructure funding. It is true that in Australia public investment has been falling for about 15 or 20 years. As a proportion of national income it has come down quite substantially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This initiative starts to reverse that trend. We must do that if we want the productivity of the economy to improve. There is a clear relationship between the level of public investment and private sector investment and productivity. That is logical, because public investment provides the infrastructure, the network of transport and communications and other facilities which are essential for efficient private sector activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this statement about $400m is allocated during the next couple of years for upgrading the rail network and about $600m is allocated for improving roads, in a number of very important ways. Main roads between cities, ring roads around cities and vital transport and road links within cities will be improved. There will also be an increase in black-spot road funding&mdash;areas where there have been a number of accidents and where a small amount of additional work will improve the safety of those roads. That is a very important basis for improving the transport system. But, as well, it is a very important stimulus to employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That funding is being done in ways which have relatively little impact on imports. One of the great benefits of spending on infrastructure during a recession, and one like the present recession when we have a high current account deficit, is that it is an effective way of improving national efficiency without a substantial leakage to imports. Most of the equipment, all of the employment and all of the materials come from Australia. Therefore, there is not a direct loss to overseas producers through that initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other initiatives in the package also will have a direct impact on the current account as well as on the labour markets here. For example, there are the expansion of Austrade and the increased allocation to the development import finance facility&mdash;initiatives which, by the way, were advocated last October in a report of a committee which I chaired. I am very glad to see that ideas prepared by an all-party committee, which were tabled in a report last October, have been taken up. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KG4">Mr LANGMORE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a very good report. I thank the Minister. As well there are initiatives in the One Nation package for increased funding on labour market programs and on apprenticeships. Finally, I want to mention one particularly important initiative&mdash;the establishment of the Australian Technology Group. The aim of that group is to link public sector research with private sector use. It is quite clear to anyone who has looked at our excellent research that sometimes there has been a failure to link that into manufacturing enterprises in Australia. The Australian Technology Group, based on a similar group now operating in Britain, will create that link and strengthen it. Again, this is something which I have been advocating for about 10 years. I am delighted that at last it has been accepted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that those examples show what a well targeted program this is. It is true, as some people have suggested&mdash;although not in the Opposition&mdash;that it is a very moderate statement. In my view it could responsibly have been larger. However, it was a difficult task for the Government to judge at what level to pitch the package. One has to remember that it is constrained by opinion in financial markets in the business community. But the other side should remember that in November the British Conservative Government brought down an employment statement for #11 billion, or $A25 billion. This is the equivalent, given the respective sizes of the economies, of $A7.5 billion. Therefore, if we had followed the example of the British Conservative Government, we could have had a package that was three times larger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition does not like to hear that, but the situations in the two countries are very similar. Britain has 10 per cent unemployment, a current account deficit and is in a relatively strong fiscal position. We could have quite responsibly had a larger statement because of the strength of our fiscal position. I have already said at the beginning of my speech that we have the lowest level of public debt of all but one other Western country. </PARA>

Of course, the package is also linked with a strategy for moving back into surplus in about four years time&mdash;at a time when one could expect the economy to be booming again.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see that the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) is here this evening, because there are a couple of matters that I want to address to him. It comes as no surprise to members of both sides of this House to hear about problems associated with Australia's land transport industries. Rail has generally been recognised as engendering some of the most incredible anomalies, inefficiencies and waste imaginable. I forget how long the Minister has been in this portfolio, but he has had a fair while to deal with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), in his response to the ministerial statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on Thursday, 27 February, referred to the way in which one section of the railways in Australia&mdash;and probably the most disastrous of all&mdash;the Victorian railways, is run. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in Victoria it would be cheaper to close down the rail system and give every commuter a small car than it is to try to run the railway. . . We have seen examples of train stations where, although trains do not stop, as many as 26 people man them. We have seen examples of firemen on electric trains.</PARA>
<PARA>This is laughable, although in reality it is not quite so funny. The Government in its `One Nation, One Job' statement has as one of its central planks an increased spending on roads and rail. However, not only does the statement fail to go to the heart of the problems inherent in our transport system, but its spending initiatives are actually unfunded. In other words, we cannot afford the $454m earmarked for rail without major reforms to cutbacks on areas of inefficiency and waste in our rail transport system. There is absolutely no mention of real labour market reform in One Nation, which is one of the most fundamental inefficiencies in our rail system today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have recently been told that the rail industry in Australia is improving. In 1986-87, Westrail, the Government-funded rail organisation in Western Australia, had only an 81 per cent cost recovery on its freight services. Australian National had 86 per cent recovery and State Rail in New South Wales had 83 per cent. Westrail and Australian National have improved their performance substantially. However, the Australian rail industry on the whole is still heavily subsidised by the taxpayer. Some sources say that the Australian rail system has cost taxpayers a staggering $20 billion in the last eight years. Last year it spent $4 billion more than it actually earned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1990-91 financial year, Westrail estimated it earned about $1.6m in profit for its freight services. For its overall freighting operations, Australian National recorded an operating loss of around $14.7m, which, after considering a series of abnormal items, turned into a profit of $9.7m. The New South Wales rail organisation, known as State Rail, made a huge operating loss of $330m during 1990-91, although there were no particular figures available for its freight operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation prompts concern when local road transport operators in my electorate have been put out of work owing to radical reductions in charges for rail transport of containers from Perth to Sydney. Freight transferred by rail over this distance travels under the rail systems of Western Australia, South Australia and New South Wales, or Westrail, Australian National and State Rail. Trains carrying cargo from Sydney to Perth are known to carry a heavier registered load than when travelling in the opposite direction from Perth to Sydney, basically because of the volume of goods transported from the east compared with the volume transported from the west. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to maximise usage of freightage volume, freight charges for loads being transferred from west to east by rail have historically been lower than the corresponding charges for freighting the other way around. For a long time road transporters have been contracted by removal businesses to carry householder furniture and effects from Western Australia to the east. Recently, Westrail lowered its fee for 100 cubic metres of storage space to $771 for freightage from Perth to Sydney. Local road transporters would normally have charged around $3,000 for 80 cubic metres of space moved from door to door. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of Westrail's slashing its container freight charge, removal businesses are preferring to use rail freightage to reduce their costs. However, householders utilising rail services for their transport can expect their belongings to be loaded and off-loaded approximately four times in a move from Western Australia to the eastern States: once onto the truck transferring the goods to the rail yard; then onto the train; then off the train and onto a truck at the other side; and lastly at the final destination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that one's furniture would have to withstand a fair bit of punishment and rough handling under these sorts of conditions. One would also not want to be in any great hurry to receive the goods at the other end. This huge difference in price has meant that road transport operators are going to the wall. They simply cannot compete with the taxpayer subsidised rates charged between Perth and Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, there have been allegations of widespread fraud being committed on taxpayer owned, government managed railways. These allegations were raised in the January edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Truckin' Life</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Truck operators whose vehicles are regularly weight checked have noted the lack of a comparable zeal to chase down underdeclared weight on consignments on the railways system. The fact that checks were commenced last year is an indication that the understating of freight tonnage is a problem. The railways work on an honesty system where forwarders declare the weight of their container loads. However, it appears from the information uncovered by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Truckin' Life</EMPHASIS> that forwarders are taking advantage of the lack of checks by the railways to transport greater weights than those which they have paid for. In other words, they are ripping off the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports government enterprises being made more competitive and more efficient so that the Australian taxpayers can realise the benefits financially. However, competition should occur on a fair and equal footing. We have reason to believe that there are significant barriers to competitive freighting between rail and road that have to be got rid of. Since 1983, the Government has been aware of problems associated with the rail industry, but has not been prepared to make the tough decisions to deal with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rail reform is well overdue and a keystone of Australia's micro-economic reform. It is clear that there has to be a sharing of freight carrying between road and rail for safety as well as environmental reasons. There is tremendous scope for increasing efficiency, which will in turn lower transport costs and be a boost to mining, agriculture and manufacturing export industries. The rail system needs to be run with a more national outlook to get rid of many of the inefficiencies inherent in the current disaggregated State system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next coalition government of Australia will ensure that road transport will be a winner in the reform process. Each truck driver can expect to save around $40,000 per year in input taxes. The abolition of wholesale sales taxes and fuel excises, and the introduction of a 15 per cent goods and services tax&mdash;which is rebateable for businesses&mdash;will give a tremendous boost to transport operators who feel cheated under the Labor Government. Labor has admitted itself that road transport is taxed 3 1/2 times more than any other industry. But this Government has done nothing to change this unfair state of affairs other than to threaten to increase registration charges on top of existing taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under a coalition government, road funding will not be reduced and all business input taxes will be rebateable. A fair and equitable, simple to administer road user charge will apply. It would only be fair for road users to contribute to road maintenance. Overall, road transport under Fightback would be cheaper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the question of buying Australian. The waste and anomalies that have occurred in the administration of government departments under Labor have been extensively recorded. For instance, we hear about $24,500 being given to the Building Workers Industrial Union for musical theatre work about the labour market; just under $9,000 for a trade union women's cartoon project; and just under $6,000 for the Waterside Workers Federation to conduct writing activities with union members. To refer once more to the rail industry, $2,000 was also given to Chullora railway workers for a song writing project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition waste watch committee has highlighted a number of these areas of government spending and administration that raise the question:  why were Government funds committed to this project, and how could this money during the worst recession in 60 years have been spent in other ways? Some other areas of government spending that could easily be made more accountable simply through a bit of discipline and common sense were recently brought to my attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the worst recession for 60 years&mdash;and judging from unemployment figures and business confidence we are still not out of the woods&mdash;a number of Australian Government and government business enterprise contracts have gone to overseas interests when they could easily have been given to Australian companies. For example, the Western Australian offices for the Australian Taxation Office recently purchased over 1,000 chairs which were essentially imported from Germany, with upholstery and assembly being the only component of Western Australian manufacturing in the product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small business in Australia is the worst casualty of the recession. The number of small business and personal bankruptcies has skyrocketed, with the October-December quarter figure in 1991 being the second highest ever recorded. This figure of 4,352 small businesses and individuals that went broke around Australia was only outdone by the figure for the previous 1991 September quarter of 4,764; this being the largest number for 50 years. In the December quarter, the number of bankruptcies in Western Australia jumped by a huge 37.8 per cent from 447 to 616. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the example I quoted of 1,000 imported chairs, why were Australian manufacturers not sought to fill the contract? A small business in Western Australia could very well have been saved if locally manufactured chairs had been chosen. To give another example:  $250,000 worth of totally imported vinyl wall covering has been ordered for an Australian Taxation Office project. Why was a comparable Australian product not chosen instead?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telecom recently fitted out an office for directory services in Perth and 450 metres of American fabric was ordered for work station screens at $42 per metre. Australian screen fabrics cost around $15 a metre for wool blended textiles. With the Australian textile industry in its current state, surely it would have been more beneficial for the sake of Australian industry to compromise and support Australian produced materials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, where imported goods outclassed the Australian counterpart on price and quality, the decision for choosing an overseas product could be justified. However, when Australian taxpayer funds are being spent on an Australian Government department or government business enterprise, for the sake of Australian industry all efforts should be made to look into buying the comparable Australian product, even if some compromise has to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal now with a more localised problem in my constituency. It is a problem that has occurred with the younger section of the population in my electorate. No. 2 Flight Air Training Corps Wanneroo has applied for Federal funding to assist in the construction of premises at Landsdale in my electorate. The No. 2 Flight is the largest cadet group of its type in the State and involves about 125 local boys and girls aged from 14 to 18 years. It has been proposed to relocate the Flight Corps to Leederville in the inner suburbs of Perth&mdash;a long way from Wanneroo. In fact, this would see the loss of a valuable community service for youth in the Wanneroo area, which is particularly distressing at this time of massive youth unemployment in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Youth unemployed in Western Australia climbed to a shocking 35.5 per cent in February this year from 32.8 per cent in January. During the past five years No. 2 Flight has already raised $70,000 independently for infrastructure development on its Landsdale site. However, this funding is not sufficient to provide adequate premises for the cadets. Facilities include a hangar and meeting and storage rooms. Unfortunately, they are only partially completed and it is unlikely that No. 2 Flight will raise the extra $150,000 needed to complete the works by itself. The problem is, of course, that the Government has not yet made a decision on the approval of funding for the Flight Corps. In fairness to the Minister, he has not made the decision yet, and I can only urge him to support this very valuable community group in the city of Wanneroo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November last year a motion was carried by councillors at the Wanneroo City Council meeting, approving the assignment of the lease held at the Western Australia Squadron Air Training Corps No. 2 Flight at Kingsway Reserve. In December the Wanneroo City Council wrote to the Minister advising that a site for the Corps would be made available for lease; however, Federal funding was required to pay for facilities. The No. 2 Flight cadets have recently been told they will no longer be able to meet at a local school where meetings have been held while they wait on news from the Minister. This is a most destabilising situation for the cadets, who have worked so hard in raising money for their group and who are facing the prospect of the flight's uncertain future. The situation is becoming more desperate as time runs out for No. 2 Flight. Indeed, it would be a tragedy if, after this lengthy process, the flight was not successful in being granted assistance, and a valuable community service in Perth's northern suburbs&mdash;the second fastest expanding residential area in Australia&mdash;was lost to local youth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the question of health care. In my speech during the second reading debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1991-92 in September last year, I brought to the attention of the House a number of constituent cases that told the sorry story of our public health care system and Medicare. The Western Australian Labor health Minister, Keith Wilson, said last year that the Federal general revenue and public hospital funding to Western Australia had declined in per capita terms by about 22 per cent since the introduction of Medicare. Unfortunately, it is the people of Western Australia who ultimately suffer from the declining standard in the provision of health care services in that State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of my constituents, Mrs Carol Smart, and her 21-year-old daughter, Sonya, recently experienced first-hand the effects of funding cuts to our public hospitals. On 16 December last year Sonya and her boyfriend were on their way to her Carine home when they were involved in a car accident on Marangaroo Drive. A car pulled out from a stop sign and smashed into the car they were travelling in, writing it off completely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both Sonya and her boyfriend were badly shaken and in pain. Sonya had cuts and lacerations to her body and her boyfriend had injured his back. Not knowing the extent of their injuries, they were taken to Wanneroo Hospital accident and emergency section to be checked out. They arrived at about 6.30 p.m., completed the required paperwork and were told by an attendant to wait for medical attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For four long hours Sonya and her boyfriend waited. Sonya was in agony. She could not sit down because she was suffering such discomfort and was forced to stand for an unbearable four hours. At approximately 10.30 p.m., having still not received any medical attention, Sonya was taken home by her mother, exhausted and in pain, still not knowing the extent of her injuries. Sonya and her boyfriend, due to the shortage of staff at the hospital, had not even been perfunctorily examined, let alone treated for shock. The next day Sonya and her boyfriend went to a local doctor. Sonya was diagnosed as suffering from severe bruising and her boyfriend was diagnosed as having a strained back and was put on anti-inflammatory medication for four weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give the House another case. Local ex-serviceman Harold Atkinson was also on the receiving end of staff shortages in the public hospital system, this time at Royal Perth Hospital, RPH as it is colloquially known. Mr Atkinson has been a voluntary driver for Royal Perth Hospital since 1977 and is presently the President of the Voluntary Drivers Association. Unfortunately, on this occasion Mr Atkinson's good service to the community did not rate in his treatment within the State public health care system. Seventy-nine year old Mr Atkinson had been ill for some time, requiring a blood transfusion every two to four weeks. He is subject to a heart attack at any time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At 11.45 p.m. on 4 September last year, Mr Atkinson experienced sudden severe chest and neck pains and was taken by ambulance to the accident and emergency section at Royal Perth Hospital. He was given an ECG as well as being X-rayed. He was also given an injection and told to wait. At 3.10 a.m. he was told that a bed was not available for him and he would have to go home and come back to the hospital if his pains returned and worsened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, Mr Atkinson was able to contact his son and be picked up from the hospital by him even though it was 3.45 in the morning. Fortunately, he is alive today to tell the story. Luckily for Sonya Smart, she did not have internal bleeding from her car accident. Luckily, Sonya's boyfriend has not permanently damaged his back. These days it seems as though our public hospital systems are relying more on luck than anything else, and sooner or later that luck will run out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I want to talk about another section of my community, a section of the senior citizens community that is experiencing problems with the Government. I refer to the members of that community who are receiving a British pension. Pensioners from the United Kingdom are worse off under the current taxation system and pay more tax on their pension income than do their Australian counterparts. These people feel they are being discriminated against in that they have to cough up the same rates of tax as everyone else on their pensions earned overseas, but are not entitled to a pensioner rebate on their tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local seniors earning a British pension have come to me absolutely outraged at the current system. If they have tax payable over $3,000, they may be subject to provisional tax that was originally intended for business and investors. Some people are having difficultly in meeting these payments and are justifiably angry about the Government's taxation arrangements that came into effect last year. These people may be living off a pension of about $20,000 a year and are being subjected to this misplaced tax that will whittle away their savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is little scope for these people to invest their money and to save for the future. Provisional tax has and will continue to leave them out of pocket before they have even started to count their savings. Under a coalition government the tax-free threshold will be raised to $7,000, and all pensioners will benefit. Pensioners will benefit from the abolition of a compulsory retirement age, an 8 per cent increase in pensions, substantial tax breaks and widened eligibility for the pharmaceutical benefits card. Pensioners can rest assured that under a coalition government they will be compensated for the effect on savings of the introduction of a goods and services tax through a special wealth compensation provision of up to $2,500. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I intend to deal with the Government's strategies for obtaining a strong future for this country, principally in two particular areas, the small business community and trainees and apprentices. This speech tonight allows me to build on and amplify some points I was making earlier this afternoon in the MPI debate on small business&mdash;and amplify and expand I will.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation statement is a plan which incites economic recovery and reform. There is no real comparison with the Opposition's Fightback strategy, which it has to be said in this place, and recognised outside it, is the death knell for many small businesses and the creator of so much socioeconomic disparity. We have heard the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and his sidekicks espouse the praises of their supposed glorious Fightback plan, a plan supposedly to rebuild and reward Australians. But in the end one has to ask and, indeed, I ask tonight: which Australians?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fightback plan has put the burden of the Public Service restructuring program on the shoulders of the small business community. As I was saying earlier today, all small businesses in Australia would effectively become Tax Office agencies, completing consumption tax collection sheets as they go. The shopkeepers of my electorate will become unpaid clerks for the Tax Office during their own personal time, limited as it is as small business people, or in the GST-imposed quiet periods. In fact, there would actually be a compliance cost to businesses for the honour of collecting this information free of charge for the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Canadians found that the cost of the GST is $9 in every $100 earned. In New Zealand the cost to the business sector is 25 per cent of its turnover. But this is just the initial molestation of the future of small businesses. If we look at the Canadian experience, we can say that the small business community will see quite a few GST-promoted silent moments. A study by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business indicated recently that a survey of 25,362 businesses in Canada found that 70.6 per cent of respondents indicated that the GST had had a negative impact on their businesses. The smallest firms had the most problems, with sales decreasing and costs rising as a direct result of the GST. Most people would think that was enough of a burden for anyone to have to contemplate, for any one group in the community or in the economy to have to bear. But, no, Opposition members are relentless ideologues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their next brilliant strategy is to transform the small business community into their own certification agency. As I also said earlier today, each unemployed person would be required to have two written certificates each fortnight from business people to verify that he was seeking work. The mind boggles at the enormity of the resulting generation of paper and work that small business people would have, even in terms of simply turning people away from their shops and enterprises. The Department of Employment, Education and Training has estimated that if we had 500,000 unemployed, a six-minute interview would multiply to 1,824 person years per annum provided by employers at a cost of some $72m each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's strategy is clearly farcical. Small businesses throughout Australia should heed these warnings. They should indeed heed the terrified calls from across the Tasman. John Morine, a New Zealand accountant, recently stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you and the other 800,000 or so small business proprietors throughout Australia do not succeed in getting the GST removed from the political agenda, you will rue the day you took no action. Act now. Otherwise you may not survive.</PARA>
<PARA>During the MPI debate today, the Opposition had the effrontery to attack the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) and the Government generally on the handling of the small business sector. It backfired badly. I can only come to the conclusion, based on what has happened today and in recent weeks, that the Opposition now knows that what it has so very often described as its own traditional heartland&mdash;small business&mdash;is about to desert it. Today was a manifestation of some further panic in the Opposition ranks, particularly about Fightback, and particularly on the point of small business policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, the One Nation statement acknowledges the important role played by small business in the economy. Small business provides employment creation and innovation, which are two very important components in the overall plan for a more competitive, efficient and fairer nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small business, indeed, must be seen as the seed for future new industries. In order to nurture these important characteristics, the One Nation economic strategy has implemented the following strategies. The first is a substantial increase in capital gains tax relief for small and growing businesses which will increase capital mobility and growth in the sector. There will be an increased capital gains tax free area on the sale for goodwill from 20 per cent to 50 per cent and the extended number of businesses under it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This strategy is better than a simple, straight rollover for capital gains on goodwill because it will materially affect business people who are looking to sell and to use the proceeds of that tax free area of goodwill to retire on and, therefore, use the proceeds as a type of superannuation. This is a perfect example of this Government knowing and understanding the needs of small business and bringing about reform. Personally, I am very pleased about that because, at the last election, I gave an undertaking to my electorate in writing that I would work for some capital gains tax relief for small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing we have done is recognise the impact of the current recession and its ramifications on the cash flow capabilities of small businesses. There will be a three-month extension for the 1991-92 company tax payments for small businesses which will approach the issues raised during the consultations of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) with small business representatives in recent times. This strategy will have an instant impact of reducing uncertainty and promoting further optimism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there will be no increase in the prescribed minimum superannuation levy for businesses with payrolls of $500,000 or less until 1994-95. Fourthly, the funding support for assisting small to medium enterprises to enter export markets through the export access program has been tripled to $12m. This is a far-sighted program. It is targeted at assisting the small and medium businesses which need this sort of assistance to do what we want them to do; that is, to develop export and international business for a long period ahead. Export access has revealed that small businesses would like to diversify their markets by entering those export markets. In particular, they are well placed to contribute to new areas of export activity in the high value added goods and services area, the very target that this Government has been about for so long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect of the statement is the pooled development funds, which will provide longer term equity capital for small and medium sized Australian companies with total assets of less than $30m. The funds are to be used principally for the expansion of existing firms rather than new operations. This is an imaginative approach and it will provide a tax incentive for equity investment in Australian businesses. This support system will be enhanced by the dividends from the funds being tax exempt while the profits will be taxed at a concessional rate of 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also, by the introduction of legislation to prevent the unnecessary foreclosure by banks of viable businesses unable to meet debts, sought to have a major impact on the continued survival and revival of small businesses. Banks will be able to claim tax deductions for partial debt write-offs and also for losses on debt for equity swaps which will give firms in difficulty a chance to trade their way out of trouble rather than being prematurely wound up by the banks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further to that, we have brought about four initiatives which are designed to improve the tax treatment of depreciation of assets. Of particular benefit is the further acceleration of taxation depreciation deductions for plant and equipment beyond effective life rates of most asset classes. I am sure that, when the small and medium business community examines and compares the two strategies, it will be evident that the One Nation plan is far more equitable and far-sighted and will promote more effectiveness and competitiveness than anything on offer from the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the strategies set in place by the One Nation plan to protect our skilled workers resource pool. Before I came into this place I was working in industrial relations. During the Liberal-induced recession of the 1980s it was evident to anyone and everyone who worked in the manufacturing industry that what this nation was then doing, in circumstances encouraged by government policy, was throwing thousands of young people onto the scrap heap, giving them a very limited future, and, almost as bad as that human tragedy, making sure that this country would have a labour shortage in the trades and other skilled areas in the years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we turn our minds back a few years, we see that that was exactly the problem that this Government inherited. It can have all sorts of ramifications; not just in reducing skill in the community, but also in artificially driving up certain wage rates across the economy, with all the attendant flow-on effects of that. In contrast to that, the Prime Minister's One Nation plan is doing something about making sure that our future generations of tradesmen are home grown rather than having to be imported when we are panic stricken upon the sudden realisation that there will be shortages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government will immediately boost the financial assistance for apprenticeships and traineeships by $100m. Importantly, young people&mdash;unlike those of a generation ago&mdash;will see greater hope for their future. Local employers will receive added incentives to retain or employ apprentices and trainees in addition to those whom they are already employing. This is, of course, a continuing commitment of the Government and  carries on from initiatives that were introduced in February aimed at increasing incentives to employers to recruit 9,000 first-year apprentices and 10,000 trainees in 1982, as well as providing a wages subsidy to save some 3,200 second-year apprentices from retrenchment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additional measures have been introduced as part of the One Nation plan to stimulate further growth in school training opportunities and to continue to save our young people from the prospect of, individually, a dark future and, collectively, a national want. These additional measures include $49m to continue prevocational training places for presently unemployed people, $5.7m to encourage group training schemes and $11.7m to extend for a further year the existing package in place to assist 7,000 at-risk apprentices and trainees, and the unemployed. This is a perfect example of government intervention in the marketplace, not only for the effect on and welfare of our citizens but also for the future of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than letting the ups and downs of the market throw these 7,000-odd at-risk apprentices and trainees onto the scrap heap in the future, in most cases perhaps never to be picked up, this Government has deliberately designed means of intervening to see our skilled labour force of the future through this torrid period. Tackling unemployment is, of course, a cornerstone of the economic statement. The expansionary policies introduced will maintain this skilled work force for the future and build on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's Fightback plan is now seen in this place as a sham and, I suspect, outside this place more and more as being well and truly on the nose. How can Opposition members honestly continue to support such a package when the Treasury's analysis has shown that some 70 per cent of Australians&mdash;that is, the vast majority of ordinary Australians; people who live in my electorate&mdash;will be worse off?  When, one has to ask, will the Opposition escape from this self-imposed time capsule, when all it seems to want to provide is a restrictive and backward plan which will increase the disparities between Australians and pull our economy into the backwaters of the international market?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just heard a load of rubbish that was no doubt written in the back rooms of the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). All the empty rhetoric and all the previously proven inaccuracies have been trotted out this evening. What a time for them to come out as we debate the Appropriation Bills, which provide ongoing funding for the business of government in the period ahead. Some of the programs that are included in these Appropriation Bills are to finance the implementation of aspects of the One Nation statement announced recently by the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is also an opportunity to debate and review the progress of our nation. Where have we been going now that we have had two years of this current term of Government?  Yesterday marked the two-year anniversary of the return of the Labor Government. The class of 1990&mdash;those members who were elected to Parliament at the last election&mdash;have now had two years in this place. I am sorry to say, as one of those members, that it seems to me that it is very difficult to find anything in Australia that is better as a result of what has happened in those two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like all new members who come into this place, I came with some ambition to be a part of building a better Australia. Sadly, during the first two years we seem to have gone backwards. Labor's report card for this period is particularly bleak: the depression it said it would make sure we would not have and then told us we had to have, record debt, continuing deficits in our trade balances, a million unemployed, social despair everywhere, division and degradation. There is a real attitude of despair in our community as we look towards the future. The only slightly brighter notes perhaps are lower inflation and lower interest rates, but they have been achieved for the wrong reason. Labor has so crushed demand and so crushed optimism that no-one is buying in our country any more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an Opposition member, as least I have the satisfaction of knowing that the coalition parties alone have prepared a package and have produced a document which provides a blueprint for the future. They provide Australian people with some real optimism that there still is hope in this once great country of ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have succeeded in capturing the imagination of the Australian people with a Fightback package built on hope and opportunity. The package includes fundamental change to our taxation system and the way in which we administer so many aspects of our country's way of life. It restores incentive to the principal place in encouraging development and encouraging individual initiative. That is so important as we as a country plan for our future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The future of our country is dependent on the future of individuals and our Australian families. If we can encourage each Australian family and each individual to produce a little more, our country will also benefit. The Fightback package is built around that fundamental theme&mdash;that it is necessary to encourage and provide incentives to individuals if our country too is to grow and prosper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package has so overwhelmed Labor that it became sufficiently desperate even to dump its own Prime Minister. The man who navigated the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Titanic</EMPHASIS> onto the icebergs has been rewarded by being made captain of the ship. The Labor Party wanted change irrespective of the consequences. It dumped the man it had loved for someone it hated. It dumped a sports-loving larrikin&mdash;a man of the people&mdash;for a rude, arrogant individual detested by most Australians. Not only is he not a sports fan but he cannot tell the difference between soccer and rugby league. The Labor Party has dumped consensus and given way to division. It has dumped the idea of cooperation and replaced it with confrontation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been amazing policy reversals, as if Australia had been enduring these years of pain all to no avail. Labor got it all wrong. It wants to change everything. There will be no Medicare co-payments any more. After cutting depreciation allowances for so many years, they are now to be increased. After increasing wholesale sales tax over the years, suddenly there are to be cuts. This is from the Government that trebled wholesale sales tax collections during its term in office. Now there are to be tax cuts, but only for high income earners, and not for 28 months, and not for four million Australians who earn less than $20,700 a year. This is all from a government that has doubled income tax receipts during its term of office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The massive deficits that we have before us now are in marked contrast to Labor's demands over the years for fiscal responsibility and budgets with surpluses. Everything seems to have changed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation statement delivered all of these goods. It is a remarkable title, I thought&mdash;`One Nation'; `One Nation', coming from the Prime Minister who is seeking to divide our country, to set Australian against Australian. His insults to Australia's friends, his republicanism statements, his degradation of the flag&mdash;hardly the kinds of comments that one would expect from a Prime Minister who is endeavouring to encourage an attitude of one nationhood. Indeed, his comments about the Australian flag demonstrate an arrogant disregard for the feelings of Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our flag in particular is one of our country's most important symbols. It naturally evokes deep feelings of loyalty from many Australians, and it has been an important element in maintaining the unity and spirit of our nation. The Labor Government has refused several attempts by the coalition parties to enact legislation to protect the Australian flag. The Prime Minister's current outbursts suggest that he cannot be trusted not to get rid of the Australian flag, even without consulting the Australian people. When his predecessors in Labor governments tried to change the national anthem, at least they asked the Australian people to choose the alternative. I call on the Prime Minister to give an undertaking that he will not seek to change the Australian flag without putting the question to the Australian people by way of referendum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that our Prime Minister, in making his attacks on the flag, on the monarchy, on the British, the Americans, the Japanese and just about anyone else he can find, is endeavouring to deflect attention from his abysmal economic record. Australia has few enough friends in the world as it is, and if this man stays as Prime Minister for too long we will lose what few we have. It is quite obvious that at this time, when Australians are becoming more conscious of the importance of our past, our Prime Minister is trying to rewrite history to support his republicanism campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ironically, while the Prime Minister denigrates our flag, the Labor Party continues to use it in its logo and masthead designs. However, I think we can expect some changes here, too. The latest edition of the official organ of the Australian Labor Party in South Australia, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald</EMPHASIS>, has defaced the design of the Australian flag and has nominated Bob Hawke as the ideal man to be the first President of the republic of Australia. In putting forward Mr Hawke as the ideal nomination, it has listed his qualifications as being a former union leader and champion beer drinker. It is quite clear that in our Prime Minister's approach he has demonstrated to all Australians that they will always have to be vigilant if we want to protect our national institutions. These sorts of things make it clear that the One Nation statement had nothing to do with creating national unity; nor does it endeavour to provide benefits for everyone in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the maps that the Government is endeavouring to circulate to electors around Australia and all the diagrams showing where the money has been spent, it is quite clear that the basic allocations have been made to Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra; the golden triangle has done well again. Rail funding, road funding and urban development are all, or largely, centred on the capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that there is the odd throwaway, to try to remember that the rest of Australia is still there. Perth has been granted $20m for sewerage works. I was in Perth recently and this contribution came as a great surprise to the people of Western Australia. It seems that nobody had been asking for it and that nobody knows what it will be spent on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also the classic $20m provided to Townsville to build a new outer harbour and transport infrastructure. It is again a development that no-one has asked for and no-one intends to use. It is true that the Greenvale nickel refinery needs new port facilities, but it wants them built at Halifax Bay. That is clearly the most economically sensible place for those port facilities to be provided. Like so many developments under this Government, spurious environmental grounds are being used to endeavour to block that project, potentially at the expense of almost as many jobs as the new project in Townsville is likely to create. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some other proposals in this great spending spree, such as the new airport developments for the cities. Luxurious new terminal buildings are planned for capital cities while country areas will be forced to do without the aerodrome local ownership plan. This Government is speeding up the relinquishment of its responsibilities under this program&mdash;responsibilities, I might add, that have been in place for as many as 40 years. These are programs that have been the result of exchanges of correspondence and signed agreements between local government and Federal governments over the years. This Government is walking away from those commitments and is leaving country airports in a parlous position. Many of these airports will be unable to continue to operate as maintenance costs get beyond the capacity of local ratepayers to meet the growing demands. So, at taxpayers' expense, we can have great new developments in the urban areas while country communities that are so vitally dependent upon airport facilities, particularly in times of crisis, are being asked to do without. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, the return of the coalition government and its restoration of ALOP will offer new hope. The commitment by the National and Liberal parties to restore a 50 per cent subsidy for essential maintenance work on country airports will recognise the community responsibility we have to serve not just Sydney and Melbourne but also the provincial areas which contribute so much to the economic wealth of our nation. </PARA>

That was the theme taken up by the chief economist of the Australian Chamber of Commerce, Mr Brent Davies, when he described Labor policies. He said:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians, though, should not give up; there are many things that could be done to help address our national unemployment crisis.

It could get rid of things such as the training guarantee levy, another iniquitous tax which employers have to pay whether they can afford it or not,  whether or not one pays income tax. There is a levy on employment. It could abolish the wholesale sales tax, a $9.6 billion ramshackle, inconsistent, inequitable, ill-targeted, complicated tax, a secret consumption tax which has been trebled by the ALP in Government. It is a tax which offers no compensation for the poor; it is taxation by stealth. Some of it falls on business. The wholesale sales tax hampers economic productivity. It taxes exports, an extra load for those who would contribute to our national profitability. Labor could abolish the fuel excise, a $6.6 billion tax on isolation, a sectional tax on provincial Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This tax has helped to create the tyranny of distance, has been multiplied seven times by Labor in government and is totally inappropriate for a vast country such as Australia. It disadvantages travel to the shops, to the doctor, to the schools, to the sports grounds and is a burden on all regional industry. It is a tax on decentralisation in a country that should be encouraging it. It is a tax on exports because most of our exports also come from rural areas. Indeed, if we were to abolish the fuel excise alone, Queensland rail would save $20m, probably enough to fund the rail improvements proposed in the One Nation statement. </PARA>

Now I cannot find anybody on this side of the House who did not vote for the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), in the challenge. It is quite remarkable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As somebody who is retiring at the next election, I can take a very objective view of the parliamentary scene. I quite firmly believe that the stocks of the Government have gone up considerably since the honourable member for Blaxland became the Prime Minister. I think we will be in government for a very long time. The thing about the Prime Minister is that he is prepared to bite the bullet. I think the One Nation statement that he has put forward is very progressive and has been very well received. Particularly in my electorate, people who barely acknowledged me in the past are now stopping to have a bit of a yarn. There is no doubt that the stocks have turned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, my remarks will be quite wide ranging. One of the things that I want to highlight&mdash;I want to speak constructively about this and I hope that we can remedy it&mdash;is very near and dear to my heart. That is the problem of the reduction of funding to the disabled. I think the disabled people are a group that we do not acknowledge, and I do not think we give them the credit that they richly deserve for the way that many of them, despite some of their horrific injuries, have tried to get back into the work force. I think we should be extending more money and more finance to these people rather than reducing it, particularly as those of us who are able-bodied worry about job prospects and other matters affecting our everyday existence. These are genuine concerns. We are all aware that there is a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel certain that the Prime Minister's economic statement will soon make inroads into these problems faced by the able-bodied unemployed in this great country. I wonder, however, how many of us sitting in this chamber ever look beyond the political bickering and point scoring on the backs of the unemployed to spare a thought for a group of people&mdash;the number of which is ever-increasing all over this country&mdash;who dare not even think of job prospects. If the able-bodied people are battling to find employment, what hope do the disabled have?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are those amongst us who may say that the disabled have attracted a great deal of attention during the reign of the Labor Government. It would be correct to say that the lot of the disabled has improved under this Government. One has only to look at the disability reform package to note the positive changes that have been made recently to assist the disabled community. Change is fine. However, funding does not always march hand in hand with the implementation of improvements. Disabled clients in my electorate suffer the most when funding is not readily available for their employment, support accommodation and respite care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rearing children is an important responsibility. Rearing a disabled child or caring for a disabled adult is an even greater responsibility and is much more demanding. To care for a disabled person is a mammoth task indeed. It places a burden of increased responsibility on all members of the family unit. By these words it is not my intention to indicate that such families would cast the burden of love and care aside. Those carers whom I come in contact with are totally dedicated. Their dedication to caring does not mean that we, the able-bodied, should walk away and let them get on with it. On the contrary, it behoves us in our own way to assist these families in whatever way we possibly can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is a lady named Annie Lockwood in the city of Whyalla. I never think of the disabled without being reminded of the community fundraising Annie has done, in particular for the Disabled Peoples International branch at Whyalla.

I pay tribute to a great lady. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with sadness that I greet the news of per capita fiscal liquidisation of funding from the Commonwealth to the States. I can only assume that the decision makers have no inkling of what it means to these families to withdraw even one position for respite care or to run around closing support accommodation without making proper provision for these people within the community. I can tell honourable members what it means. It means that parents of disabled children and adults will be under such extreme stress that we will witness marriage breakdowns, nervous breakdowns, collapse, possibly even fatalities, because there are not enough respite care or support accommodation places in South Australia. Inadequate funding for these two services in particular will cost us more as a community when the carer is no longer around to care. Government agencies will then have the total responsibility for such disabled clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does per capita fiscal liquidisation have to do with the disabled? Let me tell honourable members what it has to do with the disabled, particularly carers of the disabled in South Australia. When I speak of funding, I refer to Commonwealth funds, not the respective State funded programs or, indeed, State complementary components of various programs. In the 1980s a policy decision was taken that service development should be more community based with an emphasis on integrating disabled clients into the community. I have no argument with that. It is my belief that the disabled should be allowed to live their life within the community as independently as is possible without endangering their safety or their own well-being. We the able bodied within the community can learn many lessons of life from the disabled. </PARA>
<PARA>On a personal basis, when I see how valiantly some of them cope with problems which seem insurmountable, I feel truly humble. They have a capacity for laughter in the face of adversity, a joy for living and a will to survive which is second to none. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the claim is that South Australia was overfunded during the 1980s. It spent the money wisely, so it must have needed what it received. In South Australia, services were developed using the funding for capital assets and equipment. Recurrent funding for salaries of support workers was provided separately. Pursuing the policy of integration, the South Australian State office initiated the development of large numbers of small community based services, blowing out the recurrent funding commitment for staff; whereas I understand that other State offices committed relatively larger proportions of their funding to large capital items which did not attract the same expansion of support worker funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">South Australia needed to develop its program based on support workers, as it has a vast isolated country and rural areas, mainly in my electorate of Grey, now covering 91 per cent of the State. The equalisation principle now being adopted is based on the recurrent funding. The mechanism was introduced in the late 1980s and involved a reduction in the allocation to South Australia with increases to Queensland and Victoria. Prior to this, the national allocation of funds for new services had been made on the basis of the proportion of population in each State. The estimated time span on the new equalisation policy was on that basis to take place over 20 to 25 years. In 1988-89, the reduction to the State of South Australia was $639,000. In 1990-91, the rate of reduction in South Australia was increased with the intention of reaching equalisation within five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1990-91 Budget, a four-year funding program was announced. Funding was allocated on the basis of places and services for individuals. Under the increased rate of reduction, places allocated to South Australia each year with 1991-92 funding allocation for the whole State are as follows: attendant care scheme, one place, $22,238; accommodation support, one place, $22,464; respite care, 13 places, $37,050; employment, 28 places, $145,152; other services, $110,334. This makes the total funding for the whole State of South Australia $337,238 from a national allocation of $15,940,000&mdash;how appalling!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funding for the specified services just named cannot be interchanged. There is not enough accommodation support funding to establish the infrastructure for a new service which is desperately needed in my electorate. Instead, we have the scandalous situation of one place being added to an existing service each year&mdash;not for my electorate, but for the whole of South Australia. The situation is totally unacceptable. Demand is increasing and funding decreasing. My State colleagues inform me that there is at the present time in South Australia an unmet demand for at least 200 supported accommodation places for intellectually disabled clients alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that when the Commonwealth-State disability agreement is implemented there will be a transition payment of almost $5m made to the State of South Australia which should assist the State Government in addressing unmet demand for services&mdash;other than employment, which will remain the responsibility of the Commonwealth. But what have my constituents to do in the meantime? This may be too little, too late, on respite and supported accommodation care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that my electorate of Grey is provided with excellent service agencies for disabled employment through the auspices of the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service, which does an excellent job. However, once again its role is being diminished at the present time due to the lack of referrals, again because we are waiting on the assessment panels of the new disability support pension to come into full operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel that the Department and its clientele would have been better served had the decision-makers seen it as more of a priority to get the assessment panels into place rather than concentrate their agencies and energies on making sure that South Australia's disabled people were divested of funding 20 years sooner than they should have been. I find the contraction of the time element for per capita fiscal equalisation appalling, as no thought has been given to those who are suffering and whose suffering will be exacerbated because of such mindless decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last, but certainly not least, I would like to ask the Minister whether the disability services award is a key factor in the delay in the implementation of the Commonwealth-State disability agreement and, consequently, the release of the additional $5m transition funds. If this is the case, then I urge my colleague the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) to take immediate steps to rectify the situation by reaching agreement with the States in relation to recurrent funding to meet the cost of this award over and above the additional funding for the award which has already been agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot emphasise enough to the House that the situation for disabled clients and their parents in my electorate of Grey in relation to respite care and supported accommodation is critical and most urgent. I trust that the responsible Minister takes on board what I have said on this important issue and remedies the situation as speedily as possible. In saying that, I certainly hope that this is not seen as just hot air and that my colleagues will take on board this terrible anomaly and try to rectify the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a more pleasing note, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am delighted that you are in the chair&mdash;and I will be gracious enough to give some credit to the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) also&mdash;because as former members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, we were very forthright in trying to bring forward a national rail system. I am delighted that we were all part of that report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rail: Five Systems&mdash;One Solution</EMPHASIS>, which basically brought about the formation of the National Rail Corporation. I think that that was brought about through the bipartisan and genuine work that we did on that Committee. I am delighted. That is one of the great things that this Government is bringing into being. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation package announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 26 February this year is a visionary, positive statement which will have enormous benefits for Australia well into the future. I am particularly pleased with the announced spending on rail and road upgrading. There is a $1.1 billion package to renovate the Australian interstate rail network and to employ more people to build and fix up roads to lift Australia out of recession. It is extremely heartening that the statement sets out a two-year program that will boost road spending by just over $600m by June 1994 and rail spending by just under $500m. About 70 per cent of that spending will be in the coming financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite its smaller size, the rail program is the more ambitious of the two. In just two years, it proposes to fill the main gaps in Australia's standard gauge network, improve track standards enough to slice at least an hour and a half off Melbourne-Sydney freight times, and guarantee reliable delivery. One of the things that our Committee found was that people wanted reliability of delivery and wanted to know that when they ordered that service goods would be delivered on time. I am delighted that, through discussion with the rail unions, it seems that this positive step will most certainly take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rail plan includes $115m to build a standard gauge rail link between Melbourne and Adelaide. This would complete the standard gauge network linking Australia's five main cities, enabling the new National Rail Corporation to send freight and passenger trains from capital to capital uninterrupted. The link would turn Melbourne into the hub of the NRC network, with east-west freight trains and the Indian Pacific tourist trains destined to pass through the city. It would, however, leave headaches for the Victorian railways in western Victoria which would have links to several broad gauge links, such as the Portland line, cut off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of that massive spending on rail, one of the things I am delighted about is the upgrading of the Port Augusta railway workshops. Three and a half million dollars will be spent on the upgrading of the Port Augusta workshops. This modernisation will mean an upgraded locomotive shop to allow its effective utilisation as an overhaul facility; modern maintenance/manufacturing and materials handling equipment; and an ecological waste management system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Railway workers at Port Augusta have been very dedicated to making their workshops equal to the standard of any railway workshop in Australia and they have been very cooperative in regard to the changes that are taking place. I also hope that the concrete sleeper works at Port Augusta will get a large part of the sleepering for the new system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also delighted that Whyalla, where I live, will get a tremendous spin-off from this. The Federal Government's decision to upgrade the interstate railway network could bring major benefits to Whyalla. I welcome the announcement of the $465m investment program which includes completion of the standard gauge network from Brisbane to Perth. I will, of course, be encouraging BHP to tender for the contract to supply the railway lines for this project. Many honourable members might not be aware that the hard-headed rail that is manufactured at Whyalla is the best in the world and is exported all over the world. Canada, which has the most modern railway in the world, is one of the recipients of that hard-headed rail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I pay tremendous tribute to the trade union movement at Whyalla which, under the leadership of the Secretary of the Combined Unions Council, Doug Elkins, has done a superb job. I think industrial relations in Whyalla at the present time are second to none. The superb cooperation between employers and employees in Whyalla certainly makes it the standard bearer for industrial relations within Australia. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can see that it is nearly time to wind up my comments. I am delighted with the One Nation statement. I believe that we have a Prime Minister who is full of vision and who has really been prepared to grasp the nettle.

Tonight I want to say something about the broader issue of the apparent determination of honourable members on both sides of the House to internationalise the Australian economy. It is noticeable that throughout the years when the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was the Treasurer, for the little time he was a backbencher, and now as the Prime Minister he has constantly come back to the need for the Australian economy to be internationalised. In terms of those words, it is a sentiment that I concur with very strongly&mdash;although anybody can say anything. The question is not what people say.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing about the Australian economy, its capacity to internationalise and its success in internationalising is that over the last 30 years or so we have seen a very rapid growth in international trade, particularly in manufacturing trade. One of the constant features of OECD countries&mdash;honourable members should not worry about the boasts of Australian politicians&mdash;is that their exports have continued to grow as a proportion of their GDP. Exports have become more and more important to the creation of wealth in each of the OECD countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry to say that the notable and sole exception amongst OECD countries is our own country. Perhaps one would not expect very much of some honourable members opposite who have decided that all politics will be about between now and the next election is a constant and semi-deranged abuse of their political opponents, rather than a consideration of any real issue. However, I wonder whether in the years ahead people might wish to contemplate why it is that in 1961-62 exports made up 13.6 per cent of Australia's GDP, whereas in 1990-91 the figure was 13.8 per cent. From 1961-62 to 1990-91 there was some fluctuation, but a very slight fluctuation, in exports as a proportion of our GDP. As a matter of fact, if one were to make a party political point, exports hit a high point under the Fraser Government. In 1979-80, at the time of the resources boom, exports reached 15.1 per cent of GDP. Basically, they have hovered at around 13 or 13 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the fact is that in a world with rapidly growing trade we, as a country, have not really succeeded in getting hold of very much of that trade. That is something that as a country we ought to reflect on more than we do. By the way, those countries that have a bigger proportion of international trade than Australia&mdash;and that is every single OECD country, even New Zealand&mdash;have had a growth in their exports as a proportion of GDP, and most of those countries have GSTs. You might be interested to hear that, Mr Deputy Speaker. Australia does not have a GST because it is one of those many issues that we play out here in a rather political sense which&mdash;when looked at from the objective position of how the totality of the world economy works&mdash;is seen to be a commonsense and ordinary thing to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, in that context the Government talks a lot about the need to internationalise the Australian economy. That is the rhetoric. One needs to look at what the Government is actually doing in order to achieve that. As other honourable members said earlier during the evening, we had the One Nation statement two or three weeks ago. The interesting thing&mdash;as every honourable member would know&mdash;is that if a member goes out into his or her electorate and asks people about the One Nation statement they will not have a clue what the member is talking about.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> People would not know of one single initiative in the One Nation statement because the Government, instead of trying to promote its One Nation statement, has run off with a whole range of different diversions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, people on the other side of the House are going to argue, as did the honourable member for Grey, that spending money on a range of different projects is a good thing. It is rather like my announcing a policy that I will spend $100 billion or so building a bridge across the Tasman and saying, `If we had a bridge instead of having to use ships, it would facilitate trans-Tasman trade. We would be able to get a truck across the Tasman in the course of a day instead of three days. That would cost $100 billion. Isn't that terrific? Doesn't it look glittering?'. The reality, of course, is that it has to be paid for. The cost-benefits of building a bridge across the Tasman, as anybody would know&mdash;no-one would disagree with this&mdash;never add up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question to be asked about the One Nation statement is whether it adds up, whether all these glittering things that apparently the Government can do with taxpayers' money can ever be financed. I suppose we need to look at what others say rather than depend on the words of politicians, because they have become somewhat discredited. It is interesting to note three different comments which have been made about the One Nation statement. The first and the latest came today when the Syntec organisation estimated that the funding challenge that One Nation will leave Australia with&mdash;something like $18 billion in unfunded spending commitments over the next four years&mdash;will increase interest rates by 4 per cent, which will cost the business community around $8 billion. That increase in interest rates is caused by the fact that this extra spending is unfunded and therefore the Government has to go out into financial markets and compete with the private sector to borrow money. That forces up interest rates and that means that other borrowers, such as small, medium sized and large businesses, all have to pay more for that money. That is where the $8 billion bill comes from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They get accelerated depreciation in the One Nation statement. Remember how the Labor Party took away the Fraser Government's 5 : 3 depreciation provisions and the investment allowance?  We are halfway back again with some accelerated depreciation provisions which are entirely unfunded. They will probably be worth a bit over $1 billion to the business community. That is fine; they are a good thing. On the face of it, to reduce business costs, to reduce the cost of capital by $1 billion is a good thing, but where is the $1 billion coming from? We can see that it comes from an $8 billion increase in business costs over the four-year period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the whole issue of the funding of politicians' promises is a very fundamental one. I come first to the honourable member for Grey from South Australia, who said, `We have had years of the State Government going around funding wonderful projects'. There is the REMM development, this massive new Myer shopping centre funded by a State Government instrumentality. But now the bills are coming in. When my children are my age, as taxpayers, they will still be paying their share of a $200m a year bill left because the Labor Government in South Australia went on a spending spree and did not have a clue where the money was going to come from. Of course, that is the record of Labor in Victoria and it is the record of Labor in Western Australia. It is always the way with the Labor Party. It is not really interested in what it sees as the cold calculations of accountants and economists; it is just interested in big spending programs. Remember the Whitlam Government, and we have seen it here with the Hawke-Keating Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of this program is designed to kick-start the economy in the very short term, and to ensure that it is internationalised&mdash;and I do not want to lose track of that important theme. Will it help kick-start the economy and do the one social thing that we really want done in this country, that is, create jobs to try to compensate for the terrible things that have been done to people over the last couple of years through the recession that we had to have? If we are going to create jobs, if the One Nation statement is going to have an impact on jobs, it has to have an impact on investment. Jobs do not come from nowhere; jobs come as a result of investment. Who would know? I suppose the people in business would know because they are the people who are going to do the investing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Chamber of Manufactures, a very important organisation representing manufacturers in Australia, as its name suggests, recently did a survey of its members, which was published yesterday. In it, 92 per cent of its members said that the Government's One Nation statement would not encourage them to increase investment; 3 per cent said that it would; and the balance, which is 5 per cent, were undecided. That, I would have thought, is a fairly savage indictment of the One Nation statement, which is little more than a game being played by politicians trying to get re-elected, and who will fail in the process. As the Confederation of Australian Industry said the other day:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The economic statement is not about economic management. It is political from top to bottom . . .  One ultimately becomes weary of trying to fit all of the pieces into a coherent recovery strategy.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are not the words of politicians; that is not the Opposition trying to be horrid about the Labor Party or something like that. They are simply the words of the people who really matter in this exercise&mdash;the business people who are going to make the investment decisions that are going to create jobs. There is no sign of that at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of getting the economy going again, we are making very little progress in this country. As people will see during the rest of this year&mdash;although, of course, there will be fluctuations in a whole range of different economic indicators&mdash;there will not be any substantial recovery and there will not be any improvement in the ghastly level of unemployment that we have in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once all the ballyhoo of the Prime Minister's quite extraordinary statements about national symbols and so on passes, as inevitably it will, people will turn around, the dust will begin to settle, and they will say, `Now do we have a sparkling rich new economy with the unemployed back in jobs?'. They will see that they have not. When they see that there has been a lot of rhetoric but nothing has been achieved by it, I am afraid that as far as the Labor Party is concerned the new sense of disillusionment will be very profound, and justifiably so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present Prime Minister has been strong on this rhetoric about internationalising the Australian economy. As we can see from the statistics on exports as a proportion of our GDP, it has been all talk but little success. The present Prime Minister has argued through his time in government that one of the ways&mdash;and this is correct&mdash;to internationalise the Australian economy is to wind back tariffs progressively over a period.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to remind the House of some of the things he said. On 12 March 1991, which was the date of the sixteenth consecutive economic statement by the Hawke-Keating Government, when the now Prime Minister was Treasurer, just over 12 months ago, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within this decade, Australia will have renounced once and for all the fallacious doctrine that prosperity can be found behind the insular wall of protection.</PARA>
<PARA>In the same speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The package of measures announced today&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, on 12 March 1991&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ends forever Australia's sorry association with the tariff as a device for Australia's industrial development.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on the following day with a range of very similar remarks. The point is that we on this side of the House made those difficult decisions by the Government possible by giving them our support. If we had taken the politically expedient position and opposed those decisions, they would simply have become politically impossible for the Labor Party. History will judge that to be a very important contribution that we have also made whilst in opposition to the process of internationalising the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble is that we heard today that, owing to a by-election in Victoria and for no other intellectual reason, the present Prime Minister has decided to change his mind. He does not believe these things any more. Suddenly he has decided that he is not really in favour of tariff reductions at all and believes that industries can be saved by just maintaining tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose he has really more than one motive for that. He has the obvious political motive, but he has another motive, which is that, while he has been moving to lower tariffs, he has done nothing to improve the capacity of those firms that used to be assisted by tariffs to compete more successfully without tariffs. Clearly, if one just takes away tariffs without doing anything else to improve the capacity of business to compete, one will create a catastrophe. That is exactly what we have in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about having a similar program for the reduction of tariffs to that of the Government&mdash;at least until today; we do not know what its program is now&mdash;we talk about reducing tariffs to negligible levels by the year 2000. That is defined as somewhere in the vicinity of 5 per cent, which is identical to the Government's program. However, when we talk about that we are not just talking about throwing Australian industry out into the cold without any additional assistance to compensate for the abolition of tariffs. We provide a range of very substantial benefits to compensate for them. Those benefits are identified in our Fightback program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will take the opportunity of reminding honourable members on the other side of the House of what the Treasury said in its document about the benefits that would flow to Australian industries as a result of the introduction of the Fightback program. The rhetoric from the Labor Party is that when the coalition comes to power, everything will go wrong&mdash;there will be massive unemployment; there will be earthquakes and heavy rain; people will be washed away in floods; the world will just become a nightmare. I suppose it is the rhetoric one would expect from a government in a desperate position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly enough, what the Treasury says is dramatically different. For example, the Treasury estimates that the impact of the introduction of the Fightback program will be to reduce the cost of agriculture in Australia by over $1 billion; that is over $8,000 for every farm in Australia. Manufacturers, who are the principal beneficiaries of tariffs, get something like $3 1/2 billion in tariff assistance at the moment. When the Government's program is completed in 1997 that figure will be significantly lower, but just at the moment it is $3 1/2 billion. Under the Fightback program, according to the Treasury's figures, the coalition provides a benefit of over $5.3 billion to manufacturing industries through the abolition of the range of taxes it abolishes, and also as a result of the introduction of the GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taking individual industries, we have heard a lot about the textiles, clothing and footwear industry. The Prime Minister says that in Wills the textiles, clothing and footwear industry has no future. We point out that the Treasury's own figures show that the Fightback program would reduce costs in the textile industry by $177m and in the clothing and footwear industry by $139m. So the list goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker talked about rail transport. What is the impact of the Government's program on rail transport? It is increasing spending by $450m or so, totally unfunded. We have said that we will continue infrastructure spending in so far as it can be funded. That is obviously something that we will have to look at when the time comes, because it will depend on the level of growth in the economy over the next two or three years. According to the Treasury document, the Fightback program alone&mdash;a program which is fully funded, as I think everyone now concedes&mdash;provides railways with a benefit of $306m and road transport with a benefit of $1.1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those on the other side of the House claim that tourism will be affected by the Fightback program, and what a disaster it is going to be, yet air transport gets a $376m benefit and restaurants, hotels and clubs&mdash;the absolute essence of tourism&mdash;get a $318m benefit. Finally, defence industries&mdash;which may have something of a future in Australia if we are creative about them&mdash;get a $90m benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I began with the internationalising of our economy, and that is where I will finish. The Treasury estimates that we will reduce the cost of exports by $1.9 billion, or 3 per cent. That is internationalising the economy; that is making Australia more productive. People who support the Labor Party oppose all of those things. They oppose all of those benefits. They want to retain that higher cost structure and reduce tariffs, which is what they are doing rather than what they are saying. If they pump up costs and reduce tariffs, they will smash Australian industry. If tariffs and costs are reduced, Australian industry will thrive and our economy will finally internationalise. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are discussing government appropriations, which is really a debate about government expenditure. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), was quite right to identify the nature of government expenditure as well as the level of that expenditure as being the two critical elements that we should debate in appropriations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to take up both of those points. In terms of the level of expenditure that any government should undertake at a given time, a government has to ask itself whether it needs to stimulate the private sector activity in an economy at any time or whether it needs to withdraw its expenditure in order to give room for expansion of the private sector. In those booming years from 1986 through to the early part of 1990 the Commonwealth Government took the view that it would run surpluses in its own Budget and, therefore, by implication, withdraw expenditure from the economy, move aside and let the private sector do its best to stimulate employment and wealth. I think we made a correct decision there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, of more recent days with a troubled economy it was imperative&mdash;in fact, the business sector asked this of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) earlier this year&mdash;that the Government should re-enter the fray and begin to stimulate activity in the Australian economy. Honourable members should forget the ideology. A government needs to think through the role which the public sector needs to play. At the moment it is imperative that the public sector re-enter the fray to stimulate the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the whole purpose of the One Nation package. The beauty of it politically is that the Prime Minister, when he travelled around Australia during his consultations, was asked by the private sector, the business community, to spend public money in a way that would assist the private sector and give</PARA>
<PARA>the greatest possibility for job creation, which is the goal of both sides of this House. The level of government expenditure needs to remain as a response to a level of activity in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the second instance, how the money is spent counts most. That is quite right. We are not aiming to do as previous governments did 10 years or 15 years ago: take people off dole queues by putting them on the roads, digging holes and filling them in again. That is not a very sensible way to spend public money. I want to contrast some of the sensible ways that we now wish to spend some of the public money through the One Nation package, moneys which are being appropriated in these Appropriation Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, let me point to the alternative, the punitive view that the Opposition has in its Fightback package of the public sector's role in stimulating the economy. The Opposition is seeking&mdash;I am quoting from the figures in the Fightback document&mdash;to reduce the general purpose payments to the States and the Territories by 5 per cent in its first years of government. This would involve cuts of about $756m on 1991-92 figures. In other words, the Opposition would be withdrawing funding from the States that would be used for capital programs, public money that would be used to stimulate the sorts of infrastructure investments that we are deciding to make through the One Nation statement which the private sector requested of us. Through the Fightback package, the Opposition is moving in precisely the opposite direction to cut $756m from those general purpose payments to the States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, there is a particular program that the Opposition has some desire to destroy. It is seeking to abolish the better cities program. This would mean a cut of around $56m in 1991-92 programs. I refer to the better cities program per se and its objective. The Opposition faces the problem that if it were to make such severe cuts in general purpose payments it would add to the stringency under which State governments have travailed under our regime. The Commonwealth has actually been very tough on the States over a number of years. I think we had to be; we had to pull their expenditure into line. But there is a time when one stops. When the flesh has been cut from the bone one needs to make an intelligent decision about what are minimum levels of expenditure that States and Territories undertake on behalf of the Commonwealth, essentially because we fund a number of these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cuts that the Opposition would make need to be assessed against the background of significant real declines in these general purpose payments that were made through the latter half of the 1980s. In fact, general purpose assistance fell by 15 per cent in real terms between 1985-86 and 1991-92. By contrast, the Commonwealth, this Government, has agreed to a guarantee for general revenue assistance, in real terms, for the three-year period 1991-92 to 1993-94. This reflects a judgment that it is now time to consolidate the sorts of constraints that we placed on the States but not to cut further. There is a time to cut and there is a time to build. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Good, I have not read it&mdash;perhaps I will do so later. I shall contrast the levels of government expenditure. The Government has stepped in when the private sector has been unable to cope. The Government withdrew in the mid-1980s when the private sector was able to cope. In fact, we threw the private sector into it holus-bolus. We said, `Get on with it&mdash;stimulate the advancement of the nation'. Of course, the private sector made some gross errors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The better cities program is an example of the recent stimulus from the public sector. There comes a time when governments need to place some basic hard infrastructure in some of our cities. For instance, we will stimulate the Queensland State Government's desire to build a rail line from the city of Brisbane to the Gold Coast. We will do that because it is sensible planning; it is something that the State Government desires to do as a way of directing massive suburban growth between the southern suburbs of Brisbane and the Gold Coast, which are two of the fastest growing local government areas in the nation. The Government has promised to spend a fairly modest amount of money there to help the State Government stimulate the building of a rail line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole purpose of building that rail line is to try to get some substitution. There is a need to get some of the commuters off the road and the freeways, on which they drive for an hour and a quarter or so between the Gold Coast and the city of Brisbane, onto a rail system. Planners have noted that by laying down a dedicate transport route&mdash;specifically a rail line&mdash;one can have an enormous impact on the shape of suburbs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not throwing money at the State Government. In return for Commonwealth money, the Government is asking for the following things: that when the State Government builds the rail system it considers how it houses people close to the line and the sorts of densities that are desirable; that it gives us an estimation of the number of people who will travel by the rail system; and that it gives us an estimation of the substitution of mode of travel&mdash;that is, the number of people it believes will get out of the car and into the rail system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are flow-on effects in terms of a better use of land and a better use of infrastructure such as water reticulation, sewerage systems and so on, kerbing and guttering, the sealing of local roads&mdash;all those bits of expenditure that governments would normally undertake. We can actually ensure that in time there are enormous savings for the public sector by planning that area between Brisbane and the Gold Coast more intelligently. In other words, a little bit of expenditure at a time when sensible people have agreed that the public sector should re-enter the fray can produce returns that any investor would be proud of. The public sector will be returned many millions of dollars because we will not need to build enormous water reticulation systems and sewerage systems, and we will not need to lay down as many roads per taxpayer, per householder, as we might otherwise have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The better cities program, introduced at the perfect time, produces a return to the public sector, a return in lower taxes&mdash;a decent investment, a sensible investment if taken at the right time and at the right levels. We are making other sorts of investments through the better cities program. For instance, it is well known that the number of people who reside in our inner cities has been declining for many years, mainly because the size of families is declining. Whereas once there was a mother, a father and two or three children living in a house close to the city, there are perhaps one or two persons remaining in the same house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have a very valuable stock of housing situated close to existing services which is well serviced by means of water reticulation, electricity, public transport and so on, but underutilised. Again, a fairly modest amount of public sector expenditure through the better cities program will produce returns by ensuring that we get some renewal of housing&mdash;medium density housing&mdash;that will place more people around those areas so there is a return to the schools, a use of the parks, more people paying taxes for the use of water and sewerage, more people jumping on the train to commute and more people using the local swimming pool. The whole business will flow. In other words, there will be a return to what is a sensible investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Jim Soorley, has been a wonderful advocate for renewal in the inner north-eastern suburbs. He has persuaded the Goss Government to ensure that the better cities program stopped at the inner north-eastern suburbs of Brisbane and that we funded his project. This means that we can now also look at the big picture of a contiguous set of four or five suburbs from which, for instance, the Coca-Cola factory has indicated that it will move to the outer suburbs at some stage, leaving vacant a number of hectares of space for which we can find a better purpose. There are houses that are coming pretty close to a time when they need to be renewed. There are some public facilities, like the RNA showgrounds, which are pretty well underutilised and which with a certain amount of thinking and stimulus can be better used to produce a return on the capital, the public's investment in that land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So Jim Soorley and the local communities whom he is consulting in conjunction with the Commonwealth Government are intent on ensuring that about $30m will be spent over about five years in this area, meaning that we will get an enormous influx of people to the area, we will get a better use of its roads, and we should be able to build a light rail system to assist people to commute from new medium density dwellings to the city. Generally speaking, we will revive that area. That is not something that is done lightly or easily; it is usually a very expensive process. It is a process about which the private sector is often very nervous, but the private sector welcomes this particular stimulus, this Commonwealth involvement in better cities, because it will end up making a quid out of it; it will end up helping us to build the medium density houses that we desire. That is the extent of the remarks that I wish to make tonight. There is a time to spend and there is a time to make intelligent public expenditure. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister, I think, has finally recognised that, if the wheat does not go in this year, not only will the farmers not benefit but also Australia, because of the lost export income, will not benefit. In other words, if there is no crop, there will be no income. Many farmers will be sold up; their expertise will be lost from the land. This is particularly tragic in the case of young families on farms. Having accepted that principle, I believe the same principle applies with the need for restocking finance. If pastoralists are not running sheep on their property, they have no income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In western New South Wales and over the borders in significant areas of Queensland and South Australia a raging drought is still going on. Even though the drought may have broken in eastern New South Wales, many areas in the west have only had an inch or so of rain this year. The sheep numbers are down because of that drought and because of the wool crisis over the last year or so. Sheep numbers have plunged and those sheep left in the paddocks are often too weak to be brought to the sheds to be shorn or to be crutched. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will read out some figures that have been phoned in to me from the Louth, Tilpa, Cobar and Wanaaring areas of New South Wales. One property only has 1,500 sheep left out of 5,700; another has 1,300 left out of 10,000; another has only 300 left out of 14,000; and another has 1,100 left out of 11,000; another has lost 30,000 sheep out of 50,000; another has only 5,000 left out of 7,000; another has 4,000 out of 8,000; another has 1,200 left out of 9,800; and another has 2,000 left out of 14,000 sheep. There are, I am sure, worse examples around; however, those examples show to what extent the numbers have plunged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Federal Government that it took a decision in April 1989 to remove drought from the national disaster relief arrangements; in other words, no Federal assistance is now available to people in this position. When the drought policy review task force reported in May last year, it strongly recommended that assistance be given in such circumstances. We are now well into 1992 and there still has been no proper government response to this report. The Government must act and at least expand funding through part B of the rural adjustment scheme, as it has with crop planting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many pastoralists are financially destitute and the mental stress they are suffering is horrific, particularly for their families. I think the only comfort they are getting at the moment is that their situation is not of their own making and that many of their neighbours are in a similar plight. They are even pulling their children out of schools because they cannot afford the fees. I believe the Government has let them down badly. It has crucified them with the ridiculous economic policies it has pursued. At the very least, it should redress the balance a little by providing restocking finance as soon as it is needed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I want to say something about the divisive effect of the Opposition's 15 per cent goods and services tax on Australian families and, if time permits, on Australian small business. In essence, the goods and services tax would function to shift the tax burden from higher income earners to lower income earners. No amount of obfuscation, figure juggling, literature distribution or confused presentation can disguise that fact. It is very simple and Australian families understand it. They understand that any proposal to impose a 15 per cent tax on the food they put in their mouths and on the clothes they put on their backs will substantially add to their cost of living. Most of all, this tax will hit families on incomes of $20,000 per year and less. I say to those opposite that, no matter how they twist and turn and no matter how they try to wriggle, struggling Australian families are seeing through the proposal. They are seeing through the fanfare and the razzamatazz that went along with the presentation of the Opposition's package last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to mention the bleating of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) more recently. When anybody focuses upon the unfairness and the harshness of the goods and services tax and how it will split the Australian community and starts to expose the deceit that is the Fightback package, they cry foul. They say that it should not be done and that we are trying to divert the argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say to our friends opposite that far from diverting the argument, we are going to direct the discussion more and more at the unfairness, the inequity, the divisiveness of what they are about. No matter how hard they try, they are not going to pull the wool over the eyes of the Australian people, particularly Australian families on incomes of less than $20,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to figures I have had taken out which go to the costs to a family of supplies from the baker, the butcher, the fruiterer-greengrocer and the milk vendor. These figures come from the Australian Commissioner of Taxation. They are based on Australian income tax rulings. They have been extrapolated to accommodate an Australian family of two adults with two children under 16. In arriving at the taxable income of people in those employment categories, the Taxation Commissioner for the year ended June 1990 attributed the use of own stock for a baker at the rate of $178 per adult and $89 per child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we multiply those figures for two adults and two children we come to these expenditure figures: on bakery products, $534; on butchery sales, $1,244; on supplies from the fruiterer-greengrocer, $1,956; on purchases from the grocer, $3,914; and on purchases from the milk vendor, $534. That is a total annual outlay of $8,182. If we add to that the 15 per cent GST, $1,226, we have a total of $9,408. In other words, that family of four will be required to pay out an additional $1,226 in goods and services tax. The Taxation Commissioner tells us that 50 per cent of all families have an average income of less than $20,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under phase one of the Opposition's tax scale there will be a reduction in income tax for that category of $814. The effect of that is that that family will be $412 a year worse off; in other words, $8 per week worse off. No amount of misrepresentation, no amount of confusion, no amount of marketing by the Opposition can move away from the very basic fact that those families&mdash;50 per cent of Australian families&mdash;are going to be worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We turn to what is happening to small business. Small business will have the burden imposed upon it of collecting the goods and services tax, and that burden is equivalent to about 2 per cent on sales after net profit. So that is a major reduction for many sole traders in their net rate of profit. But on top of that, incorporated small businesses&mdash;and many of them would not be paying payroll tax&mdash;will be slugged with an increase in the company tax rate from 39c in the dollar to 42c in the dollar. It does not matter how one goes around it, looks at it and tries to present it, families on incomes of $20,000 a year are going to be considerably worse off. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Moreover, we will abolish wholesale sales tax&mdash;and over half the items in a supermarket attract wholesale sales tax. It is a lie for anybody to say that the cost of living will increase by 15 per cent in the supermarket. On our conservative estimates, the one-off effect on the CPI will be 4.4 per cent. The Government's own Treasury document&mdash;that mammoth collection of overtime of so many public servants&mdash;estimates the impact on the CPI at 3.9 per cent. So how can the honourable member for Shortland claim that the cost of living for people will go up by 15 per cent? We will abolish the wholesale sales tax, fuel excise and payroll tax.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is extremely concerned about the incidence of breast cancer in Australia and has committed $64 million over three years to the introduction of a National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer. The program is to be implemented over five years from the time each State and Territory government agrees to participate. After initial Commonwealth funding of an expansion phase, the program will be cost shared with the States. Queensland agreed to join the National Program in May 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to establish a national program was based on an evaluation of Australian pilot projects and the findings of a number of overseas studies. The conclusions of the evaluation were that screening mammography can be effective in reducing breast cancer mortality rates if provided through a dedicated, accredited program which is accessible to women in the appropriate age range and includes assessment and referral for treatment. The current system of ad hoc provision of diagnostic mammography is not geared to successfully screen those women in the population most likely to benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this reason the national program will establish a national network of screening and assessment services which will be dedicated to the purpose of screening mammography and which will be required to meet stringent standards to achieve accreditation.
