<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Happily, Mr Speaker. I quote from the article:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At that meeting the Minister for Defence and strongman of the Victorian Right, Senator Ray, is understood to have said Mr McLeay was `the worst speaker they had ever had'.</PARA>
<PARA>While I understand that under the Parliamentary Privileges Act there have been changes relating to defamatory comments, you will recall, Mr Speaker, that in a ruling of your own not so very long ago, on 9 October 1990, as reported on page 2421 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, you said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would be very happy if the House would like to change those rules&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which are with respect to the Parliamentary Privileges Act&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">so that we might bring statements made by the Speaker or other members outside the House into this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, you will know that in the House of Commons, to which our Standing Orders require us to turn when our own Standing Orders are inadequate, there have been a number of recent rulings relating to allegations about the impartiality of the Chair. I would suggest that they have real relevance to this allegation by Senator Ray about yourself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, Mr Speaker, if you would like to turn to page 250 of the House of Commons <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 17 January 1978, you would see that a similar matter was raised by a Mr Anthony Grant in which he referred to a photograph of Mr Speaker of the House of Commons and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a whole series of precedents, Mr. Speaker, whereby accusations of partiality on the part of the Speaker have been held to be a contempt of the House.</PARA>
<PARA>The Speaker considered that particular matter, and I think it worth while even for members of the Government to understand the response. I refer them to page 460 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 18 January 1978, where Mr Speaker in the House of Commons responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yesterday, the hon. Member for Harrow, Central (Mr. Grant) raised a matter of privilege concerning a caption on the back page of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Guardian</EMPHASIS> which, he claimed, implied a reflection on the impartiality of Mr Speaker.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should inform the House that within two hours of the complaint having been made I received a letter from Mr. Peter Preston, editor of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Guardian</EMPHASIS>, giving me an assurance that no such reflection was intended and expressing regret that the caption may have been misconstrued.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, I put two questions to you. Firstly, I believe this is a matter of parliamentary privilege, for you will know that although the provision in section 6 does not mean that a defamatory attack may not be found to be a contempt, it also means that it can be by reason only that it is defamatory. In other words, there is reason for the allegation by Senator Ray to raise doubts about your impartiality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put to you, sir, two suggestions, therefore: one, that it should be referred to the Standing Committee of Privileges; second, that failing, that you take up that admonition that you yourself expressed on 9 October 1990. The question of that particular subsection of the Parliamentary Privileges Act should be referred to the Privileges Committee to see whether it should be deleted. I am sure that we all believe that any suggestion of partiality on your part would not be capable of being sustained. We would want the assurance that members of the Government felt the same. On that basis, in spite of the difficulties that you may be having in preselection, I suggest to you that those comments are totally untoward and that Senator Ray should be brought to heel on the basis of having declared you `the worst speaker they had ever had'. </PARA>

I ask: is the Prime Minister aware that there are nearly 19,000 unemployed people in Wills and related areas, washed up by the recession that he created? That is a 71 per cent increase in the last 12 months. Is he also aware that at the close of business yesterday the Coburg CES listed only 26 jobs in the electorate of Wills?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We saw in the national accounts figures last week that the economy had recorded positive growth for the second consecutive quarter. The linkage between employment and GDP is a very close one. If one wants to look at any graphic illustration of that back over 10 or 20 years, one will find that whenever GDP moves so too does employment. Therefore, as we have often said in the House, employment is a lagged and lagging indicator of activity. Therefore, one would expect movements in employment to follow a shift in GDP&mdash;to succeed it, to come after it. That said, though, there has been, over a period of months, a consistent trend towards a stronger level of employment in the economy, notwithstanding the fact that unemployment has risen a jot with a shift in participation rates.</PARA></TALK.START>

But the main thing is that we have preserved the larger proportion of the employment gains of the 1980s&mdash;of the 1.8 million jobs created between 1983 and 1990, 1.5 million have been retained.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Perth for his question. It is true, but not surprising, that investment at this stage of the economy's turnaround from recession to recovery is weak. It is a fact that investment tends to be procyclical and picks up during a recovery. The Government had this precise point in mind when it took the decisions it did in One Nation to review and improve the taxation treatment of investment in plant and equipment in order to build in a new incentive for that kind of investment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now find that Australia has a world class depreciation system in relation to the taxation treatment of investment in plant and equipment. This will be aggressively competitive for businesses in Australia making a decision about where they invest and businesses outside Australia making decisions about where they invest. The point is that it will likely bring forward investment decisions which will have the effect of hastening the progress of the recovery in this particular economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth comparing what the Government has decided to do in relation to the taxation of business with what the Opposition proposes. It is worth bearing in mind that the Opposition has said nothing whatsoever about depreciation allowances or how it would deal with the question of the need to improve the former depreciation arrangements that we had in Australia and those which we are now proposing to introduce. On the contrary, the Opposition proposes to batter business with increased taxes as a result of the shifts which it has in mind. It is not often that I have the opportunity to quote Des Moore who writes for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">IPA Review</EMPHASIS>. In a recent article, he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regrettably, the Coalition has given credence to this misconception by purveying the notion that there will be a $20 billion cut in taxes on businesses. It could just as well be argued on that basis that the $27 billion estimated to be raised from the GST will increase taxes on businesses. It is business that pays the GST in the first instance and then has to recoup it by passing it on in prices, just as it is business that will not pay the other three taxes in the first instance.</PARA>
<PARA>The real picture as far as business is concerned is that there will be a net increase of $7 billion as a result of the increased incidence of taxes on business due to this amazing money laundering scheme which the Opposition has in mind&mdash;a further $7 billion imposition of taxes on business as a result of this change.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, you do not have to rely on Des Moore;  you do not have to rely on me. You can, however, rely on what has actually happened in a couple of the model economies which the Opposition seeks to emulate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of those that I would refer to is that in Canada, where we know the Canadians introduced a consumption tax in 1991. So in awe of Canada is the Opposition that it actually invited someone out from Canada to tell it how to do it. The Opposition may have been told how to do it, but has it heard of what has happened as a consequence as far as small business is concerned?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Canadian Federation of Independent Business found that 71 per cent of surveyed firms felt that the consumption tax had a negative effect on their business and 85 per cent of respondents of small and medium sized firms identified the tax as imposing additional costs, which were more significant for the smaller than the larger firms. Indeed, firms with less than 20 employees pay about 82 per cent of the total private implementation costs. That is, in Canada as a result of the tax which the Opposition is emulating, we find that small business has been battered to the point where 71 per cent of small businesses are worse off and 85 per cent say that it has imposed additional costs in terms of collecting the tax.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another model economy closer to home, just across the Tasman, which the Opposition is fond of referring to as the kind of model that it wants to follow. There is a very interesting review of the impact of the GST in New Zealand on small business particularly. I quote from an accountant&mdash;and the Opposition is fascinated by accountants; they are the ones who will really benefit from the changes the Opposition has in mind. John Morine gives a bit of advice which he hopes small business in Australia will take to heart. He says this:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If and when a consumption tax or GST is introduced in Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he is addressing this to small business&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">your personal stress level will rise sharply. Sunday at the beach with the family will be a thing of the past as you spend your leisure time grappling with GST returns and trying to unscramble your accounting records from taxation complications you do not understand. You should consider how you will cope when you lose one day a week to the GST, whether your business will survive and what you are going to do about it now, with so little time left in which to lobby against the GST.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on with this plea from the heart to Australian small business:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you and the other 800,000 or so small business proprietors throughout Australia do not succeed in getting the GST removed from the political agenda, you will rue the day you took no action. Act now. Otherwise you may not survive.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have the Opposition with nothing to say about encouraging investment in Australian business, bemoaning as it does on a daily basis the statistics which emerge when, in fact, what those opposite have in mind is not only to impose an additional $7 billion of taxation on business but to do it in a way which will be bewilderingly confusing for small business and will have the unhappy kinds of consequences in Australia which we have already seen in reality in places such as Canada and New Zealand.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to interjections, honourable members might be interested in some statistics from the electorate of Wills which indicate that two-thirds of all services in Wills are bulkbilled&mdash;64.2 per cent&mdash;and the percentage of services at or below the schedule fee is 75 per cent. Under Medicare, medical fees are restrained by an insurance system which keeps the pressure on doctors' charges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition would in fact throw all of this away. It would, effectively, slug families with a fourfold whammy. First of all, the Medicare levy would stay, but Medicare rebates would be cut by 10 per cent from 85 per cent of the medical benefit schedule fee to 75 per cent; secondly, bulkbilling would be abolished; thirdly, families would have to take out private insurance; and, fourthly, there would be a compulsory co-payment on top of private insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of such a policy on families would be quite dramatic. The analysis by my Department is based on a very conservative assumption. My Department assumes, firstly, that the Opposition would prohibit bulkbilling and that a family which currently goes to a bulkbilling doctor would therefore be charged the medical benefit schedule and not the AMA schedule&mdash;a somewhat generous assumption. Secondly, it assumes that doctors who patient bill would lift their charges to the AMA schedule because that is the level that will be supported by private insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result for families on $30,000 who go to a bulkbilling clinic and who currently have private insurance is an increase in costs of $7.50 per week. The result for families on $30,000 who take out private insurance for the first time and get the $200 tax credit is an increase in costs, my Department estimates, of $23.50 per week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for those reasons that the Treasury, in its overall analysis of the Opposition policy, estimates that health services would increase by 22.63 per cent under that Opposition policy. Those figures would be higher if we add in the other likely impacts of Opposition policy: the raising of all fees to the AMA schedule, which is 30 per cent above the level of the medical benefit schedule; a lift in the AMA schedule itself&mdash;after all, that schedule is to be determined in negotiation between the doctors and the insurance industry; and increases in costs of insurance to cover these increases in medical charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that alternative policy we see a very substantial increase in the cost for families. As a result of the shift from the medical benefit schedule to the AMA schedule&mdash;effectively doctors setting their own rates&mdash;ultimately the cost of health in this country will go up very substantially. Ultimately, a system which has been associated with the maintenance of spending on health in this country at about 8 per cent of GDP would effectively be sabotaged and scrapped.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the years the Government has been in office it has had more than twice as much growth as in the previous period of the coalition government. That is an average over twice as fast. It is no wonder, therefore, that we had the reflection of that in the very high rates of employment growth over the period, taking the work force from six million to 7 1/2 million with the recession included and, of course, to activity and profitability in the period. But coming through the late 1980s, where demand was exceeding production by a factor of two&mdash;where demand was running twice product growth by a factor of two&mdash;and where that was being satisfied by imports, the Government had to curb the situation with a policy response.</PARA></TALK.START>

I do not know what the company's performance is; I do not know what opportunities it has made for itself; I do not know to what extent it is built upon government procurement policy; I do not know to what extent it is a company engaged in export; and I do not know to what extent it was simply a company that lived happily in the heyday of high growth rates in the late 1980s and its management was unable to cope in a lower growth economy and not find opportunity for itself abroad, as many other Australian computer businesses have succeeded in doing. They have found opportunities abroad to augment national demand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The honourable member will have noticed in the national accounts the term `net exports', that is, import replacement and exports. Many Australian companies have engaged in exports as a complementation of their domestic production. Maybe this company has not; maybe it should. This is one of the fastest growing areas of the world. There is a great demand for computer software. There is enormous demand for software and computer products in the South-East Asia and Asia-Pacific areas. Maybe this company should avail itself of it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In terms of tourism policy, basically the Government's objective has been, first of all, to attract tourists to this country&mdash;and in that context, obviously the announcements of the ATC's considerably increased funding are relevant&mdash;and, once they are in Australia, to ensure that we can move them at low cost. The significant, indeed historic, reforms to the aviation sector and also to the road and rail infrastructure, and in terms of the requirement to accommodate these inbound tourists, are dramatic improvements to the amortisation and depreciation arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition interjects about a whole range of things, but let me give one reason why the tourism industry is almost having a Boston Tea Party about the Opposition's policy. That one reason goes, of course, to the issue of GST, and it is the only aspect to which I will advert at this point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those who argue that the GST internationally has not had a negative impact on the tourism industry, let me give just one fundamental example. In 1990 Sweden introduced a new consumption tax, a new impost on its tourism industry. Bed night numbers fell by a massive 13 per cent. The Economist Intelligence Unit attributed this fall in the main to the introduction of this new tax. In the light of this dramatically negative circumstance for its industry, the Swedish Government recognised that its policy was a massive mistake and in January 1992 it overturned the decision. In doing so it implicitly and explicitly acknowledged that a consumption tax particularly disadvantages the tourism industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not news in the OECD. France, for example, has a general consumption tax rate of 18.6 per cent with a tourism rate of 2.1 or 5.5 per cent, depending on the service. In Canada the general rate is 7 per cent, but tourism services are zero rated. And so it goes through a range of other OECD countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is running around saying that some countries have a GST on tourism and therefore we also should have it. What I find inexplicable, and what I find I am totally incapable of accepting, is that when we have a comparative or competitive advantage over this very price sensitive industry of international tourism, we should give it away. Why would we give it away? <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overseas evidence is compelling; but even at home, if the Leader of the Opposition had taken the advice put forcefully, but apparently fruitlessly, by his own shadow Minister, he would not have proposed a consumption tax on tourism.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is fond of pointing out how people are caught red-handed.

In an interview between Ms Tingle and him he was asked if the coalition was targeting an inflation rate of zero to 2 per cent and the inflation rate was then at 3 per cent, and if the coalition wanted monetary policy to play a role in bringing inflation down, would this not imply the need for interest rates to rise?</PARA>

They know that that is a nonsense. The only way that that could be true&mdash;the only way&mdash;would be if you had a severe tightening of monetary policy, particularly in the circumstances where it would be certain that wage rises would be increasing.

He said: `What you must do is upgrade reporting of cyclones'. That is very laudable indeed. But he forgets two things. First of all, that has been occurring. In fact, last year the radar on Willis Island in the Coral Sea was upgraded, so now it has full weather watching capabilities. Secondly, the Leader of the National Party forgot to read his own <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If, for just a fleeting moment, the Government imagines that, by gagging the suspension of Standing Orders moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) at the end of Question Time, it would in some way be relieved of the agony and embarrassment of debating the way in which the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) misled this Parliament in December last year about the key social and economic issue facing the Australian people, namely, the issue of unemployment, then it was sadly mistaken. That action of the Government reveals its extraordinary sensitivity on the matter which is before the House under the Standing Orders as a matter of public importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everybody in this country, and certainly every member of parliament, knows that, above all else, the major political issue, the major social issue, the major national issue facing the Australian nation at present is unemployment. The fact is that over a million Australians are unable to obtain work. When we add the number of unemployed and underemployed together&mdash;the underemployed are people working two, three or four days a week instead of the normal five because their employers do not have enough orders to keep them fully occupied, despite the fact that the economy is supposed to be out of recession&mdash;we have a total number of people either unemployed or underemployed approaching the staggering figure of 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the response of the Government to this colossal, staggering, tragic social problem? The response of this Government is not to address the issue fairly and squarely. In a moment of total candour it does not say, `We are sorry that so many people are out of work, we are sorry so many families have been destroyed, fractured and broken by the incidence of unemployment'. Its answer is to create a series of diversions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will say this about the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating): he certainly is not the master of economic management; he certainly is not the master of the truth; he certainly is not the master of having a vision for the future of this country.

I think that, by any measure, one could hardly say that the words `speaking untruths' go beyond the definition of robust exchange. But in deference to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and in the interests of using my time productively, I will go on and say that the Government has dishonestly impugned and deliberately misrepresented the substance of the Fightback package.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a classic example of it in Question Time today. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) got up and, on the strength of an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, tried to suggest that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had been embarrassed on the subject of interest rates. The burden of what the Treasurer said was that the impact of the Fightback package would lead to an increase in interest rates. That was the whole burden of what the Treasurer said; it is the whole burden of what Senator Walsh has been saying; it is the whole burden of what the Minister for Finance has been saying both as Minister for Finance and in the brief time that he was Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, quite properly, got up and asked the Minister for Finance why he was in full flight on 16 December last year, suggesting that the impact of the Fightback package would lead to an increase in interest rates and that there would be horror and destruction because of those higher interest rates. Yet 14 days earlier that same man, as Treasurer of Australia, had received a minute from the Department of the Treasury telling the Treasurer that, in the opinion of the Department of the Treasury, the Fightback package would actually produce lower interest rates. That is the measure of the deception we have been subjected to, and that is the measure of the diversion that has been created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Government has a problem with unemployment, what does it do? It goes out into the community and spreads dishonest interpretations of what the Opposition is on about. It does not try to address the problem of unemployment; it does not acknowledge that it is a serious social problem. It does not say to the Opposition, `Why don't we, as people interested in the future of Australia and in the future welfare of young people of this country, sit down together and try to work out a sensible approach to unemployment?' Why does the Government not recognise that there are some good things in the Opposition's Fightback package? Why does it not pick them up and say to the Opposition, `Congratulations, these will make a contribution'? Why do members of the Government not take advice of the Treasury minute which they, and the then Treasurer, had conveniently forgotten? On 16 December, when the Minister for Finance was replying to a question in the House from the Opposition, why did he not tell the House what the minute had said: unemployment would fall as a result of the Fightback package because of the beneficial effects of the removal of the payroll tax? Why did he not tell the House, and why did the Treasurer not tell the House today?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why does not the Minister at the table, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley), being the reasonable man that I know him basically to be, get up and acknowledge that one of the effects of the Fightback package will be that employment in the first three years, using the same model that the Treasury used, would actually be above the base case scenario and that unemployment would actually be below the base case scenario, using that model? Why does the Minister not have the honesty to do that? Why does he not address that problem of unemployment in a more objective and honest fashion? Why does he embark upon so many diversions? Why is he so terrified that unemployment will scar the Government irreparably? I know that it will burn the Minister the next time there is an election in Swan&mdash;as it will burn the experiences of many other sitting Labor members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that the diversion of attacking the Fightback program as being a program that would lead to an increase in interest rates has been totally and comprehensively exposed in the Parliament today by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He has produced a minute from the Department of the Treasury which proves, root and branch, what the then Treasurer said on 19 December. I will read from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record what the Minister for Finance had to say. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The last thing the Australian people need is the kind of approach that the Opposition is proposing:&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise these words&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">immediate imposition of a tighter fiscal policy to increase unemployment and stop any recovery occurring and then, in the second year, a big inflation impact and a massive increase in interest rates to overcome the inflation impact. . .</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat his words `a massive increase in increase rates to overcome the inflation impact'. Those words were uttered to this Parliament on 19 December. Yet on 2 December, just over two weeks earlier, the Treasury said that the package:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . leads to considerably lower short term interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA>They were the words of the Treasury commenting on our Fightback program. Treasury then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This validates the fall in long-term bond rates in the previous year.</PARA>

What the Prime Minister of this country is doing is engaging in national diversionary tactics of a mammoth scale&mdash;of a scale the like of which we have not seen before. Some of his colleagues on the front bench are following him; I hope that the Minister at the table does not. The Prime Minister has embarked upon a course of indulging himself in a totally negative, nationalistic campaign. His latest caper is to try to prove what a terrific Australian he is&mdash;as though he has some kind of mortgage on that identity; as though he is the only person who has ever walked in this Parliament who feels proud to be an Australian. Instead of offering us a positive vision of the future of this country, instead of talking about the positive virtues of Australians, he seeks refuge in a negative criticism of another country. It shows the puerile limitations of that man's mind.

Instead of going out into the factories of Australia; instead of going to the TAFE colleges of Australia and trying to explain to the young people of Australia how they might get thousands more jobs from this terrific economic growth; instead of addressing some small businessmen and explaining to them how they might get better investment prospects in the nirvana of rapid growth now being delivered under the auspices of the Keating Government&mdash;where did we find the Treasurer? We found him in the vastness of the Australian National University in Canberra. Not much unemployment there; well below half the national average in fact. What was he talking about? Was he talking about growth; was he talking about employment; was he talking about the future of the children of this country? No, he was rabbiting on in his normally incoherent fashion while launching a book by some second-rate academic about Australian history. Of course, guess what?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am interested in this interpretation of the Opposition's Fightback package. According to the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) who has just spoken, if the Government chooses to debate the issues in the Fightback package we are therefore saying nothing about unemployment in this country. If we engage the Liberals in a debate on what they say is the solution to the country's ills then we, by doing so, are creating a diversion from the main debate or the main game of dealing with the issue of unemployment in this country. Was that ever an admission that the Fightback package may have something to do with many things, but that one thing it has nothing to do with is the issue of employment in this country!  If anyone thought for one minute that that might not be the case, what we have now had from the Opposition spokesman on employment is confession. Confession is good for the soul. For that reason alone, I enjoy the fact that the honourable member is able to stand up here and reveal that to us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am disappointed in the remarks of the Opposition spokesman on employment in this regard. He is one of the broader conservative members in this place. He is one of those conservative members who believe that the issues of this nation do not simply revolve around this or that aspect of narrow economic concern but that those narrow economic concerns are best addressed by looking at how we propose to tackle the problems of society as a whole. That has been a position which he has adopted in the past. Whilst I have never agreed with his analysis of Australian society or the direction in which he would wish to take it, one advantage that he has had over the current incumbent of the leadership of the Opposition is that he has been a complete politician. He is a person who is concerned about the polis, concerned about its totality, concerned about its needs and concerned about the philosophies which drive the decisions which government takes to benefit it or to have those issues dealt with in some other way. That has been his position in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry that the honourable member for Bennelong has sullied that aspect of his reputation by a rather silly contribution in this place suggesting in the first instance that the Government's discussing the Fightback package means that we are not concerned about unemployment; ergo, it has nothing to do with unemployment. Then he suggested that statements on the way we feel about this nation and its direction have ultimately nothing to do with the economy. Of course they do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of confidence in the community is absolutely central to the willingness of business to invest in the community, to the willingness of young people to develop themselves through the educational opportunities that are presented to them, and to the willingness and morale of our society as a whole to tackle the social problems which at the end of the day in a democracy do not simply confront governments but confront the whole society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), as Prime Minister, addresses a range of issues, and so he should. If members of the Liberal Party had had their wits about them and left the honourable member for Bennelong in place as Leader of the Opposition, he would have persisted in his past policies of similarly addressing the totality of the interests of society in the way in which an Opposition Leader should, that is, by engaging the Prime Minister in direct debate. The honourable member for Bennelong does his best, now and then, to do that from the Opposition benches, but he seems to be somewhat curtailed from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Prime Minister has addressed is absolutely central to where this nation goes. What this nation fundamentally has to understand is that we are a nation alone. We are part of no people's trading blocs. No people with whom we have had to deal over the years, particularly in economic matters, have cared one jot for the national interest of Australians or have put those interests ahead of their own when they have come to consider our fate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be said, because the honourable member for Bennelong drew attention to what the Prime Minister had to say about the record on national security policy, that during World War II the British, for reasons that made a lot of sense to themselves, made strategic decisions in which this country played no part. If one looks at the issue of the survival of the United Kingdom, one might ask why ought it not make such decisions. However, as far as we are concerned, there are lessons to be learned from that. I am proud to say that when I was Defence Minister of this country I sought to address those lessons by creating for ourselves, as this Government has, a self-reliant defence posture in this country. It is precisely those lessons that we learned in World War II which informed us to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to this objecting to tugging the forelock: National Party leaders are generally so mindful of the potential impact of trading blocs of which we are not a member in predominating potential markets for Australian agricultural produce, but on the occasion of the creation of the European Common Market the National Party leaders tugged the forelock and walked away. However, this is still an issue in New Zealand. Why?  Because the National Party Government in New Zealand got concessions when the United Kingdom went into the Common Market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New Zealanders still have arguments every now and then with the French about how much tripe they will let into the European Community, and they have arguments with the British about how much lamb is going to be allowed from New Zealand into the Economic Community. That is because during the 1960s there were a few people in the New Zealand Government with a bit of guts who decided that they would stand up for New Zealand interests. What did we get from the Opposition at the time? `No, I am very glad that you have found your way into this organisation. Please, Sir, we won't do anything to inhibit you there or ask you to negotiate anything difficult on our part'. There is absolutely no reason for the Opposition to feel proud about that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I get back to my first point, which is the Opposition's position in Fightback on unemployment. I noticed that when the Opposition spokesman got up on his scrapers and talked about Fightback he actually did not have much to say about the issue of unemployment per se. And well might he not. The Opposition spokesman was kind enough to give me a piece of free political analysis on what might happen to me in my own constituency. I am always grateful to receive a piece of free political analysis from him or anyone else in that regard, and I take some comfort from the thoughts of Frank O'Collins on the subject of the swung constituencies, as he has been responsible for Liberal Party direct mailing campaigns for some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His view as far as the direction of Opposition policy is concerned is that the Opposition had effectively given up on Swan and Canning because of the single-minded way in which wrong-headed policies were being pursued by the Liberal Party. One does not have to be a genius to figure that out. If one went around some of the areas in my constituency and told the people that the Liberal Party was going to impose on them a 15 per cent consumption tax for no particular gain in order to benefit the tax scales of the very wealthy, one would not need to be a genius to figure out how they might feel about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was kind of Mr O'Collins, as a person experienced in Liberal Party policy making, to arrive at conclusions similar to that which I have arrived at myself. However, I am more interested in what Mr O'Collins had to say about other aspects of the Liberal Party policy than in my own fate. He was reported as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr O'Collins said the Coalition's plan to end tariff assistance would be particularly damaging and would result in about 200,000 people being sacked during the first term of a Hewson Government.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"A vote for Hewson is a vote for high unemployment. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bottom line is that you can't afford to lose any more jobs in Australia than we have already lost. I think this is an extremely dangerous policy.</PARA>
<PARA>As we are talking about diversions, this is another interesting quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said he believed the Liberals were deliberately focusing on the tax changes in the package to divert attention from the issues of jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an interesting turning on its head of this particular matter of public importance. We have Mr O'Collins, a noted Liberal Party organiser for some considerable time, saying that Fightback is a diversion to discuss taxes as opposed to discussing jobs. Well might he say that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) have had a great deal to say about the Liberal Party's analysis of One Nation over the past few weeks since it was brought down. After the One Nation statement had been subject to analysis by the Liberal Party as to what it would achieve&mdash;albeit an analysis which disagreed in several areas with our own conclusions&mdash;its view was that the 800,000 jobs we were promoting as the likely outcome of the One Nation package were in fact something over 900,000. That was the logic of the Liberal Party's analysis of our propositions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened to the Opposition's own position on unemployment?  We can remember the fanfare when the Opposition said, `You get a 15 per cent consumption tax, and the various activities based around that will produce two million jobs'. There were no ifs or buts. If we look at the incredibly wordy propaganda which the Liberals are now posting out to mailboxes around the countryside on that particular matter, we see that there is no resiling from the assertion that with a 15 per cent consumption tax there will be two million jobs. It is not `there might be' or `that is a matter of judgment' or `the particular modelling did not incorporate a consumption tax'. None of the various things that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has said are flaws in the assertion that arising from the Fightback package two million jobs are created in the Liberal Party's propaganda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about honesty and integrity in this place. The qualifications that have been put on the Fightback package now by the Opposition, confronted with having to deal with a government front bench that at least has a pretty fair understanding of what the Leader of the Opposition is about and confronted with knowing that therefore he just cannot keep arguing by assertion, were not put on it in the Liberal Party's propaganda. What the Leader of the Opposition moves away from in this place, or in front of a gallery, he does not move away from when it is presented in the average citizen's letter box. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it comes to the issue of deceit and duplicity, I do not think there is anything going on in Australian debate that is more deceitful or duplicitous than that particular exercise as far as the Liberal Party is concerned. It is no wonder that we talk about the Liberal Party's position, because we are engaged in a great debate in this country. There has never been an occasion on which our parties have been so divided on matters of general principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the one hand we have a Liberal Party that has behind it the extremity of free market ideology presented in the early 1980s, where Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher can be described as having got it half right but where, more recently perhaps, Argentina has got it all right. That a man could actually say that sort of thing and believe it, as the Leader of the Opposition has, is an indication of the extent to which an obsession takes away one's judgment about what one ought to present locally. We have people of that ilk who actually make this kind of statement without realising the hurtful political nature of them. Not only is the Leader of the Opposition a man who deliberately sets out to hurt, but to the New Zealand National Party in Christchurch last year he said this as a joke:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am also impressed to see that you do keep in touch with other parts of the electorate and having two soup kitchens is a very nice touch.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not put that in the category of nasty politicians; I put it in the category of Marie Antoinette. When that poor lady said, `Let them eat cake' to the peasants who were screaming for bread, she did not do so because she hated or was contemptuous of peasantry; she did that because she genuinely did not understand that some people were not presented with a choice between bread and cake. She thought it was simply a problem of underproduction at the local bakery that was producing that lack of choice. I genuinely think that the Leader of the Opposition has got himself so far into the ether when something concerns the coalition's package that, even though he may have had&mdash;he is losing it now&mdash;a spurious popularity around the country, when he addresses the real needs of people, when his policy is compared to what is needed, he is so far out of place that there has been no equivalent in Australian political history to this point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, the Government has a view that there is a proper role for government intervention in all processes&mdash;in micro-economic reform to improve the efficiency of the economy and in training our people so that the work force has the skills it needs to be productive. All of that is included in the One Nation package and all of it is rejected by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final insult when it comes to employment policies is when those opposite get up and ask questions about what is happening to this or that private provider. The Opposition's proposition is to close all CES operations and eliminate all youth access centres and, having done that, to hand it all over to private providers, who will then be charged a 15 per cent consumption tax on the jobs they find. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be no zero rating. So, if a private provider actually acquires a job for someone, that someone will have to pay the 15 per cent. The employer may have paid the provider to acquire the job, in which case I suppose he has some capacity to pass on the 15 per cent he has to pay on other services that he provides. But, if the client happens to be an unemployed person, that person has to pay the 15 per cent to the private provider for the job that is subsequently provided, which amount will go to the Government. There cannot be any more obscene obsession with this whole centrality of the taxation issue than that as far as the Liberal Party is concerned. I am afraid to tell honourable members on the back bench opposite that we will be talking a lot more about these things over the next few months because they are central to unemployment; they are not a diversion. And those opposite will stand condemned by the electorate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has demonstrated today, this Government will use any means at its disposal to divert attention from the most severe problem facing us as a nation:  the problem of unemployment. No amount of posturing about nationalism or a new flag or whatever by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) can hide the fact that officially we have 920,000 Australians unemployed;  that 1 1/2 million Australians cannot get a job or are working fewer hours than they would like; that hidden in those figures are 262,000 families which have the chief breadwinner unemployed;  and that 218,000 children are living in a family where no-one has a job. No amount of hyperbole or cant by the Prime Minister or any of his Ministers can hide the fact that among those statistics thousands of people have lost their businesses, their homes or, tragically in many cases, their families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the problem is far worse than that. Families all over the country are helplessly watching their children become victims of this Government as well. The national youth unemployment rate is now 32.7 per cent. In the Prime Minister's own electorate it is 39.2 per cent. Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to tell you that in my State of Victoria the level of youth unemployment is as high as 40 per cent or 50 per cent in some areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, this trend is worsening and will continue for some time. Again, the statistics hide the human face of this massive problem. They hide the despair and the lack of self-worth of young people, the fear they have about their future and, tragically, the number of suicides. Those statistics also do not tell the anguish of parents who have worked hard to provide their children with a better education, to keep their kids at school. Those statistics do not tell us the number of women who work in order to provide a better future for their children, only to find all their efforts amount to nought as their children cannot find work&mdash;or, in the case of Victoria, approximately 22,000 cannot even get into a tertiary institution to continue their education.

For those who are able to gain entry to tertiary study, the prospect for their future is uncertain as well. In fact, there is a growing number of graduates working as hotel porters and waitresses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The record of this Government in dealing with youth unemployment is abysmal. It has conducted a public relations campaign to tell us that we are a clever country, that we are on track. And now the latest: One Nation. In that statement the Prime Minister said that he wanted a civilised country where we take care of those in need, where we invest in our children. The best way to take care of those in need is to provide them with the opportunity of a job&mdash;a real job, so that in the case of young people they can look forward to a secure career path. </PARA>

We used to have a public train system that was called the Victorian railways. The trains were repainted and the system was renamed Vicrail.

To reach that deceitful figure, as the shadow Minister for arts, heritage, sport and youth affairs, Senator Michael Baume, revealed in the Senate, the Minister said that the measure of youth unemployment was achieved by taking the official numbers of unemployed as a percentage of the whole youth population when the real measure of unemployment is the number of young people looking for jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Minister tried to get away with was including in his figures all young people at school or at university plus those not looking for a job.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member raised the critical issue of unemployment and the need to generate jobs. He did not elaborate on it. He went on to talk about how the debate was being diverted and asked how dare anybody in this nation question the Fightback package, the policy put forward by the Opposition. It is a policy that would further contract the economy of this nation and would further increase unemployment. It would do nothing whatsoever to help the people who need help today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me show honourable members this sham concern of the Opposition for people who do not have direct employment. We need to remember a few things. Firstly, the Opposition's policy will increase unemployment, even on the best scenario; secondly, its policy is to abolish unemployment benefits for people who are unemployed for periods of nine months or longer. The Opposition talks about `creating special benefit'&mdash;and we know that special benefit is the hardest form of assistance to get&mdash;but that is really a euphemism for `throwing people who are unemployed for nine months or longer onto the scrap heap'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition wants to impose upon this country the New Zealand disease&mdash;the disease in which we have this incredulous line that an employee or an unemployed person can sit down with an employer and discuss terms of employment and negotiate a good package of conditions by himself or herself. That is absolutely ludicrous. People do not believe that; they know that is not true. But the poor old Opposition plugs on with the ideological approach. It wants to inflict on this country the disaster that is New Zealand today. Listen to the talkback radio stations and hear what people who have come from New Zealand and escaped that disaster have to say about those sets of industrial relations arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth point I make is that the Opposition's policy provides for the abolition of the national wage case. The national wage case is there primarily to help people on lower incomes and to help those people in employment who, industrially, have little power and who, industrially, depend upon the national wage case to ensure that there is some level of equity for them in respect of wage scales. That is what the national wage case is there for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the four points that the honourable member for Bennelong did not want to talk about this afternoon. He wanted to cry foul. Anyone who questions, debunks or exposes the sham of the Fightback package is accused of diversion. I am sorry for the Opposition, but the issue is the sham that consists of the Fightback package. It is a sham. Let me go to some of the inaccuracies, the untruths, that are contained in it. On page 116 it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key elements of our private sector strategy are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">we will continue to provide preferred tax treatment to the family home&mdash;in other words we will not tax the family home.</PARA>
<PARA>But if we turn to page 225 of the same document, we see that it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in the case of an average home the net Goods and Services Tax impact is $2856 after discounting the effect of abolishing wholesale sales tax and petrol tax.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it does have a major impact on the price when people are buying a new family home. It is an artful presentation of information designed to deceive people. That is a core issue within the Fightback package. It talks about helping people on low incomes. The reality is that a family with two children and on $20,000 taxable income would be required to pay under GST an increase in tax of $1,226. That increase in tax means the goods and services tax. That is based on taxation figures of basic supplies, basic foods; they are not my figures. I will not detain the House with details of their origin, but they are from the Taxation Commissioner. The income tax reduction under GST is $814. That family is $8 per week worse off as a result of the GST. They are not my figures but figures from the Taxation Commissioner, from the document itself. Let us put that aside and not get bogged down in that exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real answer to the situation we face is to generate jobs. We are providing expanded levels of assistance for those who are unemployed, those who need additional training. We are giving support, additional training and retraining to people to help them get into jobs that are available. But we really need to generate more jobs, and that is what the One Nation package is about. The $2.3 billion expenditure over two years is designed to generate, in our estimation, at least 800,000 new jobs and, on the Opposition's calculations, well over 900,000 new jobs. It is designed to generate domestic demand&mdash;and that is the real solution&mdash;lift the level of domestic demand, create real jobs, true jobs, jobs that will spin off into greater demand for other goods and services and so create opportunities. In addition to that, what this Government is doing&mdash;and what the Opposition would not do&mdash;is provide assistance to those people who need assistance as they try to get better training and better education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will create a new high status, better resourced vocational education training sector with an injection of $720m over the next three years; we will develop a new, more flexible entry level training system to build on the best features of apprenticeships and to extend combined work study opportunities in the new occupations and industries; we are tackling the current downturn in apprenticeships and traineeship places with a wide range of additional and enhanced incentives to employers and trainees; we will maintain a comprehensive safety net of labour market programs, advisory systems and support structures for young people during periods of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us contrast that with what members of the Opposition propose. Under their Fightback package they will slash spending by $140m on the comprehensive set of safety net programs available under this Government; they will cut Jobstart wage subsidies by $62m; they will abolish the self-employment assistance program established by this Government; they will amalgamate the Commonwealth Employment Service with the Department of Social Security and contract out job placement services at commercial rates and, on top of that, they will charge a 15 per cent tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the clear contrast between the support being given by this Government and the denial of support that would arise under the policies put forward by the Opposition in the Fightback package. The Opposition objects to the $2.3 billion expenditure that this Government has advanced under the One Nation package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Worst of all, on top of that, is the assault on small business. In this country 75 per cent of jobs are with small business in the private sector. Small business will be slugged with the enormous burden of being tax collectors and maintaining paper records of every transaction under the goods and services tax for seven years. This means that, from 71,000 tax collectors under the wholesale sales tax system, we will go to a situation where something like two million organisations will be submitting GST returns. The cost of GST collection for the average small business will be of the order of 2 per cent. As a result of the Opposition's policy, the opportunities for small business to create jobs will be severely disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter of public importance exposes the hollowness of the Opposition when it talks about unemployment. The honourable member for Bennelong managed to say very little about unemployment and very little about creating jobs. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HH4">Mr JENKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report, the Committee's first on its inquiry into the prescription and supply of drugs, has had a long gestation. The inquiry was first referred in the last Parliament and its terms of reference were advertised in 1989. Unfortunately, after a good response to requests for written submissions, the inquiry was delayed by the dissolution of parliament in 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommencement of the inquiry in July 1990 saw yet more submissions and increased levels of interest evidenced by the receipt of more than 130 submissions from individuals, the pharmaceutical industry, the medical and pharmacy professions, State and Commonwealth Government bodies and consumer organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terms of reference of this inquiry are broad. The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) asked the Committee to inquire into and report on the legislative and regulatory framework and professional practices influencing prescribing, retailing, supply and consumption of pharmaceuticals; standards for distribution, promotion and marketing; and current information and education on appropriate drug use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The breadth of topics covered by the terms of reference has meant that, for the first time, all factors involved in the distribution and consumption of medicines have been looked at in a comprehensive way. Other inquiries and studies have examined individual components of the overall equation, but this is the first such inquiry to be conducted by the Federal Parliament and I believe that it has provided impetus for many recent changes in the pharmaceutical environment and will result in more developments if the Committee's recommendations are adopted by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the broad scope of the inquiry, the Committee determined that it would table three separate reports, each addressing selected aspects of the terms of reference. This, the first report, focuses on the current legislative and regulatory controls and responsibilities and standards which should apply to the promotion and marketing of pharmaceuticals. The second report will address the professional practices which influence prescribing and the range and quality of information and education on appropriate drug use as opposed to commercial promotion and marketing. The final report will examine the current legislative and regulatory controls and professional practices which influence the dispensing, retailing and supply of medicines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This investigation into prescription drugs is timely and complements other inquiries and developments being undertaken. In particular, the Trade Practices Commission has released its draft report on the self-regulation of promotion and advertising of therapeutic goods and the Committee is pleased to support the majority of the findings and recommendations contained in the draft report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the Community Affairs Committee does not consider that there is gross abuse of the self-regulatory powers of the industry, it has recommended that certain areas should be tightened up. In particular, there should be wider exposure of the complaints process and industry code of conduct and more transparency. The Committee has also recommended broader representation on the complaints subcommittee of the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association along with the imposition of stricter fines for breaches of the code of conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes that a greater proportion of financial resources should be spent on educational, as opposed to brand product, promotional advertising. To this end, we have recommended that pharmaceutical companies provide more information to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority about the amounts to be spent on promotional activities, including the proportion of their promotional expenditure which is devoted to independent medical education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee supports the preparation of ethical principles to assist professional organisations and, in particular, the medical profession in their dealings with the industry and has made a recommendation that ethical guidelines similar to those prepared by the Royal Australasian College of Physicians be developed by the AMA and other specialist colleges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other initiatives proposed by the Committee relate to the labelling on medicines. One of these, which is designed to assist health professionals and consumers and to encourage more informed drug use, is to make it mandatory that the generic name of a drug be placed on labels more prominently than the brand name. This should reduce confusion about which drug is being taken and minimise adverse effects brought about by taking multiple doses of the same drug unwittingly. The Committee has also made recommendations designed to prevent the obscuring of essential information on labels by pharmacists, and to simplify warning statements that appear on labels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, the Committee has recommended that, in order to minimise listing delays, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee meet more often and, if necessary, for longer periods than it does at present. Recommendations also call on the PBAC to make greater use of clinicians in particular disciplines when examining specialist drugs and to increase the overall specialist expertise of the PBAC by reviewing its current membership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comments and recommendations have also been made in relation to the use of cost effectiveness analysis as part of the evaluation process prior to listing drugs under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Such analysis should  provide a  better  basis  for  listing decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of consumer information the Committee has recommended that the therapeutic goods administration be responsible for approving and formally authorising information about drugs for use by consumers. This approved consumer information should be widely disseminated and available in a compendium for purchase by the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the final chapter of the report the Committee discusses the need for a national drug strategy. Rational drug use relies on a partnership and cooperation between the major interest groups; namely, the industry, health professionals, government and consumers. A feature of the first part of the inquiry was the conduct of a workshop over two days with representatives of these groups. One of the outcomes of this meeting was strong support for a national medicinal drug policy which should have four major components: a viable pharmaceutical industry, high quality products, equity of access and quality of use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a recent editorial for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Journal of Pharmacy</EMPHASIS>, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services reinforced these four key elements in a national drug policy. The Minister cited costs to the health system and to individuals resulting from the misuse of prescription drugs. The Committee has also heard anecdotal evidence about the costs to the health system of prescription drug misuse but very little in the way of hard data. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Approximately 40% of all drug related poisoning cases admitted to public hospitals (an estimated 20 000 people per year) are caused by the incorrect use of prescription medicines. It is estimated that between 30% and 80% of all people taking prescription medicines do not take them as directed. The full social and economic costs associated with the inappropriate use of medicines are immeasurable.</PARA>
<PARA>Some steps have been taken to address this problem. The Government's pharmaceutical education strategy, involving professionals and consumers, is grappling with the identification of major factors contributing to increased consumer awareness and more rational drug use. The Committee's report will assist in this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second and third reports on this inquiry will focus in more detail on the need for further education of health professionals and a more coordinated approach to health care in the area of prescription drugs. The Committee will investigate the limitations of drug therapy and the means of encouraging greater awareness of non-drug alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An inquiry of the magnitude of this present prescription drugs investigation requires the dedicated work of both the Committee members, which I am grateful that I have received throughout the inquiry, and the Committee secretariat. The Community Affairs Committee, like most other committees of this House, is ably assisted by the secretariat. I express my personal gratitude, and that of the Committee, to the Committee Secretary, Bjarne Nordin, for his fine efforts throughout the conduct of this inquiry. He has received valuable research assistance from James Catchpole and administrative and secretarial support from Shirley Hunter. Their work is also of a high standard and appreciated by the Committee. The Committee looks forward to the concluding two stages of this important inquiry and thanks all those who have been so cooperative in our deliberations to this stage.

I also present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Chile and Venezuela in October 1991. This, of course, was the delegation which attended the Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference in Chile. I think it should be noted by the House again that the Australian delegation played a major role in the conference of the IPU.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Speaker, the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Leo McLeay), is chairman of the Australian group, a member of the International Executive Committee of the IPU and a member of the Inter-Parliamentary Council. That meant that much of his time at the conference was spent in the very important executive meetings that took place. Equally, I am a representative of the IPU on the Committee for Human Rights of Parliamentarians and also the committee examining and monitoring the situation in Cyprus. That took up most of my time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It ought to be noted by the House that under IPU rules only one supplementary item can be dealt with at each conference, and the supplementary item was furnished through the Australian Parliament by the IPU Executive. It was no small matter, in the very fierce competition that took place, to get the item which was of concern to the delegation and to this Parliament up for debate at the IPU conference. The item dealt with was the role of parliaments in supporting efforts to achieve a greater liberalisation of international trade, in particular through a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although there was some very strong support for that resolution from some of the developing nations, particularly our host countries and countries from Central America, one is bound to express the view that, particularly in many of the preliminary negotiations, while there was a general endorsement in principle, when some of the older nation states of Europe in particular were giving support to the proposition, it was support on the basis that everybody else got onto the equal playing field but them, thank you very much. One has to say that one feels that the equal playing field is becoming an increasingly lonely place for any nation state to venture onto. Nevertheless, I think the debate that took place urged support for a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round. To that extent, I think the general policies that have been advocated within the Parliament were advanced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be remiss of me if I did not mention the very real work done with women parliamentarians by our two female delegates, who again distinguished themselves. I note the permanent delegate from the Opposition, who has laboured tirelessly over a period of time amongst the women parliamentarians, often without the reward which should be her due. Nevertheless, our two delegates working together produced a major change to rules. I will leave it to them to inform the House of the details of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Chile it was refreshing to see the enthusiasm that existed in all sections of society for the emergence of parliamentary democracy and their concern to make it work. That does not mean that all their problems have been solved. General Pinochet is still a figure in the political scene. Nevertheless, one could not help feeling wherever one went that there was a commitment and a concern to see that parliamentary democracy did not fail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the fact that the IPU conference took place in Chile will assist the strengthening of the foundations of parliamentary democracy in that country. The Ministers we as a delegation visited made it very clear that they see themselves as part of the South Pacific region. They hope to play a part in that region and they look forward to closer relationships with Australia at both a political and an economic level. I believe we have established a base from which those ties can be strengthened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Venezuela, the delegation spent a great deal of time discussing the possibility of Australian companies investing in joint venture arrangements. At one stage we found ourselves advocating, as a delegation, the role of a major Australian mineral exploration company in a very important development that could take place in Venezuela. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to finish on this note: in the past the delegation has had cause to complain about what we felt was insufficient support from our embassy staff, but on this occasion one could only be full of praise for the efforts of our newly arrived Ambassador in Chile. Nothing was too much trouble and he gave the delegation his fullest support and all of the backup which was possible in that situation. On behalf of the delegation, I would like to record our thanks to the Australian Ambassador, Mr Mathew Peake. The same can also be said for our Australian ambassadorial representation in Venezuela. Dr and Mrs De Stoop not only welcomed the delegation but also made very considerable efforts to assist us in our work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One should also point out that often it is not recognised that the presence of a parliamentary delegation visiting Ministers of nation states can also prove quite beneficial for ambassadors, particularly new ambassadors. The presence of a parliamentary delegation and its visits to Ministers opens up a whole range of connections which make life a lot easier and facilitate the kind of communication that newly arrived ambassadors often find difficult to obtain in a new situation. To that extent, I think the important relationship between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and this Parliament deserves much closer scrutiny. We undoubtedly benefited from the experience and the efforts that were made by our ambassadorial representatives, but I am pleased to say that I think they felt they obtained considerable benefits too.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say by way of explanation at the beginning that the reason I have not sought leave to speak on the report of the delegation's visit to Chile and Venezuela is that I was not part of that delegation. I of course had the opportunity to participate, as a member of the delegation to the IPU; however, for personal reasons I found it not possible to participate in that delegation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to a couple of particular items in relation to Australia's participation in this IPU conference. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) has mentioned that Australia has been successful in gaining a rule change in relation to the composition of drafting committees for IPU conferences. Australia agreed, on behalf of a meeting of women parliamentarians in Uruguay 18 months ago&mdash;12 months earlier than the conference that we are referring to now&mdash;to undertake to try to get a rule change to require that when compiling the membership of drafting committees there should be some regard to female participation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significance of this is that items are debated in the plenum but the motion that the conference will vote on in the end is thrashed out behind closed doors by a small drafting committee which usually consists of, at most, a dozen people&mdash;it is sometimes smaller. It is at that point that the critical participation is made. There was a feeling amongst the women parliamentarians that on some issues particular dimensions were being overlooked by drafting committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is possible to amend the draft resolution when it is considered again by the whole committee of the conference; but in fact changes of substance are rarely made at that stage. It may be that something which a country or group of countries has tried to get into the draft resolution at the drafting committee stage but failed will be attempted again when it comes back to the whole committee, but I do not know of a single instance where that has actually succeeded. I know of only minor changes to the draft resolutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No change can be proposed when it comes back for debate by the Inter-Parliamentary Council unless that change has already been proposed in the committee. The chances are that if it is rejected at the committee stage it will not be accepted at the Council stage, so in fact amendments are very rarely carried through to the Council. Therefore, drafting committees become very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the reason that the meeting of women parliamentarians in Uruguay in 1990 gave this matter some priority. It was agreed that Australia, on behalf of the women, would investigate ways of getting the rule changed. The delegation brought this matter back to this Parliament's group of the Inter-Parliamentary Union and it received its total support. A rule change was drafted and went forward. I had the honour of presenting this rule change at the plenum meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Council and it was passed unanimously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very simple change which I think bears a little explanation. It adds the words `and gender' to a clause which now reads, `Its composition shall take into account equitable geographical distribution and political and gender balance'. I read that out in order to point out that there is already a number of considerations concerning the balance of drafting committees and it is not unreasonable to add that extra dimension of gender. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the opportunity, together with the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), who was a Government member of this delegation, to participate in the pre-conference of women parliamentarians which was held on the Sunday before the conference opened on the Monday morning. I think it was a very successful conference. It gave the women members of parliament an opportunity to meet with one another. This is such a large conference that there are not many opportunities for getting to know other members of the delegations from all countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women members of parliament typically constitute between 15 to 20 per cent of the delegates to an Inter-Parliamentary Union conference. However, they make up a much smaller percentage of the Inter-Parliamentary Council. The Inter-Parliamentary Council comprises the leader and deputy leader of each country's delegation. As the Opposition's permanent member on the delegation for the life of this Parliament, that automatically makes me deputy leader of the delegation and means that I am a voting member of the Inter-Parliamentary Council. Whilst women may constitute as much as 20 per cent of the delegates, the percentage of the Inter-Parliamentary Council which is female is very low indeed. I would not care to hazard a guess, but I am sure it is less than 5 per cent. So the women have very little voting power, in practical terms, in the Inter-Parliamentary Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore very important to have that pre-meeting of women parliamentarians because it gives them an opportunity to get together, to share their views and to make sure that those women who do have a say in other councils of the Inter-Parliamentary Union are familiar with the views and can speak on behalf of women as a whole where it is relevant. It was relevant in relation to another matter, which I intend to raise later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has already referred to the matter of the supplementary item on trade and the Uruguay Round which was put forward by Australia. We worked very hard to get that item up as the supplementary item for debate and discussion&mdash;that is, supplementary to the two items that were listed already on the agenda. It is worth saying that that item received an outstanding vote from the delegations voting one by one. As I recall, three items were put forward to fill that slot and Australia's suggestion was a very clear winner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to add one other comment to those already made by honourable member for Melbourne Ports in relation to the Europeans. I think it should also be noted that there was an amount of professed support for the item from some other countries&mdash;notably some Asian countries&mdash;which did not have delegates present to vote when it was actually voted on. In fact, delegates deliberately absented themselves at that moment so that when the name of that country was called out there was no-one there to respond on behalf of the country and to indicate how the delegation would be voting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was a little disappointing, but we live and learn. I suppose that is the way of international politics, and particularly international trade. Nevertheless, I think it is fair to say that it was a very remarkable success for Australia that we got the support we did from the conference. That was done only as a result of a large amount of extremely hard work and a lot of leg work and talking by members of the delegation doing the usual numbers exercise. I think it really paid off in the end. We got support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to raise one other matter, and that is the proposal that Australia made for an item to be placed on the agenda for the forthcoming conference in Yaounde, Cameroon. The Australian delegation had agreed to propose to this conference in Chile that the matter of AIDS was an appropriate subject for the conference in Cameroon. That was for a number of reasons, not the least of which being the conference is to be in Africa and the matter of AIDS is such a dramatic problem in Africa, as indeed it is in all countries and particularly developing countries. The extent of its spread in Africa is well known. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the Australian delegation, and with its support, I proposed this matter to the women's conference to seek the support of women delegates for advocating that their delegations support listing this item for the eighty-seventh conference. The item received that support from the women MPs. It was also proposed at the meeting of the Asia Pacific group, of which Australia is a member, and received support there. Indeed, I was very pleasantly surprised at the strength of the support from China in particular. I notice that the Minister at the table, the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Ms Fatin), indicates she was surprised by that, too. One is used to China having an image of being rather prudish on the subject of sex, and certainly that has been borne out by my time in China in attempting to discuss matters of birth control and family planning with the Chinese. So it really was not a quarter from which I expected strong support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chinese delegate made a statement which has really rung in my ears ever since in strongly supporting the proposal that AIDS should be discussed at the next conference. He expressed his belief that in AIDS it was possible that we are actually witnessing the beginning of the end of the human race. That is a very strong and startling statement to make. Those who have familiarised themselves with the pattern of the spread of AIDS will now be aware that it is no longer seen as the disease of homosexuals and intravenous drug users. People might, through misfortune, get it from attending to victims of trauma, dentists may get it or people may get it from tainted blood transfusions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the spread through women from heterosexual sex and the consequent spread to the next generation&mdash;the very large number of children who have been born world wide and are HIV positive at birth&mdash;is a very, very worrying and daunting prospect. I have seen estimates that by the end of this century at least 10 million women will have acquired AIDS through heterosexual sex, and there may be as many as 40 million AIDS orphans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I digress. As I said, the comments by the delegate from China in that context really are very pertinent comments. There was also support for the idea in informal conversations with people from quite a number of other countries, particularly African and eastern European countries. I certainly did not canvass all the delegations, but a number of countries indicated support for it. However, it did not get support from 12-plus, who really did not want to talk about it at all. There was another item going forward on the environment, and it was decided that they would support that item. The alternative of a matter relating to AIDS was put forward but not debated. In fact, on one occasion when I attempted to debate it I found it impossible to get recognition from the Chair&mdash;who, by the way, was a woman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the event it was not supported by the executive of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, and essentially it failed because it was not supported by 12-plus. The 12-plus group was originally a group of western European style democracies. It was the countries of the European Community plus like-minded democracies such as Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Canada. It is becoming now overwhelmingly a European group. Australia and New Zealand do play a full role, and I know we get good support from a number of other countries and delegates, but I feel increasingly it is developing into a European group. There are those who would be quite happy to see our role in 12-plus downgraded in the future. However, not daunted, not deterred, we are going to have another go on that item at the forthcoming conference in Yaounde. We are going to try to get it up as a supplementary item. I do not know whether we have any hope, given that it was not supported by the executive. I think it is certainly worth a try because, as I said, there is some quite broad based support for the worth of debating that issue and looking at what parliaments cooperating world wide might be able to achieve against the spread of the disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I want to say a word on Australian participation. Certainly in my time of going to IPU conferences our level of participation has been high. It was particularly noteworthy this time because of the success in getting the supplementary item up. Australia participated in two out of three of the drafting committees. The leader of the delegation, Mr Speaker McLeay, was our nominal representative on the drafting committee on the supplementary item. I am aware that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports also participated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In what was referred to as the second item on the agenda&mdash;namely, human development, economic growth and democracy and the role of parliaments in ensuring necessary links between freedoms, citizens' involvement, economic growth and social investments, which has a very particular relevance to parliaments&mdash;I had the honour of representing the Asia-Pacific group. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports was also a member of the Committee on the Violations of Human Rights of Parliamentarians and put a great deal of time into that extremely important committee as well as the committee on Cyprus, to which he has already referred. The Speaker is, of course, a member of the executive committee of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia plays a very active role in both 12-plus and the Asia Pacific groups. It is pleasing to see that the Asia Pacific group is becoming a more cohesive group and is starting to exercise a little more clout in the Inter-Parliamentary Union. Its lack of clout in the past has not been because of the lack of importance of its members, but basically lack of coordination and organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a personal note I would like to thank the secretary to the delegation, John Dyer; Wendy Barnes, who is a member of the Speaker's staff; and Bill Nelson from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, who travelled with us. I would thank John and Wendy for their assistance, and Bill for his assistance and advice as a foreign affairs officer. With the level of participation of the delegation at this conference they were spread very thin. They worked extremely hard and they did an absolutely excellent job. I would also like to thank the Parliamentary Library staff and other Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officers who gave us excellent briefs to enable us to acquit ourselves, as I hope, very creditably on behalf of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found the conference extremely useful, not only because of the contribution of the Australia delegation and the response from something like 110 countries, but also one has that opportunity provided to one to participate in the debate that is going on constantly and also in the debate that occurs after a meeting is finished. I found that very enlightening. I also join both the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and the honourable member for Moncrieff in complimenting the staff which we took with us. It was extremely important to a person such as myself to have that first opportunity with respect to what should happen, what one is supposed to do and how one is to take one's part in the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moncrieff, as well as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, has mentioned also the supplementary item and I would like to compliment the Speaker, too, in putting that item forward. It is very important to realise that when the vote was taken some 814 voted for that supplementary item, 89 voted against it and 219 abstained. I think it was a tremendous victory for Australia, not only to have that brought to the forefront as a supplementary item but also in the time of the Uruguay Round that was going on to bring forward the concerns of our country with respect to what is happening in that area of trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the very successful completion of that IPU conference, we were then provided with the opportunity both by the Chilean Government and the Venezuelan Government to meet with their parliamentarians and Ministers and, most importantly, to see part of their country, and particularly to look at the areas that we as Australia and Australians could possible be involved with in trade. I was impressed with the Chilean open economy and certainly in seeing what has now happened to that country, after what we had read previously about the Pinochet regime, and how Chile has now brought itself out of what could only be described as a reign of terror to where it is now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also had the opportunity, with Wendy Barns, to visit a mission run by Father Tim, who was actually born in Bourke, New South Wales, and see the work that is being achieved with the people in his particular area. I was very impressed by our Embassies and their staffs&mdash;the courtesy, the help, the knowledge that they had, not only of the country but of all of the matters that we were putting to them both from the trading aspect, the government aspect and the parliamentary side. It was very informative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly impressed, too, in Venezuela. I suppose that when one looks at the economy there, one sees that what should have been such a rich nation has experienced problems. We saw so many of their farmers giving up the land and coming into the cities. We saw overwhelming poverty at times that should not have happened if, perhaps, the inflation rate was not running at the 30 per cent that it was and if, perhaps, a little bit more care were given to the housing and the needs of those people. I am not trying to be rude in being critical of the country, but I found it, I suppose, inspiring in the fact that we in Australia are so terribly fortunate because not only the type of government that we have but also the  structure that we have in place in this country which assists and helps so many people who are in need through no fault of their own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I would like to express my thanks to the Speaker, to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports as the permanent delegate and to the honourable member for Moncrieff as the opposition delegate for the assistance and help that they gave both to me and to Senator Bill O'Chee, who was the other new member to go on that particular delegation. I believe that the reports which are now written and tabled in this Parliament will always be something that I will keep because, while one remembers things, from the copious notes which were taken at the time by John Dyer&mdash;and I now see how he has put them together with the assistance of his staff into these reports&mdash;I  can appreciate what we have achieved over that period of time. I again thank the Parliament and my fellow delegates who gave me the opportunity of participating in the conference, and I hope that I am able to add to many more in years to come. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill, seeking appropriation of some $204m, is introduced to accommodate special circumstances arising from the Government's statement on the economy and employment last November and the recent One Nation statement and to ensure continuity of funding for other important Government initiatives. The Bill addresses only three items of expenditure&mdash;labour market program assistance to job seekers and industry, residential care for older people and child-care fee relief&mdash;continuity of which the Government considers cannot be jeopardised by the timing of the availability of funds being dependent upon passage of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1991-92 through the Parliament. To await passage of that Bill in the normal course of events would place severe hardship on many individuals, companies and charitable organisations. This is not the Government's intent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, payments for these measures are required in a timeframe which, on the basis of current estimates, cannot be accommodated by the Advance to the Minister for Finance whilst awaiting passage of the Additional Estimates. Put another way this Bill principally deals with the timing of payments for these key Government programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In light of the appropriations being sought in this Bill I would now foreshadow my intention to move an amendment to Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1991-92 at the proper time in order to remove from that Bill reference to additional appropriations for these programs. The relevant portfolio program performance statements provided in connection with that Bill will be amended to reflect the changed appropriation arrangements. In that regard, by seeking Parliament's agreement to accelerate separately the appropriations required for these three programs, the Government is responding to the urgency of needs that cannot await passage of the other Additional Estimates in the normal course. I recognise that the Senate, through its Estimates committees, will exercise its customary scrutiny over the range of Government programs in the course of considering Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1991-92. I turn now to the specific programs:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's labour market assistance to job seekers and industry is aimed at assisting the unemployed retain their skills and links with the work force, which is particularly crucial at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government announced an increase of $71m in the program for 1991-92 in the November economy and employment statement and a further $11m net has been provided in the One Nation statement. Smaller increases in related programs, totalling $5m, result in a total appropriation now being sought in this Bill of some $87m, which will be removed from Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1991-92 as I noted earlier. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Residential Care for Older People</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's residential care for older people program is directed to ensuring that aged and disabled people who are assessed as being unable to live at home have available to them residential support and care appropriate to their needs. As part of the program, grants are made to religious, charitable and other organisations to defray the cost of capital works. An amount of $50m is proposed in this Bill, reflecting a faster path to construction for approvals given. My foreshadowed amendment to Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1991-92 will remove an equivalent amount from that Bill. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Child-care Fee Relief</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's child-care program assists families with dependant children to participate in the work force and the general community by ensuring child-care is affordable for low and middle income families and by improving the supply and quality of child-care. As part of the program, fee relief payments are provided quarterly in advance to service providers to defray the costs of child-care for low and middle income families. This program, unlike the majority of initiatives where individual entitlements are met from standing appropriations, is currently funded through the annual appropriation mechanism. In light of the entitlement nature of the program the Government is considering in the longer term whether to establish a standing appropriation for the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appropriation sought in this Bill, some $67m, largely reflects an increase in the average amount per place for fee relief since the Budget Estimates were derived and a higher than expected number of child-care places being available in 1991-92. I propose amending Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1991-92 to delete some $43m sought for this program in that Bill. The additional amount of some $24m sought in this Bill reflects updated calculation of the amount required, undertaken since preparation of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to emphasise again that this Bill seeks to provide appropriations for programs to ensure eligible individuals and organisations are not disadvantaged and placed in a position of hardship pending passage of the Additional Estimates Bills. We have brought forward a specific Appropriation Bill rather than proposing an increase in the Advance to the Minister for Finance to fund these programs pending passage of the Additional Estimates. By taking this path the proposed appropriations can be scrutinised by Parliament prospectively. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During Question Time I was asked a question by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) who referred to a statement I made at a press conference on 16 December in relation to the impact of the Opposition's Fightback package on monetary policy. He claimed that I had misled that audience and the nation by claiming that this would lead to a tightening of monetary policy when I had advice from Treasury to the opposite effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quickly state the facts. A document was referred to by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, which was in a group of documents subject to freedom of information action by the Opposition&mdash;document 21. That Treasury document of 2 December was addressed to Dr Parkinson of the Treasurer's office, which was prior to the time that I became Treasurer. However, I do not wish to make anything in particular out of that, but that document did not arrive while I was the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document sought to model the Opposition package to some extent through the Murphy model. It attempted to model the main components of the tax and expenditure cuts outlined in Fightback, assuming that the Opposition's claims were correct. In other words, it was assumed that there would be a one-off increase in inflation of about 5 per cent and that there would be no flow on to wages. That was a quite crucial assumption which was spelt out quite clearly in the document. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">monetary policy has been set to allow a one off increase in consumer price inflation of around 5 per cent in the year of implementation of GST. No direct wage flow-ons are allowed.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, this was the Opposition assumption. The document continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">these monetary policy and wage assumptions are critical in the simulations&mdash;ie the results (especially in the short-run) are sensitive to the assumed behaviour of monetary policy and wage outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA>Subsequently, looking at the key features of the tax mix in applying the Murphy model in this somewhat limited way to the Opposition Fightback package, on page 2 of the attachment it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Money supply was increased by 3.7 per cent to the initial one off increase in the price level associated with the introduction of the GST.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Adjustments were made to the wage equation residuals in order to discount wage increases for the direct inflationary impact of the GST.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the model was throwing up higher wage increases and Treasury actively went back and took those wage increases out because, under the Opposition's policy, they were assumed not to occur or to have any effect on wages through the introduction of the GST. The Treasury was trying to be faithful to that assumption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole point of the comments that I made in the press conference of 16 December was that that assumption was not one which the Government shared. It did not believe that it was a realistic assumption. The Government believed that, if the GST were introduced, there would then be a flow on of further wage increases, particularly in the context of there not having been adequate compensation paid to wage and salary earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that should be mentioned in this context is that at the time Treasury did this modelling it did not have available to it its own analysis of the revenue side of the Fightback package; nor did it have the finance modelling of the expenditure side of the package. All that information was available by the time I held the press conference. That meant that the assumptions made about the impact of fiscal policy were quite different from the reality of the package once those changes had been made and the $4 billion shortfall was built into the system. The substantial swingaround in fiscal policy, the relaxation of fiscal policy in year two, the year of introduction of the GST, was not factored in to anything like the degree that it should have been by Treasury when it undertook the model, as reported on 2 December. It simply had not done the work at that time to factor that in. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Mutual Assistance in Business Regulation Bill 1992 establishes machinery to allow Australian business regulators to assist foreign business regulators by obtaining evidence, information and the production of documents. It deals with the domestic arrangements to be put in place in Australia for our regulators to assist overseas regulators. It does not deal with situations where foreign business regulators will be requested to assist Australian business regulators. Clearly, however, the substantial part of the object of this Bill is to cooperate with foreign regulators so that they will reciprocate and cooperate with requests that our regulators make to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last 18 months I have had the opportunity to discuss cooperation between Australian business regulators and regulators in the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and regulators in the United Kingdom, the Securities and Investment Board. In those discussions, the issue of cooperation has been raised with me: from their point of view, they would like information concerning the dealings of particular people in Australia; from our point of view we would like information concerning the particular dealings of people in their countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regulators can profit clearly from cooperation. Modern technology and communications have made it easy to deal across international borders, to invest, to sell and to trade. It is possible to buy shares in Australian companies not only in Melbourne or Sydney but also in London and sometimes in New York. It is possible to move prices on domestic stock exchanges through moving prices in foreign exchanges, and that is as old as the Poseidon boom of the late 1960s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deregulation of financial markets and the movement of foreign currency have obviously also made such dealings easier to undertake; and, indeed, such activity should be undertaken. There is no reason why Australia should quarantine its financial markets; there is no reason why we should quarantine foreign investment; and there is no reason why our companies should be quarantined from investing overseas. But, where the possibility arises that some of those investments or trades might breach overseas laws, we should cooperate in law enforcement. Where Australian companies breach Australian laws by dealings in foreign parts of the world, we would seek foreign cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is to be successful law enforcement, we must have the capacity to follow transactions wherever they go and, having followed them, to receive information which is admissible in Australian courts. The interesting thing about this particular Bill is that it is directed at providing assistance to foreign regulators who seek information but not for the purposes of criminal proceedings. That is made clear in clause 6 where, before a Commonwealth regulator can deal with a request for cooperation, the Commonwealth regulator must secure an undertaking that the information or evidence will not be used for criminal proceedings or for the imposition of a penalty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill is directed towards securing information to be used, presumably, for civil purposes by foreign regulators. Of course, foreign regulators will in many cases be seeking assistance and information to assist in relation to criminal proceedings. I assume that that will be dealt with either under a complementary Act which has already been in existence&mdash;the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987&mdash;or on another basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to bear in mind that this Bill and the machinery set up for it predicated on an undertaking being given that the information will not be used for the purposes of criminal proceedings. Indeed, the machinery set up by this Bill is to call in a particular person and obtain information, documents or evidence. The Bill is not dealing with the situation where one of our regulators will, for example, just be passing across items on the public record&mdash;such as company returns and so on&mdash;to a corresponding agency in another country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, that kind of exchange of information will have to be done through a memorandum of understanding between the regulators concerned. This Bill will not take away the obligation we have to secure such memorandums of understanding, which we will have to secure to get foreign cooperation back here into Australia. I urge the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) to keep working on such memorandums of understanding and bilateral agreements to secure cooperation for Australian regulators from agencies overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system set up by this particular Bill is that a request will be made to an Australian business regulator and the undertaking will be sought and given. The Australian regulator&mdash;which, as far as I am concerned, will probably be the Australian Securities Commission and the Trade Practices Commission; there may be others but I imagine they would be the two principal ones&mdash;is then required to take into account certain particular matters and form a decision. If after taking into account those particular matters it believes that the request should be complied with, the matter is then passed on to the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matters that the Australian business regulator is to take into account are such matters as: whether it is likely to be able to obtain the information; the cost of obtaining it; whether the foreign regulator could get material from another source; the degree to which the functions of the Australian regulator correspond with those of the foreign regulator; whether the foreign regulator making the request would be likely to comply with a similar request by the Commonwealth regulator; and whether the matter should be handled under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Australian regulator comes to the conclusion after taking all those matters into account that the request should be complied with, the request then moves on to the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General takes into account another series of statutory factors such as: the national interest; international law; whether the material could be used for punishing a person for an offence of a political character or whether it could be used for punishing a person on the basis of race, sex, religion or political opinion. Those matters are set out in clause 8(2). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One matter not set out specifically in clause 8(2)&mdash;and I think consideration should be given to setting it out&mdash;is whether the foreign regulator has complied with conditions or undertakings imposed in relation to any previous supply of information. It seems to me that is a matter which should be specifically taken into account. If one is going to put conditions and undertakings on the supply of information, then presumably one should take into account in some way whether they have been complied with before dealing with another request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General may say, `I can take anything into account that I consider relevant and I would consider that relevant, so there is no need to put it in the legislation'. However, certain matters have been specifically spelt out, presumably to direct the attention of the Minister to make sure that he does take them into account and consider them. It seems to me that the Bill could be improved by making it clear. After all, the only way one is going to be able to enforce these conditions and undertakings is by holding over the heads of the foreign regulators the prospect that, if they do not comply this time, they are never going to get cooperation next time. There is no other practical way of securing compliance with undertakings and conditions. I would think that would be a matter to be specifically taken into account by the Attorney-General when he makes his decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the request has got through the Commonwealth business regulator and the Attorney-General, the Commonwealth business regulator can take evidence. The way in which that is done is that, under clause 10, the Commonwealth regulator serves a written notice requiring the person to give information, to produce documents or to appear. It has been raised with me that, as an element of fairness in giving that written notice, something should be said about what the request is and what the request relates to. It would not be sufficient, for example, just to say, `Come in and bring all your documents with you and get ready to answer some questions. The regulator in Panama has been on to us'. As a matter of fairness that written notice should say, `We have received a request from X. They are investigating in relation to Y. They seek documents that may relate to it in the following way'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be that the rules of natural justice themselves will require that to be set out in the written notice, although I would not take that as necessarily the case by reason of the way in which the legislation is put. I raise that again not only for the attention of the Attorney-General but also for the attention of the Australian business regulator. When giving notice, I think in all fairness the notice should say what the matter relates to and give some kinds of particulars as to why the particular person is being called in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to refer to another part of the legislation which fills me with some qualms. A protection against self-incrimination is set out in clause 14, but I notice that it does not include what we know as derivative use immunity. Presumably that is because a Bill is coming forward tomorrow to abolish derivative use immunity in relation to Australian domestic law and there is harmonisation. I must say that I have severe qualms about that and I will elaborate on them tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The privilege against self-incrimination is an old and an ancient one. When we whittle down the privilege against self-incrimination, as is proposed in a Bill to be debated tomorrow, and as is in this particular Bill, we should do so only with extreme caution and great care. Parliament is here to consider always the rights of the citizen. The rights of an individual&mdash;ancient, historical rights&mdash;include a privilege against self-incrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rights of individuals also include the right to be protected against corporate fraud. That is why it is such a tricky balance to strike. Rights cut both ways in a question like this. It is up to the Parliament to balance those rights. We will be debating those issues tomorrow, and I will save my powder, as it were, for tomorrow to discuss that in more detail. I wish to raise that particularly in relation to clause 14. I think it is necessary for Australian business regulators to cooperate with foreign business regulators. It is necessary to have a system in which that can be done where rights are protected. It is necessary to show good faith if we are, in turn, to receive good faith from foreign regulators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I have an overall criticism of this Bill, it is that I consider the procedure to be rather cumbersome. It is at least a two-stage process. First of all, a Commonwealth business regulator has to go through matters and then the Attorney-General has to go through matters as well. I know that the Attorney-General will be able to apply considerations that the Commonwealth business regulator would not, considerations such as the national interest. But it is cumbersome and I wonder whether it reflects a tension in our general business regulation areas, that is, the tension between where the line for the agency stops and where the responsibility for the Department starts. In this case, both the regulatory agency and the Department are involved. Some duplication will be involved and I think it may cause some diverting of resources, as it were, in the Attorney-General's Department to look at this, but we will have to monitor as time goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the whole, the Bill has much to commend it. The Opposition will support it. We raise these matters in the debate as matters to be looked at. Some will have to be looked at in the ongoing evaluation as to whether the machinery works. I do not think anybody should be wedded to this particular machinery for ever. I do not think the Attorney-General is. It is a start. It is something that will have to be reviewed. I will reiterate that, regardless of putting in place this machinery, it seems to me that if we are to secure cooperation from foreign regulators, we have to continue to pursue on a bilateral basis memorandums of understanding, and I hope they are pursued with all the vigour that can be mustered from the Attorney-General's Department and the other departments concerned. </PARA>

May I say that I find some commonality with the honourable member on his views about the need to monitor continually the machinery of this process in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill is, of course, a necessary and sensible move towards international cooperation and assistance in administering and enforcing foreign business laws. The global business structure is continuing to transmute with the increasing irrelevance of geographical and political boundaries. As that internationalisation of the financial markets proceeds, the possibility of undesirable market practices swells and casts an unsavoury shadow over the integrity of markets. If the effectiveness of the changes is to be maintained and community confidence inspired, governments must allow global cooperation with information sharing as a priority. It is no longer a viable alternative to stick our heads in the sand of the past. As the Opposition has already acknowledged in this instance, it does not believe that we can do so either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The object of this Bill is to enable Commonwealth regulators to render assistance to foreign regulators in their administration or enforcement of business laws by obtaining from persons relevant information, documents and evidence and transmitting such information and evidence and copies of such documents to foreign regulators. Mutual assistance is an important aspect in the internationalisation process which this nation is undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to attain this Government's goal of being an internationally competitive country that continues to strive for world best performance and provides equal opportunity for all citizens, we must all be willing to cooperate and mutually support our international colleagues in their endeavours. By encouraging this outward looking orientation we will be moving towards a more competitive and efficient economy which will benefit our nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deregulation of the financial markets, like any newborn, has, of course, gone through some faltering steps before it has gained its balance and contributed greater productivity and competitiveness to our economy. If this momentum is to be maintained, there must be a move towards a cooperative relationship which is embedded in the mechanism of the regulatory institutions. This can be obtained through the legislative process. Importantly, the objective of mutual assistance and business regulation can be obtained without significant financial impact. Existing resources of the Australian agencies will be used, with any additional costs being adequately offset by the advantage of reciprocal assistance from their overseas counterparts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main agencies which will be involved in this information sharing process is the Australian Securities Commission, which was set up by this Government for the regulation of companies and of the securities and futures markets in Australia. The Commission was designed as part of the overall strategy to meet the needs of the Australian economy in the 1990s and, in particular, it provides public accountability, legislative responsibility and administrative responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefits of such a commission are, in the light of this Bill, worth reflecting on for a moment: a single substantive law for all matters governing corporate, futures and securities activities; accountability to a single Minister and Parliament; uniformity of administration through a single administrative unit with Australia-wide coverage; and a uniform administrative law regime. This is just one of the policy initiatives this Government has introduced, and the Bill before us tonight can be seen in that light. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission, like its international counterparts, focuses on reinstating certainty in the domestic markets and regaining confidence in the international arena. Confidence is a vital component in the internationalisation process. If confidence is to be maintained it is necessary to promote an uncompromised market. Undesirables must be kept out of the market and, due to the interdependent nature of an internationalised system, it is important to inform and be informed of any possible dangers to that integrity of the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, information sharing exists under voluntary ad hoc arrangements but there is a need to enhance the level of assistance between agencies by developing the right legal structures so as to provide a capacity for those various agencies to gather compulsory information on behalf of another agency in the appropriate case. The need for this mutual cooperation has been heralded internationally. The International Organisation of Securities Commissions in recognition of the impact of internationalisation on the enforcement of domestic securities and futures laws adopted a resolution as far back as 1986 calling for its member organisations to provide reciprocal assistance in obtaining information in respect of market oversight and prevention of fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This view was supported by the final communique of the Commonwealth law Ministers meeting in Auckland in 1990, and by the OECD. In Auckland the meeting noted that the voluntary cooperation needed to be reinforced by legislative provisions. The OECD believed that information sharing would meet the need for ensuring appropriate regulation of financial conglomerates. Consequently, the Mutual Assistance in Business Regulation Bill represents an acknowledgment of and response to the internationally foreseen need for legislated reciprocal assistance between the world's regulatory agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition to these progressive proposals may arise as to the problem of protecting persons providing assistance and privacy considerations. However, safeguards have been put in place to ensure propriety in obtaining information, and of course it is incumbent upon us all to continually monitor that. Appearances will be in private with the legislation, under clause 11, limiting the number of persons being present when a person is giving evidence. It states:</PARA>

It will be able to take account of the different structures and the varying types of agencies involved in the business regulation, ranging from overseas jurisdictions having regulatory commissions with policing functions to those jurisdictions where the regulatory system is based on a concept of self-regulation. In particular, because of the need to act quickly in a fast moving market system, the scheme is designed to ensure that assistance can be provided quickly and with a minimum of procedural formalities appropriate to the circumstances of a particular request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation has been designed to give optimum benefits with minimal financial impact in an administratively simple and flexible regime for collecting the information. The merit of this legislation is also enhanced by the safeguards which have been introduced to protect persons giving evidence from self-incrimination and will preserve legal professional privilege as well as allowing legal representation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government is trying to approach the need for economic and regulatory reforms to promote an international level of efficiency and competitiveness in a systematic and complementary manner. This present legislation will complement the scheme for assistance in criminal matters which is embodied in the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987. The legislation will allow our regulatory agencies, such as the Australian Securities Commission and the Trade Practices Commission, to operate more effectively and have a greater capacity to protect our markets and foreign markets from fraud and allegations of disrepute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefits of this Bill are self-evident. Not only does it strengthen the integrity of Australia's financial system but it enhances the integrity of both our own and the international financial market. It is an integral step in the Government's overall plan to rationalise the collection and sharing of information and evidence and to promote our willingness to cooperate with our international colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I encourage the House to support the Bill and, in doing so, to help move Australia closer to its place in the international market. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I thank the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch) for his contribution to the debate. It is an area in which he shows a considerable interest. He outlined the objects behind the Mutual Assistance in Business Regulation Bill and what it is going to do in some detail. I thank him for his interest in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) also made a constructive contribution, with a couple of bleeps, one being in relation to what I think we would refer to as the two-stage process, that is, the role of the regulatory agency and the role of the Attorney-General. Just at the end of the honourable member's contribution, and I think this is worth touching on, he somehow seemed to see that as reflecting in some way the tensions between the Attorney-General's Department and/or the Attorney-General and the regulator. That is something that I think is worrying the honourable member for Higgins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only say to him that there is not that tension that he refers to from time to time. Sometimes these things can become a bit obsessional. I think it is worth mentioning that there is not that intention, and it is certainly not the reason&mdash;irrespective of what the honourable member for Higgins may think&mdash;why the legislation is framed in this way. This is not the first time that criticism has been made in the sense of the way the Bill is structured. It has been said, for example, that criticism can be directed at the Bill primarily on the ground that it is overly restrictive, and especially that the regime it establishes will not be acceptable to some overseas agencies such as, in particular, the United States Securities Exchange Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That criticism went along the lines that, because there was a two-stage process in that both&mdash;as the honourable member for Higgins indicated&mdash;the ASC and the Attorney-General have a role in deciding whether the request for assistance should be granted, the process was too slow and complex. I do not think that happens at all. In fact, the ASCs role quite clearly relates very specifically to operational matters. The request would be made in the first instance to the regulatory agency, and that agency would assess the request having regard to a number of factors. It would take into account the cost of the collection of the information and the likelihood of the country requesting it acceding to a similar request from an Australian agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, those matters that are taken into account by the agency are operational. It is not a matter of doubling up in the sense that seems to be a concern to the honourable member for Higgins, because when it gets to the Attorney-General for consideration there are a number of broader issues which have to be taken into account as to whether or not the request should be accepted&mdash;whether accepting the request would be consistent with international law, whether it is in the international interest to comply with the request, and whether the information might, for example, be used to punish or harm a person because of race, religion, sex, political opinions or matters of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I do not think the two-step approach provides a mechanism which makes the process too slow or too complex. It does not, because it does not represent any doubling up. They are two separate issues. The Australian agency considers matters from a practical operational perspective, whilst the Attorney-General's consideration would be based on broader issues which have that broader international perspective which I touched on earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth mentioning that the other point raised by the honourable member for Higgins was the question of the circumstance where, if in the past information had been provided to an overseas agency and that overseas agency had given undertakings that it would comply with certain conditions in respect of the supply of the information and did not, then that should be taken into account in respect of any subsequent request. The honourable member for Higgins referred there to his concern that that was not spelt out in section 22. I take that point, but I mention to the honourable member for Higgins that I think quite clearly that would be part&mdash;as he anticipated the answer&mdash;of the second phase of the process, that is, the consideration by the Attorney-General, because when the Attorney-General in that second stage takes into account any other matters that he or she thinks relevant in deciding whether to accede to a request, I think that that would certainly be a matter that would have to be taken into account if there was a record. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr DUFFY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take that point. I acknowledge that maybe it should be spelt out. But I must say that I thought it was pretty clear, in the sense that I took the view, in looking at this Bill in the very early days, that that was one of the matters which immediately occur to a person&mdash;that, if conditions are not complied with, what would happen in those circumstances. I would have thought that would be at the top of the list of the matters that an Attorney-General would and, in my view, should take into account in these circumstances. I take the point, however, that the honourable member thinks that it should be more explicitly spelt out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in respect of the interrelationship between this Bill and the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act, it is intended to complement the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act, which I think is the point that was made by the honourable member for Higgins. That said, however, I suppose the legislative framework established by this Bill is flexible enough to recognise that a foreign regulator may not be able, at the outset, to identify where the investigation will ultimately lead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On one of the points, of course, made by the honourable member for Barton, the Bill restricts only the use of self-incriminating evidence in subsequent criminal proceedings. What the honourable member was saying about this being the civil side of the equation is, of course, correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter which the honourable member for Higgins touched on was the question of self-incrimination in section 14 or, more particularly, the issue of derivative use immunity, which is a matter to be debated in this House tomorrow. I do not propose to say any more about that now other than to say that the point made by the honourable member for Higgins is, of course, correct; it is a very difficult balancing act between the rights of people to be protected and the rights that people have in relation to matters such as self-incrimination. That is a matter which, it being 6.15 tonight, we will leave to another day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill will be supported by the coalition. It is an omnibus Bill from the Department of Transport and Communications and it contains some amendments to the Air Navigation Act, to which the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) will speak after dinner, the Broadcasting Act and the Radio Licence Fees Act. I wanted to take the opportunity before dinner to make some remarks about the Bill and also some broader remarks about the radio industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill, in respect of the Broadcasting Act, together with other amendments, makes it possible to ensure that licensees of non-metropolitan AM and commercial radio licence services who have FM translators will be able to apply under the Act for conversion to FM. My colleagues will know that there has been a great deal of concern in non-metropolitan Australia to see that FM services are made available in country areas. This Bill attempts to fix up an oversight in the original Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second change relates to the radio licence fees, to remove an anomaly within the Act and the new complicated licence arrangements so that the full benefit of an earlier change proposed by the Government and supported by the Opposition where there is a reduction in licence fees collected from the radio industry will flow to those it is intended to benefit. In 1991-92 some $8m in reduced licence fees will flow to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be said that the reason the Government has had to address the problems in the radio industry is that the radio industry is now in the worst position it has ever been in. Those people who might be driving home tonight and listening to their radio stations, whether they be commercial or otherwise, ought to know that at least in the commercial area the revenues that have been enjoyed by radio stations&mdash;particularly the smaller rural radio stations&mdash;have been under severe stress and that some of them have gone out of business altogether. That, of course, has major impacts in regional areas&mdash;lack of localism, and so on. There was certainly a desperate need for the Government to respond to the difficulties in the radio industry. That is why we support these minor amendments and why we supported the earlier Bill when the Government presented it to the Parliament. Indeed, on that occasion I welcomed it as the shadow Minister for communications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is great change taking place in the radio industry. That was brought home to those of us who watched this industry closely through the Australian delegation to the world radio conference in Spain, which returned about a week ago. Some major changes took place on that occasion. That conference went on for over a month and we learnt that a whole new technology will be available called DAB&mdash;digital audio broadcasting&mdash;and that will include the possibility of cleaning up all this confusion between AM and FM. We will see a dramatic change in the provision of services to regional and metropolitan Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said on other occasions, we have to look to a new legislative regime to give effect to these dramatic changes which are being forced on us by technology. This is happening at a time when the financial returns from those in the radio industry are at historically low levels. That, of course, is of great concern to all of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think those who were involved in the Australian delegation deserve credit. I have not had a full briefing from the Department yet, although the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon), who is at the table, assures me that that briefing will be forthcoming. In the reports that I have read it is quite clear that Australia did have a major victory in the very complicated area of spectrum management. We have to use spectrum in common with the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a whole range of new services. DAB is one that I have talked about and mobile phones is another. What are known as LEOS, low-earth orbiting satellites, will be available, which will provide a whole new range of services. We have had some major victories. People such as the Indians and the Indonesians have supported us in trying to get a world regime conducive to the development of these new services. That is particularly important for Australia, because a country of our size with a sparse population, relatively speaking, spread over such a large area needs to maximise to every extent possible the best utilisation of those communication services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Secretary at the table hosted a conference only last week in Darwin about remote area communications, which, unfortunately, I could not go to. He being from the Northern Territory and I being from Tasmania and having served in the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio, we appreciate the importance of utilising technologies to their best advantage. So what we are searching for in this Parliament is a legislative regime to give effect to these opportunities. I think we also need to be careful about understanding the difficulties that we have in the current regime; it is old and outdated and it has caused a great deal of frustration for many people around the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I came into possession of a letter addressed to the Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal dated 6 March and signed by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Richardson) in regard to a licensee in the Richmond area relating to a station called 2LM, which apparently is in Lismore. This is a letter asking the Tribunal to entertain a supplementary licence at the same time as it is dealing with a licence for a new independent FM station in the Lismore region. Admittedly, Senator Richardson is the new Minister, but the interesting fact that emerges from his letter is that this independent inquiry from the ABT has been going for four years. There is an AM station in that area, and applications by two competing consortia for independent FM have been going on for four years. Now the Minister has intervened and said to the Tribunal, `We would like you to join to that independent assessment an application for the existing AM station to have a supplementary FM'. I think that shows us that we have got ourselves into a mess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can be critical about this, and I guess I have been critical on a number of occasions, but there is a growing recognition that we have to address this problem, because people are being denied FM radio. The policy that we have pursued in this country has meant that a 40-year-old technology has not been made available to many areas in regional Australia. Now we know from the conference in Spain that a new technology is emerging, which means that we are almost going to jump a technology that the rest of the world has enjoyed. I think our approach in radio policy has not only visited a financial disaster upon the industry but also put in place a regime that has not given to the consumer, who after all is the person we want to serve, the opportunity to enjoy even the technologies that are now available. I think the Minister has a major task in front of him to address those problems quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect of the administration of this area is the level of fees, which I raise by way of example to the Parliamentary Secretary at the table, who I know is very diligent in these matters. We are talking in this Bill and in the licence fees Act about a reduction in fees. I received a letter today from a small company called Expamet Pty Ltd of Revesby in New South Wales. Interestingly, it is in the district of Bankstown, which is in the centre of the electorate of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I will read the point this small company makes and then get to the nub of the issue, from its point of view. The letter says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This company has been struggling to maintain employment for the 77 people still employed here. Before the recession we just had to have, and despite promises from Mr Keating that the Bankstown district would recover from recession </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">last year, we find that business continues to be difficult to obtain and that profit is rapidly declining.</PARA>
<PARA>That is true of many companies and small businesses right around the nation. That is something the Parliamentary Secretary at the table ought to be regretting. The Prime Minister says that he does, but it seems to be somewhat of a hollow claim when he was the one who designed the problems that these people face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the letter, the nub of the issue for this company is this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An $800.00 licence fee to cover two walkie talkies and a base walkie talkie, used by our factory despatch and maintenance personnel so that they are in touch with the office gives these mobile stations a status way above reality.</PARA>
<PARA>The interesting postscript at the bottom of the letter gives it all away. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Daily operational time for our `mobile station' would be ten minutes or less.</PARA>
<PARA>An amount of $800-plus is paid to the Department each year for the two walkie-talkies for 10 minutes use a day. It would seem to me that, if we are reviewing the licence fees for radio, perhaps we ought to look at the licence fees for this type of activity. I think it would be only fair to do so, given that there has been a dramatic change in the technologies that are available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry policy and the policies that we are putting forward in this Parliament in the Fightback package are all about lowering the input costs to business and saying to businesses that we will address their concerns by taking away payroll tax, allowing them to provide for better labour contracts, and by looking at and abolishing the wholesale sales tax range. But we also need to look at the demands that government is placing on businesses, for example, by the collection of data for the Australian Bureau of Statistics, much of which we need, but all of that is done, unpaid, by small business. Here we have another example in the communications area of what can only be described as a very heavy impost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I will take a minute to mention the Broadcasting Act and the changes that are made to it, relating to recent decisions that the ABT has made in relation to children's programming. Admittedly, that does not manifest itself in the radio area, but it certainly does in television. It is not appropriate to enter into a full debate now about those issues, but I make the point&mdash;and I think the Parliamentary Secretary at the table would agree&mdash;that we are about to enter into a consideration of the broadcasting services Bill, which is in draft form and available for community discussion. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the broadcasting area there has not been a more important Bill which has gone to the community for discussion, and will finally come to this Parliament,  for 50 years. This will be the first full rewrite of the broadcasting legislation for 50 years. It would ill become either side of the Parliament to take this matter lightly, because we are seeing dramatic changes in technology which are going to impact tremendously on service providers. It will give the opportunity for the consumers to be their own programmers, in time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are yet to have the whole debate about pay television and its intricacies and ins and outs. We wait for the Minister, who has just returned from overseas, to report to his Cabinet and, finally, to the Parliament. But all of those issues indicate that this is going to be a major change. These matters need to be dealt with sensibly, in an open fashion, and we must make sure that there is opportunity for full and complete discussion in the broader community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot stress too strongly the major changes that are going to be proposed. There will be arguments about them, as there need to be, because out of arguments we will get a better Bill. The major changes that will take place will require a lot of discussion. Tomorrow or the next day I will be releasing a discussion paper to all my colleagues to draw to their attention the significance of what is being proposed. What we do here over the next six months will determine the legislative framework for how we deal with broadcasting for a very long time to come. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to take part in this debate on the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. I think it is correct to thank the shadow Minister for communications, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), for his contribution and to note that the Opposition supports the amendments to this Bill. It is difficult to see how the amendments could be opposed because they are basically of a housekeeping nature and they do not involve any significant policy changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some amendments are made to the definitions contained in the Broadcasting Act 1942 to ensure that certain AM commercial radio licensees, whose main transmitter is AM but who make some transmissions on an FM translator station, can apply to convert their licences to FM in the same way as other AM licensees. I do not think there could be any objection to that. This will ensure that those licensees do not suffer any disadvantage compared with other AM licensees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also makes a minor amendment to clarify a drafting inconsistency between paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection 80B(2) of the Broadcasting Act 1942. Part 4 of the Bill amends the Radio Licence Fees Act 1964 to correct a drafting oversight in the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Act 1991. This amendment will reduce by 50 per cent the current licence fee ceiling of 6.5 per cent for licensees with revenues greater than $10m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 4 of the Bill also ensures that the licence fee reductions are applied to two old system licences. Old system licences are not licensed under the Broadcasting Act, but instead are licensed under transitional provisions in the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Act 1985. Old system licences require each transmitting facility to be licensed, instead of licensing a service to operate within a service area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, the amendments to this Bill are basically of a housekeeping nature. The Opposition has said that it does not oppose these and will be supporting them. As we are talking about transport and communications, I would like to expand my comments a little to deal with the transport area in general. As you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, the efficiency and effectiveness of the transport sector is critically important to the Australian economy&mdash;an inescapable consequence of our nation's size and dispersed population. Equally desirable is the need to develop a more equitable society by increasing national income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's guiding objective is the promotion and development of an integrated, effective and coordinated land transport system which reflects national economic and social priorities; pursues safe and efficient practices responsive to user requirements, with each mode undertaking the transport task to which it is most suited; and is equipped to meet the rapid growth envisaged for the 1990s and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The means of achieving these essential goals is structural adjustment through micro-economic reform. Micro-economic reform aims to accelerate growth in living standards. It also seeks to establish an environment where industry can provide, at competitive prices, the goods and services demanded by Australians and by our trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task in the transport and communications sector is to improve intermodal choice and the links between modes in order to lower the real cost of transport. This directly benefits industries, exporters and consumers. In the transport area, more efficient railways, for instance, would decrease substantially the annual $4 billion drain by the railways on public sector savings and assist some of Australia's largest exporters. Improved efficiency in road investment and management can increase the returns to the community from the Commonwealth's considerable road funding. The Federal Government has also played a pivotal role in initiating road reforms that can deliver an extra $2 billion a year in national earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Working in partnership, the Federal Government, the States and the Territories have embarked on a reform strategy that aims to develop a more effective and responsive national transport sector. The basis of this program is the Government's fourth term policy commitment to structural reform of those industries with the greatest impact on the national economy. The impetus is the very real need for Australia to become competitive internationally. Its specific aim is to increase the economy's resilience and responsiveness by enabling higher growth in productivity, production and employment and real wages, and by easing Australia's susceptibility to changes in demand and fluctuating world commodity prices that can destabilise our balance of payments outlook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission has estimated that land transport reform has the capacity to increase our national income by more than $6 billion. The Government is determined to deliver these benefits to the economy and to all Australians. The changes which this Government has initiated and which are now under way are being pursued in a spirit of cooperation with other levels of government and through the establishment of institutions covering the national transport sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, more change is needed and at a faster pace. This is not solely a government responsibility, but one which all areas of the community must share. Australian industries and those sectors serving them need to be more efficient. For example, they could increase the return on public funds through better management practices, through more targeted investment, by lifting productivity and, of course, through the use of new technology. The efficiencies achieved can be passed directly to users in the form of lower prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While increasing efficiency and improving performance in the transport sector, the Government will also act to safeguard public interest, social justice and safety objectives. The pursuit of a modern, efficient and cost-effective transport system across all modes has required the creation of new institutional structures in both road and rail, national in outlook and commercially focused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, governments are moving towards a consistent national institutional and regulatory environment which is conducive to structural reform and growth.

The Federal Government's land transport strategy and the One Nation statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) focus this Commonwealth spending on road and rail projects that reduce transportation costs for industry, speed the flow of goods and produce to ports, or demonstrate a capacity to lift national income through shorter travelling times and greater efficiency gains. </PARA>

If he thought his terms of reference were narrow on this particular Bill, the section on which I wish to speak tonight, the amendments to the Air Navigation Act, is probably even narrower. Mr Deputy Speaker, I hope you will give me a little leniency. I certainly will not be wandering off the point too much.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Act proposed in the legislation relate principally to international aircraft movements in and out of Australian ports and for flights across Australia. It has been quite interesting because up until this time the operations of foreign aircraft have been covered in the Act, while the operation of Australian aircraft flying internationally has been covered by regulation. Basically this amendment ensures that all those aircraft are covered under the Act. There are some related items. All the offences relating to licensed aircraft flying internationally will now be contained in the Act, and there will be an upgrading of penalties for breaches of the Act from the present maximum of $5,000 to a new maximum of $100,000. The Opposition has no problems with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions of a prison term for serious offences will also be transferred from the regulations into the Act. A proposed new section of the Act, section 13A, will make similar provisions for the operations of scheduled international and non-scheduled charter flights on the same basis as scheduled operations. The only other real change to the operation of the Act is an amendment to section 19, which clarifies that it is an offence for an aircraft flying internationally to, from or across Australia to carry munitions or implements of war except with the written permission of the Minister. There are no new real regulatory powers in this Act, and I notice that the Minister's briefing suggested that there may even be a small saving of money in its implementation. Obviously we would all welcome that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I first saw this legislation I contacted the people in the Aviation Division of the Department of Transport and Communications who very kindly faxed over to me the regulations and the rules surrounding the licensing of these particular flights. I draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon), who is representing the Minister tonight, to something which interests me. Paragraph 1.5.3 of the regulations state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any proposed flights to or from the following, or involving the carriage of passengers or cargo between Australia and the following, may not be operated without prior approval:</PARA>

<PARA>I ask: is the Government doing anything in respect of the South African flights and, indeed, the expansion of the flights that are coming from Taiwan at the moment? With the way the traffic is building on the Taiwan run and the estimates of the number of flights that will be applied for from Taipei, especially to Brisbane, if the Federal Airports Corporation can ever get its act together and get some gates available for those flights to arrive, it will be very interesting to see whether or not those carriers will have to go through this. I suppose that, in many respects, this will be the first of a number of Bills that we will be seeing, and a number of amendments to Acts, as the Australian aviation regime goes through some major changes. This Bill is perhaps the first. There is no doubt that the announcement made by the Government in the One Australia policy, and indeed the policy changes that the Opposition has been promoting for nearly two years, will require a total overhaul of the way we see the  operations of international aircraft in and out of Australia. We might have some requirements to make changes to these operations sooner than we think. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The revolution in international aviation policy in Australia probably should have begun 11 or 12 years ago. I believe that we have already paid a price for our closed minds and our protectionist attitudes. For decades successive governments, including this Government, have argued that what was good for the national carrier was good for Australia. That attitude was wrong and we have paid the price. While we congratulate ourselves about the strides that we have made in attracting international tourists, for example, to this country over the past 10 years, in hindsight our performance in many ways has been quite pathetic. We still only have 0.5 per cent of the world international tourism market. We can compare that with a place such as Singapore, which has twice the international visitors than we do, or Thailand, which will expect about four times the number of international visitors that we get this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think one of the major points that should be made about what has happened in South East Asia, and one of the things that we should highlight, is the fact that we have not been part of that particular action over the last decade. We are operating in the most liberal and vigorous international airline regime in the world. If honourable members want to see what a liberal aviation regime can do, they should have a look at Singapore or have a look at Thailand. It is not about selling our sovereignty; it is about a liberal aviation regime, and we have got lots to learn from that. There is no doubt that competition and efficiency have brought our Asian neighbours great riches, and it is not without significance that the Asian airline carriers are amongst some of the most profitable in the world. But that is history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad to see that the Government is making some tentative moves for a major evolution of Australian international aviation over these next few years. Australia could well be forced into a different situation, too, with what happens in the forthcoming aviation regime of the European Community, which we expect to see at the end of this year. We have already seen the emergence of US mega-carriers; we see attitudes that are still evolving in Asia; and we have seen the marrying up of international carriers into strategic alliances. All those things should be ringing warning bells to Australian carriers who have the chance of really becoming quite small fry in the international aviation regime unless we get our attitudes and our rules and regulations right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would argue, for example, that the first thing we should be doing is getting a lean, mean, well financed 100 per cent privately owned Qantas that can get out there and compete in this international market. I congratulate the Government on the introduction of dual designators operating for Australia in the international markets. That will produce some international competition, provided all the bilateral arrangements can be changed to accommodate this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other question we have really got to start asking in this country is: how long are we going to have the present bilateral arrangements? It would be my suggestion that we could well see the whole of the bilateral international aviation regime fall over within five years. The EC situation at the end of this year could be the start of it. I have no doubt that, if we see an aviation trading bloc starting in the EC, the North Americans will respond. There is talk about a common market at the end of this year between Canada, the United States and Mexico. If that happens, I am sure Japan can look after itself. We will see the ASEAN countries forming their own trade bloc, and what will be left? It will be Australia, New Zealand and a few Pacific islands, if we are not careful, and we will be very small fry indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aviation has never been included in the Uruguay Round and we have now got a situation where GATT has asked the International Civil Aviation Organisation to submit some ideas to it for the liberalisation of international air rights. The bilateral framework that resulted from the Bermuda agreement of 1946 has to a great degree been the principal reason for the restrictive establishment of these aviation regimes. It is in its final years of effectiveness and, as I said before, if it lasts another five years I will be very surprised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the suggestion that probably the only option Australia has got open at the moment is to start making some tentative moves to become part of that ASEAN aviation complex. That is a fairly radical statement, but because of the things that I have pushed out before, and because of the movement of the world to multinational international air rights, I think it is about time we started looking very closely at equipping Australia for the brave new world, especially with the projected growth of air travel in the region. The World Tourist Organisation, for example, predicts that 120 million Asians will be travelling offshore for their holidays by the year 2000. If Australia could get just 10 per cent of that business we would have trouble handling the traffic. Can we do it with the capacity and the finance we have at the moment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at what has been happening to other major industries, such as banking and insurance, we see that the whole thing is becoming internationalised. My suggestion is that Australia should be looking at doing just that with its aviation markets in the coming years. Such a system would demand the most efficient airline operations from Australians, and the best management of airlines, otherwise I acknowledge that there could be some real losers. Frankly, with the present efficiencies of Asian carriers and a newly structured privatised and well managed Qantas, few of the traditional carriers of the US or, indeed, Europe would be likely to be able to compete in this particular region. On the Australian side it would not only be Qantas that would be in the game, but Ansett, Australian and any other carrier that may emerge. While some people may say that this is pie in the sky, I remind the House that Australian entrepreneurs have been very much at the forefront in getting this type of situation into place. I refer particularly to the TNT-Ansett organisation and what it has done with international air freight traffic within Europe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arrangements that TNT has with a whole host of carriers ranging from Aeroflot through to Malev, the Hungarian carrier, through to the French post office, is an indication of the challenge that is there and of the way the rules are changing. I believe Australia has the capacity to get into that particular market and to do it. Indeed, if we want to be part of Asia, as both leaders and both parties are saying at the moment, maybe aviation is one of the doors that can be opened which could give us some of this access into those Asian markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that a number of Australian airline operators, if they read this speech, will be screaming blue murder, but the plain facts are that if we are going to exist, expand and really get into this business, we have got to start thinking about it now. For those operators who scream and carry on, may I tell them that six of the world's 10 most profitable airlines are all ASEAN carriers. I would stack that up against the performance of some of the Australian carriers in recent years. If they are worried about over-competition on the Australian run, look at the reality of what has happened within Asia. Seventeen carriers compete between Bangkok and Singapore, 11 compete between Singapore and Hong Kong and five operators ply between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. There is no doubt that there is more traffic there, but there is also no doubt that the competition and the efficiencies that have been brought on by the ASEAN have attracted traffic there. It is an amazing situation if, for example, we look at the services out of Japan, that the biggest carrier on, say, the Japan-Bangkok run is United Airlines. It carries more passengers than either the national carrier of Japan or the national carrier of Thailand. What I am saying is that if we do not get in there and start making our mark, we could well see some of the American mega-carriers getting in there, as they are already on the Japan-Australia run under that old 1949 bilateral and we could miss the boat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Competition, open markets and freedom of the skies have been very good news in Asia. That could be brilliant news here for Australia. As I say, while the amendments to this particular Act are only the very beginning of some of the major changes that I think we will probably have to make, I am sure that people of good spirits and open minds would be prepared to look at just how we can get into that common ASEAN aviation regime, to lift the shackles of the past and to make sure that we go into that brave new world so that Australia and Australians can get the full benefit of what a liberalised aviation regime can bring. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the contribution of the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) who is a national authority on tourism and aviation and appropriately represents the Opposition on these subjects. I believe he made a very good point when he remarked how aviation has changed over the last few years. While we may condemn organisations such as Compass&mdash;and some years ago Solo, Bourke's, XL&mdash;for the way in which they have in a sense sacrificed themselves to show how deregulation can work, they have made a great contribution. While it could be said that Compass may have priced itself too low, it is quite evident that it did make it clear that we can have lower prices, and things will never be the same again because of the deregulation which took place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same could be said of other firms which have initiated action. Quite often the previous Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, has been condemned for his role with Solo and Bourke's, and Sykes has been condemned for his role with XL Petroleum, but in each of those cases they took quite historic initiatives which will be recognised by history as forcing down prices. Whatever else is said about all these organisations, they made that great contribution. Of course, the main aim of Hawke with Solo and with Bourke's was to get some price competition. It was the main aim of Hawke, Keating and the whole of the Federal Cabinet at the time to deregulate the airlines for the benefit of travelling Australians, and it was done. Now we see the Government looking at the potential available for lower prices by allowing overseas carriers to carry people and the potential we have for more efficient transport of people in that domestic passengers will be allowed to travel on internal legs&mdash;for example, Melbourne to Sydney, Melbourne to Perth and Perth to Sydney&mdash;and also Qantas will be free to operate domestically. So these are great moves, great changes that are happening. It took too long to happen, but it has happened and it did so under the present Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, there have been some great boosts to airline tourism by the present Government, particularly through promotion, and that tourism is now linking into regions. In this region alone, many of the three or four million people who have visited this place have come from overseas to see the building that is here. Tourism is now great news for Australia. It is a major part of our export industry. The advertising through Paul Hogan and the advertising through Greg Norman has assured Australia of more customers on aviation, and it has assured Australia of a greater level of tourism which is going to continue. This is quite obvious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill looks at aviation, and the amendments are not particularly important amendments within the context of policy, but they do make some provisions such as replacing the existing general offence provision with specific offence provisions and penalties. They clarify the provisions relating to international airline licences, permissions and approvals, and they enable regulations to be made providing for on the spot fines for specific offences. They remove the power to prescribe in regulations a term of imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other speakers have also referred to the reference in the Bill to the Broadcasting Act, which is again making some minor changes. These are in relation to AM commercial radio licence, non-commercial FM commercial radio licence and other matters relating to the Broadcasting Act 1942. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make some points about broadcasting because I believe some extremely important things have happened here again through the actions of the present Government which has made some great strides. In this region alone there have been some extraordinary changes. With respect to the areas served by radio, for Canberra, Queanbeyan, Yass and Yarrowlumla Shire the number of radio stations has increased from six to 11 and the number of television stations has increased from two to five. If we look around the region we can see similar progress. In the city of Shoalhaven the number of television stations has gone up from two to five, and the number of radio stations from one to four. In the Eurobodalla Shire where approximately 16,000 people had only one commercial radio station&mdash;no ABC radio station at all in 1983-84&mdash;we now see four radio stations instead of one and we see four television stations instead of two. Bombala Shire had no television at all in 1983-84. Now it has a choice of four television stations. Some people in Bombala could receive one radio station and now all can receive two radio stations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tallagandah Shire had one television station for some people and for others they could not get television at all. In fact, they looked like losing that television station with aggregation and the move of WIN television to UHF. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of people would not agree with Malcolm Muggeridge when he said, `I have had all my television aerials removed. It is the moral equivalent of a prostate operation.' People were certainly missing their television in that area, but instead of that one television station they now have five. Bega Valley Shire, instead of two television stations, has four, and Cooma-Monaro Shire has gone from two to five television stations. Snowy River Shire had no television stations at all but now they can receive four. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some great things happening in television. The Government is now looking at pay television. It has recognised that the standard of public television will have to be maintained when pay television comes. People will be able to pay for access to television channels which provide music, perhaps; another station may provide drama; another station, sport; another, movies; another, news and current affairs. I am hoping that the ABC will be one of the organisations operating pay television, particularly in news and current affairs. I believe it should be given a go at that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am worried, though, about the prospect of a funding cut of $10m proposed by the Opposition because I believe this could well affect rural programs. It could well affect services in areas like Bega and Cooma. It could well affect the local news on Canberra radio stations. It could well affect important activities of the ABC such as its university courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not go backwards; let us continue the big changes that have already taken place. Particularly let us not go backwards in radio and television services. Let us not have, as exists in the United States, a situation where all sorts of people are able to get radio licences. One sees congestion and confusion there. I can recall seeing one television show which was broadcast from a backyard studio operated by Mum and Dad;  Mum operated the camera while Dad read the news. It was not of a particularly high standard, but there was not much competition. On the commercial stations in the US there is certainly not the range and choice that we have with the ABC and SBS here in Australia. We do not want that dreadful choice which is given to people if they are not prepared to pay for pay television. We need to keep our SBS and ABC services strong. That is particularly important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not want the changes that have happened in the United States with regard to the deregulation of airlines.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the particular concerns I have in relation to this Transport and Communications Bill regarding broadcasting also relates to some particular areas of television. One of the issues raised in recent times has been the move by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to reclassify children's programs. I am pleased to say it has now got sense. Quite frankly, it made a mistake in its approach to the classification of children's programs. Here I refer to the move on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fat Cat and Friends</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Humphrey B. Bear</EMPHASIS> programs. The Broadcasting Tribunal took an attitude towards those programs which meant that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fat Cat</EMPHASIS> would not qualify under the Australian content requirements. It was of concern to many people in the community that these relatively harmless programs were being denied airplay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ought to be absolutely accurate here. It was not that the Tribunal said that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fat Cat</EMPHASIS> could not be put on air<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>; it was quite simply that it would not qualify for points under the Australian content requirements. So from that point of view I think that the Tribunal saw the error of its ways and said, `We will leave it to the television stations to undertake their own classifications'. I think that is a more sensible outcome.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Children were being denied access to programs which in many senses were relatively harmless.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general drift of television does concern me. Firstly, there is the program called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Studs,</EMPHASIS> which I referred to; secondly, there is the question of the deregulatory environment for advertising. I think that deregulatory environment failed. I will guarantee that if there is a good quality movie on, and I am sure people agree with this, as the movie nears its end the viewer is deluged with advertisements. The television channels cynically play the viewer along and, just as the viewer thinks, `I had better watch the end of this movie. It only runs for two hours, and I have been sitting here for 3 1/2 hours already', the television station cynically adds more and more advertisements to try to milk as much revenue as it can. I think that is a disgrace. Television stations are simply abusing their position. I strongly object to viewers being subjected to that.

The rest of the time there are B-quality programs on. What other commercial organisation could afford to put two quality products on the market?

I have a specific concern about a program called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Studs </EMPHASIS>shown in prime time by Channel 10. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>Frankly, I think that is a program that ought not to be shown, and I have complained to the Broadcasting Tribunal about it. I believe that there are other programs that need to be examined for their suitability for television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My third point relates to the abuse by television stations in terms of the amount of advertisements they show. The types of advertisements now appearing on television have also been raised with me. In particular, some women are concerned about the advertising of women's hygiene products on television. Frankly, I doubt that those products ought to be advertised on television at the times they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final concern is the level of violence on television. I am assisted here by a report by the Broadcasting Tribunal on violence on television. The report says quite clearly that there is considerable concern amongst people in the community about violence. If we do a breakdown in terms of age, education, religious affiliation, family status and so on we see a very real concern about violence on television among many people in the general population as well as among those who were specifically surveyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that much of the violence is contained in American produced programs. I object to that. Quite frankly, it is sometimes quite a joy to watch Australian or British produced programs, which can be quite as dramatic as the American programs but which one can view with a sense of relief because no-one gets shot or beaten up. I feel that the salacious violence injected into Australian viewing by American produced television programs is quite unhealthy. In this respect I am at one with many people in the community, who find that violence quite unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To use an example, the British produced program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Bill</EMPHASIS> very rarely has violent scenes <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>because the British producers know their game well enough to realise that one can create enough tension and enough drama without having to enact violence. Again, I refer to what I would regard as a magnificent piece of television produced by the ABC called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Phoenix</EMPHASIS>. There was one significant violent act in that series when a car was blown up and a policeman and a policewoman were killed. But it has not been felt necessary to inject violence into that program every week. Why is that? Because the producers know their job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is it that we so often have to be affronted by American produced programs displaying violence? It is rather interesting to do a body count during the programs to see how many people are murdered. From my point of view and my family's point of view and, significantly, from the point of view of the community at large, there is a considerable rejection of violence on television. I believe we owe it to our communities to look at the program classification system and at the amount of violence which is injected into our television viewing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past in Australia we would not have been regarded as a violent society. We were regarded as a vigorous and very competitive society, but not by nature a violent one. I do not believe that we should allow this injection of violence through the medium of television, and largely American produced television, to corrupt our standards in terms of what we regard as a healthy society. It is interesting to talk to children in schools. One can ask them their views on how we should deal with crime. The number of children who respond by saying that you shoot the baddies is rather alarming. In other words, their perception of justice, developed from seeing American produced television programs, is that, if someone is bad, ipso facto, one shoots them. If that is the way that we are developing children's attitudes in terms of violence on television, I believe that we are making a grave mistake. We ought not to wonder when that violence is replicated on the streets of our cities&mdash;which, of course, it is. That brings us back to the role of violence on television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have found the Broadcasting Tribunal research very useful because it reveals the concern of people about violence in the community at large and violence on television. I believe that it is up to our television executives to consider whether they are putting sufficient constraints on violence on television. There is an issue that comes up frequently in my discussions with people. Often movies with an Adults Only classification that are shown late in the evening are promoted&mdash;with significant violent extracts&mdash;in prime time when children are watching television. We have to ask ourselves whether the television stations are getting around the requirements of the Act and whether they are ignoring the standards that ought to be set for the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some television stations argue that stills of violent actions are different from movies of violent action. However, I think the issue that has to be addressed is whether our community accepts that we should have as much violence shown on television as we do. The answer that comes across in this report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sex, Violence and Offensive Language</EMPHASIS>, is that the view in the community is that there is too much violence. There is a concern about the frequency of bad language on television. There is also a concern about the number of sex scenes on television. Again, I do not say this from the point of view of being somewhat sheltered in relation to what television does, but because television is a very powerful medium that is viewed in many homes in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is, therefore, in two areas. One of my concerns relates to the demeaning of people, in particular women. I refer to programs such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Studs</EMPHASIS> and to violent programs. Secondly, I believe that television executives have a very significant responsibility to look at the quality of what they are putting before us. If they actually talked to people in the community, quite separate from their ratings&mdash;which the Broadcasting Tribunal, to its credit, has done in this report&mdash;they will find that there is a very real concern about what is shown on television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not dealt with another area of real concern, the content of news programs, but I believe that that is a big issue that needs to be addressed. However, I suggest that people sit down some night with a stopwatch and look at commercial television news to see just how much real news they get. Certainly, there is a lot of interchange between the two talking heads; there is a lot of chit-chat about what has been happening. But in terms of hard content there is very little. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I thank the honourable member for Mayo for his interjection, because he is right. We get very low quality stories. Many people in the community tell me, `SBS news tells me what is happening in the world'. The ABC, when it is doing its job properly, has a properly structured news program. I recognise that there are commercial stations which try to do a very good job with their news programs. However, when one is subjected to only about three significant stories and the rest happen to be cats up trees stories, one wonders whether we are being given sufficient news or whether, in fact, as has been discovered in the United States, news has become entertainment. This is now called `infotainment'. That is an interesting word because news content is reduced and it becomes more entertainment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the news executives are looking at is not a program with a real news content but something to entertain their viewers. In the end we have to ask ourselves whether, if viewers are not being properly informed, our democratic society is being conducted properly. I respond by saying that I do not believe it is. A proper democratic society requires proper levels of information, not entertainment posing as news. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest to many people that they take a stopwatch next time they watch commercial television news and take a note of how much real news they get compared with chit-chat and cats up trees stories, and how many advertisements are shown during the news program. If we went into a restaurant and bought a meal that undersold us in the way that commercial television news undersells us, we would wonder whether we would ever go back to that restaurant. However, people are great creatures of habit, and come 6 o'clock at night they turn their television on to a certain station. I accept that, and it is not all bad news. However, if people such as us in this Parliament do not draw the attention of the people at large to these issues we are perhaps not doing our job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make these comments about television because I believe they are significant in regard to the broadcasting legislation before us. There are issues that people raise with me on a regular basis in relation to their families, in particular their children, and what is being put forward in the form of television programs. I refer again to programs such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Studs</EMPHASIS> which, frankly, demean women and ought not to be on television. I suggest that the 10 network must be in grave financial strife to have to buy a program that is as cheap and hopeless as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Studs</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, I have raised that matter with the Broadcasting Tribunal and, to its credit, it is looking at it. But I did so in the context that, rather than its making life difficult for a program such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fat Cat,</EMPHASIS> I think it should look at <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Studs</EMPHASIS>, which I think is harmful whereas <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fat Cat</EMPHASIS> was harmless. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe the question of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Skippy</EMPHASIS> has already been raised by the Premier of Queensland. The honourable member ought not to provoke me, but I am glad that he did. The issue at stake here is that some people in the Broadcasting Tribunal were making decisions about what they thought was fit for us to watch. That is all right. We ought to be looking for better children's television and, frankly, they were trying to do that&mdash;although I think they were mistaken. But, in doing so, they were blinkered to some of these other programs that were on television which in fact were harmful to children. That is what excited my interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does concern me is that when one asks teachers about how many children watch television programs at night&mdash;it is worth doing this&mdash;one discovers that many children are watching television as late as 9.30 or 10 p.m. Not only is this bad for the children, but also we have to look at what programs they are viewing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make quick remarks about two radio stations. I particularly want to pay a compliment to the management of a radio station in Perth called Radio 6PR, which is one of the few profitably operating radio stations in Australia at the moment. The managing director, Cheri Gairdner, has done an excellent job in getting that radio station back in the black. I see that it has just signed up a commercial arrangement today with a number of country stations to service that station. I believe that will not only improve their news content but also offer them better commercial positioning in selling products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other station is interesting because it is Radio 6NR in Perth which is an outgrowth of Curtin University. This station is doing a fantastic job with limited resources in providing services to a wide range of community groups as well as sporting groups which have not been served well in the past. With very limited resources it is doing a wonderful job in providing a service to the community at large. I would like to acknowledge those stations. In closing, I say that I believe this issue of broadcasting is one that has a constant interest for the community. I thank the House for its attention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the debate for the passion with which they spoke about this subject, although I must say that not many of them said anything about the legislation. As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards), has illustrated, a great number of issues in relation to broadcasting attract the attention of this House, not least of which are those which the honourable member mentioned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just refer to the legislation which is, after all, what we are debating, although I am not going to mention all the issues which have been canvassed. The Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 relates to the Air Navigation Act 1920, the Broadcasting Act 1942 and the Radio Licence Fees Act 1964. As I have said, a number of speakers have canvassed a variety of issues, some of which were relevant to the legislation but most of which were not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) for his contribution and particularly for his endorsement of the work which has been done by the officers of the radio communications division of the Department of Transport and Communications at the recent WARC conference in Spain. He raised a number of important issues which the communications industry in Australia, and indeed this community, will have to come to terms with in the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also mentioned that a person had written to him about licence fees, which as far as I can ascertain were not broadcasting licence fees but related to the use of a land mobile radio communications system. Whilst I am not conversant with the particular company which was mentioned, the honourable member said that it was a company which used walkie-talkie sets which cost the company $800 a year for a licence. I cannot really give an answer to that comment without having definite information, apart from saying that $800 is not an unusual amount to pay for licensing a land mobile base station and associated mobile stations. I would be happy to provide for the honourable member's information the licence fee schedule which was brought out in December 1991. This shows, for example, that the licence for a base station in an extra high density location of a major city&mdash;and I understand this company is in Revesby&mdash;would cost $706 per year and associated mobile stations would cost $47 per year. I will make this schedule available to the honourable member because it might be able to answer the inquiries which have been made. But, as I said, this is not an unusual fee for a land mobile base station. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the other contributions which were made during the second reading debate, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) did not really address himself to the issues pertinent to this legislation, although he raised a number of important matters in relation to transport, particularly as it impacted upon his electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), as with the honourable member for Bass, indicated that the Opposition had no problems with the amendments which have been proposed, but he did raise a couple of questions about aviation policy. Whilst it is important that we do debate the question of aviation policy, the honourable member for Fadden talked about open skies, a brave new world of aviation and the need for a sudden upturn in the number of inbound tourists to Australia. I am sure that the honourable member would agree with me that the carefully targeted initiatives announced in the One Nation package will provide much of the stimulus which he refers to and contrast dramatically with the proposals which have been made by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just remind the House about some of the broad policy objectives for the aviation industry that came out of the One Nation statement: promotion of Australian interests; facilitating tourism and trade; fair access by Australian airline operators to international domestic markets; competitive policy and industry efficiency&mdash;both most relevant to the contribution which was made by the honourable member for Fadden. The Government has taken the view that the international and domestic airline industry will be enhanced by creating an environment which will foster, amongst other things, increased competition and pricing flexibility leading to greater economic efficiency in the airline industry free from unnecessary government controls, increased responsiveness by airlines to consumer needs and the promotion of tourism and trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's policy will, as I am sure the honourable member knows, encourage greater competition both domestically and internationally and the development of a more robust, integrated and internationally competitive Australian aviation industry. It also builds on the already substantial program of micro-economic reform in the international and domestic aviation industry with benefits for the crucial areas of international domestic tourism and trade and for the national economy. It recognises that the Australian and New Zealand aviation markets are relatively small and that there could be advantages for consumers in both countries and for the ability of our airlines to compete internationally if the two markets are merged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy also allows for the privatisation process for Qantas and Australian Airlines to continue with greater certainty. It provides scope for greater regional diversity of international flights to and from Australia, as well as scope for the development of Australian designated international carriers based outside Sydney. It ensures that airport infrastructure will not become a barrier to growth in the aviation industry. It encourages a vigorous cost effective regional aviation market by accelerating the final transfer of Commonwealth airports and withdrawal from the ALOP; and it recognises that the Civil Aviation Authority and Bureau of Air Safety Investigation will continue to maintain national safety standards. These sorts of changes have been applauded by the industry. Most informed commentators agree that this is the sort of way in which the aviation industry should be managed into the future. I commend the legislation to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to congratulate the coarse grain growers of Australia and through their representative organisation the Grains Council of Australia on this bringing together of the different coarse grain research and development arrangements for their combined or total industry. That is what these Bills, the Coarse Grains Levy Bill and the Coarse Grains Levy (Consequential Provisions) Bill, do; they bring together all of the different coarse grains. At the present time we have barley and triticale within the research and development arrangements. This brings in cereal rye and oats. Others potentially, as I understand it, to come into the system would be grain sorghum and maize.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is part of the standard rural industry research and development arrangement, through the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act, that is, the dollar for dollar, industry and Government, arrangement up to a maximum of 0.5 of the gross value of production for the particular industry. It is particularly commendable that oats and cereal rye, which are just coming into the scheme, are immediately going to the maximum level that attracts the matching contribution from the Government. Barley and triticale are already there. It is my understanding that they will all go higher than what has been the target set by the Government for what is seen to be a worthwhile or a reasonable contribution on the part of the industry to research programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this legislation also signifies further development in coarse grains and grain industry research generally. I see it as being in three stages. The first stage was when wheat, alone of the grains, had a research arrangement with the Government. Over a period that was seen to be too narrow; the concentration was on wheat when there was a need for research to develop more appropriate strains of other coarse grain varieties to meet market opportunities and also as required for better farm management practices in the wheat-sheep zone of Australia. Of course, that broader concept of grain crops is not just wheat and coarse grain, but also legumes and oilseed crops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second stage in this development of research arrangements came with the inclusion of that broader range of grain varieties in the research arrangements. We are seeing some of that still going on, and that is part of this legislation tonight. In this second stage, yield as well as suitable varieties for different climatic and soil situations were the dominant factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that grains industry research is now moving into a third stage, where the yield is still important but the market requirements are now having a higher priority than before. There are a number of market opportunities for specially bred coarse grain, oilseeds and legume varieties, particularly in that developing market area for us of Asia and the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One example of this is barley and beer. The growth in beer consumption in Asia is quite astonishing. It is an acceptable form of alcohol to the governments of those countries and it is one that is available to the mass of people. Barley is needed to produce it, and Australia produces very good barley. But there are particular requirements for special beer markets or types of beer. Whereas we have been very successful with China and its beer requirements, and there have been some good joint venture arrangements between some of the Australian barley marketers&mdash;some of the barley boards in Australia&mdash;and China, the converse is the situation in Japan, where we appear to be missing out on that country's market for barley because the Canadians have bred varieties more suitable for the particular type of beer that the Japanese prefer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best example of all of these grains and oilseeds, where there has been special breeding using the latest breeding techniques to develop or change a variety to suit particular markets, is canola. There has been a dramatic increase in canola production at the present time where, through some very clever breeding, as I understand it, the ratio of mono and polyunsaturated fats has been changed and maximised so that that is now a very desirable product for a whole range of end uses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With cereal rye and oats coming into the breeding program for the first time, it is interesting that both of these have special appeal in the health food market. Oats are a low cholesterol breakfast food and rye has been seen to be of beneficial value from a dietary point of view for some time. Cereal rye also has the added advantage that it is perhaps the best crop that can be grown in the lighter sandhill-type soils of the Mallee area of Australia. It plays an important part in soil stabilisation as well as growing a worthwhile crop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition parties will be supporting this legislation. We acknowledge the progress that is being made with coarse grain research and recognise that there is now a need for more special research to pick up these market opportunities. We particularly congratulate the grain growers of Australia. At a time when they are experiencing their lowest incomes on record&mdash;for this financial year, minus $32,000 on a farm business basis, according to ABARE, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics&mdash;and the tremendous uncertainties and unfairness of a corrupt world grain trade, these people really are setting an example for the rest of Australia. They are saying that our future lies with research because it is through research that we can get productivity and breed what the market really needs in its particular forms for different end products and different geographic areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just wheat that is affected by the corrupt world grain trade. Barley and some others are affected as well, and the price effect of the major grains flows on to the other grains. Therefore, even in this particularly difficult economic time, these growers are prepared not only to meet the standard or the challenge set for them by the Government of 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production but also to go beyond it. If the other sectors of Australian business were prepared to make the same sacrifices now for long term gain for the international competitiveness of their industry, Australia would be looking forward to a far better future than would otherwise be the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I endorse the comments of the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), with regard to research and development. They certainly are correct. I had the privilege yesterday of speaking to some of the representatives of the CSIRO about the importance of research and development for agriculture, which is vital if we are to take a leading edge in the competitive world which we are in. The fact that countries such as the United States and European nations are hiding behind subsidies and corrupt world markets makes it harder for us to do that, whether it is under the EEP program or the policies of the EC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is commendable, as the honourable member for Murray said, that at a time when we see a downturn, particularly in the grains industry, grain growers are prepared to put up money for research and development for the long haul, because the long haul is what it is all about. Over the last several decades a lot of people from all walks of life have looked to the short term. It will be a long haul if we are to be competitive and improve production with less input costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Coarse Grains Levy Bill 1992 incorporates the existing barley and triticale research levies and provides for new levies on oats and cereal rye. The levies will attract matching Commonwealth contributions as provided for under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989. To date, barley and triticale research levies have been imposed under separate Acts which in the main are differentiated only by product specific provisions. The oats and cereal rye levy arrangements will be similar. Consequently, omnibus levy legislation has been developed covering these grains, with provision for other coarse grains to be added by regulation having regard to any recommendation of the relevant grower organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Barley Research Levy Act 1980 and the Triticale Levy Act 1988 will be repealed under the related Coarse Grains Levy (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1992, which includes provisions to ensure continuity of current levy arrangements for these grains. These arrangements are being implemented at the request of the Grains Council of Australia on behalf of coarse grain producers after consultation with other relevant industry bodies, including the Triticale Grain Association of Australia, which is the representative industry body under the Triticale Levy Act 1988. The GCA is currently the representative industry body for barley and has been nominated as such for oats and cereal rye. Other organisations consulted include the Cereal Rye Growers Association and the various State marketing authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Levies will be imposed on grains produced in Australia and will not be payable unless the producer delivers or processes the grains. Grain used by the producer for domestic purposes, whether processed or not, will be exempt from the levy. Maximum and operative rates of each levy are specified in the Bill, with provisions for the operative rates to be changed by regulation on the recommendation of the relevant grower organisation. The maximum rates may be changed only by Parliament amending the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of value based levies for oats and cereal rye at the request of the GCA reflects the Council's policy of relating the amount of levy payable more directly to the return received by the producer. That is only fair. A value based levy has applied to wheat since 1989. Initially, the operative levy rates for oats and cereal rye will be 0.5 per cent of the value of the grain, with provision for these to be increased to a maximum of 5 per cent of the value of the grain. The Bill provides for the method of ascertaining the value of grain for levy purposes to be prescribed in regulations. It is envisaged that the method will parallel that for wheat. By that I mean pool payments or sale price net of handling, storage and transport costs. Further consultations will take place with industry in drafting these regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The barley and triticale levies will continue as specific rates, with the operative rates unchanged at $1 per tonne and 75c per tonne respectively. The maximum rate to which these may be increased by regulation is from $2 for triticale and 75c for barley to $5 per tonne for both of these grains. The Government has made a commitment to continue matching expenditure of approved industry levies on a dollar for dollar basis up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production. While the maximum specific rates proposed for barley and triticale, as requested by industry, generate levy revenue above this level, they allow scope for the operative levy rates to be increased in line with increases in the GDP and to fund and expand a research program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the proposed maximum rates for the value based levies are 10 times higher than the operative rates, they are not excessive compared with that proposed for the specific rate levies. For example, at the maximum rates estimated, levy revenue expressed as a portion of GDP from the value based levies will be lower than that from the specific rate levies. Regulations to be made under the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 will provide for collection of the levies. Other regulations under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 will attach the new levies to the GRDC to enable the corporation to administer the research programs for oats and cereal rye. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additional expenditure resulting from the extension of matching Commonwealth funding to oats and cereal rye will not commence before 1993-94. At the proposed levy rate of 0.5 per cent of the value of the grain, matching Commonwealth contributions for 1993-94 are estimated at approximately $250,000 for oats and $20,000 for cereal rye. The cost to the Budget of Commonwealth matching contributions for the existing barley and triticale schemes is estimated at $3.1m and $90,000 respectively for 1992-93. Similar outlays are expected in 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The serious drought in Queensland and northern New South Wales is expected by ABARE to restrict Australian coarse grain production to 6.9 million tonnes in 1991-92. Although there has been some damage from the rains we have had&mdash;as the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) recognises better than I&mdash;I think they will be beneficial in the long term. It is unfortunate that there has been damage and flooding in the short term; but I think that, in the long term, most grain producers will welcome the rain that will certainly recharge the aquifer and put some decent moisture into the subsoil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst unfavourable planting conditions and poor price prospects for wheat have seen the area planted to barley increase from 2.5 million to 2.8 million hectares, production is expected to remain at around 4 million tonnes, reflecting drought conditions during the growing season in northern New South Wales and Queensland. Sorghum plantings are also estimated to have increased from 398,000 to 540,000 hectares, primarily as a result of the current Queensland grain shortage. With recent favourable planting conditions in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales, production is expected to increase from about 0.9 million tonnes to about 1.1 million tonnes. Oat production is also expected to remain at around 1.5 million tonnes and cereal rye will remain at about 15,000 tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With wheat planting severely reduced and rain inadequate for normal early summer crop plantings, feed prices have risen sharply. For example, Brisbane sorghum prices rose from about $123 per tonne in February 1991 to about $195 per tonne in October 1991. The price has since fallen to about $153 per tonne in February 1992 as a result of rising confidence of an assured supply, particularly from southern Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other increases&mdash;based on Sydney retail prices&mdash;include oats from $93 per tonne in December 1990 to about $158 per tonne in December 1991; barley from $115 per tonne to $159 per tonne; triticale from $113 per tonne to about $160 per tonne; and maize from $168 per tonne to $199 per tonne. High prices could continue until winter crops are harvested in late 1992. I certainly hope that the prices go up and stay up. It will take quite a long time before many grain producers are able to replace machinery and plant and get back on their feet, but it is certainly a more positive sign than we have seen in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">High prices have prompted the shipment of grain to Brisbane from southern States&mdash;particularly barley from South Australia. The reduced availability of grain for export has highlighted the expanding feedlot operations for pigs, poultry and beef. I think it is important to recognise that because it is value adding. If we are able to use our grains in feedlots and sell the finished product&mdash;the beef&mdash;to the Japanese or to the Korean market, then we are really value adding. Rather than selling the grain or the grass-fed beef, it makes more sense to get that actual value added for a commodity which the Asian market wants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coarse grain export tonnages for the 1991-92 financial year&mdash;estimated at 2.4 million tonnes&mdash;are expected to be down by about 19 per cent on the previous year. Barley will certainly be down from 2.9 to 2.1 million tonnes, and sorghum will be down from 220,000 tonnes to almost nothing. They represent the major declines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise, as does the honourable member for Murray, that we are facing one of the lowest farm incomes we have had in many years&mdash;certainly in our lifetime. That reflects the state of the world's economy and certainly, as I have said previously, the behaviour of the European countries and the United States. I think all eyes will be on the Dunkel agreement and, hopefully, there will be a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round. Unless we can get some sanity into world trade our farmers will always be behind the eight ball because we are so reliant on export markets. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that 60 per cent of the EEP program in the United States does not go to grain producers; it goes to grain traders.

It is certainly living with hangovers from the mid-1930s and some of the Roosevelt programs, which at the time were far-reaching and right in themselves but which are certainly not beneficial for the Western world today and certainly not beneficial for us. </PARA>

Ports are also involved because we actually export the products from there. In my electorate we have to export through the port of Gladstone; that is a great terminal. The Opposition says in the Fightback package that it will privatise ports. I will not comment any further on that matter during the debate on this Bill because I will speak about it during the debate on the Appropriations Bills.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the Coarse Grains Levy Bill and the Coarse Grains Levy (Consequential Provisions) Bill, which are before the House, because I do not want to wander from the point as the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) did tonight. The purpose of the Bill is to impose a levy on certain coarse grains in order to fund research. It introduces new levies on oats and cereal rye. The existing levies on barley and triticale are to be maintained and all of the levies are to be incorporated in a single Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levy revenue will attract matching Commonwealth contributions, and I see that as a very positive point. Further, provision will be made in the Act for other coarse grains to be included if recommended by the relevant grower organisations. I notice that the Bill says that the levy is payable when grain is delivered for processing. However, when grain is used by the producer it will be exempt from the levy. I find this a little hard to follow because, clearly, the farmer who produces these grains and uses them on the farm in order to add value to that grain is gaining a considerable degree from the research funded by other people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do need to monitor the situation where this levy is to be paid at the level where it is delivered to the processor. However, the people who produce these grains and add value to them on the farms&mdash;and in many cases they could be used just for feeding livestock&mdash;are not required to pay the levy. I believe we have to monitor the situation very closely to see that a gaping hole does not emerge there that would allow a fairly large leakage of funds that could well be going to research. I would like to declare my interest in this Bill at this point because I happen to be a grower of barley, oats and sorghum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Murray asks, `Why not triticale?'. Triticale does not grow very well in the rich soils of the Maranoa, particularly around Muckadilla. It may grow well in Victoria, but not in the rich soils of the Darling Downs. So I certainly have a vested interest in this Bill. Only last year I sent money to Canberra to the DPIE for research into barley.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levy rate for oats and cereal rye will be 0.5 per cent of the value of the grain, but there will be a ceiling placed on that, and that is a maximum of 5 per cent. However, barley and triticale are based on a per tonne basis of 75c per tonne for barley and $1 per tonne for triticale. I must say that as a producer I have always been a great believer in a per tonne levy because that allows the industry to determine more accurately the amount of money that is going to be generated by these levies. I just wonder why the industry has agreed on this occasion to vary the methodology that has been used in the past and has gone to this percentage levy rather than sticking to the per tonne levy. Perhaps the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) may have an answer for that. I have always been a great believer in the per tonne levy. It is a bit like a per head slaughter levy, if you like, or a per head transaction levy. It is much better and people are more able to determine the level of funding on a more predictable basis. </PARA>

Most of the triticale grown in Australia is used in animal feeds, mainly for pigs, poultry and lot feeding of cattle. However, there are uses for triticale for human consumption. It is used in flakes and muesli&mdash;obviously it is a health food&mdash;for flour, whole grains and speciality breads. It is also used in the manufacture of triticale macaroni. For those people who are conscious of their diets, and particularly sports men and women who need a high intake of pastas, it is obviously very important that we do encourage further production and research into the qualities of triticale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is really impossible to quantify in dollar terms the value of research and how this research has benefited the Australian agricultural sector, and how it has led to improvements in productivity. Without this research that has been carried out in the past, we would have been left behind long ago in the race to have breeds of cereals such as oats, wheat and barley, and we would not have had products that we could sell on the export markets because our quality would have been much lower than that of our competitors in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I believe our research must do in the future is move in a direction to reduce the plants' dependency on pesticides. There must be continued research to improve the rust resistant varieties that we have today because we are only now just keeping pace with new rust spores which breed in the fields. We are only just staying in front of the race to get plants which are continually more rust resistant than their parent counterparts. We have to get crops that utilise soil nutrients more efficiently, and this certainly can be done by genetic engineering. It is research of this calibre that will give our grain industry a competitive advantage in the international markets because it is not only price that we are talking about when we are selling these products on the international markets; it is all about quality. It could well be baking qualities or protein levels that are very important. I would like to touch on sorghum and maize because there is provision that in future, if the industry decides that sorghum and maize should also make a contribution to research, those levies could be incorporated within this legislation. It is important that we develop better varieties of sorghum and maize. We certainly need to develop varieties which are much more midge resistant than the ones we have today. At present the only method of attack that the industry has to combat attacks from pests such as the midge is by the use of pesticides. Unfortunately, where pesticides are used, it is not only the midge that is eradicated, but also the midge's predator, in this case the little wasp. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our research in future years we must ensure not only that we get better yields and better quality grains, but that the plants are better able to resist attacks, in this case from the midge. By relying more and more on pesticides to remove these pests and not allowing nature to take its full course, we will get to the situation where we become totally dependent on pesticides. There is a golden opportunity for us in Australia to be leaders in this field. Unfortunately, we do not have levies at this stage for sorghum and maize, so obviously this sort of research is being done only by commercial seed companies. It is estimated in Australia that probably only about 10 per cent of the total research that is carried out on sorghum and maize varieties is carried out by commercial firms. The balance of it is carried out in Australia by the State departments of primary industry in their plant breeding research programs. It is obviously very limited by the funds it can have access to without a contribution from the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This really is directly related to the fact that we have for so long relied on overseas countries for the development of new parent varieties in the hybrid sorghum and hybrid maize plants. We have very much relied on the Texas Agricultural University for this research. In fact, the Texas Agricultural University was responsible in the beginning for the breeding of hybrid sorghums. It is the largest plant breeding university in terms of summer maize and sorghum in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So relying on research conducted overseas is not the most efficient way of going about things, and I would urge the grain industry to take a long, hard look at this and come up with some solutions to the way it can levy itself to get more money going into the sorghum and maize industry. Whilst we rely on overseas countries for these new varieties to come on stream all the time, if we want to be efficient we look around the district to see who is the most efficient farmer, who is successfully growing crops, and think, `So and so is a very successful farmer. I'll do exactly what he does next year'. But the only thing is that next year when we do exactly as he did and we look over his fence, we find that what he has done today we do tomorrow and therefore we are not doing it in exactly the same way as he did it. By relying on overseas research in the sorghum and maize industries, we get the benefits later and much more slowly, and we lose that competitive advantage. I would urge the industry to look closely at the area of levies for sorghum and maize. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the future research with respect to these cereal grains needs also to look at lifestyle. As a nation we can capitalise on our research in this area because there has been a tremendous upsurge in the awareness of health foods, not only in Australia but around the world. As lifestyles improve in the Asian area there is obviously going to be an increasing demand for health foods, and cereal grains fit very well into that area. We have only got to look at the significant increase in demands for oats, cereal rye, rye-based biscuits, bread and breakfast cereals. Goodness me, Australia was once a land of steak and eggs for breakfast. Now it is muesli and rye bread toast. </PARA>

It gives farmers the opportunity to diversify into other products other than the traditional ones of wheat, barley and so on but more particularly oats and ryes, and of course this Bill is mainly addressing the levies on these two grains.

So, not only is it better for our farmers in that it is going to give them more opportunities to diversify into crops other than the traditional ones we know today, but also if we do have research in this direction&mdash;namely genetic engineering which looks at plants which are less reliant on pesticides to eliminate some of the pests that attack them&mdash;we could find ourselves at the forefront in this area of research and technology that we as a nation could export. </PARA>

I think we must monitor that aspect of it to ensure that we do not see a gaping hole develop where people can avoid paying the levy just because they add value to the grain on-farm and yet they derive all the benefits of other people's money. I think we must watch that very closely and monitor it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have an opportunity to participate in the debate on this Coarse Grains Levy Bill, the purpose of which is to impose a levy on barley, cereal rye, oats and triticale produced in Australia and, of course, to see that levy matched, as indicated by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), by Commonwealth grants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be those listening to the debate or even those in the House knowing little about coarse grains who imagine that coarse grains are in some way different from other grains and the term `coarse grains' implies a certain vulgarity&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr Bruce Scott interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Maranoa for his interjection. In fact, the term `coarse grains' does not mean that these grains lack any finesse. One should appreciate that coarse grains are a major contributor to Australia's balance of payments and one of our major export crops. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you will be aware, coarse grains constitute Australia's second most important crop after wheat, and barley&mdash;one of the grains being considered by this legislation&mdash;has earned something like $708m, oats $178m, sorghum $136m, and these rank among Australia's top income earners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation, as previous speakers have indicated, leaves unchanged existing barley and triticale levies and extends the coverage that exists for research in the barley and triticale industries into the oats and cereal rye industries. As has also been mentioned, the rates will be set with barley at 75c a tonne, triticale at $1 a tonne, and oats and cereal rye will be 0.5 per cent of net farm gate value to a maximum level of 5 per cent. The levy, as the Minister is well aware, will be set by regulation within those particular limits. It is intended that the legislation before the House will enable 250,000 tonnes to be raised for oats research and 20,000 tonnes to be raised for cereal rye research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is frequently a problem when one participates late in a debate, much of what ought to be said has been said, and the point has already been made by the honourable member for Maranoa, that those who are unfamiliar with triticale ought to be acquainted with the fact that it is a cross between wheat and rye, that it proved attractive because of its drought tolerance and its capacity to adapt to acid soils and, in addition, that much of it is currently being used in the animal feed industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is significant that we are debating these Bills tonight because we are effectively on the verge of what will be much of the 1992 cereal planting season around Australia. With what have been encouraging&mdash;if early, nonetheless encouraging&mdash;opening rains in South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland we can expect, if this is to continue, that there might be a large acreage sown to grains in one form or another around Australia, particularly given the rural recession and the need for rural producers to be particularly productive in the 1992 season. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, Mr Deputy Speaker, it has been suggested that it could well be that we will see wheat tonnages&mdash;and wheat acreages, obviously&mdash;rise and coarse grain tonnages fall, partially because of changes in crop rotation principally because there has been hesitation about planting wheat because of what have been depressed prices over the last two seasons, and these prices, while not turning dramatically around, look as though they are moving the right way this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it needs to be appreciated that because of the move into beef feed lots and to the value adding that this offers to Australia's primary producers, it is expected that in spite of the legislation before the House and in spite of the enthusiasm for coarse grain production, feed grain is likely to be in even more demand than coarse grains in the coming year simply because of the interest in beef feed lots and the expanding beef market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a comment or two about the barley industry in Australia because I represent the electorate of Wakefield, and the electorate of Wakefield includes the York Peninsular, the leg as it were&mdash;some people say the only leg Australia has to stand on&mdash;that characteristic leg of South Australia which claims, not without justification, to be the barley capital of the world. In fact the town of Minlaton, about in the centre of that leg, claims just that title as its town title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to enter into a debate with my colleague the honourable member for Maranoa about who grows the best or highest quality barley, but it is reasonable for me as a South Australian to be participating in this debate because of the importance of the barley industry in South Australia. I should say that legislation currently being considered by the South Australian Parliament directly affects the barley industry and deals with the issue of whether or not the South Australian Barley Board ought to be appointed or elected. This matter of sensitivity currently being dealt with both by the farmers organisation in South Australia and in the Parliament needs to be dealt with speedily or South Australian growers may well find themselves outmanoeuvred by decisions to change barley administration in the eastern States of Australia anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my focus on barley I want to point out that all the figures would indicate that beer consumption is rising in Asia, and this provides a real opportunity for an expanding export market in malting barley both out of South Australia and in the other States of the Commonwealth. Dr Kavanagh of Carlton and United Breweries has indicated that there are real opportunities for quality Australian barley to be used in this expanding beer market in Asian destinations. I would hope that part of the impetus that will be given as a result of the legislation before the House, and the opportunity for additional funding, will be an impetus encouraged by the Grains Research and Development Corporation to develop barleys which will be marketable for their high quality rather than simply having to compete on price. There is little doubt that quality will be a major consideration as we endeavour to break into malting barley markets, particularly the Japanese market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we ought to recognise that what has happened to barley production in South Australia and is happening to barley production around Australia is that as a result of research, particularly varietal research, we have had increasing tonnages of barley available from paddocks that have been cropped year in and year out and available in spite of falling farm inputs. That, of course, is a real credit to research. That is the direction that has been characteristic of Australian agriculture and a direction that ought to be applauded by this Parliament. In fact, it is acknowledged by both sides of the House this evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the success of farm research has been due to the work that has been done in the paddock and in various selected lots where researchers have been determined in their genetic selection and have come up with superior barley lines that have enabled barley to stand in storms and not shed the grain that normally is shed as a result of storm damage to barley crops. However, as well, the success is the result of what I think has been characteristic of Australian primary production&mdash;very effective extension. I doubt whether there is another industry in Australia that can claim to have been as effective in its extension as has Australian agricultural research generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know there are many who despair about agricultural research and say there are farmers who are not availing themselves of the latest techniques. There is some justification for that concern. But if one looks&mdash;and you are familiar with it, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;at the changes in farm practice over the last two decades, particularly at the emphasis on the astute use of chemicals in agriculture, one sees as a result of minimum tillage techniques a dramatic increase in production without a dramatic increase in inputs. Much of this is a tribute to and a result of what has been very effective farm extension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incredibly, of course, this farm extension has resulted principally from the sharing of information among farmers. Farmers have been prepared and inclined to take what has been information available from departmental officers and opened their individual farms to field days so that their neighbours may see what are the best techniques to adopt and what effectively works most usefully in one area as compared with another area. I think this sense of sharing available research ought to be lauded and recognised. This legislation encourages further research, but the effectiveness of this research and the way in which it is applied to meet the needs of Australia in regard to increased export opportunities will largely be determined by the way that research is made available to farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to applaud organisations such as the bureau movements around Australia which, without any political base at all, and without even an agro-political axe to grind, have simply dedicated themselves to making sure that farm groups avail themselves of the latest research, the research that we are seeking to fund here this evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are just two other comments I want to make. I want to pick up the point made by the honourable member for Maranoa when he referred to a health conscious society. It is true that there has been an increasing dependence on cereals in our diet, and that is to be applauded. Of course, we have seen an increasing demand for oats as a result of the enthusiasm for oat based cereals. This is reflected in sales and in what I hope will ultimately be a healthier society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my other comment I want to look briefly at the cereal rye industry. This industry has not received a great deal of attention, but in electorates such as mine and in a State like mine where rainfall is in such short supply, cereal rye has played an important role in ensuring that sandhills that would otherwise be drifting, particularly in the Mallee soils of South Australia, in areas such as Wanbi and spots in the northern Mallee, are locked in place. Whilst it has been easy for people to see the sandhills as being the result of careless vegetation removal by farmers, the fact is that it is those same farmers who are now holding sandhills that previous generations were not able to secure. Much of the success in stemming the spread of sand drift has been the result of the very careful use of cereal rye and the development of cereal rye varieties which are drought tolerant and in fact able to steadily make their way in the face of what has previously been seen as an unassailable assault of drifting sand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before the House deals principally with the question of grain research. There are great opportunities no doubt for genetic engineering and great opportunities to develop even more new varieties which will allow us to capitalise on the facilities that we have in Australia to continue to be a major source of food for the rest of the world. I would like to applaud and support the legislation before the House and encourage the emphasis on genetic engineering in the hope of producing high quality grain and of maintaining our reputation as a nation, from a grain trading point of view, well worth dealing with. I support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In an attempt to be helpful to the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), who questioned the use of ad valorem levies in relation to the Coarse Grains Levy Bill and the Coarse Grains Levy (Consequential Provisions) Bill, I am advised that the introduction of value based levies for oats and cereal rye at the request of the Grains Council of Australia reflects the Council's policy of relating the amount of levy payable more directly to the return received by the producer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have before the House the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992, which is an omnibus Bill to amend various Acts in the Attorney-General's portfolio. The coalition will not be opposing the passage of the Bill. The Bill amends three Acts: the Judges' Pensions Act 1968, the Defence Force Discipline Appeals Act 1955 and the Family Law Act 1975. As the adjournment will be moved in approximately eight minutes, I will take the seemingly simple matter of the Judges' Pensions Act first and seek leave to continue my remarks on the other aspects of the Bill on a later day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is proposed to amend the Judges' Pensions Act to remove the current limitation that a pension payable to the surviving spouse of a judge or a retired judge ceases to be payable on remarriage. Subsections 7(2) and 8(2) of the Act currently provide that, if a widow in receipt of a pension remarries, the pension ceases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed new subsection 8A(1) will provide that a surviving spouse who has lost her or his entitlement to a pension by virtue of having remarried may apply to the Attorney-General for restoration of the pension. The Attorney-General may direct that a pension be restored where he or she is satisfied that the applicant is in need or that the restoration of the pension is otherwise justified. The Attorney-General may, in special circumstances, direct that a pension be restored from a date earlier than the date of application. However, that date, of course, must not be earlier than the commencement date of the Act. Where a decision is made under subsection 8A(1) not to restore a pension, the Attorney-General must give written notice of that decision and include the reasons for the decision and notification of the applicant's entitlement to apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments will bring the entitlements of judges' widows who have remarried broadly in line with those of widows of public servants and politicians. There appears to be one main difference, which is that the amendments to the Judges' Pensions Act do not give widows who have previously lost their pension due to remarriage an automatic entitlement to the pension. These widows need to apply to the Attorney-General, who will then restore the pension if he is satisfied that the person is in need or that the restoration is otherwise justified. In the future, the repeal of the sections prohibiting payment of the pension on remarriage will most likely mean that the pension will automatically continue as it does for the widows of politicians and public servants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is fine as far as the judges' pensions are concerned, but I take this brief opportunity to remind the House of this Government's poor record when it comes to judicial salaries and judicial independence. It was approximately a year ago that I referred the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) to an extraordinary letter written by the Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Anthony Mason, to the Remuneration Tribunal. In his letter Sir Anthony referred to the Government's treatment of the judiciary and in particular the Government's attitude to judicial salaries. Sir Anthony, in writing about the proposals to increase the remuneration payable to senior law officers, namely, the Solicitor-General&mdash;that was a saga in itself in addition to the salary that the Attorney-General sought to pay him&mdash;and the Director of Public Prosecutions, said of the proposals that they:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . indicate a want of understanding of the constitutional position of the judiciary and the relationship which that position requires to be preserved between the judiciary and the Executive Government. More than that, when viewed in light of the history of salary determinations in recent years, they indicate an apparent want of understanding on the part of the Government of the nature and significance of the role of the judiciary. That want of understanding has led to an erosion of the remuneration and status of the judiciary.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>They are not my words; they are the words of the Chief Justice appealing to the Government to recognise the diminished standing of the judiciary that has occurred during the period of this Government. Whilst the Attorney was falling over himself at that juncture to look after the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Solicitor-General&mdash;as I say, that was in advance of all the other cosseting he sought to provide for the Solicitor-General&mdash;he was, in the words of the Chief Justice, diminishing the status of the judiciary, which is fundamental to our system of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each time I have raised the issue, the Attorney has been unable satisfactorily to enlighten me or anybody else of his understanding of the independence of the judiciary. I remind the Attorney again that the evil of this erosion of judicial salaries will continue as a threat to judicial independence as long as sporadic and partial correction of the process of erosion is left to depend on the very arms of government of which the judiciary should be independent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The judiciary is dependent on the Executive for effective initiation and the legislature for implementation of reform of the present system. There is some merit&mdash;I am not proposing it today&mdash;in the suggestion that there be an independent tribunal free from government and trade union pressure to determine the appropriate levels of judicial remuneration, subject, of course, to the Parliament's constitutional responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that there is a nexus in this arena which the Attorney has long denied in terms of the standing and status of the judiciary. It continues to concern me, not so much because of the particular levels and types of remuneration, but rather because of the chaotic and disorderly manner in which they are currently arrived at. I raise these matters again today in the hope that the Attorney will reconsider the misguided position he has adopted on this issue and appreciate that the matter of remuneration bears directly on judicial independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the commencement of my remarks I referred to two other pieces of legislation which the Bill also deals with. These are the Defence Force Discipline Appeals Act 1955 and the Family Law Act, those two Acts, in addition to the Judges Pension Act, being amended by this omnibus Bill. I just say before the adjournment is moved that the Bill in seeking to amend the Defence Force Discipline Appeals Act provides that the Minister rather than the Governor-General may approve leave of absence for members of the Defence Force Discipline Appeals Tribunal. This will simplify the process of approving leave of absence for members of the Tribunal and really requires no further comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, the Bill also makes a number of minor amendments to the Family Law Act.

<PARA>Not being a technical person, that is absolute gobbledegook to me; in fact, it is a very lame excuse indeed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can stand here confidently in this House and raise these important issues knowing that, if I say anything outside the House which could result in my being called before a judge, in this place I am protected under privilege. It is a privilege that is not used lightly but, importantly, in the public interest. Unfortunately, journalists are not afforded these same privileges, but they seek to protect those very same interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This dilemma between ethics and the law has spurred protests, not only of Mr Budd's professional colleagues but also those in the wider community who recognise the importance of an unmuzzled media. Australia is a modern democracy characterised by the presence of a free media. The proper operation of the media relies on the rights, freedom of expression and access to information. The information is available to journalists from a variety of sources including&mdash;dare I say it&mdash;high ranking politicians and from people who fear victimisation if they were to be identified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was the case that resulted in Joe Budd putting his personal freedom aside. Yet the judicial system has ruled that this is wrong. I call upon my fellow members on both of the sides of the House to help change the law which put Joe Budd in gaol and to prevent other journalists from facing the walls of a prison cell for simply doing their job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My message is particularly aimed at the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and his State counterparts who have set the reform wheels in motion. These laws must be changed expeditiously to ensure that the public's right to know continues unhindered. The Standing Committee of Attorneys-General has discussed the matter. A model Bill was drafted and included in a report by the Australian Law Reform Commission. The Bill was circulated and comments sought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A new Bill is currently being drafted by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and the revised draft Bill will be presented to the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in July 1992. I compliment the Federal Attorney-General and his Department for the work they have put in. It certainly requires the cooperation of all the States to ensure that we do improve this law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point that, were it not for people with courage like Woodward and Bernstein, Watergate would not have been exposed; were it not for people like Phil Dickie, the Fitzgerald inquiry would not have happened. I believe in the proposition put forward by Thomas Jefferson so many years ago: our freedom does depend upon the freedom of the press. That can never be limited without being lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a principle that members on both sides of the House should support and all parliaments should collectively work together to improve this process. As I have said, the Federal Attorney-General is working on that. My thoughts tonight go to Joe Budd who is in Boggo Road gaol. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sadly, I have to report to the House the death of Friedrich August von Hayek, economist, political philosopher and Nobel prize winner, at the advanced age of 92.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Friedrich von Hayek was born in Vienna in 1899 and became a naturalised British citizen in 1938. After 10 years of employment in the civil service and teaching in Vienna, Hayek occupied the Tooke Chair of Economics at London University from 1931 to 1950. Between 1950 and 1962 he was a Professor of Social and Moral Sciences at the University of Chicago. Returning to Europe, he was a professor at Freiburg from 1962 to 1968 and at Salzburg from 1968 to 1977. His Nobel prize for economics, shared with Gunnar Myrdal, was awarded in 1974. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hayek was a towering figure in the economics and politics of liberty and free markets. In his early career before the Second World War he concentrated on relatively technical questions. However, in the late 1930s he turned to more fundamental issues and in 1944 published <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Road to Serfdom</EMPHASIS>, which revealed his new focus on the problems of individual values in a world of increased economic controls. He argued the case for an economic system based on free markets and a political system granting individual freedom within the law. The interaction between economic freedom and individual liberty was a recurring theme in his work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hayek was no supporter of laissez faire. Like the thinkers in the Freiburg School of the 1940s on whose work Ludwig Erhard based his revival of post-war West Germany, Hayek believed in a stable and predictable social and economic order within which people would be free to organise their lives. An important element of a stable framework was price stability;  that is, negligible inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Curiously, Hayek's ideas, which tidied up the classical liberalism of earlier thinkers such as Adam Smith and related the basic principles of liberalism to the modern world, did not begin to dominate the intellectual climate until Hayek's old age.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Road to Serfdom</EMPHASIS> in 1944 Hayek warned Europe's intellectuals that they were making a grave mistake going down the socialist path. In distinguishing between the state totalitarianism of Stalin, for which they had considerable sympathy, and that of Hitler or Mussolini, of which they disapproved, they were guilty of a grave misapprehension. Further, he pointed out that lesser forms of socialism, such as those practised subsequently by Britain and Sweden, would not work either and if pursued to their logical conclusion would eventually lead to the snuffing out of human freedom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Western intellectuals had heeded Hayek in 1944 and not, as they shamefully did, heaped him with contumely, an enormous amount of human suffering could have been avoided. The Soviet empire would almost certainly have collapsed earlier and countless Third World countries would not have been encouraged to embrace the disastrous centralist economic models that so many of them did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge honourable members who have not read <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Road to Serfdom</EMPHASIS> to do so. In it they will get a taste of the extraordinary vision and depth of understanding of this remarkable man. They will also see laid out the explanation of what happened to the world between the end of the war and the collapse of communism in 1989, written during the war and published 45 years before those events reached their climax. Countless millions owe their freedom and prosperity to Friedrich von Hayek without ever having heard his name. Countless more millions suffered tyranny for too long because his words were not heeded. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring the attention of the House to an event of considerable significance in my electorate of Oxley. As honourable members will be aware, RAAF Base Amberley has been an integral part of the Ipswich region for many years;  in fact, well over 50. On Monday, 16 March last week, celebrations were held at Amberley to acknowledge 50 years of service to the Australian Defence Force by No. 3 Aircraft Depot and 482 Maintenance Squadron and to acknowledge the formation of 501 Wing, which is the RAAF's newest and biggest unit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The celebrations included a parade of No. 3 Aircraft Depot's Queen's Colours and the Governor-General's banner of 482 Squadron. This parade was the last occasion on which the colours of the two units were publicly paraded, a matter of considerable significance in RAAF history and the history of the Amberley Base. Those who attended included the former Governor of New South Wales, His Excellency Air Marshall Sir James Rowland. The RAAF Air Command Band was flown up from RAAF Base Richmond to take part in the colours parade. There was also a less welcome visitor at the celebrations, with Cyclone Fran making her presence felt. This meant that there was a heavy downpour throughout the whole ceremony which spoilt the day somewhat. However, the RAAF's wet weather capabilities came to the fore, ensuring the success of the event in spite of the bad weather. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a matter of considerable sadness to many people in the Ipswich region that 3AD and 482 Squadron ceased operations in their golden jubilee year. However, the units have been reformed within the new 501 Wing. No. 3 Aircraft Depot was officially formed at Amberley in 1942 and consisted of one officer and 106 airmen. During its 50-year history the unit serviced over 30 different types of aircraft, including many which have played a vital role in our national defence, such as the Tiger Moth, the Sabre, the Phantom, the Canberra&mdash;I think honourable members would have noticed the Canberra at Fairbairn when we arrived here yesterday&mdash;the Iroquois, the Chinook and, of course, the F111. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The support services provided by the depot were recognised in March 1980 when it received the Queen's Colours. When the depot was disbanded, it employed over 25 officers and 650 airmen, as well as 30 civilians. No-one can argue that the depot made a significant contribution in ensuring the operational readiness of the RAAF throughout its 50 years existence. The unit lived up to its motto of `Excel', an indication of the high skill level its personnel obtained, having received the Defence Productivity Award in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No. 482 Maintenance Squadron originated at RAAF Base Laverton, Victoria, with the formation of No. 4 Repair and Salvage Unit on 18 May 1942. The unit became No. 482 Squadron with its move to Amberley in 1946, a part of the No. 82 Bomber Wing. During the 1950s the squadron provided support to the wing during the process of conversion from Lincoln to Canberra aircraft. An example of the important contribution this unit has made to the general community is the equipment it prepared for flood relief operations in Queensland and northern New South Wales in its time at the base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delivery of the first F111C aircraft to Amberley in June 1973 meant a change in roles for 482 Squadron. The squadron became responsible for the maintenance of the F111Cs used by No. 1 and No. 6 Squadrons throughout Australia in exercises in Malaysia, New Zealand, Hawaii and the United States mainland. No. 482 Squadron received the Governor-General's banner in 1981 in recognition of its 40 years of service to our nation's defence. Throughout its 50-year history, the Unit made a significant contribution to the operational effectiveness of the Royal Australian Air Force. It lived up to its motto, `Trenchant', a word defined in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Oxford Dictionary</EMPHASIS> as `vigorous, penetrating and decisive'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of its tremendous record of service, it was necessary to merge the two units into the new 501 Wing to meet the logistic needs of the RAAF as the nation enters the twenty-first century. The two units will shortly be joined in the new wing by the Weapons Systems Logistics Management Squadron from Victoria. Group Captain Chris Tyler, the last commander of No. 3AD, has become the first commander of 501 Wing, ensuring the historical link between the old and the new units. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that all members of the Ipswich community wish Group Captain Tyler and his Defence Force personnel there well in their new role and recognise the contribution the units that 501 Wing is replacing have made. I am sure that all members of this House join me in acknowledging the fine contribution that the defence personnel of 3AD and 482 Squadron have made to the RAAF in their 50 years of service to Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) To determine how much work has been undertaken by each inspector who is headquartered in a town where the abattoir has closed would require the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) to examine all time sheets and rosters prepared for each establishment since the day it was closed. In the case of Bendigo abattoir more than seven years of records would have to be scrutinised. I am not persuaded that it would serve the public interest to devote the large staff resources necessary to this task. I can inform the honourable member that AQIS' practice is to employ such inspectors as part of the established pool of inspection staff who regularly provide relief duties for other staff on authorised leave or undergoing training. Where appropriate such inspectors have been given priority in AQIS' current redundancy program. The cost of maintaining surplus inspection staff is not a charge to industry under the cost recovery system unless work is actually performed.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) paid all costs associated with the hardship allowance paid to the officer who was suspended from duty without pay.

As a consequence the payments made to the officer did not contribute, in any way, to the total costs recovered from primary producers.</PARA>
