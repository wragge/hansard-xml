<PARA>What I was referring to when I referred to the Budget statements was the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, to maintain the structure of the revenue base and reduce the prospective deficit for 1995-96 the Government is prepared to consider reforms to the domestic interest withholding tax, the scope of the PPS arrangements and the FBT system (to make more neutral the taxation of remuneration in cash and kind), if nearer to the time the prospective deficit is as now projected. Adoption of such measures could yield between $2 billion and $3 billion which would point to a Budget deficit of between half and one per cent of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA>Far from there being no inclusion in the Budget Speech of these measures which were forecast as perhaps having some impact in 1995-96, far from their being left out, they were quite explicitly put in. Beyond that, as the Prime Minister announced not 20 minutes ago, I will be making an announcement tomorrow about the Government's quite specific intentions as far as these matters are concerned.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;that this Government has not continually increased the size of the public sector. This year the estimated size of Commonwealth outlays as a proportion of GDP is 27.0 per cent, which compares with 28.8 per cent in the last year of the Fraser Government in 1982-83. At one stage three years ago we were down to 23 1/2 per cent, but that has come back up to 27 per cent with the impact of the recession. But it is still well below that of the previous Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, our public sector is not large by the standards of other developed countries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was 5 per cent below the OECD average and 10 per cent below Germany's public sector, an economy which has been enormously successful. The Opposition's answer to that is that we should match best practice. The honourable member for Curtin said during a debate in this House last week that we should be looking at countries in the Asia-Pacific area to match best practice in the public sector. If he means countries such as Hong Kong, where outlays as a proportion of GDP are 15 per cent, compared with the total public sector in this country of 35 per cent, then he is talking about the decimation of the public sector in this country. He is talking about Hong Kong rates of unemployment benefits, which are zero. Of course, that fits in with Captain Zero.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is talking about pensions at $33 a week compared with pensions in this country of $153 a week. That is what he is talking about. If we are going to match the so-called best practice of the Asian countries, then we are looking at the decimation of the public sector. If that is the Opposition's agenda, then let us see it more fully spelled out by the Leader of the Opposition. The question was also asked: what would be the effect on the economy and employment growth of slashing the public sector? The Opposition's policy is to cut the public sector by reducing outlays by $6 billion or $7 billion: about 1 1/2 per cent of GDP. Clearly, that would have the effect of reducing economic and employment growth in this country at present, inhibiting economic recovery and cutting the growth of employment, because that much demand is being taken out of the system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is the Opposition's policy on outlays, what else is there about the Opposition's policy which would create jobs? Is it tariff cuts? The Leader of the Opposition says that the Opposition's tariff policy would create a bigger car industry in this country. We can accept that that is true: it will create a bigger car industry somewhere else&mdash;in Japan, in South Korea, in Germany, in the United States, but not in this country.</PARA>

Business pays the tax either way. So what is employment creating about that? Absolutely nothing. They also say that their micro-economic reform will be employment creating, but they ignore the great sweep of micro-economic reform taking place at present. They give no detail as to how they would bring about faster micro-economic reform and, even if they did achieve it, the initial impact would be to reduce employment growth. There is absolutely no reason to believe that the Opposition policy would promote employment; it is far more likely to be the opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Group training companies play a vital role in our apprenticeship and traineeship systems. They operate by employing apprentices and then providing a series of placements for each apprentice with different host employers. What this does is open up employment and training opportunities with smaller firms which would otherwise not be able to take on an apprentice for the full period of indenture. They are a very important link now in our training system and between the training system and small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are about 100 group training companies spread across the country. They are linked now with some 22,000 host employers and they work with 14,000 apprentices. Honourable members can see in that mismatch of numbers the extent to which small business does rely on them to be able to provide at least a partial training opportunity in a series of small businesses that could not hope to complete a training program for the average apprentice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have recently introduced a series of measures to enhance these programs. One Nation, for example, provided $6m for innovative projects. That program was further enhanced in the youth strategy to provide for projects especially in housing, tourism and hospitality. In One Nation there is an extra $40m for pre-vocational courses. State Ministers have been asked to involve group training schemes in the delivery of these courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The youth employment strategy also introduced a special incentive payment of $3,000 for every new first year apprentice taken on by a group training company in 1992-93. The impact of that is already apparent. Just over $2m has been committed for 38 group training projects with a potential to provide over 1,200 opportunities for young people. These include major projects such as the Gold Coast scheme to build up to 60 houses, employing 85 new apprentices, and they actually also include a smaller innovative program&mdash;indeed, there is one in the honourable member's own electorate of Port Adelaide&mdash;where there is a move by third and fourth year apprentices to construct a tourist walkway through a wetland area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So group training companies are going to play a major role in the delivery of new and more flexible entry level training services, also under Carmichael. These companies are critical to the training programs in our society and absolutely critical to small business. There is one scheme that would perform a very direct threat to the activities of these group training companies: the application of a 15 per cent consumption tax to their services.</PARA>

That totals $26 billion. So there is $27 billion collected, and $26 billion is spent on knocking out the wholesale sales tax, the payroll tax, the petrol excise and the compensation package.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House censures the Treasurer for his deliberate attempts to mislead the people of Australia about the Government's secret tax agenda.</PARA>
<PARA>We have seen today a constant refusal by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) to answer simple questions about the processes which led up to the drafting and final presentation of the Budget just one month ago. This Government today has been caught out clearly fudging the wording of the Budget to give Australians a false impression that new taxes were only some vague possibility off into the future when in fact the truth is that the Cabinet revenue committee itself had given the new taxes the go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government members were saying one thing to the Australian people, but when they walked into this Parliament they knew that in fact they had made a decision to proceed with the imposition of new taxes. If anybody had any shadow of doubt about that whatsoever, it has been made clear by the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) today at the Press Club that the Government will actually introduce the legislation and a major statement by the Treasurer tomorrow, as these new taxes are in fact to be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After having said in the Budget, `Oh look, this is only a possibility; it might happen, it might not happen, and of course we can't tell now because this is all something that could happen in 1994, 1995 or 1996', we now find within a month that in fact the whole secret tax agenda was sitting in the bottom drawer and honourable members on the Government side have been forced to present it as a result of the fact that we have been hounding them to come clean with their hidden and secret tax agenda. I must say that it is a classic example of how the Labor Party will do and say anything to get itself re-elected. Setting out deliberately to mislead the Australian Parliament and the Australian people about its intentions is the pinnacle of its deceit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are four things that can be said about the Labor Party, four things which are clear in all it does, in all its presentations to the Australian people. Firstly, it always promises you the earth. It is always full of statements that if you vote for and support the Labor Party then things will be better. Remember this one: `This is the Budget that is going to bring home the bacon.'? Remember in 1989, after the Budget, Government members said, `We are entering a golden era of economic change.'? Remember that in 1990 the now Prime Minister said, `I won't let there be a recession.'? Those opposite are always full of promises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, they have no answers. If ever you have seen a demonstration of a government bereft of any solutions to the problems that it has created, it was the appalling and pathetic performance of the Prime Minister today at the National Press Club. He is the one who engineered this recession; he is the one who has been pulling the levers to see nearly one million people unemployed in this country; he is the one who has been in charge of economic policy as our debt has gone from $23 billion to $148 billion. So what do those opposite do? They attack the coalition. They attack the coalition in the absence of any alternative economic policy from the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, those on the Government side always say that things are going to be better. Secondly, in the absence of their own policies they always attack the coalition. Thirdly, they abandon the very people they claim to represent, the men and women of the Australian work force. Yet with the Government's own tax cuts, which it is still sticking to rigidly, half of Australia's taxpayers, those earning under $20,700, will get absolutely nothing. Those opposite have the gall to say that their 30c rate matches our tax cuts when half of the Australian taxpaying population, and very arguably those most in need, get nothing. Of course, Labor has been responsible for so many unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, and this brings me to the particular censure motion today, this is a government which is totally expedient. Those opposite are the sorts of people who believe that it is clever politically to lie and cheat about the circumstances in which Australia now finds itself. They think it is smart to deceive people. They think that if they can fool some of the people some of the time, somehow it is good politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, what we saw in the presentation of the Budget was a classic example of Labor setting out deliberately to deceive people. You can imagine those opposite sitting there saying, `This is good politics, this is clever politics'. It is not clever politics and it is certainly not good for the future of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ever since Fightback was released we have seen Labor struggling, day in, day out, to put up some sort of response to the alternative vision which Fightback provides for this country. Its first major attempt to do that was, of course, in the One Nation statement in February. When you wipe aside all the data and what all the economists say about it, the fact is that honourable members on the Government side did not have the money to match our tax cuts, our tax package. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And they are still short, as the Leader of the Opposition says. The reason for that is they were never prepared to undertake major tax reform. So what did those opposite do? They hid their incapacity, their deficiency in the numbers, by pretending that the Australian economy would grow bigger than it otherwise would.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the whole thing was based on deceit, with the motive of Government members being to answer what the coalition had put forward in Fightback. Within about six months, as we headed towards the middle of the year, and by the time of the Budget, they basically had to admit that they did not have the money to match the comprehensive set of tax reforms and the substantial income tax cuts which are within the Fightback program. People should understand the dimension of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those people in the gallery, I point out that in our tax package we are proposing the abolition of seven taxes. We propose to abolish fuel tax, which will save people 19c a litre every time they go into the local petrol station. We are also proposing the biggest income tax cut in Australia's history&mdash;a massive reduction in the amount of income tax&mdash;so that people will have a lot more money in their pockets. In fact, it will be about one-third less than what they pay now, and most Australians will never pay more than 30c in the dollar. We are going to lift the tax-free threshold from $5,400 to $7,000&mdash;320,000 people will not pay any tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The differences between our tax policy and Labor's tax policy are like chalk and cheese; they are beyond comparison. But Labor is running a lie. The lie is that it is matching our income tax cuts in the proposals that it put up in One Nation. Honourable members on the Government side have been absolutely desperate for months now to hide the fact from the Australian people that they do not have the money to even put up the paltry proposals that they are now presenting. As we came into this recent Budget, the Government was under a lot of pressure.

So here we have the Government going into this forthcoming Budget&mdash;its last chance Budget going up to the next election&mdash;and it is desperate to hide the massive hole that it has in its funding package to meet the income tax cuts which the Government needs for the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That committee sat down and came to a decision, which was to introduce three new taxes effectively in the prescribed payments system; to introduce a withholding tax on interest income in bank accounts; and a very considerable expansion of the fringe benefits tax. The committee did not just make a decision in broad terms only, it made a decision on how those taxes would be introduced, what the estimates of the revenue were and the precise timetable for the introduction of those new taxes. So this was no sort of fly by night scheme or a last minute attempt to fix the problem. This was an inevitable culmination of the pressures building up within the Labor Party's ranks to prepare them for the big fight going into the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So here we have a specific decision from the revenue committee of Cabinet&mdash;it might as well have been a decision of the full Cabinet as it carries the weight of the full Cabinet. The reason I say that is that it was so serious about the introduction of these taxes that, particularly with respect to the fringe benefits tax, the whole detail was actually put into the Budget. Things do not get into the Budget unless they carry the highest authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We find that that happened within a week or 10 days to go&mdash;I do not know&mdash;before the delivery of the Budget. I might add that there was another pressure on the Government, which it has never admitted but which is true, and that is that it made a decision in the Expenditure Review Committee to privatise further shares of the Commonwealth Bank. The Prime Minister knocked that off, leaving another hole in the numbers, so that was another pressure on the Government. </PARA>

So here we have going into the Budget a decision to increase a range of taxes. We know from what the Treasurer actually said in the Budget that they are looking at $2 billion to $3 billion. This is a major decision, incorporated into the Budget and on track to be announced in the Parliament on 18 August, on Budget night. At the last moment the Prime Minister and the Treasurer sit down in a room on their own and decide that they do not like the political prospects of an attack from the coalition which says, `Oh, you've got income tax cuts, but you are going to pay for them by tax increases elsewhere'. Do honourable members know why I know the Government is so sensitive about that? It is because when the Treasurer responded, I think it was to the first question in Question Time after the Budget, his line was, `We can pay for ours without additional tax increases'. Government members concocted a story and walked into the Parliament deliberately intending to mislead the Australian public about what their intentions were.

His line on the night was, `Well, we'll work all this out in three or four years time. We won't be able to work it out until three or four years time because these things are all into the future. This is all prospective'. The Treasurer might remember that, when we pursued him, by the end of the week his first claim was that there would be a discussion paper out before the election. Within a few days of that it got out to weeks or months.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to the black economy in a moment. The Prime Minister went through the arithmetic of the funding of Fightback earlier today. He said that Fightback would raise $27 billion. But the Opposition is going to give $26 billion of it back before it even looks at personal income tax. Firstly, $4 billion goes on a so-called compensation package&mdash;a woefully inadequate compensation package; nevertheless, a compensation package. Next, $9 billion of it goes on eliminating the wholesale sales tax; $6 billion of it goes on relieving payroll taxes on business; and $7 billion goes on relieving petrol taxes. There we have $26 billion of the $27 billion being handed back in these ways before the Opposition even contemplates the idea of the personal income tax cuts which it says will cost $13 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members say, `But we have this $10 billion worth of expenditure cuts'&mdash;and other tax changes which they intend to inflict upon Australia. I use the word `inflict' advisedly because many of these measures, if ever implemented,  would go to the heart of the fabric of society in Australia and rip away the support which most Australians, particularly poor Australians, have taken for granted. They would tear at the quality of our health system and tear at the quality of our education and school system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if Opposition members were able to inflict that damage on Australia, on the say-so of the Department of Finance and the Treasury, those measures would amount to only $6 billion. There we have the kind of shortfall which the Opposition has to confront if it is going to fund its $13 billion of tax cuts. Maybe $6 billion will come from expenditure reductions and other measures, but where is the rest of the money coming from? It does not matter how many times we ask; the Leader of the Opposition and his Deputy just squirm away; they slide away from any consideration of those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition makes the absurd claim that he is going to deal with the black economy. He says that only with a GST can we deal with the black economy. The Victorian Employers Federation, in a paper which is cited in the Fightback documentation, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both systems &mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>a retail sales tax and a value added tax&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">miss the cash, underground or black economy . . . both the RST and VAT are subject to some tax evasion and avoidance. . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Federation says. It stupidly produced a table in the back which apparently tried to demonstrate the size of the black economy in various countries. Where do we find the black economy is biggest? In the countries that have a GST. Where is it lowest? In the countries that do not. On their own say-so, it is the countries that do not have a GST or a value added tax, such as Switzerland and the United States, where the black economy so described by them is the smallest; it is the largest where a GST actually exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an important question of compliance, and I will be dealing with that in part tomorrow. That is not the only question that has to be answered by the Opposition. There is another matter that the Prime Minister has rightly raised about the $4 billion necessary to fund roads in this country when the Opposition has already embraced the idea of a user pays principle in relation to road funding. What is the answer to that? The answer has been hanging in the ether for as long as Fightback has been around but the Opposition refuses to answer it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite then say that they will confer a $20 billion benefit on business when it is business which is going to collect this $27 billion. How can they confer a benefit on business when at the same time they ask those same businesses to collect this $27 billion?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How unfair is the impact of this collection? The cost of the collection will fall most heavily on the smallest businesses. For some of the larger businesses already computerised maybe the cost will not be so punitive. Hundreds and thousands of small businesses around Australia will all be inflicted with this task, many of whom are not subject to the wholesale sales tax now, many of whom are not subject to payroll tax now. They will not be relieved from those obligations because they do not pay them, but they will be inflicted with a new and penal obligation in regard to the collection of GST. We find from Canada and New Zealand just how painful that exercise is for small businesses, particularly those family businesses which have to forfeit their weekends in order to comply with the rules which will be imposed upon them as they have to go round doing the dirty work for the Opposition, doing the dirty work for the Liberal Party, as they collect that $27 billion for any government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other issues which the Opposition has to confront, including the effect this entire package will have on Australian families. Seventy per cent of Australian households will be worse off as a result of the imposition of these measures upon them. These are the questions which need to be answered.

The current sales tax legislation, called `simplification of sales tax', manages to pick up on a whole range of new items into sales tax for the first time, including one category of farm grain trucks. So the Prime Minister should get it right. His legislation is wrapping into sales tax for the first time ever a new category of farm grain trucks which will apply a 20 per cent sales tax to trucks, including the sugar industry trucks, the trucks that cart the sugar down from the Atherton Tablelands to the Mossman sugar mill by road. People are not pleased with the new sales tax legislation picking up farm trucks in the way that it does. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We tend to forget where the Treasurer came from in terms of his own economic views. We all make a maiden speech in this place, and I would like to quote from the Treasurer's&mdash;Mr Dawkins's, that is, just in case anyone does not know whom I am talking about, considering that the Treasurers change from time to time. Let me quote from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> so there is no doubt. When he was talking about Australia, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet this economy has failed as capitalist economies have failed around the world. It is not surprising that Australia's capitalist system has faltered because capitalism by its nature is ill-fitted to respond to the demands of a just and equitable society.</PARA>
<PARA>That is from the man who now runs the Australian economy; it is also straight out of the mouth of the honourable member for Calwell. What about this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is quite clear that the capitalist system as it operates in Australia is incapable of maintaining balance in terms of economic activity and is also incapable of providing social and economic justice without some  involvement by the Government. I want to argue that a far greater degree of government involvement is necessary in order that the worst excesses of capitalism might be avoided.</PARA>
<PARA>Maybe I should go on a little further to where he attacks home ownership. Here he is giving a couple of examples of the worst things about capitalism. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first no doubt is the failure of previous governments to provide sufficient funds for State-owned inexpensive rental housing.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not an unreasonable statement. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has meant that most of the rental housing available is privately owned by people intent on making a profit. The high rents that inevitably resulted only served to make the purchase of a house on a mortgage basis relatively more attractive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This process was spurred on by speculative builders and advertising agencies which brain-washed the community into believing that owning one's own home was not only cheaper but indeed was the only Australian thing to do. By playing on the acquisitiveness and status-consciousness of the Australian people, these operators were able to be extremely successful. To finance this heightened and indeed artificially created demand for housing the financial institutions unleashed a flood of funds which were loaned at variable interest rates. These lenders operated largely outside the umbrella of government control&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>a matter of great worry to the Treasurer in those days&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and purported to possess the respectability of banks without having the wherewithal to back it up. When times are flush, when there is full employment and easy credit, this system operates deceptively well. However, when times are harsh&mdash;and it is endemic to capitalism that economic activity is punctuated by at least minor booms and slumps&mdash;then the story is quite different. The once proud home buyer realises he has been hooked. He realises that behind the rosy propaganda is the lie. He finds he is committed probably for the greater portion of his working life to something he does not really need to own&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>a house&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and probably cannot afford. The promise that capitalism in this country makes in regard to private ownership is indeed an illusion.</PARA>
<PARA>Have you ever heard the likes of it? Straight out of the mouth of the honourable member for Calwell. He was probably the Treasurer's speech writer at the time. The whole speech is full of that sort of drivel, just as his speech today was full of drivel, just as he has today totally demonstrated his lack of understanding, and that of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley), of the fundamental international principles of a VAT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Employment, Education and Training talked about a GST on group apprentices. If he had travelled overseas just once and talked, as I assume he has, to other politicians he would know that there is a fundamental principle to a VAT, GST, call it what you like, and that is that all GST collected in the process of doing business is refunded. It is not unique to the Liberal and National coalition; it is fundamental. He either chose to perpetrate another lie on the people of Australia or he is dumb. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their multiplication is pretty good, too. When the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) wants to talk about our GST and criticise revenue shortfall he is happy to agree with the economists' and the Treasurer's nationally accepted principle that the revenue potential of the GST is $27 billion. When he wants to talk about the burden on the community he suddenly finds the figure of $30 billion. It is on the public record; I have heard him on radio. One minute we are being told we have a $6 billion hole; suddenly the honourable member for Calwell has it up to $12 billion. How much credibility can be put in people who just change the numbers to suit the argument? It is outrageous. It is even worse when one thinks what we are talking about: we are talking about people's lives; we are talking about their opportunity to keep their home, their business and, above all, their respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the Prime Minister and Treasurer come into this place and for political reasons predict a fall in interest rates, guaranteeing that they would not rise. I know people who still believe in the words of Prime Ministers and Treasurers. I know people who went out and borrowed money on the strength of those comments. They said to their bank manager, `I can afford this money at that rate; and the Prime Minister of Australia and the Treasurer of Australia have said it will not go up'. But in making that decision they put themselves in up to about their chins. Weeks after, what happened? Interest rates went up, as a result of the initiative of this Government&mdash;no other reason&mdash;and those people went on the scrap heap. </PARA>

When his Prime Minister and his Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) and his Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) all did the job on him and said no, that was not the Government's view, he got up here and he squirmed and he carried on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I sent a note to our Leader, `Watch that man'. I said, `This bloke could crawl under a carpet and not even make a bump'.

We have constant complaints in this place about the handling of Question Time. The Speakers are criticised for that. It is not their fault. It is a simple fact that the Government misbehaves, abuses the process and has no intention of answering the question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House that the Governor-General of Australia once said in this place that Question Time becomes high farce when Ministers refuse to answer questions. It could not be put more succinctly. We do not ask questions in this place for some sort of bear pit or political advantage. The reason questions are asked in this place is to elicit and elucidate information on behalf of the Australian people. The simple fact is that governments should be prepared to give it. I made a remark on 2GB this morning that it is the only constraint on the Minister sitting in his office with a mate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members might remember the book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mates: Five Champions of the Labor Right</EMPHASIS> a little while ago which referred to Senator Richardson. What caught him? It was Question Time, primarily in the Senate. At least the members of that House can vote under the rules by which they operate. But the simple fact is that, when Ministers sit down with their mates, there has to be that little bird on their shoulder saying, `They might get me at Question Time'. There is not much hope of their being got in here. But the great pity of it is that we do not need to talk about corruption; we only need to talk about stupid decisions. Would it not be helpful to Australia at the moment if these Ministers thought about Australia first? They should think: I might have to answer a question in the Parliament and I had better have an appropriate answer; I had better be able to tell Australians how they are safe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told about the Fightback black hole. What is a $13,500m deficit, if it is not a black hole? The honourable member for Calwell said to us, `You're going to pull $7 billion out of the economy'. I have had a look at the tax cuts page or the expenditure cuts page in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>, and the figure that jumps out at me is $1,320m that we are going to take off foreign bankers by reducing the Government's debt. Under our proposals&mdash;that is the biggest single item of expenditure cutting&mdash;it does not hurt anybody in Australia. We are going to do that through privatisation and using the money, as other Liberal governments have demonstrated around Australia, to repay debt. That stands in stark contrast, does it not? Qantas is for sale and the money has been spent already. Now there are considerable doubts over whether the sale can be concluded. This is the interesting point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a censure motion and an amendment, but the Government wants to talk about black holes. A black hole is debt. The honourable member for Calwell said that if you withdraw $7 billion of government expenditure that will create problems. He should be reminded that, because the Government is operating in deficit, the $7 billion has to be borrowed from someone. So it is borrowed out of savings&mdash;small business cannot borrow it&mdash;or it is brought in from overseas. Page 4 of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>

Might I add, if the Government is going to have a GST when it is not going to have a GST, why not use the prescribed payments system? It is nothing more than a 20 per cent turnover tax so easily applied to the service industries. We are already seeing what the Government is doing with the WST.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for O'Connor has a certain amount of rat cunning about him. That is a compliment, by the way, Wilson. I remember that before Fightback was launched there was one person in Western Australia who said, `This is a bad idea': the honourable member for O'Connor. Do you know what, Wilson? You were dead right. I was not here, but I read about it. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) sprung this Fightback package on unsuspecting backbenchers in the party room. The honourable member for O'Connor was portrayed as somebody who had made the conversion; he had travelled across the river and all of sudden he was a born-again GST man. I was happy to hear him say that it was a value added tax. Not a lot of people know that, but they certainly do in my electorate because it is a value added tax. It adds tax to every stage of production. The person who ends up paying it all is the consumer, the person in the street. All the way through, small business has to collect it and do all the paperwork. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion that has been moved this afternoon talks about misleading the Australian people. I will start my contribution by looking at how the backbenchers of the Liberal Party were misled. They were not taken into the confidence of the people who constructed the Fightback package. Because of the short time available to me, I will quote from articles in newspapers about that time. The inspiration for Fightback did not come from the Australian people. There was no great call out there for a goods and services tax. Where did the idea come from? In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 4 December 1991, Greg Sheridan wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is true that the intellectual inspiration of Fightback comes partly from overseas; from Hewson's work at the International Monetary Fund, from John Howard's admiration for the American approach to industrial relations, from the adulation of Margaret Thatcher in conservative circles throughout the 1980s, from a sneaking admiration for Roger Douglas across the Tasman, and even from Jim Carlton's dabbling with the post-war German experience.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of philosophy which germinated the seed of the GST. It did not come about because people in the Australian community or the Liberal or National Party backbenchers thought it was a good idea. There is the inspiration for it. I will quote another journalist, Alan Ramsey. He is known around here as a journalist who does his homework. On 23 November last year, he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For a good part of this week I poked about in the Liberal Party trying to find out just who were the people really responsible for the Hewson program. From time to time, particularly in the later months, Hewson used a number of economic and academic contacts to cross-check and recheck a lot of the figures, forecasts and assumptions that came out of the basic work of the consultants at Access Economics. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But always, it seems, the person at the middle, directing traffic, was Hewson. The finished product encompasses not only his ideas and his politics but also his view of the world. The package is Hewson himself.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>Does that not say a lot about being misleading? I wonder how many times the back bench of the Liberal Party or the National Party was consulted about the goods and services tax. Is it misleading to spring on the Australian people this half-baked idea about a tax which the Opposition's own parties had nothing to do with until the Leader of the Opposition sprung it upon them in a party meeting and handcuffed them to it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members jump up in here from time to time and make glowing speeches about it, but they do not believe it for one minute. They have no authorship or part-authorship of the policy. They know that they must start talking about what they see as the benefits of it in this place and in the wider community. But deep in their hearts none of them are in it because they were never a part of it. It was sprung upon them. I refer to an article by Shaun Carney which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 28 November 1991. It is entitled `A glance in the GST mirror'. He has this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a policy regime that purports to hand back power to the little people, there were not many little people involved in its formulation.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Liberal Party rank-and-file? Forget it.</PARA>
<PARA>They were not even asked; nor was the back bench. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The GST and the Fightback package generally&mdash;drawn up by a cabal of senior politicians and Canberra-based economists&mdash;is a technocrat's wet dream.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what it is. These are the sorts of things they talk about in universities. They talk about models, but they do not think about the people who will be affected by the policies.

It was all about the academics and technocrats in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is very much a top-down tax policy.

He opposes it in this place but he trumpets it in his electorate as a grand thing. However, he neglects to mention the 15 per cent GST which will apply to child-care. That is the sort of duplicity we are starting to see when members of the Opposition go out into the community and try to say that this is a grand policy which they stick by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at duplicity on the other side when we start talking about misleading the Australian people, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition did in his motion. The Leader of the Opposition visited the electorate of the honourable member for Lowe. By way of introduction, journalist Sarah Armstrong said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The children at Ashfield's Infants Home provided Dr Hewson with the youngest, most enthusiastic audience he's had in some time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He was in Sydney to launch a guide to child care in the inner-west, put together by local Member, Dr Bob Woods. The Coalition have yet to give any great detail on their child care policy and this morning, Dr Hewson revealed little.</PARA>
<PARA>Too right he did; and he has not revealed much since. Ms Armstrong continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He also declined to answer reporters' questions.</PARA>
<PARA>Another thing we have noticed about the Leader of the Opposition is that he holds no press conferences. He has only door-stops when there is limited time for questions. He does not expose himself to the sort of questioning that we saw the Prime Minister undertake today at the National Press Club. The Leader of the Opposition knows what will happen to him&mdash;he had a preview of it when he saw the Leader of the National Party on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> last Monday night. On <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> we saw how hollow the leadership of the Opposition is. When the Leader of the National Party was subjected to quite reasonable questions about policies which his colleagues had enunciated just a few days before he could not cut the mustard. He was caught and all Australians could see just how hollow and shabby the policy was. At Ashfield's Infants Home, Dr Hewson had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we have undertaken to review the proposals that are around and there are a number of them that have come forward in recent days in relation to the tax deductibility of child care which would be an additional system, and I think in many senses an important improvement on the existing facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not only would places be funded and there would be fee relief in that sense as well but there would be the flexibility for parents to make a choice on their own, with the knowledge that at least part of the cost of child care places would be tax deductible. </PARA>
<PARA>Once again there was no mention of the 15 per cent which would go on top of that. We can see a pattern starting to emerge in how the Opposition conducts itself in this place and how it conducts itself when it is confronted by community groups who have a genuine interest in how the proposals would affect them. Let us look at another half-baked idea, once again from the Leader of the Opposition. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday </EMPHASIS>program, in part, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We'll be putting forward proposals, let me give you an example. One we are looking at is actually giving a voucher, or a grant, to individuals. Young people and long-term unemployed are two particularly disadvantaged cases. Let's look at those&mdash;giving them a voucher which allows them to take that to a recognised training institution, be it a TAFE College or a private alternative, to supplement their on-the-job training. So, we see on-the-job training as a base&mdash;access to technical and further educational institutions, public or private, as another essential element.</PARA>
<PARA>There is another glib statement about education vouchers. But it is just the bones. Nobody out there really understands what he has in mind for the higher education or training sectors of this economy. There is no detail in those three sentences. But if we ask a question of Opposition spokesmen or their Leader they run a mile. Let us see whether the Leader of the Opposition has an answer for us on this issue. On radio 2UE in 1989, in relation to fringe benefits tax, the Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, fringe benefits tax . . . our position on that is that we think that fringe benefits ought to be taxed, that they ought to be taxed in a different way, that is in the hands of the recipient not through the corporation.</PARA>
<PARA>Is that still his position? There is nothing in Fightback to say that it is not. But I think the people who are recipients of fringe benefits&mdash;and there are quite a few of them&mdash;would have an interest in that question and in whether it should be answered. But, no, once again we cannot find any answers from the Leader of the Opposition. Yet those opposite come in here talking about misleading the people of Australia!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, between now and election time the members of the Opposition will have plenty of time to get out amongst the population of Australia to try to sell this policy. But the people of Australia will be better armed than they have been in the past as a result of the debate which is taking place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what happened at one community meeting. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) went out into the bush and an article appeared not in one of the major newspapers, but in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herbert River Express&mdash;</EMPHASIS>we can tell that the honourable member was a long way away from a metropolitan area and a long way away from the journalists in Canberra. What is the headline? It says, `Howard cops flak at Liberal luncheon'. This is not even a community group&mdash;these are his mates&mdash;yet he is copping flak. Do honourable members remember his fudging in here the other day? In the article he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By negligible, you can really mean anything from about 0 to 5 or 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>He was in North Queensland&mdash;I bet he was talking about sugar&mdash;and he copped flak at the Liberal luncheon because he could not even explain that part of the Opposition's policy to his own supporters in North Queensland. What chance do those opposite have with the rest of the Australian population?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policies of GST and Fightback were never constructed with the help of the back bench, most of the front bench or the lay people of the Liberal or National parties. It was sprung upon them by some Canberra-based economists and the ideas of the Leader of the Opposition. That is why it will eventually fail. It will fail because it does not have broad acceptance. I have found no-one in the community who supports it. Nobody thinks that taxing food and clothing at 15 per cent is a good idea or that it will turn Australia around. I think, deep in their hearts, Opposition members know that out in the wider community they will have an uphill job trying to ram a 15 per cent consumption tax down the throats of Australians. The people of Australia will not wear it, and neither should they. </PARA>

<PARA>The foreign debt this year is $145 billion. The Government's performance in trade is reflected in that current account deficit and in that foreign debt. One Government member, whose electorate escapes me at the moment, should remember that if we take our current account deficit on a cumulative basis the employment creation schemes of the Government have been very successful.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that disturbs us on this side of the House&mdash;and the Government seems to have lost sight of this&mdash;is the changes in real disposable income under Labor's budgetary strategy. I would like to mention what has happened to real disposable income for a single-income family with two children from 1983 to 1991. This reflects the failure of this Government in its tax reform proposals and the way it applies income tax to Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear from the Government that there is a gap between high income earners and low income earners and that that gap is ever-increasing. I have here a graph which shows that, for a single-income couple with two children on average weekly earnings during the period 1983-1991, their real household disposable income has fallen by 4.7 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The speech of the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) certainly did not conform to international best practice. A couple of points might be made about it. So many Opposition speakers when debating the issues in Fightback or a motion such as the one before the House assume that they are somehow wandering around in some type of policy vacuum. In fact, those opposite have put down their views on the policies they will pursue at the next election and those views have implications. It is no good standing up in this chamber and talking about the difficulties that have been or will be experienced by middle income people with the sorts of spurious figures that have been used.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unimpeachable beneficiaries of the introduction of a consumption tax, and changes unrelated to that but related to cuts in government expenditure which subsequently produce income tax cuts, are the people on three, four, five and six times average weekly earnings. The unimpeachable payers of a consumption tax operating through the system would be those who are obliged to spend the maximum proportion of their income on supporting their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, there are other ancillary aspects of Fightback that those opposite cannot run away from, including what they intend to do about wages. Their industrial relations policies and various employment schemes associated with Fightback, by means of which somehow or other they will legislate to alter awards&mdash;if they get into government to do it&mdash;to cut 30 per cent off earnings or allow people to wander around with a ticket saying,  `You can pay me 30 per cent less than the award rate', do what? They do one thing only&mdash;cut wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time as the Opposition is introducing a consumption tax which effectively has to be paid by low and middle income earners in this country as they have very little discretionary expenditure available to them, it is cutting their means to do it. Those opposite can make arguments that wages ought to be cut to improve employment, but it is a nonsense argument. But they cannot in the same breath say that they are proposing to improve the standard of living of people receiving those wages. It is a nonsense; it is an illogical impossibility. Yet this seems to be the basis of the Opposition's position on Fightback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What those opposite are proposing, not only by the introduction of the consumption tax but also by the massive cuts in social outlays that they propose, is that the burdens in the taxation system in this country and the impact of public expenditure&mdash;or the lack of impact of public expenditure when it is cut&mdash;ought to be borne by the average Australian. Arguments can be put at the margin, but there is no doubt that the principal beneficiaries of the taxation changes are the very high income earners. Opposition members cannot escape that. That is what their taxation schedules say. They can argue about the middle income earners, but the people who are the impeccably unimpeachable major beneficiaries of the Opposition's propositions are the upper income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are left with is a formula for massive social discontent in this country. But all these judgments are based on a deeply flawed document. Opposition members, in the process of attempting to defend themselves since Fightback came down, have specialised in wandering around the countryside saying, `Our statistics and our position simply cannot be criticised. If you criticise them, you will go on an enemy list and you will be dealt with if we are elected to government'. Of course, by any definition of corruption it is a corrupt act to threaten somebody with a financial disbenefit  if that person does not come to one's aid politically. But that is the process of intimidation that those opposite go through. </PARA>

I suggest that you ring up the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party, your conservative equivalent in Japan, and tell it what a heinous job it has just done by providing a $125 billion stimulus to the Japanese economy.

They might even sit down with you and go through a sensible proposition with you&mdash;that, of course, in a recessionary period, when there is not a deal of private investment around, it is a normal thing for a government to step in and invest publicly until such time as the private sector picks up and at that point the government recedes from that level of impact on gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell you what ought to be clearly understood, and will increasingly be clearly understood by the public in this country: whatever your claims for it, the goods and services tax, which is at the very heart of Fightback, is a massive tax on employment in this country. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then let us look at the impact of payroll tax in Australia compared with the rest of the OECD countries. It is a very interesting set of statistics. To those 40 per cent of businesses that do pay payroll tax, those opposite wander around this place saying, `Well, of course, you are enormously burdened by this. When we take this enormous burden off you, you will find yourselves in such a good position to be able to get out and employ people and in such a terrific position relative to your competitors'. Well, I have news for them: they are already in a substantially good position as far as payroll tax is concerned relative to their competitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go through the OECD figures, which no doubt the genius here, the Toltoy of the Opposition, will describe as more rubbish from the OECD. In Australia, the impact of payroll tax as a percentage of GDP is 1.7. What is it in the United Kingdom, which has a government that you love to emulate? It is 3.5 per cent. What is it in the United States, which has a government that you like to approve of? It is 4.9 per cent. In Switzerland it is 3.3 per cent; in Sweden it is 15.7 per cent; in Spain it is 9.2 per cent; in Portugal it is 5.6 per cent; in Norway it is 7.9 per cent and in New Zealand&mdash;at last we come to somebody with less than ours&mdash;it is 0.7 per cent.

It is not simply enough for you to describe a payroll tax when the OECD has a sensible way of collecting statistics.

Therefore, you would be introducing this massive tax on small business to replace a tax that impacts by a factor of about one-quarter compared with most of those in the OECD with which we like to compare ourselves, or 10 per cent in comparison with some of them.

Of course, the other element of the introduction of the goods and services tax&mdash;or VAT as it is called throughout most of Europe&mdash;was to support a massive subsidy program for European agriculture.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, I present the report of the committee entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Privilege&mdash;Mr James Gaffey</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RH4">Mr KERR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I thank the House. The background to this matter is that Mr James Gaffey was employed as a legal officer by the Victorian regional office of the Australian Securities Commission. He appeared before the Committee as a representative of the young lawyers section of the Law Institute of Victoria at a public hearing on 11 October in relation to the use of the immunity provisions of the corporations law. At the beginning of his evidence he stated that he was an employee of the ASC but appeared before the Committee in a private capacity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 25 May the Chairman of the Committee received a facsimile from Mr Gaffey advising him that Mr Gaffey had been charged under section 61 of the Public Service Act 1992 with misconduct in that he had made a submission to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities which was at variance with the submissions of the ASC, thereby compromising the submissions of the Chairman's representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was plain that this charge was inappropriate and the report details the circumstances under which the charge was laid. Various other matters were drawn to the attention of the Committee by Mr Gaffey but are not worthy of being traversed in these short remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The substance of the Committee's conclusion in relation to this matter is set out at paragraphs 13 to 16, which state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In deciding to include his appearance before this committee in the charges the ASC seems to have focussed exclusively on its own internal management problems and failed to consider the broader issues involved in making charge F.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission is a body with a considerable level of legal expertise in its senior management. The ASC also consulted the Australian Government Solicitor on the making of the charges. If the ASC was unaware of the statutory and other provisions relating to the rights of witness before parliament and its committees and that the making of charge F had implications beyond the disciplinary provisions of the Public Service Act then its own consideration of the matter was superficial and the advice provided by the Government Solicitor was woefully inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prompt withdrawal of charge F by the chairman of the ASC, as soon as he became aware of it, minimises the harm caused to Mr Gaffey. At the same time it suggests that the making of the charge was a product of ill-considered internal management decisions rather than a deliberate challenge to the committee's right to gather evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is extremely concerned by this matter not only in terms of the protection of Mr Gaffey's rights but also with regard to the general attitude to, and knowledge of, the powers and privileges of Parliament. It is not a matter of the making of the charge being `inappropriate' or of any question of a `slight' to this committee, as Mr Hartnell has described it. The making of charge F prima facie constitutes a breach of s.12 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act and as such those responsible in the Victorian Regional Office of the ASC could be subject to criminal charges. It also appears to be a blatant contempt of the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>That report is now tabled, and it is a matter for the appropriate officers in another place to consider further steps in relation to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the fifth and sixth reports of the Committee for 1992 relating to the Christmas Island rebuilding program and the refurbishment of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Perth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the reports be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The reports I have tabled are the Committee's fifth and sixth reports for 1992. The fifth report relates to the Christmas Island rebuilding program which was one of the most interesting inquiries the Committee has undertaken for some time. The aim of this project is to align conditions on Christmas Island with mainland Australian standards as part of a broader government policy aimed at the integration of Australia's Indian Ocean Territories within Australia. The need for major upgrading of the infrastructure on Christmas Island has been given impetus by the introduction of mainland Australian laws from 1 July 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rebuilding program will provide substantial new infrastructure for the island at a cost of $132.85m. At the time of the public hearings in May 1992 the Government had committed $37m over the next five years subject to the endorsement of the Committee. The most urgent works include: a new and upgraded sewerage system and water supply; a new hospital; a new police station; extensions to the school; and upgraded housing. Funding of the remainder of the works in the rebuilding program will be considered by the Government following the Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing infrastructure on Christmas Island was designed and built to meet the requirements and standards of a mining operation. Significant elements predate the Second World War, while a period of renewed construction began after the war but by the mid-1970s construction activity had tailed off. With the decline in mining profitability and the uncertain future of the island in the 1980s there was little incentive to invest in maintenance of the island's infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not an understatement to say that the Committee was shocked, when it carried out inspections prior to the public hearings, to observe the appalling state of most of the infrastructure for the provision of government services on Christmas Island. In particular the Committee was struck with the incredibly run-down condition of the hospital and the completely inadequate sewerage and water supply systems. In summary, most of the current infrastructure is more than 30 years old, in a poor condition and does not meet current Australian building, health and safety standards. Western Australian government agencies, which will provide most government services on behalf of the Commonwealth, have made it clear that existing conditions are completely unacceptable for their operations and staff, and the Committee agrees with this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the public hearing on Christmas Island, and having had the benefit of a thorough inspection of the existing infrastructure, it became obvious to the Committee that the $37m committed by the Government did not include all essential items. Those not included were: the clearing of aggregate plant from the hospital site; power and water supply to the hospital site; a new crane; and wharf and jetty upgrading.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result of this situation is that while the hospital could be built, there were no funds to provide power and water supply. Even more serious was the situation regarding the port infrastructure which is completely inadequate to handle the increased volume of freight which will result from the rebuilding program. It is vital that the port infrastructure be upgraded as part of the initial funding program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the Committee I wrote to the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Ms Fatin) on 4 June 1992 indicating that, in the Committee's view, the priorities determined by the Government for inclusion in the initial $37m funding program did not include all essential items. The Committee suggested that the Government should consider increasing the amount committed over the first five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is pleased to note that following Budget considerations the amount committed has now been increased to $42m to provide for additional items of critical importance, including the wharf improvements and a new wharf crane. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it was.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that the Minister will have a delightful time, as we did, and he will see the work of the Committee and how needed this work is on Christmas Island.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recognises that the Government's commitment to rectify the immediate infrastructure, health and safety issues may stimulate private investment on the island. It has recommended that prior to the final commitment to the total 10-year rebuilding program there should be an assessment of the success of the initial funding program which may lead to changes in priorities and/or funding levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has made a number of detailed recommendations in the report for consideration by the Government, and I will briefly mention a number of them. The heritage aspects have been given due regard and protection. However, the Committee has recommended that the fuel tank containing Second World War strafing marks should be demolished with the panels containing the strafing marks being removed and displayed in a suitable location. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes that Christmas Island is an ideal location for a demonstration project to test the feasibility of alternative energy systems to augment existing conventional power generation systems in isolated communities. The Committee has recommended that DASET commence the collection of the necessary solar and wind data and to set up a pilot plant to assess the feasibility of the chosen alternative energy system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">DASET should include in the rebuilding program the sealing of the roads from the airport turn-off to Waterfall and from the golf course to Waterfall at a cost of $1.2m. These roads will soon become the busiest on the island and should be sealed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rebuilding program will provide an opportunity to implement training programs for local workers. The Committee has recommended that as a matter of urgency a scheme be set up to maximise training and apprenticeships. The Committee has also recommended that DASET should ensure the maximum possible use of local labour and materials in the rebuilding program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has recommended that a comprehensive strategy be developed to address the critical housing situation on the island. While funds are provided in the rebuilding program to upgrade housing for government employees the Committee has recommended that the Government consider additional funding of some $16m to meet the Commonwealth's wider housing obligations on Christmas Island. Housing is an issue of considerable concern on the island and the Committee hopes the Government will give favourable consideration to extending the scope of the rebuilding program to address the overall housing problems, not just those of its employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's sixth report relates to the refurbishing of the Perth branch of the Reserve Bank of Australia at a cost of $32.2m. The Reserve Bank has operated from its current premises in Perth since 1973 and the building no longer complies with current building regulations and some services are nearing the end of their operational life. The removal of fire retardant asbestos material is an important aspect of the work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is satisfied that the refurbishment option is the most economical of the options available to the Bank. The refurbishment will proceed on a staged basis which will enable an assessment of the availability of tenants and market conditions in Perth before proceeding with the fitout of tenanted floors. I commend both reports to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I will speak briefly on these reports, particularly the report on Christmas Island. I want to concur completely with the remarks that have been made by the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. I want to make some comments because of what I saw on Christmas Island. I do not think that I have ever seen a more appalling hospital situation than the one on Christmas Island. I think that any other nursing staff from any other hospital&mdash;other than the nurses already working there&mdash;would have refused to work on Christmas island. The nurses are totally dedicated. Under very difficult circumstances, they were prepared to carry on in the belief that they would get a better facility in the near future. I am delighted that the Committee came down with the recommendation not only to build a new hospital, but also to upgrade the sewerage and many other facilities of the island which were most certainly substandard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At times, I think we take committees and committee work for granted, but the inquiry into Christmas Island was very trying and, one could say, very interesting. It was very humid and I think that members of the Committee got a bit testy with one another. But it is one of the better committees of the Parliament. I have served on a number of committees, but the bipartisanship and the dedication of members of this Committee are first class. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it would be remiss of me if I did not acknowledge the Secretary of the Committee, Peter Roberts, who does a sterling job and his assistant, on this occasion Mike Fetter. I thought that they were very constructive and positive in the support that they gave to the Committee. But I think it is very fitting that we commend the people on the island, particularly the nursing staff, for the first class job that they do in really appalling conditions. I am glad to acknowledge that and put it on the public record. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RI4">Mr PROSSER</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Forrest)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Firstly, I will address the report tabled by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works on the upgrading works on Christmas Island. As my colleague the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) has pointed out, the work entails upgrading the sewerage and water supply for the island, the hospital, the police station, extensions to the school, and the upgrading of housing and some port facilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This work has come about as a result of the lead-up to the self-determination vote when the Commonwealth promised the people living standards equal to the mainland and that they be brought up to standard no later than 1994. On 1 July of this year, the legal regime of Singapore was replaced with the legal regimes of Western Australia and the Commonwealth. Of course Western Australia administers those laws. The casino that is being built on the island is expected to open later this year. It is important that the infrastructure work goes into the island to make good that commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I note that there was very little said about the second report, but I will address some comments to the refurbishment of the Reserve Bank in Perth. The Reserve Bank building in Perth at St Georges Terrace is some 19 years old and some quite considerable works are involved. I note that the report says something about the collapse of property values in Perth as a result of this recession. It states that a valuation carried out by the Australian Valuation Office in April 1992 valued the building, including the land, at $14.4m. The corresponding valuation at April 1989 was $28.6m. It has collapsed by half. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that on completion of the proposed works, Richard Ellis advised that the building valuation would be in the order of $20m. One has to appreciate that we are spending $32m on this building and it is worth less than what we are going to spend on it. That worries me somewhat. It goes on to say that after the building is fully tenanted on a yield basis it could be worth $26.9m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The works that are proposed for the building entail the upgrading of some air conditioning, electrical services&mdash;mainly light fittings&mdash;the extension of the fire sprinkler system to the building to bring it up to scratch, the removal of some asbestos and fire retardant materials, and the replacement of the passenger and goods lifts in the building. The estimated cost, as I mentioned, is $32m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned at the time taken to complete the works. The report went on to say that the refurbishment work could commence as early as 1993, with completion expected late 1995. So the refurbishment will start early 1993 and not finish till late 1995. I have expressed concern previously in this House in regard to the cost estimates and the return on capital invested in regard to the upgrading of Juliana House. I expressed concerns at that stage of the game about the time taken to carry out the upgrading of that particular building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I wish to express my concern about the time taken to carry out the works on this building that is to be upgraded. I am concerned that we continue to take only one view and that is the view of the Australian Construction Services. I am not confident that we are getting value for money but, in the absence of any other information, I am not able to go further on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would appear that the cost per square metre for the upgrade of the building is extremely excessive, but again the report does not go further on that point. It is of concern that after spending $32m on a $14.4m building it is now worth barely $20m. But the coalition will not oppose the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 1992-93 Budget builds on the Government's already proud record in science and innovation. This Budget provides $2.9 billion for science and technology, an increase of 2.2 per cent in real terms on 1991-92 funding. This is the fourth real increase in succession and it produces a total real increase of 39 per cent since the Government took office. Moreover, outlays on science and technology over that time have grown at a rate greater than the increase in all government outlays. In other words, not only has expenditure on science and technology increased but the share of government expenditure going to support science and innovation has also increased.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This growth in Government support has been accompanied by a spectacular growth in industry funding of research and development. Industry funding has more than doubled in real terms over the last decade. Among the OECD countries in the 1980s, Australia had the leading growth rate in business R&amp;D expenditure and external patent applications. The Government's decision in this year's Budget to maintain the 150 per cent tax concession for business investment in R &amp; D will continue that very strong growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal in some detail with two aspects of government funding in particular&mdash;funding for the CSIRO and funding for rural R&amp;D. I will refer first to the CSIRO. In the period 1988-89 to 1992-93 there has been strong and consistent growth. Over that period appropriation funding has increased by 13 per cent in real terms. At the same time external funding has grown by some 54 per cent. I should also point out that business investment in CSIRO R&amp;D has increased by 400 per cent between 1986 and 1992. There has been some comment about a one per cent drop in the appropriations for CSIRO this year. I should point out that this is merely an accounting blip, arising because an additional $10m was provided in the 1991 employment statement for capital works. In 1993-94, next financial year, appropriation funding for CSIRO will rise by a further 2.7 per cent, quite apart from any further increases CSIRO may win in that Budget process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to correct any perceptions that rural research funding has fallen in recent years. In this financial year funding provided through the rural R&amp;D corporations will be $110m, a real increase of 13 per cent on the previous year. This builds on an increase of 13 per cent from 1990-91 to 1991-92. In addition, CSIRO's high level of expenditure on rural R&amp;D will continue at one-third of its $686m budget. Expenditure by the CSIRO institutes of animal and plant production and processing has increased by 24 per cent in real terms over the past five years. Funding for these institutes has risen this year by 4.1 per cent and 4.7 per cent respectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth's cooperative research centres program further reinforces that message. Eleven of the 34 centres approved so far relate directly to the rural sector, in areas such as viticulture, tropical plant pathology and control of vertebrate pests. Through these centres the Commonwealth will directly fund more than $130m worth of rural R&amp;D over the next seven years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn briefly to the Government's White Paper on science and technology, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Developing Australian Ideas</EMPHASIS>, which was released with the Budget Papers. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Developing Australian Ideas</EMPHASIS> makes explicit the Government's philosophical framework. It sets strategic directions and it supports that strategy with generous funding initiatives&mdash;more than $300m worth of funding initiatives over the next four years. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Developing Australian Ideas</EMPHASIS> recognises that being the clever country is not enough. If we are to continue developing Australian industry, using our research and development base to improve our competitive position to generate new products, processes and jobs and so improve our living standards, we need to be both clever and capable. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Developing Australian Ideas</EMPHASIS> recognises that, while we have always done good science in this country, it is also true that far too many good Australian ideas have either withered on the vine or have been taken overseas because of lack of local support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In becoming both a clever and a capable country we need to develop those twin capacities both to generate exciting science and to use it for the national benefit. Specific initiatives contained within the White Paper include: maintaining the taxation concession for private sector R&amp;D at 150 per cent; lifting the $10m limit on pilot plant; a $30m boost to the government research agencies to complete a capital infrastructure program; 200 new postgraduate research awards worth $24m to 1995-96; $13m to upgrade the capacity and speed of Australia's research data network within the framework of the CRC program; a renewed commitment to a national space program; additional funding for medical research; a new marine science research facility in the north-west of Australia, established under the Australian Institute of Marine Science, which will now operate on two oceans, the Indian and the Pacific; initiatives to encourage higher levels of science and technology awareness; an inquiry into the need for a new research reactor; an international industrial collaboration program; funding to establish a genetic manipulation authority; national measurement infrastructure funding; and a new defence science industry support office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The White Paper has been welcomed by the science community and industry. The Institution of Engineers Australia, in a media statement the day after the Budget, warmly welcomed the Budget announcement of a continuation of the 150 per cent tax concession to industry for research and development and described the reversal of a previous decision to scale down the incentive as `courageous'. Speaking for the Institution, Mr Kemp said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the continuing support for industry R&amp;D flowed naturally from the Government's commitment to vocational education and its intention of resurrecting industry through the creativity and ingenuity of the Australian workforce.</PARA>
<PARA>More recently, in the magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Civil Engineers Australia</EMPHASIS>, the White Paper made the cover&mdash;`Engineering has Arrived: Budget recognises importance of the profession'. Inside the magazine the story refers to the Budget and the White Paper as `A milestone for engineering'. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1992 budget contains a policy paper on science and technology which not only recognises the importance of engineering for the health of Australia's economy, but also establishes steps to encourage and support engineering activities.</PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The white paper itself, which is the first on science and technology, is a milestone in recognising the importance of science and engineering in the health of Australia's economy and establishes for the first time a national policy for science and technology.</PARA>
<PARA>The President of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering, Sir Rupert Myers, reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> the day after the Budget, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the retention of the 150 per cent R&amp;D tax concession was "excellent. I think it is very wise and far-sighted.''</PARA>
<PARA>The President of the Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies, Dr Ditta Bartels, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To maintain the status quo and a bit more I think is pretty good. [It] indicates that the Government is taking science and technology seriously.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Institute of Agricultural Science also welcomed the Budget initiatives. The Chairman of its research committee, Dr Gordon Burch, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Institute of Agricultural Science (AIAS) is encouraged by the final outcome of the Dawkins-Keating Budget and associated S&amp;T White Paper.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>

<PARA>The President of the Institute, Dr John Leslie, was also reported in the press release as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By its actions the Commonwealth is affirming a positive policy on the economic importance of rural R&amp;D which the Institute trusts will be observed by State Governments and reflected in their policy and budgetary decisions. This is essential because Commonwealth sponsorship alone cannot sustain rural R&amp;D which is so dependent on the states for core support and delivery.</PARA>
<PARA>Politics is always about choices. Having seen the reaction of the science community to the Government's White Paper, it is also reasonable for it to have an interest in the policy of the Opposition. It is a bit difficult because the Opposition has not released its policy. We have the Fightback agenda on science and technology. We know that Fightback commits the Opposition to retaining the tax deduction for private sector R&amp;D at 125 per cent, rather than the Government's 150 per cent. We know that Fightback contains $60m worth of cuts to science over three years, as well as $39m in cuts to energy research and development. We know that Fightback will cripple ANSTO, and we know that Fightback contains no provisions for agency infrastructure and no provisions for continuing 1989 funding. We know that Fightback will raise the efficiency dividend to 2 per cent; we know that Fightback will impose a 10 per cent administration levy which will cost CSIRO alone $4.1m; and we know that the Opposition will impose some kind of GST on research inputs or at least on those inputs to commercial research. Certainly, we know that the full imposition of a GST on CSIRO, for example, would cost that organisation $38 1/2m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the full Opposition policy goes, the Government and the science community have been waiting and waiting and waiting. It was one year ago at the ANZAAS congress in Adelaide&mdash;it is on this week in Brisbane&mdash;that the Opposition's science spokesman, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), said that the policy was nearly ready and that it had been gestating for quite some time. At the time he could not put a date on its release, but he said it would certainly be released well before the Government's White Paper. The White Paper was then timed to be released in May of this year. As people would be aware, the Government put that date of the release back to August. So we certainly gave the Opposition plenty of time to get its act together, and we certainly gave the Opposition spokesman plenty of time to keep his promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, he has not been able to do that. A couple of weeks ago when I was in Townsville I was forced to leak part of the Opposition policy for a particular reason which I will deal with later. It turned out that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) was also in Townsville at the time. His response to my release of part of the Opposition policy, the part which dealt with the Opposition's intention to abolish the Australian Institute of Marine Science, was that the document I had released was a discussion document with no status.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has a familiar ring because recently, when a report from the Opposition's GST planning office surfaced, it was also said to have no status. This appears to be the standard cry every time secret Opposition agendas float to the surface. But the Opposition spokesman at the time went further. He said that it was a discussion document which had been widely circulated to be evaluated by the science community and by university groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us test these two propositions: the document's alleged status and its alleged wide circulation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a document worth looking at, despite its alleged lack of status, because not one of the measures proposed in it has been denied by the Opposition. The first thing that strikes me is the fact that the Opposition has suddenly discovered commercialisation and the need to develop Australian ideas for the benefit of Australians. Ten years ago the Government recognised this need, and we have pursued it unflaggingly. The Opposition is now trumpeting this as some kind of new idea. It is looking, rather sadly, like the person who understands the joke five minutes after everyone else has stopped laughing. This is the view of the President of the Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies on the policy. The President says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The business sector is constantly interacting with the research community but Mr McGauran seems blind to it. Maybe there are some smarter people involved in Coalition science and technology policy than him. What we got from him today is a real disaster. It was not even 1970s stuff, it was 1960s stuff.</PARA>
<PARA>That comment was made by the President of FASTS after the shadow Minister's address to the National Science Forum. At least the document has exposed some interesting differences&mdash;in fact, a vast gulf&mdash;between the Government and the Opposition. Certainly, there is a vast gulf in relation to industry research and development. As I have explained, the Government will maintain the concession at 150 per cent while the Opposition will reduce it to 125 per cent. This was the view of the Opposition spokesman when he was asked whether he would match the Government. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can certainly tell you that I don't intend to enter into a Dutch auction and the thrust of my comments today if not previously has been that I just don't believe in buying off the science constituency. Everytime there's a crisis we throw some money at those who are shouting loudest. CSIRO is under pressure, let's throw some money. That game  is  over  so  far  as  we  are concerned.  But in regard to the 150% well, what is the difference between our 125% and the Government's 150% . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can tell him the answer is about $100m a year to support industrial R&amp;D. In fact, he really does not like industry very much, as his comments on 7 January to the CRA National Science Summer School make very clear. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With few exceptions, we've got a business sector which would have a heart attack if it had an adrenalin rush . . . Again, with few exceptions, our manufacturing-related industries which are vital to our future prosperity haven't hunted down a competitive market for ages.</PARA>
<PARA>He does not like industry and he does not understand it. On public sector research and development, an equally large policy gulf exists between the Government and the Opposition. The Opposition policy statement contains no comfort for the Australian science community. When the Opposition spokesman previewed the statement at a recent conference, he spoke only of lighting fuses, blowing holes and driving wedges into the public sector research base&mdash;language quite correctly described by the CSIRO's Chief Executive, Dr Stocker, as the language of war. Among other things, the policy threatens privatisation of the Government's CRCs and a wholesale sell-off of CSIRO's industrial research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the first words of the Opposition document where it talks about its being a source of national humiliation that Australia cannot win greater advantages. It is certainly a source of humiliation for the Opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Gippsland, that having tried for 12 months to cobble together a policy he is now too ashamed of it to release it. It is certainly a source of humiliation for the whole Opposition that its spokesman's response to the policy debacle of the last fortnight has been to leave this place, hop into the first-class cabin of a jumbo jet and go to Europe. That is the priority that he gives to developing a science policy for the coalition. While he is away he might take the opportunity to talk to overseas industry, because that is where Australian ideas will go if those opposite get into office. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

However, like the One Nation statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), when one looks at this Budget&mdash;and one does not really have to look at it very hard&mdash;one can see that it is a cynical engineering exercise designed to manufacture more jobs in time for an election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that in the run-up to elections, no matter who is in power and who is trying to remain on the treasury bench, we all resort to that kind of tactic. However, we are seeing a really cynical exercise being undertaken now. This afternoon during the debate on the censure motion we witnessed many gross examples of twisting and bending the truth. Leaving things out is another good way of misrepresenting a situation. Unfortunately, Fightback, as we are promoting it, has been the subject of a lot of misinformation. I hope that in the speeches which are to come and during my own speech some of that misinformation will be corrected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government forecasts that unemployment will fall from 11 per cent now to 10 per cent by next July. However, that improvement is bought dearly through $3 billion in additional Budget spending. As a result of that and other things, the interest on public debt will go up by about $1 billion this year and by about $1.5 billion in the following year. In fact, the public debt interest will be the largest contributor to the real growth in Budget outlays between now and 1995-96. Indeed, the turnaround in the Budget deficit in the last two years is bigger than the disastrous Budgets of the Whitlam years and double that during the last recession in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been interesting to observe the Government's tactics since the Prime Minister brought down his One Nation statement&mdash;especially the tactic of diverting debate away from economic issues, which are the very issues which urgently require debate in this House. The flag debate was one of the tactics used by the Government to take the spotlight off economic issues. The debate on the republic was another example, as were what seemed to be anything but veiled attacks on the monarchy. I received a large number of telephone calls, as did many other honourable members, from angry constituents who were outraged that the Government, under the leadership of the Prime Minister, was preoccupied by our national identity when the one million unemployed appeared to be forgotten. As I have said in this place before, it is the Government which suffers from an identity crisis, not the people of Australia. They know exactly who they are and they know what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, time has shown that this particular diversionary tactic was a disaster for the Government, demonstrating clearly that the Prime Minister is out of step with community opinion. Political commentators now seem to agree that the next tactic to be employed by the Government will be a personal attack on the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). The people of Australia look to members and senators of this Parliament for leadership and direction through sound policies. Diversionary tactics only make an already cynical electorate even more cynical. </PARA>

The people want to know what the Government will do about the currently unacceptably high levels of unemployment, what the Government will do to stop the erosion of their standards of living, and what it will do to make this country internationally competitive again.

We hear a lot of rhetoric about $6 billion and $10 billion holes in Fightback and so on, but I can say with confidence to the people of Australia that even though the Government has spent millions of dollars analysing this package through its Treasury and in other ways, it has not even put a dent in it, as time will tell. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The size of the 1992/93 Budget deficit was not totally unexpected in the light of the poor economic circumstances, the uncertain outlook and the high level of unemployment. However the Budget pays little attention to the role of the private sector and there are major concerns that insufficient progress is being made on the fundamentals which determine the international competitiveness of the economy . . . Without this we will not achieve the sustainable economic growth needed to provide increased long term employment opportunities and the maintenance of current living standards.</PARA>
<PARA>This very interesting articles continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key requirements are higher productivity and increased business investment. Business investment has fallen for the last twelve calendar quarters and the capital stock is being seriously eroded. There has been a recent improvement in productivity but it must be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After a massive fall in business investment over the last two years the Budget predicts a further decline of 2%. Business considers this may be optimistic with the fall possibly about double this amount. This will be the fourth consecutive year in which business investment has declined. Consequently the Government needs to address the kinds of changes that will create the environment to encourage business investment.</PARA>
<PARA>The article concludes by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key to sustainable economic and employment growth in Australia rests with the private sector. A thriving and less regulated business sector is the only way forward to maximising our economic potential.  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister is the steward of the Australian economy; therefore, he has a tremendous responsibility, through his Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, to deliver sound economic policies that are in the interest of all Australians. The Budget does not provide such policies. Like the One Nation statement, it is a program of unfunded spending which does not address the need of fundamental economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the Prime Minister's approach to economic solutions is reactionary. He reacts in the short term to any given economic hurdle with the view of his future electoral success, without thinking of the long term welfare of the Australian people. I believe that is one of the greatest tragedies this nation is experiencing today. This is not the sort of leadership Australians are looking for, nor do they deserve it. Fightback, by comparison, is a comprehensive, self-funded program of reforms that will result in more jobs, simpler and fairer taxation, competitive exports and sustainable economic growth. Fightback goes to the very heart of our problems and deals directly with the fundamental problems of our economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The practical advantages of the coalition's approach to recovery can clearly be seen if we look, for example, at how we approach the construction of Sydney's second international airport at Badgerys Creek. With the third runway at Kingsford-Smith Airport now under way, the construction of a second international airport at Badgerys Creek appears to be of less interest to the Government than it once was. The current plan is to construct a runway of 1,800 metres, including taxiways and aprons, as a first stage, with further development taking place as the need arises. This is the current plan, although I believe that there has been approval for more funding to extend the taxiway to around 2,000 metres. Such a plan is totally inadequate, as it restricts airport use to very small aircraft and will do little more than provide a second Bankstown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition, on the other hand, believes that if construction is handled differently, thousands of additional jobs for the people of western Sydney can be created sooner than they would be under current government proposals. Our alternative is that the money currently allocated for runways, taxiways and aprons be reallocated to construct the longest runway possible, which we hope will be able to handle aircraft of any size. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition would allow private enterprise to lease sections of the airport and construct their own taxiways, aprons and facilities. The airport could then compete effectively with Kingsford-Smith for traffic. The end result would be a full-scale international airport, bringing with it upgraded infrastructure, more tourists and substantial increase in industry investment&mdash;in other words, more jobs. It is more jobs, more jobs, more jobs that we are really talking about and really need in this country. The people of western Sydney do not want inaction by a government which has lost touch with the needs of the community. What they want are jobs and the opportunity to restore some dignity to their lives. For those living in western Sydney, fast tracking Badgerys Creek in the way outlined will go a long way towards achieving that goal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said a couple of times that the Government has lost touch with the people. I sincerely believe that is the case. The coalition, on the other hand, has taken a great deal of time to get the feel of the electorate. In its Australia 2000 program, the coalition consulted the Australian public to achieve certain objectives. They were to develop a vision for Australia which will prepare us for the challenges of the future; to involve the Australian community, local and national interest groups and experts of all ranges of opinions; to ascertain the needs and hopes of the Australian people; to develop well researched and precisely formulated policies capable of fulfilling the community's aspirations; and to successfully communicate policies to the Australian people. All those things were put into place months and even years before the Fightback policy was announced. Fightback was based on intensive research along those lines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of our consultation, many thousands of letters and submissions from a broad spectrum of the Australian community covering all ages, occupations and States were received. The overwhelming response proved to the coalition that the Australian people want a more participatory political process and, above all, more visionary leadership demonstrating a genuine sense of purpose and a willingness to entertain new ideas regardless of their source. The Australian community also told us that a number of radical shifts must occur in the attitudes and behaviour of the Australian community. These included a need for politicians to become more genuinely sensitive to the community and less preoccupied with short term power&mdash;something that needs to be noted by all of us, particularly by the present Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia must begin to define its economic goals in terms of its role in the worldwide marketplace by allowing inappropriate activities to decline and creating new industries which reflect Australia's unique capability to respond to international demand.

These issues must be approached with long term strategies not short term opportunistic reactions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will not be re-elected because it is taking none of these findings seriously. The coalition, on the other hand&mdash;even though we do not get that impression during Question Time, but generally speaking this view is held by the community&mdash;is taking all these things very seriously and the Fightback package is gradually being accepted in a very fine way. I commend the Opposition's approach to all these policies to the Government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Budget is about creating jobs. It is about government action, government taking responsibility and taking action on jobs. It is about the difference between us and them; the difference between consultation and confrontation; the difference between a single-minded obsession with purist economics and the level playing field, and the Government's commitment to consultation and a realistic trade and tariff agenda. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), I believe, has shown his true colours over the last two weeks. They are very ordinary colours indeed. He has shown himself to be hardline and uncompromising and his backbench, and his Party's political rump, the Nationals, are understandably very worried. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians are not into dogma. The Leader of the Opposition wants us to put all our eggs in one basket&mdash;no ifs or buts. He knows what is best for us. He says that a 15 per cent GST on everything we buy, from cornflakes to the gas bill, the destruction of unions and the indiscriminate abolition of tariffs are good for us. He is dead wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians will not buy his laissez faire extremism. In fact, I believe that his own colleagues will ultimately tell the Leader of the Opposition to swallow his pride, drop his arrogant, dictatorial leadership style and learn to compromise. It is those back bench colleagues of the Leader of the Opposition who are out there in their electorates and they know that the Australian public does not want confrontation and that, for all the Leader of the Opposition's chest thumping, they do not want radical change. That is what he says he is on about&mdash;radical change. Members of the New Right, I believe, have hijacked the word `radical'. They are not talking radical in the sense demanded by the Australian workers in the great shearers strikes of the 1890s. The shearers wanted radical change; they wanted the right to unionise, to a decent wage. They wanted the wealthy landowners, the Army and the imperial government to give them a fair go. Women were campaigning at that time for the right to vote, for the right to own and inherit property. Their radical cry was taken up by the union movement and the fledgling Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know what happened to the striking shearers at Barcaldine: the conservative imperial government sent the troopers in and arrested the so-called ringleaders. They were chained together under the shade of the now legendary Tree of Knowledge in Barcaldine in May of 1891 for their part in the great shearers strike that changed the course of Australian history. In the end, as a result of the tireless efforts of the workers who united across Australia to form unions and enter parliamentary politics through the great Australian Labor Party, our society has changed radically. If the conservatives had not been challenged successfully, had not been forced to accept change, unions would be powerless, workers would be paid a pittance, children would still be sweeping the factory floors, and women and Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people would not have the right to vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition came to north-western Queensland this time last year and talked about his plans for radical change at the 1991 Cattlemen's Union conference in Mount Isa. He talked of the need for `hard-headed decisions', `fundamental change' and `quantum leaps'. He wanted to do it all at once, all at midnight. There was no talk of consultation or graduated reform; the Opposition Leader wanted it all to happen at once, and he still does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He seems to think that by lacing his fundamentally conservative agenda with radical rhetoric he can con the Australian electorate into believing that he is presenting something new and untried. Believe me, the Australian electorate will not be fooled. I must confess that I was surprised by the intensity of his rhetoric. I wondered where the Leader of the Opposition was going to land us with his so-called quantum leap. He sounded quite fanatical about the whole deal. He was putting his career on the line over this GST business. Fortunately for the Government and the Australian people he is still putting his career on the line, and I believe his career will go bung. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was addressing an audience of Queensland graziers and station owners. I guess there is not going to be a generally more conservative crowd together outside a meeting of the H.R. Nicholls Society. One could be tempted to say that he was really preaching to the converted. Yet this hardline, uncompromising attitude did not appear to be what Queensland's cattle industry wanted to hear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us face it, the cattle industry wants a government that will provide assistance in terms of access to overseas markets. It wants a government it can talk to and consult with about the future of that very important industry. Most cattlemen and women are not into basing the future viability of their property and the financial security of their children on an untried and non-negotiable set of economic dogma, as set out in Fightback. The concern about the hardline economic policies of the Opposition Leader that was there at the Cattlemen's Union conference in Mount Isa has been evident within the National Party for some time and I believe is now being felt within his own Party. It is scary stuff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> quotes an unnamed member of the Liberal Party of Australia who had this to say of his Leader:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once he makes up his mind he's a person who brooks no criticism. He is inflexible and very dominant.</PARA>
<PARA>When Kerry O'Brien asked the Leader of the Opposition on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> last week whether he had ever been wrong or had any nagging doubts about what he was doing, all he could say was that he ran too far that morning jogging to Parliament House. The Leader of the Opposition is never wrong. The theory is never wrong. As I said, this is scary stuff. Everyone makes mistakes, but not the Leader of the Opposition it would appear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> He said that he was a `firm believer' in what he was doing. But, alas, he seems to have a very singular vision. Queensland sugar growers do not agree with him; Australia's car manufacturers do not agree with him; Australia's leading company directors do not agree with him; unions do not agree with him; and, as I said earlier, increasingly I believe his own Party is not agreeing with him. Australians on all sides of politics do not like the direction in which he is heading. Why? Because he is only going backwards. He wants to take us on a quantum leap back in time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said it all, and very eloquently, in his Ben Chifley memorial address on the weekend. As the Prime Minister said, the conservatives want to take us back to `nineteenth century pseudo-scientific ideals'. We have an Opposition intent on imposing the theories of early industrial capitalism on an advanced post-industrial economy and in the face of the blatant failure of similar, misconceived and implemented policies elsewhere. The Opposition wants Australians to embrace an economic model that has clearly failed elsewhere. For example, and I again quote from the Prime Minister's recent address:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Communism has failed. Less spectacular but no less emphatic has been the failure of monetarism and laissez faire economics; under all its appellations&mdash;Thatcherite, Reagan and Rogernomic.</PARA>
<PARA>But still the Leader of the Opposition is a `firm believer'. And just what is it that the Opposition Leader believes in so firmly? He believes in the private sector; he believes in the forces of the market and the forces of competition; he believes in the level playing field; he believes in survival of the fittest; he believes that it is okay for those not so fit Australians to squirm at the bottom of the heap, to be cut off from unemployment benefits or to be bargained down to a minimum wage with no penalty rates or holiday leave loading, to be treated like second-class citizens in hospitals. Hey, that is competition and if the other bloke has more bargaining power than you, well, that is just bad luck&mdash;that is what the Leader of the Opposition believes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He would like to forget that the great shearers strike ever happened. He would like to take us back to the days when wealthy graziers from the mother country cruelly ruled the lives of the masses by virtue of their ownership of property stolen from its original Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander owners. The Opposition would like to take us back to the late eighteenth century when workers only had an average life expectancy of 38 years, when they started work at age 11 and worked a 70-hour week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, for the increasing number of Australians who are growing more fearful every day of the Leader of the Opposition's plans to take us back to the future, this Government does not share his free market zealotry. The Budget presented to this Parliament by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) is testimony to that. This Government believes in the need for government intervention in the economy; this Government believes that it should spend to stimulate jobs in the economy; this Government believes that it should be sensitive to the needs of particular industries in the context of the tariff debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a key point of difference between us and them. This issue of intervention directly reflects a difference in relation to tariff policy. It has been interesting to note that there has been a shaky shift in the Opposition's attitude towards difference. One minute we are poles apart, and the next minute we are exactly the same. For example, the Leader of the Opposition spent most of his post-Budget speech emphasising the difference between his policies and the Government's policies. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think the principal difference between you and us is the increasing role of government and the influence of government in this country . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .          . . .           . . .           . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key difference between you and us is that we believe in the private sector, we believe in individual Australians and we believe in the forces of the market and the forces of competition.</PARA>
<PARA>I heartily agree: we are different. I proudly stand here today and advocate the crucial role of government in any economy. I believe we should help to promote successful industries. There is no such thing as a level playing field. Ask the sugar growers in my electorate. Ask people in the peanut industry or the beef industry and, of course, ask the wheat farmers and the car manufacturers. Ask the farmers in Farrer, the electorate of the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this side of the House we of course believe in the ideal of the level playing field. We believe in the international GATT process. We believe in free trade. We agree with the Opposition Leader that it is not fair that the US Government is offering massive subsidies to US wheat farmers at the expense of Australian wheat farmers. International markets should not be distorted. All countries should have the opportunity to compete in a fair competition under the same rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But&mdash;and I guess this is a big but&mdash;it strikes me that the so-called free market system can sometimes be fundamentally unfair. If we are talking survival of the fittest, as the Leader of the Opposition would have it, we are talking about the big getting bigger and the little guy going to the wall. We are talking continued disadvantage and discrimination against women. We are talking continued disadvantage and discrimination against Australia's indigenous people. We are talking about leaving to fend for himself every battler out there looking for a job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is needed to make the system fair&mdash;I guess I am loath to use this analogy as we get close to grand final time&mdash;is an independent umpire, a democratically elected umpire to set some ground rules and to enforce those rules. When we talk purist laissez faire economics, we are talking anarchy&mdash;no government; no umpire. The Leader of the Opposition does not want government intervention. He wants the private sector to rule the day. He wants government to back right off and let the likes of Bondy and Skase and their mates in the banks simply reign supreme. It is madness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One lesson of the 1980s that has really cost us dearly as a nation is that some sections of the private sector cannot be trusted without intervention. But the Leader of the Opposition believes that the private sector knows what is best. He does not want government to legislate for any level of protection for any industries. He wants zero tariffs in the sugar industry and in the car industry. He does not care whether there is an Australian car industry or a sugar industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Strangely enough, this is where the Leader of the Opposition suddenly starts to backtrack on this issue of difference. He is suddenly saying that there is no difference at all. Clearly he is wrong. We are poles apart. The Prime Minister made that patently clear in his speech to the National Press Club today. This Government believes in consulting with industry groups about changes to the tariff regime. We have talked to the dairy industry and it is extremely happy. The sugar industry</PARA>
<PARA>task force has been up and down the sugar belt talking to growers, mill managers and workers. The tobacco industry has enthusiastically embraced the same process. The car industry wants to work with the Government to secure that industry's future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition is wrong. Our tariff policies are very different. This Government believes in working with industry, with the private sector; we believe in partnership. Again I quote the Prime Minister in his Ben Chifley address:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our guiding philosophy is social democratic, by which I mean democracy of the broadest kind: the maximisation of rights and liberties, the extension of both individual and opportunity and social justice.</PARA>
<PARA>As the Prime Minister pointed out, it is countries that have adopted this style of government that have succeeded. The Leader of the Opposition wants us to follow in Maggie Thatcher's shoes, to introduce the same failed policies that have put the United Kingdom, the United States of America and New Zealand into debt and, I believe, social decay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, let us look at the successful economies of the world&mdash;Germany, Singapore, Japan, Malaysia and Korea. Why are they successful? It is because government works with industry. Government provides some assistance when it is needed to secure an industry base, and government provides tax incentives to encourage industry. They are successful because, while they encourage a free market economy, they operate within a democratic framework to address social problems and needs. The Leader of the Opposition wants to ignore the lessons of the successful economies and instead take us backwards to the dark, dour days of Thatcherite Britain, or Reagan's USA with its mounting debt and escalating social problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The solution put to us by the conservatives opposite is not a solution but a proven recipe for economic and social disaster. The Opposition parties seem to have an obsessive need to hark back to the past. This is manifesting itself acutely in the strategies of the coalition in the Queensland State election campaign. First, we have the Nationals putting it in black and white in their policy document on industrial relations that women should be paid 30 per cent less than men&mdash;unbelievable! I wonder what Senator Flo Bjelke-Petersen made of that little effort. I have said that those on the other side of the House want to take us backwards and take women backwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next we have the Liberals running an insulting and offensive so-called law and order campaign that plays ruthlessly on the emotions of grief-stricken parents&mdash;a campaign that blames on the Goss Government the tragic murder of a young woman by a man with a previous conviction for violence. The legislation under which the man was released was introduced by the National Party Government. It is the sickest of campaigns and it has, deservedly, backfired. I would have thought that the Federal Liberals would have acted to stop such a base and manipulative campaign from getting off the ground. I guess by their silence I can read into it their tacit approval. Once again it is clear that their so-called radical agenda is intent on pushing us back to the Dark Ages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government is committed to social justice. It is committed to leading us forward; this Budget proves that once again. I am the convenor of the north Australian social justice strategy working group and I proudly note the mark that that group's efforts has had on this Budget in terms of financial assistance and the provision of services to people in northern Australia. The long awaited increase in tax zone rebates and the extension in this Budget of the rebate to social security remote area allowances is a clear acknowledgment of the Government's awareness of the costs faced by northern Australians in getting access to goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, this Budget is about jobs. It tackled unemployment in targeted regional centres across the north. My electorate of Kennedy received $3.3m in funding under the local capital works program. The funding has been targeted at shires with higher than average unemployment levels and it has been enthusiastically welcomed by councils concerned. Of course, it will enable those local councils to create employment through capital works initiatives such as recreation parks or gardens or tourism related developments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural health initiatives announced in this Budget have also been warmly embraced.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time I have left to speak, I will just hark back very briefly to the comments I made about the current election campaign in Queensland and the absolutely outrageous accusations that have been made by the Liberal Party&mdash;as I have said, I believe with the tacit approval of the Federal Liberals, as they seem to have done nothing to stop this very ugly campaign. An article appeared in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">North West Star</EMPHASIS>, which is the daily paper in Mount Isa. It quotes the Liberal candidate for the seat of Mount Isa, Mr Glen Brown, on the subject of legal aid. I believe that in this country we have one of the best legal aid systems in the world. Certainly, we can always argue that more money should be put into legal aid, but it is a very important social institution. It certainly serves a great role, particularly in rural and country courthouses where a duty solicitor is available for people to gain access to legal representation. I think most members of the Opposition would also agree that legal aid is a very important and worthwhile institution. But this is what Glen Brown, the Liberal candidate for the State seat of Mount Isa, had to say, according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">North West Star</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In regard to the National Health and Medical Research Council Bill 1992, let me declare an interest inasmuch as my wife has been a recipient&mdash;I think she may still be a recipient&mdash;of a National Health and Medical Research Council grant. Although I have not received any direct funding, I have certainly been associated with various organisations and research projects which have. On that basis let me say, therefore, that I offer my compliments right up front to the NHMRC. It has done a wonderful job in promoting medical research in this country, and it is in no small way responsible for the excellent reputation Australia has in medical research in particular. We certainly have a good reputation in the scientific field in general, but I think it is fair to say that we are amongst the two or three leading countries in terms of the reputation that our research has, and in terms of the impact it has had on health care in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could list a number of discoveries, inventions and enhancements which have occurred as a result of Australian medical research, but those would be well-known to most of the honourable members present. May I also add my compliments to Diana Horvath, who is responsible for the running of the NHMRC. In the time since she was appointed she has done an excellent job, and I am sure she will continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having an NHMRC is crucial, and it has been crucial for many years. I do not think anybody on either side of politics doubts that, and nobody on either side of politics doubts the importance of the role, current or future, of the NHMRC. That is relevant to the Bill before us because the Bill will actually reorganise the NHMRC and make it into a separate statutory authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first question we have to look at is whether there is a need for statutory authority status. The NHMRC currently exists under an executive order. There have been a number of reviews&mdash;and years of discussion, I think it is fair to say&mdash;of the role of the NHMRC. I remember reading a review first in 1981, if I remember rightly, and I think Sidney Sax carried out a review in 1984 or thereabouts. Both of those reviews looked at the role of the NHMRC. One of the questions addressed is whether the fact that the NHMRC does not have any separate statutory authority status is a problem. Should it be separate from government? Should it be independent of government in a more strengthened way or should we take the view, which the most recent review did, which said, `It may not be a statutory authority but it has succeeded impressively for 50 years in promoting, amongst other things, medical research in Australia.'? The review that I am referring to basically took the view: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NHMRC has an enviable reputation for independence, for making objective decisions free from political bias, and for taking into account the views of the community. It has a very open operation, one which is readily accessible by members of the public and members of the relevant professions involved in either applying for funds, disbursing funds or ensuring that the principles and aims of the NHMRC are achieved. The NHMRC reports twice a year to Parliament via its sessional reports, so there is a fair amount of accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have an organisation which has not only existed but also prospered, and it has prospered not just in terms of itself but in terms of enhancing our international reputation. As I said, for more than 50 years it has had a reasonable amount of independence. Nobody who works within the NHMRC really has any ground for concern about the independence of the way the body functions. It runs an open function and it is accountable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report from two years ago indicated that there was indeed great strength in the flexibility of the Order-in-Council situation rather than the rigidity of the statutory authority, which was the alternative. That report came down on the side of a maintenance of the current position. There were some changes suggested, but basically it was a maintenance of the current position rather than a moving over to the problems it saw with a statutory authority. What are those problems? There are a number. Firstly, as with virtually every statutory authority known to mankind, it would result in increased costs. It is not what the financial considerations of the Bill have indicated, but surely nobody would really doubt that setting up a statutory authority always has been and always will be associated with further costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The structure, however, is somewhat strange inasmuch as the NHMRC under this Bill will still be dependent upon the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services for various parts of its resources. Indeed, there is very little in this Bill which actually sets up the actual financing structure or any of those arrangements.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the NHMRC have indicated that they are happy with that arrangement because they would see it as a continuation of the current arrangement. The question then, of course, is this: if we have a continuation of the current arrangement in that regard, why do we need to change the arrangement so that the body operates in the form of a statutory authority?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, of course, the theoretical consideration that at any time, by a whim of the Minister, the NHMRC could be abolished. I have to say to the House that I think that that is a whim which is clearly not a reality. Certainly on our side of politics we would never dream of abolishing the NHMRC, or indeed radically changing it in the ways which have been suggested. I am sure that the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe), who is at the table, would agree that it is not part of his agenda. In that situation, why is there the need to fix something that is not broken? The answer is by no means clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of problems, and I am not sure that they have all been addressed. For example, it has been clear that, in the past, the NHMRC has not necessarily been equipped to fill some roles. For example, the Australian Medical Examining Council looks to the NHMRC as the prime source of advice on delivery of health care, and also on the prevention of disease and the promotion of good health. In the past, the NHMRC has really had some problems filling some of those roles; for example, the difficulty in mobilising resources quickly enough to provide it with any policy advice which might have been needed, or to undertake particularly urgent investigations. For example, it was to a certain extent unable to provide the large scale consensus building required for the development of operational national health goals and targets. It is currently unable to sponsor the extensive consultation required for the development of outcome measures for health service planning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that this new legislation does not give it any extra capacity in these fairly critical areas, so the bottom line in regard to that particular aspect is whether this proposal benefits Australian medical research or Australian advice in regard to the promotion of good health or the prevention of disease. Sadly, I think the answer is a resounding no. If that is the case, then we have to consider whether it is worthwhile embarking upon this change just for change's sake, just for the cosmetic appearance of giving more independence and freedom to a body which, as I have said, has worked very well. I think the Minister at the table would agree that there have been no major problems, except in one or two small areas, with the promotion of medical research in regard to that function of the NHMRC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, however, a couple of other points which need raising, apart from the overall principle of whether we need to enshrine this in the statutory authority. The first question which arises concerns ethics. Under this proposal, the Australian Health Ethics Committee will be maintained as a principal committee of the NHMRC. That raises a number of problems, some of which will be addressed by my colleague the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews). The first one, which is obvious, is the potential conflict which arises, and this has been pointed out in other situations. The question is that if one has a body&mdash;the NHMRC&mdash;which has as one of its main functions the promotion of medical research interests, and one of its other main functions is the ethical review of medical research and clinical practice, there is clearly a conflict in terms of those two requirements. On the one hand there is the question of pushing for more research and, on the other hand, a restraint in some of those areas in which research might be implemented or pursued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear that there should be a separation of those two aims with regard to medical research. There is a conflict and, even with the best will in the world, that conflict is still maintained. The Government has put forward some amendments, and I will discuss those later. The problem is that they really do not address the problem adequately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second problem is that the ethics committee guidelines are just that; they are guidelines. They have no real power. The amendments from the Government strengthen those guidelines a little, but in the end they have no real power, and that is a major problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third problem is the question of public accountability. There have been some criticisms of the ethics part of the organisation in terms of its accountability. One of the suggestions made in 1985 by the Senate Select Committee on the Human Embryo Experimentation Bill 1985, a Labor Party run committee&mdash;run I believe, by Senator Tate, if my memory serves me correctly&mdash;was that the Parliament should implement a recommendation which set up a separate statutory authority in that case, which would be the ethical committee, the ethical body for Australia. That recommendation has never been taken up. Indeed, I think this is an ideal time for us to consider doing this. Whether it should be a statutory authority or some other body, the important part is that it should be a separate body not under the auspices&mdash;or even seen to be under the influence&mdash;of the NHMRC and in particular the Medical Research Council. One of the amendments from the Government indicates that there should be only one Medical Research Council member on that committee, so some of the considerations there have been taken into account. But it really does not resolve the main problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that need to be taken into consideration here is the principles involved. As we embark upon a time of great scientific discovery, of pushing back the frontiers of not only test tube medical research but, in some ways more importantly, clinical medical research, we need to make sure that we have a set of guidelines which will hold firm into the future and not just maintain us for the next weeks, months or even year or two&mdash;something which indeed could be considered to be a legacy. In regard to this, Nicholas Tonti-Filippini, who is well known to most of us here, put the problem very succinctly when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A legacy we should try to leave future generations is a willingness to question our own ideology. That willingness should find practical expression in adequate review structures which are independent of the interests of the institutions they serve.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be most unfortunate if future generations look back to this century as a time of immense development in knowledge and technology, but one which proved incapable or unwilling to control the technology.</PARA>
<PARA>I will be very sad if indeed his reservations come to pass and we find that we have left a legacy to our descendants of which we should not be proud. I think he has succinctly summed up that particular difficulty. The problem is that what we are about to do in this legislation will confirm his fears in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been representations from a number of other groups. There have been representations, for example, from the Right to Life groups in Australia. They have major concerns, as do I, about embryo experimentation. They indicate their support for many of the findings of the 1985 Committee, and there is sadness that some of those recommendations have not been implemented. Keith Wilson, the Minister for Health in Western Australia&mdash;a good friend of the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services and somebody whose views he always shares, I am sure&mdash;said in his second reading speech on the Western Australian Human Reproductive Technology Bill 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular it will absolutely prohibit all use of human IVF embryos for research, including any diagnostic procedure on an IVF embryo. It will also prohibit the deliberate production of a human clone, or of a living human or animal/human hybrid or chimaera, embryo flushing, the keeping of or using of a human embryo beyond 14 days development, and the sale of human embryos or gametes. These absolute prohibitions reflect general community abhorrence of these practices, indeed or even the possibility of these practices.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Federation of Right to Life Associations said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst Federation Members have serious reservations concerning aspects of the WA legislation, those parts of the legislation concerning human embryo experimentation and associated matters appear to reflect the concerns of the Senate Select Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pending Bill&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the one before us now&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">if enacted will remove from Parliament and individual citizens the ability to question a utilitarian research ideology which we fear may dominate the NH&amp;MRC.</PARA>
<PARA>It is with sadness that I have to say that the Association's concerns are very genuine and the legislation in front of us does nothing to address these particular issues. I think it is vital that in regard to medical research we make sure that we enact legislation which protects all humans, but perhaps in particular the unborn humans who are unable to speak for themselves. The Government amendments which are before us go some way, but they do not go far enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention in passing that the amendments to the National Health and Medical Research Council Bill arrived on my desk at 10.30 this morning. This Bill has been in front of us for some considerable time. It was listed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> a few weeks ago. I think it is appalling that the Minister cannot give us any more sensible notice than that. I see the Minister is not actually meeting my eyes; he is hanging his head, and so he should. It is appalling that he should maintain those sorts of things. He shakes his head and scoffs. If he does not think this is an important issue that needs careful consideration, which clearly seems to be his view, then he should be ashamed of himself. He surely cannot defend sending these sorts of amendments to us a few hours before the main date with no time for discussion and no time for consideration or anything like that. He cannot seriously defend that. You are not going to answer that, clearly. I understand exactly why. </PARA>

I am sure he will respond in his speech, and I hope he responds in an appropriate way with an apology to the House for trying to transgress the generally accepted views of the House. It is sadly typical of the Minister's behaviour. This is not the first time that this has happened from the Minister for Health. It has happened on numerous occasions before. He seems very keen to obstruct the processes of this House and to make sure that there is no possibility of any bipartisan approach to these matters by foisting amendments on us at the last moment. Yesterday alone we phoned the Minister's office five or six times and still got no answer whatsoever. If he thinks that is an appropriate way to behave, then I feel sorry for him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another issue for which there is an amendment being circulated, and that is the question of representation of the Public Health Association of Australia. The issue here is one where the Public Health Association does not have a voice which is being heard. The issue has been summed up by the Association itself&mdash;I quote from its representations regarding this&mdash;where it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In his second reading speech, the Minister talks about NHMRC as the peak advisory body on public health; he talks of the importance of NHMRC in promoting and improving health and preventing ill-health (including safety of air and food). However, when it comes to the stipulated backgrounds he says "knowledge in the fields of medical standards and post-graduate medical training; health care training; the medical profession; the nursing profession; the trade union movement; business; consumer issues; social welfare services; and environment issues. Also included are representatives from each State or Territory, and a nominee of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>It quite rightly states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We wonder why public health has been excluded from this list. The chairs of the principal committees on Public Health and Public Health Research and Development are of course excellent people, but as they sit on the NHMRC Executive may not always be able to bring an independent voice for the population perspective (as opposed to the individual illness care perspective) to Council.</PARA>
<PARA>The Association requests an amendment to the NHMRC Bill so that the public health body has an appropriate representation. On its behalf, we will circulate that amendment. In the last hour or two we have also received a missive to support our view from Father Michael McKenna, who is a representative of the Catholic Bishops of Australia, about the ethical question which I raised a short time ago. In a media release with the headline, `Bishops concerned about accountability of the National Health &amp; Medical Research Council', Father McKenna says that the Bill needs careful scrutiny. The media release reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to the Bill proposed just this morning&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>emphasising the shortness of the consultation period&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">are due to be debated in the House of Representatives tonight. `They go some way, but not far enough, in meeting the concerns which the Bishops have been expressing to the Government over the past year,' Father McKenna said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Catholic Bishops Conference . . . has insisted that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the ethical review of research be undertaken by a body that is independent of the NH&amp;MRC</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the NH&amp;MRC be accountable to Parliament, not just to the Minister for Health</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The establishment of a new Committee . . . goes some way towards preventing researchers from being their own arbiters.</PARA>
<PARA>That is so when the composition is limited to one person. The press release continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the potential for conflict . . . still remains. The NH&amp;MRC has, as one of its prime objects, the promotion of medical research.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ethical monitoring of this research should not be done by a body under the aegis of the NH&amp;MRC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The accountability of the NH&amp;MRC is not addressed in the proposed amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>The legislation as it stands is lacking. It will not lead to a stronger body; it will lead to the continuation of potential conflicts of interest and other problems in terms of the ethical committees of the NHMRC. These issues need to be resolved. Our situation in regard to this is that we will move an amendment to allow for the Public Health Association to be represented on the appropriate committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will, however, oppose the Bill on the grounds that it is a waste of time. It is not going to improve the system, and it will lead to increased costs. In the Senate we will move to refer to a committee the question of the separation of the ethical component of the NHMRC into a separate body, which will consider whether there should be a statutory authority or whether it should take some other form. Our view is that it should be separate and completely independent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say in closing that the coalition is committed to research. In particular&mdash;partly because of my background&mdash;I have a major commitment to medical research. A government which claims to have a commitment to the clever country, I think, should endorse that view and should make sure that the NHMRC is a strong, powerful and independent body, and make sure that this issue is carefully resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other issue which I think needs to be clarified here is the fact that there is an interference, on a small scale at this stage, by the Minister in the direction of research of the NHMRC. There are pressures on the NHMRC from the Minister to direct research to areas which are commercially likely to be productive rather than the traditional direction of research, which has been research, if you like, for its own sake&mdash;pure research without any necessary direction of this towards commercial ends. We would all agree that if a commercial option occurs it should be utilised and exploited to make sure we get as much money back into Australia for these procedures as possible. However, there is a difference between using research findings which happen to occur in the process of research and using money to try to direct research into potentially commercially viable situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought the Minister, coming from Victoria, would above all have realised that governments trying to pick winners are usually, universally, failures at that option.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to reiterate our support for the NHMRC. We want to maintain the NHMRC as it is. For 50 years it has been a viable, active part of the Australian community which has led to the Australian community having a wonderful reputation in a whole range of areas, but particularly in the medical research area&mdash;something which we want to maintain and which this Bill does nothing to either enhance or protect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Health and Medical Research Council is Australia's peak advisory body on public health, health care and health and medical research and ethical issues relating to health. The Council and the Medical Research Endowment Fund were established in 1936, and since that time the advice of the Council has increasingly been taken without question.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 over $104m will be disbursed in support of medical and health research on the advice of the Council.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic purpose of the National Health and Medical Research Council Bill 1992 is to achieve this for the Council. Currently the Council is established by an Order-in-Council. The unique structure of the NHMRC lends itself to providing close linkages between health and medical research, health ethics, health care and public health, thus assisting the focusing of health and medical research on health outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NHMRC has wide ranging responsibilities in protecting and advancing the health and well-being of the Australian public. Its function is to develop standards and guidelines which are recommended to all levels of government in Australia. Legislators then give legal effect to these recommendations as they see fit. Some 30 people drawn from each State and Territory health authority, professional and scientific colleges and associations, unions, universities, industry, consumer groups, social welfare organisations and the Commonwealth administration make up the Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Council is the centre of an extensive network of working parties, advisory panels and committees which carry out detailed investigations and assessments for it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A real strength for NHMRC is its capacity&mdash;and, indeed, it has a tradition in this regard&mdash;to bring together the best people in Australia to work on a particular issue or to formulate health advice for the nation which is credible and respected. The Council has increasingly been opening up its processes and procedures to public participation, and the Bill provides for this desirable process to continue. It defines an intention of the Parliament as being that the Council, as far as practicable, adopt a policy of public consultation in relation to matters it is considering. Clauses 11 to 13 of the Bill in addition provide a comprehensive consultation process for the Council to follow when it is considering issuing guidelines or making recommendations that will require State legislation to give effect to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has shown foresight in fostering the expansion of health and medical research in Australia during a decade which has seen the explosive growth of new knowledge and technologies resulting in part from the revolution in molecular biology. It has increased funding for health and medical research from $29.8m in 1982-83 to $108.7m in 1992-93, which has allowed a high level of performance and productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NHMRC supports a range of research funding schemes such as project, program and unit grants, training awards and special initiative grants. However, the flagships of the NHMRC research support system are the five institutes which receive NHMRC block grants. These are the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, the Howard Florey Institute, the Baker Institute, the Murdoch Institute and the Garvan Institute. Australians can be justifiably proud of the world standing that these research institutes enjoy. They are all actively engaged in fundamental research and research which has commercial potential. This form of research support by the NHMRC has enabled these institutes to pursue closer interfaces with the private sector in some promising areas of commercialisation. A recent achievement at the Hall Institute is the well-publicised award winning research by a group led by Professor Donald Metcalf into a series of hormone-like molecules which control blood cells and their growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A study by the Australian Science and Technology Council has shown that Australian health and medical research performs well by international standards in science and technology. The Government and the NHMRC have recognised the importance of developing a much larger public health research base in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NHMRC peer review system for assessing research grant applications is seen as a very efficient and fair system of determining the scientific merit and the level of funding of proposed research projects. However, there is merit in providing for an Office of Commissioner of Complaints in the Bill to consider the small number of grievances relating to the disbursement of medical and health research grants. The Commissioner will examine the process adopted to see whether any fault of process affected the decision. Thus the Office of Commissioner will be a guarantee of the fairness and integrity of the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Successive governments have encouraged the research effort of the NHMRC by providing funding through the Medical Research Endowment Fund.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Council, although best known for its role in fostering world standard health and medical research, also plays an important role in health care largely through one of its principal committees, the health care committee.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NHMRC is currently producing a substantial body of work related to the care of the elderly.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Council has a very broad-based membership. Its ability to combine good science with broad-based community consultation has been one of the strengths of its public health position. The Council has also recognised that to reach good public health decisions it is necessary to look beyond narrow health interests. For example, the Council is currently in the final stage of reaching a decision on the future uses of organochlorin pesticides&mdash;a study which required the examination of health, environmental, housing and social health issues, as well as the examination of alternatives to chemical treatments for termites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill now before the House proposes a very clearly defined public consultation process for the Council when it is involved in an activity which is expected to result in a regulatory recommendation. This formalisation of the Council's public consultation process is a logical extension of its existing processes, as well as being consistent with the approach to new public health as set out in the 1986 Ottawa charter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members should be aware that the charter endorses the need for reorienting health services to give a stronger emphasis to preventative activities, as well as recognising the need to strengthen community action as a necessary basis for any successful public health intervention.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary functions of the Council relate to the improvement in health, the presentation, diagnosis and treatment of disease, the provision of health care and public health research and medical research in Australia. Moreover, the Council advises the Commonwealth on expenditure on public health research and training and medical research and training in this country. In fact, the appropriations for 1990-91 amounted to almost $91m. Indeed, the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe), who is at the table, acknowledged the primary function of the Council in his second reading speech when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in essence the functions of Council have changed little . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He referred to the address by Billy Hughes to the Council in 1937 when Hughes described the functions as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to promote the health of the people of Australia, to protect them from disease; and to advise, coordinate and direct research into the cause of, and cure for those diseases, which levy so heavy a toll upon the community, and which have hitherto baffled medical science.</PARA>
<PARA>The National Health and Medical Research Council was established in 1936 by an Order-in-Council as an extension of the previous Federal Health Council. Broadly, its concept was to bring together the health administrators of the time and the professional medical colleges and associations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will speak to one aspect of the work of the National Health and Medical Research Council and that is in relation to the overview of the ethics of medical research and the provision of medical services in Australia at the present time. In 1982 the Council resolved that in every institution in which human research is undertaken there must be a properly constituted institutional ethics committee and that no research project may proceed without prior consultation and approval of a written protocol by such a committee. Further, the National Health and Medical Research Council established a Medical Research Ethics Committee to advise and oversee in relation to the field of medical research and ethics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The functions of these institutional ethics committees are: first, to consider ethical implications of all proposed research projects and determine whether or not they are acceptable on ethical grounds; secondly, to provide for surveillance of research projects until completion so that the Committee may be satisfied that they continue to conform with ethical standards; thirdly, to maintain a record of all proposed research projects; and, fourthly, to establish and maintain communication with the National Health and Medical Research Council's medical research ethics committee and to provide access upon request to information in the institutional ethics committees' reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, these institutional ethics committees are required to conform with the NHMRC statement on human experimentation and the supplementary notes on research; to take account of local, cultural and social attitudes in making decisions; to ensure that procedures relating to obtaining of consent are observed; to ensure that no members of the committee adjudicate on proposals in which they may personally be involved; and, finally, to ensure that, while accepting that doctors have a duty to advance knowledge and research, the rights of individual patients or subjects of research take precedence over the expected benefits to human knowledge or to the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result of these arrangements in Australia is a two-tiered system of the Council's medical research ethics committee and the local institutional ethics committee. The former body's responsibility is largely the formation of and recommendation to the Council of appropriate guidelines for research, while the local committees oversee and approve research within their institutions, be they hospitals or medical research institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The guidelines approved by the Council reflect an acceptance that ethical judgments should, to quote a former chairperson of the committee, `continue to be made where local, cultural and social attitudes could influence things'. As such, the guidelines constitute some minimum requirements and not a comprehensive code of ethics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Human Embryo Experimentation Bill in 1985, referred to by the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), the Federal Government, rather than accept the recommendations of that Committee to establish a licensing system for embryo experimentation, established instead the National Bioethics Consultative Committee. This Committee issued a number of working papers and reports, culminating with reports on surrogacy in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following widespread criticism of the NBCC over its surrogacy report, a joint meeting of the Australian health and welfare Ministers rejected that Committee's report, leading the Federal Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) to announce the disbanding of the Committee and the assumption of its functions into a new Australian Health Ethics Committee under the aegis of the National Health and Medical Research Council. The new committee is chaired by Ms Robyn Layton, the chairperson of the former National Bioethics Consultative Committee, and includes as its membership former members of the previous committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existence of the ethics committees in hospitals and other medical research and health care institutions has become commonplace in Australia in the past decade. In some institutions these committees have been established for some years, while others have sought to establish similar bodies much more recently. Although in some institutions there has existed for some time a body sometimes known in the past as a medico-moral committee, which has served the purpose of advising about the conduct of certain procedures within the institution, the origin of ethics committees may be traced generally to the development in the United States of institutional review boards, following the issue of a policy statement entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Clinical Investigation Using Human Subjects</EMPHASIS> in 1966 by the Surgeon General of the United States. These boards were formed for the purpose of providing ethical assessment at an institution, and for the purpose of providing medical scientists with ethical approval when seeking research funding from Federal agencies. The approval of an institutional review board was a prerequisite following the 1966 decision of the Surgeon General for consideration of the funding application by the Federal agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concept of an ethics committee did not gain widespread approval until there was considerable publicity and impetus in 1976 from the decision of the new Jersey Supreme Court in the case of Karen Ann Quinlan. However, prior to that landmark Supreme Court decision the concept had received some academic and ethical interest. In a seminal article in the first issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Journal of Medical Ethics</EMPHASIS>, William M. May argued for the existence of ethics review bodies within hospitals to deal with issues such as informed consent, proposed benefits and the interest of special groups such as children and prisoners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Quinlan decision was made to provide the impetus for the subsequent establishment of ethics committees, the Supreme Court had acted upon the mistaken presumption that each hospital at that time had an operative committee. Moreover, the court contributed to some of the subsequent confusion about the function of the bodies by calling them ethics committees and assigning them the role of prognostication. The court's guidelines included the establishment of prognosis committees composed solely of physicians from multiple disciplines to be used for consultation and concurrence in decisions to withdraw, at that time, life-support equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A central feature of the New Jersey Supreme Court's decision, often not understood very well in discussions about the role and the development subsequently of ethics committees, was a concern at the time to relieve physicians of legal liability. As the court stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There must be a way to free physicians, in the pursuit of their healing vocation, from possible contamination by self-interest or self-protection concerns which would inhibit their independent medical judgements for the well-being of their dying patients. We would hope that this opinion might be serviceable to some degree in ameliorating the professional problems under discussion.</PARA>
<PARA>Thus, an essential feature of the Quinlan decision was the judicial fiat for the use of ethics committees to resolve difficult life and death dilemmas free from the spectre of civil and criminal liability. In this context, an ethics committee is primarily a legal mechanism for dispute resolution. Whether this is an appropriate function for ethics committees in Australia today is certainly debateable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, ethics committees were developed upon two bases: first, to approve ethically applications for research applications to the NHMRC, and to oversee such grants&mdash;what I describe as the regulatory function of these committees&mdash;and, secondly, to review ethical and other values involved in patient care decisions, and to make larger ethical and policy decisions, what might be described as an advisory function for the committees. The legal standing of the committees was strengthened by section 95 of the Privacy Act, which provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the National Health and Medical Research Council. . . may, with the approval of the Privacy Commissioner, issue guidelines for the protection of privacy in the conduct of medical research.</PARA>
<PARA>The Privacy Guidelines apply stringent conditions on institutional ethics committees when dealing with Commonwealth agencies thus reinforcing the legal, regulatory function of these committees and the Australian Health Ethics Committee. Therefore the National Health and Medical Research Council and the committees have conflicting roles. On the one hand, the prime function of the National Health and Medical Research Council in Australia today is to promote research; on the other hand, it has a function to regulate or police such research within individual institutions. I believe that this is a clear conflict of interest, and I say this as a member of a number of ethics committees, both currently and in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of reasons why I believe that the proposal in this legislation to continue the function of ethics committees under the National Health and Medical Research Council is entirely inappropriate. Firstly, the NHMRC is primarily a body established to promote and fund medical research in Australia. There is a clear conflict between the promotion of medical research and the ethical regulation of it. This concern was raised, for example, by the United States Office of Technology Assessment in its report on genetic engineering and by the United States President's Commission for the Study of Biomedical and Behavioural Research in its November 1982 report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Splicing Life</EMPHASIS>. The United States Commission recommended, in so far as possible, that the oversight functions of the advisory committee should be separated from the sponsoring functions, so that no conflicts of the sort that plagued the Atomic Energy Commission in America would arise in this field of activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the national study of institutional ethics committees conducted in recent years raised serious misgivings about the system of regulation involving the NHMRC and institutional ethics committees. The study concluded that some researchers were present, for example, at meetings when their own projects were discussed and decided upon and that there was an absence of comprehensive monitoring of research protocols. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the NHMRC guidelines have no statutory force. At best, the guidelines issued by the Council are tabled in this Parliament&mdash;and I am not aware that that has ever happened&mdash;but they are not subject to a motion by this Parliament either to allow them or disallow them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, as a committee of an independent body, there will be little public accountability. The Medical Research Ethics Committee, now the Australian Health Ethics Committee, of the NHMRC has in the past issued guidelines without public submissions or comment. Recently, the NHMRC issued guidelines for the maintenance of genetic registers&mdash;a matter of some importance and of some future importance in this country and generally in the world&mdash;without any public debate at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifthly, the Medical Research Ethics Committee has adopted only one approach to ethics. As one of its former members, Dr Robert Jansen, has said, the Committee adopted a consequentialist position in its approach to medical ethics. Yet consequentialism is widely rejected as an approach to medical ethics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sixthly, I believe it was inappropriate to reconstitute the National Bioethics Consultative Committee under a different guise. First, the previous committee members were clearly out of touch with community sentiment over surrogacy as evidenced by the widespread rejection of their report and a subsequent rejection of their report by the Federal and State health and welfare Ministers. Despite the revelation that a minority wrote the majority report, the legalisation of surrogacy was actively promoted by a number of members of the National Bioethics Consultative Committee, some of whom are now members of the Australian Health Ethics Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the NBCC was criticised also for not being prepared to debate its position and for its chairperson, Ms Layton, leaving a national conference on surrogacy without taking any questions at all. It has been claimed also that submissions to the NBCC from interested groups were not even read by all the Committee members, some of whom are now members of the Australian Health Ethics Committee. I believe it is inappropriate for the Federal Government to suggest now that the Committee be replaced simply under a different name at a different location. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government should accept that the NBCC was an experiment which failed and, instead of repeating the mistake, institute a committee that meets with general public and societal approval. It is to be recalled that the national inquiries conducted by the Family Law Council and the Senate Select Committee recommended a national approach to issues such as reproductive technology. The Senate Committee recommended that a licensing body be established by legislation in which broad declarations of principle were set down. Appropriate regulation in a sensitive and complex area such as reproductive technology requires a system which is accountable and inspires public confidence. I believe that the current proposal will achieve neither. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In amendments which have been placed before the House today the Government has gone some way towards improving the situation. It has inserted into clause 34 subclause (3A), which states that the Ethics Committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)must not have more than one member of the Medical Research Committee among its members; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)must have as its Chairperson a person who is not a member of the Medical Research Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>The further amendments which have been moved by the Government provide that the guidelines in force at the present time&mdash;that is, guidelines that have been issued to date by the National Health and Medical Research Council&mdash;should continue to be the guidelines of the new statutory body and that guidelines should be issued in relation to matters of ethics and medical research by the new statutory body, the National Health and Medical Research Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this goes only partly towards solving the fundamental conflict of interest between placing within one body the function of regulating research and, at the same time, having as its primary function that of promoting, sponsoring and funding through the medical research endowment fund the conduct of medical research in Australia. If the Australian community is to retain the belief that medical research which is carried out in this country is research which meets all the ethical requirements that it as a community would wish to impose, I believe that the separation of the two functions&mdash;that is, the function of funding and sponsoring research and the function of regulating that research&mdash;ought to be clearly defined and delineated. The National Health and Medical Research Council Bill does not go so far as to clearly define and delineate those two functions. Whilst the amendments that have been introduced on behalf of the Government by the Minister go some little way towards clarifying that issue, the fundamental issue of conflict between regulation and sponsoring of research remains in this proposed legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;The Government is aware of the interest in medical circles, in particular in the areas of health and research, of the National Health and Medical Research Council Bill. I will try to make several points as dispassionately as I can. Firstly, all this legislation does is sit what has now become a great national institution within the context of the responsibility to this Parliament. I would have thought that a body that has operated since 1936, a body that has every right to independence&mdash;and that independence ultimately can be properly grounded only within the Parliament&mdash;a body that, in terms of the funds at its disposal, has grown during our period in government from close to $30m in 1983 to a budget closer to $110m, deserves the scrutiny of this Parliament and legislation that provides clarity for its goals, that provides a basis for its regulations and that provides the opportunity from time to time for the scrutiny of the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are talking about is evolutionary change. Over its history, the National Health and Medical Research Council has not remained static but has been prepared to grasp new challenges and continue to provide the leadership that it does provide in Australia and, indeed, internationally. Its capacity to change is very important. But that change is now, and will be in the future, evolutionary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a great deal of discussion tonight by Opposition members about the issue of ethics. I thought that what we heard from the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) was a very passionate argument against the National Health and Medical Research Council. Frankly, he began with a note of admiration but then went on essentially to suggest that functions which have been together for some time, and which certainly current members of the National Health and Medical Research Council strongly believe belong together, should be separated; that is, research roles, regulatory functions and ethical issues within the province of the Council. Those issues do, in a real sense, belong together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have had, certainly from the honourable member for Menzies, is a somewhat legalistic discourse about elements of ethics. I do not think there has been recognition of the fact that, increasingly, ethical issues are inseparable from every aspect of the Council's work. I think it is that inseparability that makes it entirely appropriate that the Council, in terms of its responsibilities, ought to go to ethics, not in a narrow sense, perhaps not in the sense of some of its critics who appear to be somewhat preoccupied with a particular range of issues in the area of bioethics, but with a full range of ethical issues, including the issues that have been of concern particularly to the current Chairperson of the Council, Diana Horvath. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, one of the reasons why I thought she was an appropriate person to lead the Council was her interest in issues of resource allocation, which obviously will be quite central, now and increasingly in the future, in the area of health. When resources are limited one is ultimately driven to the question of making choices. Making those choices may not represent ethics in the narrow sense that has been talked about tonight, but ultimately they are choices about human lives and choices about the best way to make use of resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This might go to the issues raised by the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), when he talked about his concerns in terms of the commercialisation of medical research, for example. To use resources that are perhaps directed in some respect to building on the very substantial basic research that has been done in Australia involves questions of allocation of resources. Should we develop research in directions which will be profitable from the commercial point of view, or should we develop research only when it is likely to have a prime benefit in terms of health care-type goals? There are real conflicts in terms of those priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the National Health and Medical Research Council have been very much aware of those tensions and have been prepared to come to terms with them. The Science Council&mdash;particularly through Professor Nossal&mdash;has put on some pressure to suggest that those who have been so interested in medical research in a narrower sense ought to recognise how crucial so much of that research is to Australia's economic interests, if not to its national interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be the first to agree that scientists need to be prepared to question their own ideology. Indeed, I would not think there is anything particularly controversial about that statement. Of course, scientists have to be prepared to question their own ideological presuppositions from time to time. Indeed, that does not apply simply to scientists; it applies more generally to those who are interested in a whole range of forms of endeavour. But, certainly in the area of research, a whole range of issues will ultimately turn out to be ideological issues or issues with elements of ideology in them which need to be open to question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is not about closing off opportunities for the National Health and Medical Research Council, but it is about providing an underlying basis of legislative support so that it is able to grasp new opportunities and to define its own priorities. Like the honourable member for Lowe, I do not have any difficulties with the notion of researchers and research bodies, such as the National Health and Medical Research Council, giving thought to the policy basis behind the priorities that they set and thinking about where those priorities will need to be from time to time. I think it is a good thing that the Council is now thinking perhaps rather more strategically and giving some thought to how its priorities might be defined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In saying that, the Government has no particular desire to interfere in that process. I see it as very much a process within the Council itself: the Council should determine its own priorities. But it is important that Australia is aware of its place in the world and of the very considerable resources that we put into the whole area of medical and medically related research. I think the honourable member for Lowe said that we were one of only a small number of countries in terms of the size of investment that we make in this area. I think he is right in that sense. That, of course, makes us tremendously important, particularly within this region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I received a note from Gus Nossal today in which he made the point that we are leading the world in certain aspects of dealing with of HIV and AIDS, particularly in areas such as intravenous drug use. Our capacity to deal with AIDS has won us some reputation. He made the point that in the WHO Mr Mercer suggested to him that Australia's record in this area was outstanding and one of real leadership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, within this region we have massive health problems. There is a great need to respond to those problems in terms of the development of more advanced health care systems. So the Government clearly recognises the role of the National Health and Medical Research Council. It is not simply a matter of a body which belongs to Australia; it is a body which is important within the region and, indeed, internationally. It carries part of the load in terms of advancing medical research and opportunities for stronger medical science and for improving the status of people's health, as I said, not only in this country but also very much in our part of the world. So I commend the National Health and Medical Research Council Bill to the House for its support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were two amendments which relate to recognition of the role of the Public Health Association. As the honourable member for Lowe will know, people are not appointed to the various committees of the National Health and Medical Research Council, for the most part, in a representative capacity; they are appointed because of the expertise that they bring. But the Government has no particular reason to argue about the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Lowe, which we understood would be moved by the Australian Democrats in the Senate anyway. We had indicated to the Democrats that we would be prepared to accept an amendment along the lines of that moved by the honourable member for Lowe. With those remarks, I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take up the remarks that were made by the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) in relation to the substantive debate on the National Health and Medical Research Council Bill prior to its reaching the committee stage. I am prepared to accept that the Minister misconstrued the remarks I made in my speech on this Bill when I said that there was a belief in the community generally that the regulatory function of the National Health and Medical Research Council ought to be clearly delineated from the function of sponsoring research within the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That issue has been one of considerable debate and interest to all those concerned with medical research and ethical matters generally in relation to this legislation, to the National Health and Medical Research Council and to medical research generally. It is my belief that proposed clause 7A, which has been referred to by the Minister, does not go far enough in establishing that clear delineation. It is inappropriate for the Minister to come in here tonight and characterise this as simply a narrow issue relating particularly to embryo experimentation or matters of that ilk. I will give an example of this in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of all the members of this chamber&mdash;indeed, I suspect, of this Parliament&mdash;may I say without boasting that I know more than most about these issues. Prior to coming here, much of my practice related to legal and ethical matters relating to medical research. Even though I was a barrister, in the last three or four years of that practice I probably spent more time in hospitals, medical research institutions and the like advising them on matters relating to their legal and ethical responsibilities and duties than I did in a court of law. For the Minister simply to characterise this in some way as a narrow issue is simply to place a characterisation on the issue which is at best inappropriate. I will not say what it is at worst. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give an example. Let us take a matter which does not raise any sort of religious connotation, if that is what the Minister might have been suggesting. Let us take the issue of organ transplantation. In relation to organ transplantation there are two matters of interest which could be of concern in terms of medical science. The first is the natural interest of the medical scientists concerned to promote organ transplantation&mdash;an interest which I suspect most ordinary members of the Australian community would support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is not only the aspect of the clinical organ transplantation itself from a person who is, for example, head injured in a car accident to a person who is in need of a replacement heart, liver or some other organ, but there are also the medical research aspects of organ transplantation. That is to ensure we have more effective organ transplantation and to ensure that the causes of rejection of replacement organs can be overcome. There is a real, legitimate concern in the medical community and the medical research community to promote organ transplantation in Australia. That concern is one which I believe is shared by most ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, on the other hand, there are questions about the mechanism by which organ transplantation should take place. What regulation, what legal and ethical mechanism should surround organ transplantation?  For example, what sort of information ought to be given to the relatives of a person who is wheeled into hospital and placed on a ventilator, when, 48 hours later, the relatives are told that that person is brain dead?  If one looked at that patient, one would say, `There is a normal, healthy, well functioning patient'. The only difference between that person and any one of us who are walking around is that that person happens to be lying on a bed in intensive care in a hospital and hooked up to a ventilator. But to all intents and purposes one would say that person appears to be alive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the ethical considerations that go to that organ transplantation? What should the relatives be told? What sort of information should be given to them so they can give their consent and so that their beloved son, daughter, uncle, aunt or mother can give that replacement heart or liver or some other organ in an organ transplant procedure?  I could give many other examples but I am limited by time tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those sorts of issues relating to the ethical concerns surrounding aspects of medical research are not ones which are necessarily congruent with the actual sponsoring of medical research. This has been a matter of widespread debate in the Australian community. People are genuinely concerned about these issues. People are saying, `I have walked into a hospital ward and seen a person there who 24 hours ago was sitting down to dinner with me in my living room. Now I am being told that this person, who looks to be alive and who appears to be functioning normally, is brain dead'. But his heart is beating, his blood is circulating, he has all the normal pulses and everything that one would expect of a live person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That raises real ethical concerns which cannot be simply swept away by the Minister saying that these are narrow issues relating to matters such as embryo experimentation, or that they raise narrow legalistic issues that only lawyers or those concerned particularly in the field of ethics and medical research would be concerned about. They are real issues which are being debated across the board in a number of areas, of which organ transplantation is just one. They do not raise matters of religious affiliation; they raise matters of our very humanity and dignity as human beings. People are saying, `It is my concept of what it is to be a human person that is at stake when I am told that this person lying here is brain dead and therefore dead and that I should give my approval to the transplantation of the liver, the heart or some other vital organ of that person to another person'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not criticising the National Health and Medical Research Council. As I said genuinely at the outset of my remarks, the work of the Council is highly valued not only by me but also by the general Australian community. But that does not dismiss the very real arguments that have been raised about whether or not the regulatory function of the National Health and Medical Research Council ought to be separated from its function of sponsoring research within this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that as a person who has been and remains a member of ethics committees of hospitals and other health institutions. Those hospitals and institutions have a real interest in promoting medical research. Their interest is motivated by a real concern for the health, the well-being and the life of the patients in those institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter simply cannot be dismissed out of hand, as the Minister sought to do tonight, by saying that somehow this is not a real issue; that somehow this matter has not been debated within the general community over the past five or six years; or that somehow this is some sort of narrow legal issue. It is a real issue which goes to the very question of the dignity of human persons. Those issues ought to be addressed. I repeat that, whilst this clause goes some way towards delineating that regulatory and sponsoring function, it does not go far enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one believes that the regulatory function ought to be separated from the sponsoring function in the body, then one would go much further in terms of separating those two functions. In fact, one would say that what is ethical in relation to medical research ought to be determined by a separate body from that which determines what ought to be promoted as a matter of research. There are real issues of conflict between the two, and they ought to be addressed. This amendment does not address them sufficiently. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not mean to convey the impression that I did not think these issues were serious and complex, that I did not think they involved a range of considerations or, indeed, that I did not think different contributions might be made by people of different backgrounds. The reason why the membership of the Committee is specified in the way it is is to provide for people who are not from a medical background to play a significant role within the life of the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just take issue with the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) in one respect. At the end of the day these issues, whether it is in medical research or in the health care system, do need to be resolved in a way that involves and gives a key role to those who make up much of the membership of the NHMRC. They have a very important interest in seeing that ethical issues or issues that involve moral choice are thoroughly worked through in a way that encourages dialogue, rather than the adversarial role that is perhaps more appropriate to the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that, in terms of the history of the previous separate committee, that is the direction in which we were heading: we were heading in a direction that would have had conflict which was always very difficult to resolve in a way that brought the cooperation and the active involvement, interest and indeed ownership of those issues by the medical profession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many ways there is no group in Australia more divided than that of the medical profession. It is a group that Sidney Sax said, seeing as he is being quoted tonight, is very much a strata of interest. It is so easy to create a situation where what we are fighting about are the trivial issues rather than the very substantive issues to which the honourable member has quite rightly drawn the attention of the House tonight. These are always a matter of judgment. The judgment that I as Minister have made is to say that the National Health and Medical Research Council is the appropriate body or the umbrella, ultimately, within which ethical issues ought to be raised. So the Government recognises some substance in the point made by the honourable member for Menzies and we have tried to recognise that. He says that we do not take that recognition far enough, but I simply say that I would not want to take his point so far that what it finally resulted in was a process that was external to the National Health and Medical Research Council. That body has played a distinguished role. All of the major parties in a sense are involved and we need obviously to broaden the National Health and Medical Research Council. We have tried to do that at the Council level. Indeed, in terms of the way in which this Committee has been composed we have also tried to recognise that there are other disciplines and backgrounds that will be important in dealing with ethical issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that I was making and on which perhaps I was misunderstood by the honourable member for Menzies was that we should not take a narrow view of what ethical issues are represented. There is a whole range of ethical issues, some of which go to concerns such as those raised by the honourable member but others of which go to even broader concerns that perhaps I had in mind as being important from my social, as opposed to the honourable member's legal, background. Obviously in debates such as this we bring to them our backgrounds, prejudices and presuppositions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My faith in the National Health and Medical Research Council is also reflected in legislation which will provide a base for developing over time the necessary regulations where that is appropriate and certainly allowing the Parliament itself to act as a watchdog on these issues. I suppose that, perhaps because we are in a political arena, we see these issues from a certain perspective. But at the end of the day, in health, politicians often have to resolve the issues that in a sense are more difficult, or so difficult that no-one else can quite resolve them. The Parliament is on many of these issues the ultimate court of appeal, if you like. Sometimes in the fire of community debate people diminish the importance of institutions such as the Parliament for resolving ultimately very difficult and complex issues. So it is certainly not for any narrow political purpose that this Bill is before the House. It is one that I hope will enhance, strengthen and ultimately give a larger place in history to a body that has survived not for any legal reason or any political reason, but because the Australian people have recognised its worth&mdash;not in a narrow medical research sense but in terms of the wide range of its activities, which certainly I was convinced by the Council it believed ought to be held together within a single institution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1992-93 deals with the Government's Budget, which I think will be the last of the Keating Government Budgets. Unfortunately it is a Budget hardly worth a mention. If honourable members want any evidence of that, I suggest that they should go back to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and have a look at how many Government speakers have given the provisions of this Budget practically no attention at all. They seem to be more concerned with the Opposition's proposals when they are in government. Government speakers have spent by far the largest amount of their time in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A notable aspect of the Budget is that it proposes a $13,500m deficit. That must be compared with last year's Budget estimate of a $4,000m deficit, which turned out to be close to a $10,000m deficit. One can only speculate on where this one might go. I do not think the Government has any idea at all. Over half of that deficit, some $7.4 billion, is for the payment of unemployment benefits. Whilst none of us object to that assistance being given, for a government it is a total admission of failure. The economy is in huge difficulties if the Government has to pay that sort of money to people to do nothing, and that is just one of the indicators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another indicator is that, in gross debt terms, this nation now owes $180,000m upon which it must pay interest. Those servicing costs are exceeding 20 per cent of the value of our exports. Economic history points out that, whenever that figure goes past 25 per cent, we have a situation that has occurred in Australia on only two previous occasions&mdash;the 1890s and the 1930s, periods of great economic depression and massive unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that, when we look at the growth in Australia's international indebtedness during the Hawke-Keating Administration, now the Keating-Dawkins Administration, we see an increase in international indebtedness of $150,000m. During that time, the Government, ignoring population growth, lays claim to having created 1.5 million jobs. As a matter of simple arithmetic, that means Australia has borrowed $100,000 to create each of those jobs. Unfortunately, those jobs have come from nowhere else; they have made this nation further indebted to the rest of the world. The great tragedy is that the young people of this country must bear the repayment problems associated with that debt and they will probably do that, without dramatic change to the way this economy is managed, by lower living standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worst statistic that we can lay at the feet of this Government is that those of us with younger children stand here tonight as the first group of Australian parents in history to deliver a lower standard of living to our children  than we enjoy ourselves. There is an ever growing gap between the rich and the poor. That seems to be a reasonably amazing situation to have occurred under a Labor Government. The solution offered in this Budget, offered in One Nation, is: `Don't worry about all those indicators. We believe that if you will just let us borrow the last $20,000m we can fix the problem'. A million bank managers must have heard that story from people who knew their businesses were going to fail. The Government says, `Let us borrow some more and we will fix it. We will spend our way out of your problems'. But the only winner in the short term is this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not end there because the Government has made some projections relative to the growth in this country, and it can only grow on that debt. Not one commentator is prepared to support the claim that there will be sufficient levels of growth. The only way the Government can get Budget deficits down in the future is to propose more taxes. We are expecting to hear how they will be applied tomorrow. We are going to have a bigger prescribed payments system, a bigger interest withholding system, and a bigger fringe benefits system. It appears that people were told originally that if they gave their tax file number to their bank they would not be considered tax dodgers and, as such, they could retain all of their interest. Some would need it desperately. They are now being told, `Don't worry about that. Irrespective of whether your tax file number is there or not, we are going to take some of your interest earnings'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That stands in stark contrast to what the Opposition is saying. We will follow the lead of other successful economies and allow people to earn interest free of tax. This Government's solution to savings is compulsory superannuation; ours is to give tax incentives that will encourage people to save their money. Fishermen, farmers and the service sector will all be at risk tomorrow. I will not be too gullible if the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) comes up with a very mild proposal. We have seen from the proposals that the Government will make tomorrow that those original, mild, prevention of tax evasion measures&mdash;interest withholding tax, and the PPS&mdash;are suddenly going to become fundamental standard revenue measures. If the Government is going to have a GST when it is not going to have a GST, all it needs to do is use its prescribed payments system and its revised wholesale sales tax system. It can put it all together and say, `It is not us', but it has the same effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That stands in contrast to the policy the coalition has proposed for Australia in Fightback. It is interesting to note that the Government Whip, the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear), stood up today and said, `I remind you that Mr Tuckey said he would not tolerate a GST'. I do not resile from my statements at that time. Standing here tonight as a member of the coalition, if all that was in our Fightback policy was a GST, and if all that we were proposing was the Government's tax proposal where it swapped a GST for the WST, I would still oppose it because I would see it as another tax. But that is not what Fightback is about. That is why I stand here tonight as an ardent supporter of Fightback, because Fightback is a big policy in many areas other than tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look briefly at the item that will be introduced immediately upon our election to government&mdash;labour market reform. It is interesting to see the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) at the table. We know his views and his background: he is a trade union bureaucrat. As Minister for Finance he knows that he has to protect the very substantial incomes of the Bill Keltys and others of this world. He has to keep Tas Bull and his North Shore residents in Sydney. These bureaucrats are extremely concerned about what we are going to do. The simple fact is that their members, the workers, do not have to have that fear. Only the jobs of senior trade union bureaucrats need to be at risk.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, we might even have to call them that. The simple fact is that we will create a situation where voluntarily people may contract out of an award. I think it is worth looking very quickly at some of the problems that the award structure gives workers today. We are told of the great victories and the hard fought battles that gave workers penalty rates. That means that if a man works the second shift, he is more than likely to get time and a half for the first hour's work, and if he works the late shift, he will get double time. That is a great victory for workers. There is only one problem: none of them are getting it. The factories are locked up. Business has discovered that it is too expensive to pay those rates; it is cheaper to pay interest to the bank.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my State, wheat growers pay $1m a year in demurrage to foreign shipowners so that they can be tied alongside our wharves at night time because it is too expensive to pay double time to continue loading them with grain. Is that not a tragedy? People are denied a job by the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we have heard before of women in a Victorian clothing factory who went to their boss and said, `Look, we would like to start work half an hour earlier, we would like to do without smoko, take half an hour for lunch, and get home an hour and a half earlier so that we beat our kids home from school; they are getting into trouble'. The boss agreed, but the arbitration inspectorate came around two weeks later and said, `If you continue that practice, we'll sue you'. That is a great benefit to the workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have apprentices in my electorate who, according to their parents, would willingly work for nothing just to be able to complete their indentures and become tradesmen and have the opportunities that that would give them. Their employers cannot afford to take them back on, and the law prevents their employers taking up their offer. They must be paid full wages or nothing. It is full wages or the scrap heap. The kids do not want to be on the scrap heap, their parents do not want them to be on the scrap heap, but of course everyone is powerless to help. They are the sorts of things we will change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made the point about those wealthy union bureaucrats, the men on the big money with their of directorships and everything else that they get given by this Government. I remind this House, as I have time and time again, of the comments of Mr Kelty, Secretary of the ACTU, when the IRC rejected their accord mark 6. When I say `their', I mean the trade union movement and the Government. He said to his colleagues on television, `If we let the Industrial Relations Commission get away with this, we will lose all our power'. He did not say, `Our members will be unable to clothe their children or buy their schoolbooks'. That did not worry him in the least. All he was concerned about was that he would lose all his power. We will change the system that says to many workers in Australia, `If you are not prepared to pay a bribe to a trade union, you can't have a job'. We will guarantee everyone the right to work, and I think the workers will be very pleased when they understand that better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we are told that the workers will be exploited, that they will be driven into the ground. We had the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) saying today that it would be illogical to think that if we cut wages living standards would not fall. We were told a lot about New Zealand and its change to a deregulated labour market. We had the Minister for Finance reading letters that someone had planted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>. We had the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer giving us New Zealand day after day. Has it come to your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we are not hearing about New Zealand any more? There is a deathly silence on New Zealand in this place. Joan Kirner is a bit slow; she thought it was still happening. She does not read her mail. I read mine. I read the national accounts from New Zealand. I read about its work and how wages have increased under this new and apparently dreadful arrangement. Wages have increased by 1.3 per cent in real terms. I went to the Australian statistics to discover that in the same period the workers in Australia who have this wonderful regulated system actually had their wages fall 0.5 per cent in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does `real terms' mean? It means that New Zealand workers are buying 2 per cent more with their pay at this moment than Australian workers are, compared to the situation a year ago. That is the case for New Zealand workers across-the-board. I know that we can go over there with our television cameras and pick some complaining New Zealander. We would have no trouble finding five to one in Victoria. The simple fact is that we must accept the national statistics. New Zealand workers' wages have gone up 1.3 per cent in real terms. I have pointed out to this place before that that is the real test&mdash;real terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Employment, Education and Training was wrong again when he said that if wages fall we must have lower standards of living. No, not if our buying power goes up. Of course, when our factories become more efficient the first people to benefit will be Australian workers. The things they need to live on, the things they want, will be cheaper. So the real wages are the key, and New Zealanders have it. That is an interesting fact if one is a Queenslander, a Western Australian or a New South Welshman. I ask people these days, `How did you enjoy your Kiwi XXXX the other day? How did you enjoy your Kiwi Swan? How did you enjoy you Kiwi Tooheys?'. New Zealand now owns half of Australia's brewing capacity&mdash;our national symbol in the hands of the Kiwis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is another aspect of all this, of course. The second stage is tax reform. As I have said to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I was converted to Fightback by some simple arithmetic, such as sales tax being totally eliminated&mdash;$9.4 billion&mdash;and fuel tax being totally eliminated. The previous speaker from the other side, the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls), was condemning these processes today, and he represents one of the most remote areas in Australia. He represents people who travel huge distances just to get to the next town. He might answer to this Parliament why he is against reducing his constituents' fuel taxes by $10 and $11 a tank-full; why he is saying to those who rely on the mining industry, `It is better to protect a car industry than have your industry develop'. I have nothing against the car industry, but I represent farmers and I fight for them first. The honourable member for Kennedy represents remote area dwellers, and it is about time he stood up for some of the things we offer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Payroll tax is to go, too&mdash;another $6 billion. Of course, 30 per cent is to come off personal income tax. It is worth putting on the record what that means in tax scales. It means that if workers earn $10,000 a year, they will pay 5c tax on each dollar. If they earn $20,000 a year, they will pay 10c tax on each dollar. If they earn $50,000 a year, they will pay 22c tax on each dollar. Do honourable members remember when Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen said, `Make me Prime Minister and I'll give you a flat 20 per cent tax.'? This is better than that. One has to earn $48,000 a year before one even pays 20c tax in the dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another bit of simple arithmetic. Those taxes to be eliminated are taken right off the statute book. We had Government members today saying, `Oh, you have to hold a bit there for the purpose of road user charges'. We have already rejected that. Our Leader is on the record as saying that we will not do that. It is a good idea that we never do it. Why? Because that is how fuel tax started. It was originally introduced as a road user charge, and it has gone to 26c or 27c a litre. It is now a revenue measure. It cannot be on the statute book at all, and under our proposals it will not be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple thing is that when we add up those particular reductions&mdash;the sales tax, the fuel tax, the payroll tax, and the reduction in income tax&mdash;the total is about $35,000m. Everybody accepts that a GST will bring in only $27,000m. I am very proud to say that we are reducing overall taxation by $8 billion. Government members say, `Oh yeah, and you are going to take it all off social security'. I pointed out to the Parliament earlier today that the largest single item to achieve that reduction is a reduction of $1.32 billion in interest, paid, if not directly then certainly indirectly, to foreign banks. The simple fact is that we will not necessarily have to reduce a lot of those things. But it is all there in black and white to be seen. Of course, it is very interesting that the Treasury says it is achievable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whenever Government members get up, they start talking about `plus 15 per cent'. Their own Treasury has said that it is only about 4 per cent. On 26 May, the Treasurer said that it was 4.7 per cent. On the same day, the Prime Minister said that it was 5 to 6 per cent. They are all jacking it up a little, but it cannot be jacked up by 15 per cent. They know that the overall CPI effect is only about 4 to 5 per cent. Furthermore, they ignore completely the cascading effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give the House the quick example of bread. Everyone would tell us that bread is not taxed, but we know that it costs a typical truck driver $1,000 a week to meet his consumption tax commitments, and $1,000 a month in lease payments on the hire purchase component of his prime mover. And he passes it on. Just think how often that simple tax that the transport operator passes on impacts on a loaf of bread. It impacts on bringing the rock phosphate from the wharf; it impacts on the fertiliser being delivered; it impacts on the grain being delivered a couple of times; it impacts on the flour being delivered. And what does the typical baker use to cook bread? He uses fully taxed automotive diesel. Then he puts it in another van, and a fully taxed van at that, and delivers it to a supermarket. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If all of those costs add up to 10 per cent of the retail value of a loaf of bread, and if we deduct that 10 per cent and then add 15 per cent, we have an increase of 3 or 4 per cent. That is spot on with Treasury on an item that this Government would claim suffers no tax burden at all. I have not thrown payroll tax in. We heard the Minister say today that 60 per cent of small businesses do not pay payroll tax. Then they do not own a motor car, because payroll tax impacts on the iron ore miner, the coalminer, and the people who get the oil out of the ground for the plastics. If we follow it all the way through, when it gets to Ford and Toyota wholesale sales tax is added as well. Yet those opposite tell me that those people do not pay payroll tax. Not much! They pay plenty, and that is the simple fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A GST never cascades in that fashion. The simple fact is that, because each person claims back what he has paid, and pays the tax man the difference only, when it gets to the consumer, if the tax is $15, one can see that the aggregate of tax paid by all those before him adds up to only $15. The tax man gets only what the final consumer pays, and that is quite different from the taxes applied today. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Liberal and National parties' science and technology strategy, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An Innovation Statement</EMPHASIS>, tempts me, and I find the temptation irresistible. When I was Minister for Science I tried to help the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), now Opposition shadow Minister for science and technology. He had a likeable, almost innocent quality about him. He needed coaching, advice and information in this area and I helped him to receive it. I thought that, if he were able to mount a credible challenge in the House, asking penetrating questions, proposing MPIs, contributing to debates and raising science issues on the adjournment, it might help to stimulate serious political interest in science. A degree of polarisation might have helped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think he was better as a shadow Minister two or three years ago than he is now, and he was certainly better informed. He seems to have lost ground, and he never was far from the edge. The best that can be said about the honourable member for Gippsland is that he has not written the Opposition science and technology strategy. I doubt whether he has read it closely. I do not altogether blame him for the text, but he deserves criticism for his intellectual laziness and his failure to come to terms with tough issues. I can understand why he has been half-hearted about releasing the document. From the hysterical style and superficiality I can recognise its principal author. This disreputable document is not likely to advance his career prospects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some parts are quite sensible, especially section 6 on international dimensions to innovation, with which the Government would largely agree. The document is simply a collection of assertions set in an unknown context, devoid of history, completely lacking in any examination of industry sectors, without even the faintest understanding of types of industry&mdash;for example, sectors within manufacturing and service industries. The only distinction, and one has to search to find it, is between big, medium and small business. No account is taken of the distinction between long and short term factors. It is dream world stuff: sometimes innocent, mostly ignorant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It rarely mentions what has been done before. For example, there is only a casual reference to the 150 per cent tax concession for investment in research and development, a concession which the 1992-93 Budget indicated will be maintained indefinitely. Page 20 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An Innovation Statement</EMPHASIS> says that the coalition would cut the concession back to 125 per cent after June 1993: a curious illustration of the Opposition's alleged determination to encourage industrial R&amp;D. The statement begins with the portentous heading, `The Problem'. I quote from the document:</PARA>

Nobody has been more critical of industry's failures of nerve than me, but I applaud the dramatic changes in export performance by our manufacturing and service sectors. The last quarter of 1991 was the first in our economic history when the value of manufactured exports exceeded that of commodities. The value of worldwide exports of manufactures first exceeded commodities in 1957, and it has taken us 35 years to catch up. But we did it. It would have seemed inconceivable a decade ago. </PARA>

If we substitute for `science' its synonym `knowledge' we can see how silly it is. A knowledge push tries to work out whether there is a solution to a problem&mdash;for example, finding out how to apply skin grafts to burns without rejection, or developing a new antibiotic. Everybody knows that it will take years before a technique is perfected or a product is ready for testing. The author of this peculiar document would suggest putting the development cart before the research horse; perhaps designing the bottles and getting the label right and then sending the research teams out to see whether a product is possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the words of Margaret Thatcher, the high priestess of economic rationalism, after her 1988 mini-conversion on science funding which we quoted, without attribution, on page 5 of the May 1989 science statement. As she said, there is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the need to avoid two dangerous fallacies: first, that research must be required to meet utilitarian goals; second, that research in industry is inherently second rate and that product innovation is inconsistent with excellence in science.</PARA>
<PARA>Amen to that. The pursuit of curiosity-driven, basic research is essential to the survival of rich and lively science and technology in Australia. It provides the best training ground to stimulate and enthuse young scientists. However, the relationship between science and technology is very complex. Science provides the foundation of knowledge and skill formation which makes technology possible. It provides a context of continuity with past experience and future capability. Investment in science helps to provide the core capacity which is an essential precondition to the next stage of development in technology. If science is long term and cumulative, technology is immediate and perishable in a context of market volatility and frequent incremental change. This is a typically short-sighted, now oriented `the market rules, okay' statement which emphasises that commercialisation is more important than finding out what, if anything, there is to be commercialised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand why Australia had a `science push'. It is an inevitable result of having first rate researchers who have something to offer, if not to Australia&mdash;which would be their first choice&mdash;then the world. To quote a rule in physics, which the honourable member for Gippsland may not be familiar with, `nature abhors a vacuum'. It is likely that, with static management and a dynamic research centre, a science or knowledge push will develop and, if it does not succeed here, it will go overseas. This incredible document blames CSIRO for getting things wrong&mdash;that is, of getting ahead of the field&mdash;added to which scientists are also guilty of another offence, that of using big words. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give an example of a typical science push situation to see how we can apply <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An Innovation Statement</EMPHASIS> to advantage. Jim Haselhoff and Wayne Gerlach, working in Jim Peacock's CSIRO Division of Plant Industry in Canberra, have developed a very powerful technique called `gene shears'&mdash;the use of exclusion enzymes to zap out unwanted genetic information. This is a development with apparently vast applicability in a range of areas&mdash;plants, animals and humans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The French Groupe Limagrain recognised its significance immediately and bought a share of the development action within three days of finding out about it, without the benefit of the tax concession. The Johnson and Johnson organisation in the US soon followed, again without tax relief. Repeated attempts over three years have failed to gain any Australian partner, even with the 150 per cent tax concession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at page eight of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An Innovation Statement</EMPHASIS>. Step One, printed out in big letters says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be a requirement that all public research agencies, in cooperation with relevant industry groups, identify those of their programs with an existing or prospective high level of intense, private support&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is not my parody, Mr Deputy Speaker; that is what the text says&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in order to transfer them directly to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA>What on earth does `Step One' mean? What are the private sector research facilities with the skills and experience of CSIRO's Division of Plant Industry? I offer a small prize to anybody who can give an answer. Does it not set a precondition that without `intense, private support' research such as gene shears will come to an end? It sounds as if Peacock and company are required to hang around in the hope that the telephone will ring one day and a voice will say, `Is there anybody still there who remembers the work you used to do in gene shears? If there is, we would like to put some money in it'. If that is not what Step One means, then the Opposition had better clear it up. It is clear from page six of this document that the direction of research should be determined to suit the 71 per cent of manufacturing companies in Australia who have no involvement in research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section four of this document deals with the heading `Careers and skill development in science and technology'. It refers to the declining number of students who are studying maths, chemistry and physics, which is certainly a worrying phenomenon. The document on page 14 sets out what it regards as the causes. The first is the `incapacity of the public research sector to provide more diverse and rewarding career paths'. Earlier on, it suggests that this public research should be cut back in the interests of developing the private sector. Do they not see the inconsistency there? Secondly, teachers&mdash;they are very handy whipping boys or girls&mdash;are blamed for loss of interest in science subjects. Thirdly, the Government has failed to set expectations as to national standards of achievement and performance in science. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do honourable members pick one significant omission? There is no reference at all to the failure of the private sector to provide career structures for science graduates in industry. Perhaps those opposite forgot that or perhaps they were planning to write it and then they went out for lunch and suddenly it all disappeared. On page 16 a series of simple propositions are put forward to solve the situation. Step one is to establish and monitor national standards of achievement and performance. This will give them `the opportunity to provide the most sophisticated standard of science and mathematics learning in the world by the year 2000'. The only thing missing is how it will be done. It makes me think of one of my favourite stories about Voltaire when he was talking about the legend of St Denys, the patron saint of Paris, who had his head cut off in Montmartre. He picked his head up, tucked it under his arm and walked all the way to the site of the Basilica of St Denys. Voltaire said he really had no difficulty in accepting that St Denys had walked 25 kilometres, taking thousands and thousands of steps. As he said, `Actually, it is only the first step that worries me'. It is the first step that worries me too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the document wants the science and technology curriculum in schools to be made `more responsive to community expectations'. What on earth does `community expectations' mean? Which community? Will it vary State by State, region by region? Perhaps, if we are ambitious, it could be Federal electorate by Federal electorate? Can we imagine treating calculus in a way which is absolutely appropriate to the Federal division of Gellibrand and nowhere else in the Commonwealth? Or perhaps what they have in mind is a specifically Tasmanian system of mathematics, or a significantly different Gippsland variety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is mad stuff&mdash;immature, inconsistent and silly. Science must challenge. It cannot just reflect the tribal views of a particular locality. It cannot just reflect community values. If it does not, it would be absolutely worthless. At least I have the consolation of knowing that this absurd parody of a science and technology policy will never be implemented. I regard it as a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has also very significantly quoted out of context a very eminent Australian scientist Professor Ralph Slatyer. He is quoted as saying that one of the reasons that we do not have much development in manufacturing that is science based is really the relative lack of technological sophistication in manufacturing firms, and it also reflects the scientific rather than the technological orientation of much of the research so that the gap is harder to close than it would otherwise be'. I think that misses a fundamental point about the way in which Australian science has evolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian science has very strong links with international science, as a major contributor, just as Australian industry is linked to international industry in a subordinate role. However, the links between Australian science and Australian industry are very tenuous. There are rational, but disturbing, explanations. Many problems in agriculture and mining are closely related to the local environment and the users and beneficiaries are readily identifiable. But, in generic areas in manufacturing, local manufacturers, particularly those owned abroad, feel sceptical that there can be specifically Australian solutions to problems in computing, electronics or new materials. They prefer to wait, as they always have, on overseas developments. They prefer to draw on the international pool of science and technology rather than initiating new developments using local basic research. That is a matter of grave concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the comparatively few seconds at my disposal I want to conclude by pointing out that this is an emphasis on lowest common denominator research, not highest common multiple research. It is Claytons research; it is a kind of pretence. I think it ought to be rejected. I hope it will be rejected out of hand by the Opposition parties before they get to the Federal election. I do not believe there is anything credible about it at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a particularly miserable little element to which I want to draw attention. The coalition will abolish the Australia Prize on grounds of its questionable impact on the public's awareness of science and technology and its high cost of administration. The funds from this program will be directed to such organisations as the Australian Museum, to expand its program of highly regarded Eureka Awards. We really ought to be doing both. The whole point about the Australia Prize was to try to signal to the rest of the Western world, particularly the OECD countries, that Australia was back with a serious interest in science. At one stage the honourable member for Gippsland, the shadow Minister, was prepared to go along with that. I have in my hand a letter dated 14 August 1989 that he wrote to Professor David Curtis, President of the Australian Academy of Science, who was the chairman of the judging panel. He wrote:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In tonight's debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1992 I would like to talk about the Aboriginal affairs portfolio, the recent coalition Green Paper on the administration of Aboriginal affairs and about a number of issues in Aboriginal affairs that the forms of this House do not often allow the opportunity to talk about. The coalition went into the last election with the policy of abolishing the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. After the election our initial position was that I was to have a watching brief on the organisation. This I did. Over the next two years three things impressed me. The first was the commissioners in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. Twenty commissioners from around Australia work on a part time salary, the vast majority of whom have given up their full time jobs to take a full time job as commissioner on a part time salary. Secondly, I was impressed with the way the Commission acquitted itself in the Australian Aboriginal Affairs Council meetings. The direction that governments of both political persuasions would have liked to have taken over the last 15 years was to have agreements between State and Commonwealth governments about the delivery of services to Aboriginal communities. We could never deliver them, but the ATSIC commissioners, through the AAAC forum, have gone a long way to succeeding where we have failed. Finally, ATSIC has made many hard decisions about funding to Aboriginal organisations which were not delivering the goods. Again, in many cases they were decisions that we would have liked to have made ourselves but have not made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This led to our position in Fightback where we said that we would keep ATSIC. Having made that decision, it was then necessary to elaborate on how we saw the administration of Aboriginal affairs. In November last year I had three people from the Public Service start in my office for a period of four months. They were on the executive development scheme which takes people who are just under the level of the SES and puts them through a 15-month program. It is something like a Public Service MBA. They were Jim Redrup, Tony Tucker and Barry Hutchins. They worked in my office with one of my staff, Amelie Bitsis. They consulted by writing to over 800 regional councillors in Australia; they travelled extensively through outback New South Wales; they met ATSIC regional officers; and they travelled with me to Western Australia and the Northern Territory. As a result of those discussions and deliberations of the group, three months ago we released a Green Paper on the administration of Aboriginal affairs. It sets out the basis upon which a coalition government will see the administration of Aboriginal affairs. We make a number of proposals, some of which I would like to discuss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our principal proposal is that ATSIC will decentralise its operations to the maximum extent possible. At the moment 88 per cent of all funds are decided in Canberra, 12 per cent in the regions. I would like to see a situation where that was reversed. The regions are not Brisbane and Perth, they are Roma and Kalgoorlie. Surely we should be looking at 88c in the dollar being decided by the people who know what is going on, rather than being decided in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regional councils will become the primary decision making bodies in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. All the programs for the benefit of Aboriginal people will be brought under the jurisdiction of ATSIC. This is important, because at the moment ATSIC has to negotiate with several large and sometimes difficult departments when it wants to take a decision. Invariably when it tries to do anything it runs up a against a training block. This will allow ATSIC to make some real decisions for itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to institute a national funding model. This is important, because at the moment if an Aboriginal community makes a real effort to improve its own lot it is penalised by virtue of the fact that it is said that its need decreases. We are going to give funding in a block and guarantee it on a triennial basis. This will allow regional councils to take a long term view and make some long term decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are going to reduce the number of regional councils and the number of commissioners. Block funding on a triennial basis simply would not work with the increased responsibility in decision making for 60 regional councils. Further, it is almost a geographic impossibility for ATSIC regional officers to service 60 regional councils. Probably the most extreme case is that members of the Kalgoorlie regional office have to travel 1,000 kilometres to regional council meetings in Warburton. We recognise two special cases where regional councils would remain unchanged: the Torres Strait Islands and Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reducing the number of regional councils will release some funds. The coalition would see these funds being distributed in two ways: firstly, it is time that the commissioners became full time&mdash;they are working a full time job and they should be given full time resources; and, secondly, as we will be placing bigger responsibility on regional councils, we would like to see training of regional councillors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We acknowledge that, in many cases, Aboriginal controlled community organisations are the most effective way of delivering services to Aboriginal people. We would like to see their administration made open and transparent, for them to agree to cooperate in a process of audit and evaluation as required, and to use standardised accounting procedures so that ATSIC can have a look at whether these organisations are delivering the services to people on the ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are looking to change the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation and Aboriginal Hostels so that they become separate organisations with their own board. At the moment the Commercial Development Corporation has no beneficial owner. I can only assume this has been an oversight. We would look to set it up under a trust, which would be the beneficial owner. The trust would provide the money to the Commercial Development Corporation, which in turn would pay a dividend back to the trust. This allows the dividend to be distributed according to the trust deed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some time ago Sue Gordon, a magistrate from Western Australia and one of the interim ATSIC commissioners, put to me the difficulty of trying to get assistance for bright Aboriginal kids to study overseas. This was really brought home to me when I went to New Zealand earlier this year. Quite frankly, I got sick of meeting Maoris with PhDs. One can count Aborigines with PhDs on one hand. In New Zealand the first Maori man to be university educated was Sir Apirana Turupa Ngata. He graduated from Canterbury University in 1893. He went on to be Minister for Maori Affairs in three different administrations over a 30-year period. The first Aboriginal man to be university educated was Charles Perkins, who graduated in 1967, nearly three generations later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the functions of the Commercial Development Corporation trust will be to distribute the dividend to provide scholarships for outstanding young Aboriginal students to study at the best universities overseas. I hope that through this program Aboriginal kids may in the future have people to look up to, other than sports people, that Aboriginal people may excel academically and then find their place both in Aboriginal organisations and in mainstream companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are looking to set up an office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. This will be a small office&mdash;we envisage only about 20 people. It will correct an anomaly whereby, under the Westminster system, a Minister should administer a department. We have no desire to see this take over any of ATSIC's roles, but we want it to provide an open and transparent source of advice to the Minister, independent of ATSIC, about those matters that are relevant to the Minister's portfolio. ATSIC would still provide advice to the Minister on matters relevant to ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would see the Minister being given clear powers to issue national guidelines that would be broad in nature. As we consulted around Australia, the biggest single complaint I heard was from Aboriginal women. They complained continually that they were not getting a fair go through the ATSIC structure. The second complaint I got was from people in the bush who thought the city was getting too much and from people in the city who thought the bush was getting too much. Maybe both of these are true and it depends from where one is looking. But I would see the broad national guidelines as asking regional councils, as part of their budgetary process, to ensure that women are given a fair go and to ensure that, where there are significant mixed urban and rural populations, both urban and rural populations see themselves to be given a fair go. We released this policy as a Green Paper as a sign of good faith to those who had put significant input into it. The consultation is now about 2 1/2 months through the process, and I would be hoping to release a formal policy some time next month. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will send you a copy, Gerry. The response so far has been pretty good. True to Aboriginal politics, I have had the extreme variance of responses. One regional council said it would withdraw its support from ATSIC if this were implemented and another regional council said that it offered enormous hope and opportunity to Aboriginal people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other issues that I would like to talk about. They are fairly wide ranging, but I do not often get the opportunity to talk about some of these issues. The first is the potential threat that AIDS poses to Aboriginal people. Earlier this year, I travelled through the Western Australian goldfields and the Western Australian desert. I started in Kalgoorlie, went 1,000 kilometres north and then 500 kilometres to the west. I visited nine communities and, as is my wont, as a former medical practitioner, I went into the health centre in every community I visited. In every case, I asked the sister&mdash;because they are all sisters; there are no doctors and there are very few male nurses&mdash;what the incidence of syphilis was in the adult population. In every instance, I got an answer that between 30 and 40 per cent of adults have active syphilis. We can use only anecdotal evidence because we really do not know what the figure is, although the one good screening survey done in 1986 in the Pitjantjatjara lands did show that 20 per cent of adults on screening came up as syphilis positive. It was not that they had had it, but they actually had it then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this respect, unfortunately, I think Fred Hollows is right. I do not agree with him when he talks about the issue of segregation. I think that is a very unfortunate sidetrack from what is a very important issue. But I really cannot see what is a more important issue. We can talk about empowerment of Aboriginal people, we can talk about Aboriginal people in prisons and we can talk about infrastructure provision, but we really face the possibility of losing half of tribal Australia in the next 20 years. If we do this, it will be something that will be talked about for the next 200 years, just as the introduction of small pox and influenza has been talked about for 200 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I travel extensively in remote Australia and, as I do, I simply cannot see any degree of activity commensurate with the size of the potential threat, and I have looked very hard. I have personally examined every single Aboriginal funded project in the AIDS area over the last three years. I can see no overall plan; I can see no common thread running through it. It is just a series of ad hoc programs probably because we do not really know what else to do. I think it is incumbent upon this nation and this Government or the next government to seize this issue&mdash;not to be frightened of it but to say that we are facing a potential holocaust in this country, we are at a time when we can do something about it and, if we do not, future generations will condemn us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue I would like to raise is that of Aboriginal rock art. In the whole of Europe there are 150 rock art galleries dating back 30,000 years. In Australia we are discovering 150 rock art galleries a year. They are being destroyed at almost the same rate. They are being destroyed mainly by two things: feral animals and water. They are very simple to fix. Feral animals can be fixed with a fence; water can be fixed with a silicon drip line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has just been revealed that the oldest dated rock art in the Flinders Ranges of South Australia is 42,000 years old. It is fully 40 per cent older than any known human artistic endeavour anywhere on the planet, and yet our rock art is going out backwards because of neglect. ATSIC has no policy on it and there is nothing wrong with that, given that ATSIC is so overwhelmed with the problems of the present. But again I think we have a priceless human treasure that is uniquely Australian and in the future we will be condemned for our neglect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aboriginal language is another issue that has been commented on in the Parliament in a report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. This showed that we still have in Australia 50 Aboriginal languages. We still have 20,000 Aborigines actually speaking a language other than English in the home as the language of first choice. Of those 50 languages, 30 will be non-existent in a generation, and there is probably nothing we can do to stop that. Two hundred languages have died since white settlement and that sort of cultural loss is really unparalleled anywhere else in the world. In New South Wales, a couple of years ago, a single student was allowed to sit the Estonian examination at a cost of some thousands of dollars. Yet no Aboriginal student can sit Year 12 in his or her own language. There is no centre for the study of Aboriginal languages anywhere in Australia. There is no centre for academic excellence; there is no focus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to turn to a paper that was written by Hugh Morgan and delivered at a Rotary Club address a couple of months ago. Hugh Morgan is a very great Australian and a man that I admire very much. I would like to comment on some of the things that he says. In a statement about the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, he talks about the language of cultural despair that has been adopted by Ministers of the Crown and how the politics of guilt have become the bipartisan stock and trade of the Government and Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose once one has had this job for a while, one actually hears cultural despair, and I can understand why. When one travels through Aboriginal Australia as freely as I do, as does the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and former Ministers, one has to come to grips with things that really are quite foreign to those who live in the cities, such as active leprosy, which I saw in a community in the top end of the Northern Territory, and rheumatic heart disease, which I saw in a place called Wadeye that until only recently had the highest incidence anywhere in the world. It is very easy to be consumed by despair at the sheer enormity of the problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The politics of guilt is something that I would reject because the coalition has supported the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, and this support is genuine. I compliment Patrick Dodson on the work he has done over 12 months. I must say that I had some reservations when he was first appointed. He has acquitted himself magnificently. The coalition supported the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation because it was our view that it is not in Australia's interest to have an aggrieved minority who see no hope and no future and to have an aggrieved minority with such appalling health that it is not correct to say it is Third World because, in most places in the Third World, conditions like this do not exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In much of rural and remote Australia, there is significant racial tension, and it is a real fact. Some years ago, after riots in the north coast of New South Wales in Kempsey, the local council commissioned a report into the basis of the racial tension in the community. The report, which was written by a Sydney psychologist, said that the single most important factor in the racial tension in this community is the resentment that Aboriginal people feel over the way that they have been treated, not in the last 200 or 150 years, but in their own lifetimes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very real things which have happened in their own lifetimes&mdash;I do not have time to go into them tonight. I feel no particular personal guilt, but I do feel and I understand how that can be the basis of a deep resentment&mdash;a resentment that will be passed on from generation to generation. It is a very real thing. I think, as a country, we now have an opportunity to do something about this. In supporting the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation we have recognised this fact. We have said, `We are not interested in guilt. We are certainly not looking to the past. But certainly, in our country's interests, we should look to the future, put what has happened behind us and work out a way of going forward together'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak on a matter which goes to the heart of the style of government Queensland has had over the past three years: the do-nothing style of Wayne Goss. Mr Goss's do-nothing approach has meant that the expensive Cooke Royal Commission into corruption within the Queensland trade union movement has been largely wasted. I want to address, in particular, some of the concerns of Mr Marshall Cooke, who headed the inquiry into the Queensland trade union movement, in relation to the activities of the executive of the United Firefighters Union.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a long history of corruption in the union movement which has damaged the credibility of the Goss Labor Government in Queensland. On page 76 of his report, in section 3.12.12, Mr Cooke concludes that the amalgamation ballot was fraudulently rigged. He draws this conclusion because of a number of irregularities which occurred. These irregularities were: firstly, the ballot was counted without scrutineers appointed by the union general meeting; and, secondly, there were no security measures in place for the printing of the ballot and so on&mdash;typical Labor union bosses corruption. They swing things their way at the expense of decent, honest workers whom they coerce into joining the union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Cooke found that present at the counting of the amalgamation ballot was Stephen Robertson, now the State Secretary of the United Firefighters Union, whom Mr Cooke described as having `a vital interest in ensuring the amalgamation went through'. The same Stephen Robertson is now the endorsed candidate for the socialist Left for the marginal State seat of Sunnybank in my electorate. So not only has Mr Goss failed to do anything about this ballot rigging, but also he is happy to reward those mentioned in the Cooke inquiry with marginal State seats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Robertson is being rewarded by the socialist Left for dubious services rendered. He is no good guy of the trade union movement. In his grasp for power, Robertson has coordinated rigged amalgamation ballots and rule changes which have stripped the Firefighters Union members of their democratic rights. His testimony at the Cooke inquiry revealed that he was using the forum of a rank and file meeting to discredit reformist officials dishonestly simply to advance his own career. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Around the Firefighters Union he is known as `the little bagman'. He is part of the `gang of four' who run the Firefighters Union in Queensland. He is also national president of the Firefighters Union, but he is no firefighter&mdash;he has never been one in his life. He is a professional union henchman with extreme socialist Left leanings. His predecessor, the man he served alongside as the assistant State secretary, has been stood aside following the Cooke inquiry investigations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This man has quite a history. Earlier this year Robertson sold illegal art union tickets. The prize was a queen-sized bed. In Queensland it is illegal to run these sorts of art unions, yet Mr Robertson simply went ahead and did just that. He was caught and faced a swift kick from the right wing State Secretary Swan because Robertson had put Swan's name on the tickets as authorising the art union. The penalty for such an act for you or for me is three months gaol. Robertson was not charged. The matter was dealt with internally by the Labor Party&mdash;meaning yet again one law for Labor and another for the rest of the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the things one can say about the adjournment debate is that it does provide some light comic relief, and I think the last effort was clearly in that category. I am interested to know where this place Queensland is; it is a very obscure part of Australia and I do not really think it is worth the time of this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to dwell for a minute on 2 July 1777, which is obviously a very important day in the annals of the Liberal Party&mdash;apparently particularly so for the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge). It was of course the day on which Jean-Jacques Rousseau died. Tonight we heard the most Rousseauesque eloquence from that honourable member. It seems that nothing changes. One had hoped that the Liberal Party would stick to its guns and sweep away ATSIC, but it is not going to; it has become part of that establishment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell members of the Liberal Party that there is no support for ATSIC amongst the Aboriginal community. It is an outrage and an offence to them. It is quite clear from this toadying we are seeing from the honourable member that he has fallen into the trap of trying to placate a few senior people. The honourable member talked about decentralising power. One of the things which will happen when power in ATSIC is decentralised is that there will be even more pandering to family connections. I, who represent more Aboriginals than anyone else in this Parliament, can tell honourable members that every week Aboriginals&mdash;many of them ATSIC commissioners&mdash;complain to me. They say, `I joined ATSIC to stop these rorts and it is impossible. We can't do it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginals everywhere are saying, `We want to be part of Australia. We are Australian and we want to be part of mainstream Australia'. Those opposite, along with us it seems, are destined to make them some sort of separate citizens. I am amazed to see the crocodile tears when the honourable member for Chisholm says he cannot envisage an Australia with an alienated minority. Those opposite are the people who are going to bring in a GST which will make a section of Australia poverty-stricken&mdash;a large section, much bigger than the 1 1/2 per cent that constitutes Aboriginality. They are quite happy to have an Australia with haves and have-nots. Honourable members opposite should bear this in mind: if a person happens to have a job, taking home about $300 per week, and has to pay a tax on food, it will cost that person $30 to $40 extra and he or she simply will not have it. Honourable members have not considered that. </PARA>

I say to Queensland members of the Government that when Neville Wran made the left wing faction member, now the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker), the New South Wales Minister for Housing in a factional deal, Richard Persson came from obscurity to work in that State's Department of Housing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Greiner Government was elected in 1988, Mr Persson was one of the first politically appointed bureaucrats to be axed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Persson's role is to control all local government in that State. This he will set out to do through a centralised planning system. Clearly, this begs a number of important fundamental questions. Is Premier Wayne Goss another victim of the factions in his own Party? Will Mr Persson's appointment be a significant victory for the Queensland Left, which insists on keeping unaligned Labor backbenchers such as Matt Foley out of the Goss Ministry?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two car assemblers in Adelaide are at each end of the metropolitan area, which is bound by the coast and the hills. To the north, General Motors-Holden's was established at Elizabeth in the 1950s and now produces one model, the Commodore/Lexcen, for itself and Toyota. Mitsubishi is in the southern suburbs as a result of taking over Chrysler about 12 years ago, and it makes the Magna. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the strip that runs between these two plants along the western border of Adelaide runs a string of components manufacturers. This complex forms the backbone of the industrial structure of Adelaide. Without it, other industrial investors would find Adelaide a much less attractive place. The submarine contract would not have been viable without its skills. No MFP bid would have been possible. ROH, among others, would not be exporting&mdash;in its case, to Europe. The population of Adelaide would be greatly diminished and restricted, essentially, to that of a country town processing the output of the surrounding agricultural area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The car industry in Adelaide would not have come into existence in the first place without a tariff protective structure. It is quite clear that by 1983 this structure was too high in its protective fence, and it resulted in featherbedding.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this plan both Mitsubishi and General Motors are intending to invest about half a billion dollars each over the next few years. It is true that under this plan some component manufacturers have closed and both major companies have shed labour in the interests of pursuing efficiencies.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the Opposition's plans to cut tariffs to zero by the year 2000 was announced two years ago, but no-one in the industry, and certainly no-one in Adelaide, believed it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(a) No, although hPG was probably used initially in all countries that had a human pituitary hormone program established, as in the 1960s hPG was the only hormone available for fertility programs. Subsequently, human menopausal gonadotrophins (hMG), extracted from human urine, became available commercially, and replaced hPG in most countries. The countries which continued to use hPG included Australia, United Kingdom, Sweden and New Zealand.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The first use of hPG in Australia was in 1962 by the Victorian Pituitary Group which continued with its own hPG program until the Human Pituitary Advisory Committee program took over in 1969.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has been concerned for some time that the rate at which Australia considers and, if appropriate, ratifies ILO conventions has been too slow. Consequently, in May 1991 the Government established an Interdepartmental Task Force to review, over a period of 18 months, the ratification prospects of 74 (later increased to 75) unratified ILO conventions with a view to significantly increasing the number of conventions ratified by Australia in the short to medium term. This initiative was not intended to replace the existing arrangements for federal-State consultations concerning ILO conventions which are considered appropriate for action in part or in whole by the States and Territories, and the Task Force has consulted extensively with them. By agreement with the States and Territories, however, those arrangements were made more flexible in that consultations have taken place outside, as well as within, the established consultative machinery.</PARA>

There are 67 such conventions amongst the 75 conventions within the remit of the Task Force. The following table lists the 67 conventions under headings showing (i) those which have been ratified since May 1991; (ii) those which have been categorised by the Task Force as suitable targets for ratification; (iii) those which have been categorised as unsuitable targets for ratification; and (iv) those which have yet to be placed in any category.</PARA>
