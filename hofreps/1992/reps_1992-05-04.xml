<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for the Arts and Territories, in the absence of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories. I ask: does the Minister agree that the compromise to the Forest Conservation and Development Bill negotiated by the Minister for Resources would not in any way reduce the level of environmental protection for our forests? Will the Minister therefore support the Minister for Resources in his attempts to gain agreement to the compromise from the Prime Minister, and therefore help to secure the jobs of 80,000 forest workers?</PARA></TALK.START>

Whether the Opposition supports it in the Senate or not is a matter for the Opposition to determine.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HH4">Mr JENKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House of the significance of the March 1992 balance of payments figure released today by the Australian Bureau of Statistics?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2245" SPEAKER="Dawkins The Hon J.S." NAMEID="9E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FREMANTLE" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The statistician revealed today that the monthly current account deficit was $938m, which was a little higher than market expectations, but one which took the nine-month figure to March 1992 to a little over $9 billion, which is, of course, well within the Budget time forecast of $14 billion for 1991-92.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures also mean that the merchandise trade balance has been in surplus continuously since December 1990, and the surplus has averaged nearly $400m a month since that time. The March 1992 surplus of $428m is consistent with that trend. Indeed, the ABS figures indicate that there was a surplus of $231m in the balance of goods and services, seasonally adjusted, and this makes the twelfth such surplus in the last 15 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABS figures are consistent with the view that there has been a structural shift towards exports in the Australian economy. This shift has been evident since the Labor Government came to power, and has been especially clear since 1989. It is perhaps worth recalling that in 1981 Australia's exports accounted for just 11 per cent of GDP, whereas in 1991, just 10 years later, they accounted for 19 per cent. Ten years ago exports accounted for 11 per cent of GDP; now they account for 19 per cent, close to double the 1981 figure. They represent a much bigger part of a much larger GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This, I think, indicates that this has been the decade of very strong export growth in Australia. It was always an ambition of the Government when it came to power in 1983 to put more emphasis on exports from Australia, an issue which had been basically neglected by our opponents for a very long time. We have been the Party which has put exports back into the equation of the Australian economy. It is not just a question of improving the prospects of our traditional exports from our farms and our mines but, more particularly, getting our manufacturing sector and our services sector in a state where they can compete effectively and successfully with the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This trend, which has been revealed once again in these monthly figures is, I think, something which all Australians are entitled to be pleased about. This is not just a question of the fortuitous sale of some primary commodities, some mineral commodities, it is very much a measure of the way in which Australians are working. Men and women in Australia are working in such a way that the product of their labour is now more competitive, of a higher quality, better priced and, therefore, capable of achieving larger export markets in the rest of the world. This is the kind of way in which the Australian economy has been changing in the last 10 years and I think it will continue to change in that very beneficial direction in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point to bear in mind&mdash;we hear this time and time again&mdash;is that, whenever the question of improved export performance is mentioned, the Opposition simply says, `Oh, this is just a function of the recession'. It is not. This has been a trend which has occurred over the last 10 years regardless of whether the economy was growing fast or slowly. It is evidence of a structural change that has happened in the Australian economy, one which we should be proud of, not one that should be denigrated, as it is so frequently by those opposite.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is again directed to the  Minister for the Arts and Territories in the absence of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories. Is the Acting Minister aware that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories telephoned the Prime Minister from Kuala Lumpur last week?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the nation has cause to be pleased with the data which has been released in the last few days. As the Treasurer said a moment ago in relation to the trend change within the balance of payments, it is not just fortuitously from a shift in commodity prices but a trend improvement in the nature of added value in Australia and the shift to exports and import replacement which has attended it, which has reduced the current account deficit from around 6 per cent of GDP to around 3 1/2 per cent at the moment&mdash;just on a 30 per cent improvement over the last 12 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With inflation running at zero for the quarter and l.7 per cent for the year with an underlying rate of around 3 per cent, it is the first time in nearly two decades that Australia has recorded such a profound change, an historic change, to its inflation performance. That, coupled with the One Nation package which the Government introduced in terms of stimulating the economy, will lead to changes which give us a sustainable recovery into the 1990s. But the certainty and stability of the Government's policy settings are not evident with the Opposition, as we saw with the Deputy Leader, the shadow Treasurer. The article headed `Reith flexible on inflation goal', states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The shadow Treasurer Mr Reith has conceded that the Opposition's zero and 2 per cent inflation target is flexible.</PARA>

If, for instance, North Broken Hill decides that the market is not opportune or it is not the right time for it to be developing a project, what does the Government do? Does it go scurrying back to its Cabinet, back to the drafting, to say, `Oh well, they have been struck dumb down at North Broken Hill; we had better go and change the Bill'.

Those balances are there and members of the Opposition can go and vote for it.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2250" SPEAKER="Staples The Hon P.R." NAMEID="KJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="JAGAJAGA" MINISTERIAL="AGED, FAMILY AND HEALTH SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KJ4">Mr STAPLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to thank the honourable member for Forde for her work on the development of the national accreditation policy and her work in child-care. In the past, the Government has looked at tax expenditures in relation to child-care through rebates and deductions. We have rejected them because they have failed the basic tests of fairness. Tax rebates or deductions, as I think most people realise, provide most assistance to families on the highest incomes. Families whose incomes are too low to pay tax obviously get no benefit at all from such concessions. A tax rebate or deduction is of no value to a family if it cannot find a child-care place. So the Government's national child-care strategy is focused on the two aims of affordability and supply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are now 130,000 families being assisted with fee relief. The number of families getting fee relief has more than doubled in the last two years. There are now 178,000 funded child-care places. We have more than trebled the number since 1983. We will have 250,000 funded child-care places by 1995-96. Rebates, of course, do not build child-care centres. These issues were well and truly understood by Australian families at the last election. That is why they rejected the Opposition's policy of tax rebates. They saw it as unfair because it gave help to those who perhaps needed it the least. Last year we thought that the message had, in fact, finally got through to the Opposition. I was very pleased that in June last year the Opposition spokesperson on child-care, Senator Alston, went as far as to endorse the Government's fee relief system and child-care strategy. On ABC radio here in Canberra, about the Government's strategy, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is income tested. . . It is fairly generous . . . and it seems to me that approach, in terms of where you cut out the assistance, is probably not too far wide of the mark.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say about child-care fee relief:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We've got to look more seriously at whether we think that is more appropriate than our approach, the Opposition's approach.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is fair to say that I felt very grateful to Senator Alston because he finally realised the strength of the Government's position. So I was very surprised to see clearly stated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> today that the Opposition would now introduce tax rebates for child-care. Back in June when Senator Alston described the Government's child-care policy as fair, generous and not too wide of the mark, he also had a fair bit to say about tax rebates. I would like those comments recorded. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My preference would be to target assistance to lower income earning groups. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not able to say why I would think you would provide child-care rebates or child-care assistance across-the-board.</PARA>
<PARA>He was obviously not able to say why the Opposition would advocate that because it is really as indefensible as the GST is on child-care because it targets people on the lowest incomes to pay the most. So I presume that here we have another example of `Flexiback'. Not only was Senator Alston admitting that the Opposition got it wrong at the last election and now was about providing a child-care system which met the test of fairness but also it is now clear that he is well and truly in conflict with the current policy of his Leader, creating further divisions within the Opposition. Last week it was tariffs; this week it is child-care.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleague notes, Senator Alston in a moment of candour said that his preference was to assist the low earning groups. He was unsure about tax rebates. For a start people have to have a taxable income to get a tax rebate and there is a disproportionate rebate, depending on the marginal tax rate. Senator Alston said that he thought the Government's arrangements were fair and generous; he thought that  `fair and generous' was not too wide of the mark.</PARA>

The $90m that the Opposition is now beating its breast about is, in fact, $90m of a $130m impost. It actually put $40m into the Fightback kitty for other grab bag proposals which it has developed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You referred to Michael Field as Premier Field. Unfortunately, he is not;  he is the Leader of the Opposition. The fact is that Michael Field is not a member of the Caucus. He may be using that terminology simply in reflection of the fact that both the Minister for Resources and I have both said&mdash;and have informed him&mdash;that, as far as we are concerned, as the Minister said a few moments ago, the only change to the Bill sought by the Opposition was a change in the name.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. The OECD economic survey of Australia released last week projects that inflation will rise to about 4 per cent over the next two years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Let me first deal with the initial part of his question about the OECD forecast. The important point to bear in mind is that Australia's inflation performance has been improving so rapidly that it has been too fast for the OECD to keep up with&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is because when the OECD put together its forecasts it was operating on material that it had up until about the end of last year. Of course, a lot has happened since then, and most of it has been good; certainly in relation to inflation it has been extremely good. Of course, the OECD back in December, and indeed even a little later than that, would not have been alone in predicting a rather more rapid increase in prices than is now so clearly in prospect. Indeed, our own official estimates for inflation in the current year, 1991-92, have just recently been reduced again in response to the very good figure that we received for the most recent quarter for the consumer price index.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD says in its forecasts that the private consumption deflator&mdash;which is not quite the same thing as the CPI, but nevertheless the one they were using or forecasting&mdash;was 3 per cent for 1991-92. There would have to be a most spectacular increase in prices between now and the end of June for that forecast to come true&mdash;and, of course, no one expects that to be the case. Therefore it is entirely the case that the OECD forecast for 1992-93, which is the one which is likely to be a little more contentious, is also an exaggeration of what is likely to be the rise in prices during that period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to talk about our own estimates forecast for inflation for 1992-93, as I indicated last week, in the wake of our most recent estimates&mdash;which, by the way, do not even take account of the zero figure of last week&mdash;there has been a revision downwards from 3 1/2 per cent to 2 1/2 per cent for the 1992-93 year. That is to be juxtaposed with what the OECD is saying for that year of 4 per cent. So it is not surprising that the OECD, operating as it was on information which is now outdated, had a higher forecast for rises in inflation than has been the case since or is likely to be the case in the immediate period ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only dark cloud on the horizon as far as inflation is concerned is the weight which anyone places on the prospect of the Opposition's being elected to government because it is only the Opposition which has a pro-inflation policy; it is only the Opposition which has built into its policy as a quite deliberate measure a plan to increase the inflation rate by five or six percentage points. Of course, that has to be placed beside what we are saying, which is that our quite deliberate and determined approach to inflation is to get it low and keep it low&mdash;to keep it at or below the level of our major trading partners&mdash;because we know that that is the way in which Australia can become even more competitive and turn in an even better export performance than we are doing at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has this policy, and to some extent the market is factoring that into its estimates of long term inflation rates. But it is interesting to note that as the prospects of an Opposition victory begin to disintegrate, as they have over the last few months, we have seen the long term bond rates coming down. That is an entirely rational thing for them to do. Indeed, the only thing which is keeping the long term bond rates up is that diminishing prospect of the Opposition being elected and having an opportunity to give an almighty whack to inflation, as it wants to do as a result of its particular package. I do not know whether the OECD was influenced by that prospect&mdash;I doubt it. I think it was probably basing its estimates on information which is now out of date, and I am quite sure that if we asked the OECD now for a contemporary assessment of inflation for the next 12 months or so, it would be very close to the Government's official forecasts.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These followed on from an earlier report by the Australian Customs Service to put into place provisional measures in December of 1991. There have been a number of comments around the place, and it is part of bush mythology, that we have very poor anti-dumping measures; in fact, Australia has some of the quickest anti-dumping measures in the world. For example, to get to a preliminary decision Australia now takes 125 days; the United States takes between 160 and 210 days; Canada takes from 141 to 186 days; the European Community takes 270 days; and New Zealand takes 110 days. So it is clear that Australia now has very efficient anti-dumping measures. Again, it is part of this bush mythology that, if we have a cheap imported product, all we have to do is claim that it is dumped and, in some way, the Government can protect it. It is a bit of a re-run of the old tariff protection argument. Australia does have efficient anti-dumping measures. We will be introducing more legislation into this House shortly to improve the facility and to make sure that Australia maintains its measures which will ensure that Australian industries compete against overseas industries in a fair and equitable manner.</PARA>

It was put in five points: to retitle the Bill; to institute a monitoring arrangement to see the effectiveness of the legislation; to develop the concept together with the industry and the trade unions; to cover through regional agreements all that part of the timber industry&mdash;that is, all the timber mills of Australia&mdash;which are not covered by the $100m-plus projects; to initiate also with the industry the development of the ESD, the national plantations strategies and the RAC recommendations so that a national forests strategy could be developed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very appropriate to quote the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> editorial today on the OECD survey of Australia for 1991-92, which starts by saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last week's report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development on the Australian economy is a distressing and depressing catalogue of Australia's missed economic opportunities in the last decade.</PARA>
<PARA>The last decade being, of course, the time under which this Government has been administered by the Australian Labor Party. It is particularly depressing and particularly distressing, as this report comes from the OECD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is a fee paying member of the OECD. The OECD gives the Federal Government the chance to influence any final reports. So the Government actually gets a say in the final drafting of the reports, which in most cases are more favourable or, shall we say, ensure that the message is put in subtle terms. In other words, they pull their punches, if you like, in the drafting of these reports. So when the reports come out critical, even on the face of them, they are a damning indictment of the Government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this occasion, the OECD really carpeted the Government's economic management in a most blunt way. Virtually no stone has been left unturned. Whilst there are all sorts of the usual qualifications that one gets from the OECD&mdash;one can be sure that Federal Treasury officers have been writing in bits and pieces throughout the report to try to tone it down&mdash;it makes compelling reading for anybody interested in the future management of this economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take the opportunity to commend those Treasury officers who, to the extent that they did, let the truth shine through this report, as it has, in such crystal clear terms. I have no doubt that to some extent it reflects the fact that Treasury itself is very concerned that this Government loves to hide the truth from the Australian people about the extent of our problems. We have the Budget deficit blowing out and, of course, as most Australians know, Australia's worst recession in 60 years rolls on inexorably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report card from the OECD is very critical. In it, Australia fails virtually every subject. The OECD says we are going to have to go back and do the subjects again. Perhaps worst of all, the OECD says that in this case Australia has failed to try hard enough to correct the problems of the last 10, 15, 20 or more years. We have not attempted to keep up with the rest of the class; Australia has fallen behind the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a report where there is a mark of five out of 25, I know the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) will get up and spend all of his time telling us how good the five marks are. In that sense it is balanced; there are some things where the Government is entitled to some credit. But when reading this report, one could not help come to the conclusion that this Government's economic policies have been an absolute failure. I suppose one does not need to be an economist to know that. In this country we have net foreign liabilities of nearly $200 billion and our net debt is about $145 billion. Do not get up and blame it on the last Government, because when this Government came into office this country's debt was about $23 billion. It has gone from $23 billion to $145 billion. And, of course, the number of unemployed is now around a million people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A quick glance at this report card reveals over 20 points where Australia has not done well. Point No. 1, on page 9, essentially says that high interest rates have brought on the recession and have thereby lowered inflation&mdash;a point on which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was attacking me last week, the very day that the report came out. I had said, `Look, you always get low inflation in a recession'. He attacked me for that during Question Time and here we have it in black and white in the OECD report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Point No. 2, on page 22, says that educational standards in Australia have been falling. Point No. 3, on pages 25 and 26 of the OECD report, is a mention of the OECD's concern about the state of Australia's indebtedness to the rest of the world and our current account deficit. The OECD notes that our monthly deficit, which represents about 3 1/2 per cent of GDP, is the third highest amongst OECD countries&mdash;a critical point, particularly as I know the Treasurer today will be crowing about the latest billion dollars balance of payments figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Point No. 4, on page 34, notes that inflation has always fallen in past recessions. Point No. 5, on page 43, notes that unemployment is likely to stay over 10 per cent for the next two years. Point No. 6, on page 44&mdash;and I will refer to this in greater detail in a moment&mdash;notes that OECD's expectations about how the Australian economy is going to perform in the next 12 months are very different from the Government's own bloated and overly optimistic projections about growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Point No. 7, on page 51 through to page 55, is an absolutely damning indictment of the conduct of monetary policy. The OECD makes three points. The first is that monetary policy has been complicated by the fact that we have too many objectives&mdash;in other words, on monetary policy there are two stools and this Government always falls between them. Secondly, it notes that in respect of monetary policy the Government always gets its readings on economic outlooks wrong, and that of course is a real problem. Thirdly, the OECD makes the point that the monetary authorities' intentions have often been confused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Point No. 8, on page 57 of our scorecard, is that living standards have fallen. Again, this is not news to the average Australian; but it is a critical assessment from an independent, authoritative voice, the OECD, to ram home the point that in the last decade under Labor people's living standards have been falling. As we saw recently in the official release of figures, we now fall to the bottom third of the OECD league. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Point No. 9, on page 58, is that our productivity is very low in both the public sector and the private sector. Of course, the OECD has some very interesting information about the public sector such as that Qantas is only seventeenth when it comes to productivity, and that the unions have had too much say in the running of electricity and railways. Again, our country has fallen behind partly as a result of the failure of this Government to change economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Point No. 10, to be found on page 74, attacks the Government's trade policy. It says that it is a real paradox that we should be moving to lower tariffs and yet keeping,  effectively, a high consumption tax of up to 50 per cent. It mentions particularly textiles and clothing. Point No. 11 refers to the fact that at the Special Premiers Conference we had sharp disagreements raising the possibility that that, of course, would jeopardise progress on a significant area of reform. What does that refer to? Between the lines, it refers to the fact that our Prime Minister used the Special Premiers Conference as a lever to get himself a few votes in the Caucus to get into the leadership. This is typical of the way in which these people operate. They will do anything, say anything and jeopardise anything to advance their own personal cause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In point No. 12, to be found on page 79, the OECD says that corporatisation has some benefits, but that if we really want the full benefits we ought to privatise. We have been saying that for years and years, yet these people continue to refuse&mdash;because their union mates control the shots on this issue&mdash;to do the right thing by the very people they claim to represent, the employees who have been losing their jobs as a result of their policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In point No. 13, on page 80, the OECD notes that until recently we have had very little progress on waterfront reform. This is an interesting point because for years these people have been saying, `We've got the problem fixed. We are doing it now and look at the benefits'. The OECD completely explodes that. It also goes on at page 80 to explode the myth that basically shipping reform has been done and finished. In respect of shipping, it says that more remains to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Point No. 15, which is also on page 80&mdash;and I will come back to this again in a moment&mdash;concerns tax reform. Of course Australia should reform its tax system. It gives clear and unequivocal support, as the OECD has now for years, for a reform of Australia's indirect and direct tax system. In particular, it notes that the existing tax system that we have now puts a lot of costs on our businesses. No wonder businesses are closing in Australia. When one picks up the newspaper one reads, `In future we are going to manufacture overseas and import back to Australia'. One of the reasons is that we have a tax system that penalises our very own producers in Australia. Instead of encouraging people to employ fellow Australians, we have a tax system, particularly Labor's tax on employment, which imposes a very significant disadvantage on Australian production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Point No. 16, on page 81, notes, `after a decade of slow progress'&mdash;and how slow it has been. At the next election, Labor will have been in office for 13 of the last 20 years. If one is looking for excuses as to why we are in the mess that we are in, it is hard to go past the people who have actually had their hands on the levers, and that is members of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At page 84, it notes at my point No. 17 that interest rates in Australia, for Australia, have been at post-war highs. But it makes an interesting observation when it states `even at unprecedented levels by international standards'. So there is none of this, `Blame the rest of the world. They have high interest rates as well'. That little myth was exploded again by the OECD. Point No. 18, on page 84, is a very interesting point to be found near the end of the report. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . wages policy did not deliver inflation performance comparable to Australia's trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very strong point because the reverse of that has been a claim of Labor since 1983 when it came to office. One hears its members all the time saying, `We have a special deal with the unions. We can control things with the unions and that is why we have had a relatively good inflation performance'. That is wrong, wrong, wrong. The accord has, in fact, seen Australia having a comparatively high inflation record relative to our competitors as one of the reasons that we have fallen behind the rest of the world. It is one of the Government's favourite myths exploded in front of its very face. It is on page 86. I refer the Treasurer to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 87, the report makes the point&mdash;and it is my nineteenth&mdash;that faster progress in labour market reform is needed badly. The Government has been in office for 10 years; that is a damning indictment of its slow progress to date. Furthermore, I think it really puts the pressure on Labor to acknowledge the fact that it does not have any plans for the further reform which this country needs so desperately and which is a critical element of Fightback. Those two points&mdash;my eighteenth and nineteenth&mdash;will be picked up by the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) when he speaks in support of this matter of public importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lastly, my twentieth point is to be found on page 87, where the OECD says, `More vigorous micro-economic reform is urgently needed'. It ties that into living standards. There is a lot of economic jargon, but I say to the ladies and gentlemen in the gallery and to those who are listening that if we want to have higher living standards we have to run our country more efficiently and we have to do things better than we have been doing them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many things that the Government could do to improve the incomes and, therefore, the living standards of most Australians. This independent report says that this Government has fallen down on the job; it has failed to introduce, with that sense of urgency, the sorts of micro-economic reforms that Australia needs so desperately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the remaining moments available to me, I will refer to and remark upon the comments of the OECD in respect of tax reform. This is an issue which the OECD was very strong about in the last survey it conducted on Australia. It said that we must reform our tax system. There is no surprise about that; Australia is one of the last countries in the OECD to make the sort of change that we in the Opposition are advocating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report exposes the scare campaign which the Prime Minister has been running for the shabby, self-serving exercise that it is. It is exquisite timing. Last week he ran a scare campaign on the question of jobs and the GST, and yet the OECD has come out with a report saying that we ought to introduce this sort of reform in order to protect jobs. That is the thing about the GST: it is the jobs protector. We will take tax away from the business community so that it can afford to employ more people. We will abolish the payroll tax, which is a $6 billion disincentive to our businesses employing people. Yet those opposite have the cheek, the hypocrisy and the self-serving shabbiness to run a scare campaign against a proposal which the Prime Minister himself said would create 200,000 jobs. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development reports come out every now and again, surveying the economies of all of the members of the OECD. Australia has always welcomed this process because we believe these surveys provide an opportunity for an informed debate about where the economy is going and where it has come from. This comes from an organisation which, it is true, is paid for by the member governments. It is true that the member governments have an opportunity to examine the contents of the report. But they do not have an opportunity to veto it or make major changes; they have an opportunity to make observations about what might be in the report. The Government has welcomed these reports as a way of providing some dispassionate commentary on the way in which things are going.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can tell from the speech we have just heard from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) that he was just a little disappointed that this report from the OECD was not more critical and that it was so complimentary in a number of important respects. It is always interesting to know how serious an Opposition is about a matter of public importance. Usually, if it is really serious about it, it will address some questions to the particular topic of its matter of public importance during Question Time. But not on this occasion; there was not a single question. It was all left to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition&mdash;old Humpty Dumpty over there&mdash;to come up with a speech, which was a pretty poor one even by his standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Ronald Edwards)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I ask the Treasurer to withdraw that reference. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw that. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition made only one actual quotation from the report. I would have thought that if this report had been so damning, so full of crystal clear scathing attacks on the Government, he would have waved it around and quoted it word for word. But he did not; he quoted only one set of words that I was able to follow during his dissertation. There was only one occasion on which he actually quoted word for word what was in the report. The rest of his speech was a paraphrase of what was in the report&mdash;that is, his view of what was said by the OECD&mdash;and in one case it was a total distortion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His third point was that on page 22 the OECD had complained about falling educational standards. I have looked through page 22; it says nothing of the sort. It does not say there have been falling standards within the Australian educational system. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Job search characteristics single out lack of job skills as the major impediment to finding employment. . . Notwithstanding significant progress in raising basic education and vocational attainment levels over the past five years (the number of persons with post-secondary school qualifications increased by 23 per cent from February 1986 to February 1991), insufficient skills or greater skill mismatches related to structural adjustment may explain, in part, why the median duration of unemployment at cyclical peaks is higher than in Canada or the United States.</PARA>
<PARA>That does not say that educational skill levels are falling. So at least one of the comments of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is not even a paraphrase of what the OECD said; it is a total distortion and, indeed, the opposite of what was said. On this topic, the report on page 63 went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A country's long-term economic performance is heavily dependent on the skill levels of its work force. Australia has made major strides over the past decade in raising basic and vocational education standards.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot believe anything the Deputy Leader of the Opposition says if, when he is given the opportunity to participate in a debate, on the basis of a document which is dispassionate and does have its criticisms as well as its praise, he distorts, misrepresents and totally reverses the message of the report. Once again, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has been found out in terms of his very scant regard for the truth and his very scant regard for honesty&mdash;that is, if he even read the report before he got up to read this speech. I suspect on this occasion, as on so many, he was simply programmed to get up here and mouth whatever had been put in front of him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He referred to one editorial which was somewhat despairing of the observations in the OECD report. He could also have referred to a far more balanced editorial of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> which says, `Praise&mdash;and a prod&mdash;from the OECD'. It would be entirely surprising if the OECD brought out a report which was full of unqualified praise for the efforts of any government. This is not the purpose of these reports. The purpose of the reports is to provide a dispassionate report on what has been happening in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He then went through 20 points, as I recall it, in the report. I repeat that in only one of those points was he able to find a convenient set of words to actually sum up this devastating criticism which is supposed to be contained in it. The reason for that is that there are no more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some observations in the report about how some things could have been done better and how some things are yet to be done. I do not walk away from those kinds of observations. But that is a very different point from the one the Deputy Leader was trying to make by representing this report as a scarifying critique of the efforts of the Government in the last 10 years. If we go through the report we find time after time reference to the progress that has been made or the progress which is in store, whether we are talking about tariff cuts or whether we are talking about some of the other micro-economic reform which has been embraced by the Government, particularly in recent times. The OECD is very complimentary about what happened in the statement the Government brought down in March of 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pity for the Opposition in all of this is that it was not able to find within this report a bucket for the Government nor paeons of praise for its own particular policy proposals. That is, of course, very disappointing for the Opposition.

Does the Opposition think we would have committed something like $2.3 billion worth of funds towards infrastructure in this country if we did not believe more reform was necessary, if we did not believe that more improvement was necessary? Of course we believed that, and we acted accordingly.

What is not spelt out in this report&mdash;the Opposition would do well to remind itself of this on a daily basis&mdash;is that, in fact, the process of micro reform came to a grinding halt when a Liberal-National Party government was elected in 1975. That process of change in terms of reduction of tariffs not only stopped, but went backwards. Protection actually increased under the Fraser Government, rather than being reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why the process had to be restarted by us. We had to make up not only for lost time but also for the revisionism and the reversals of the Fraser Government. That is something of which the Liberal Party ought to remind itself, and that is essentially why it is going through these massive contortions on the issue of tariff policy. Those opposite do not have a unified view on this. Some believe that tariffs should be reduced;  but a lot do not. There are a lot of old-fashioned protectionist Liberals still in the ranks in here and still very influential in the Party outside the Parliament. Day by day we hear some desiccated old leaders from either the Liberal Party or the National Party coming out and making their own particular observations about where policy ought to go. They have a large number of adherents in here and outside in their parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's problem is to get some unity around these issues of reform and around these issues of change. Those opposite will not get it simply by ramming them down people's necks. They have to convince people about the necessity for these changes and achieve them in a way which is manageable and in a way which can be supported by those people who actually have to contemplate the change. That is the great difference between those opposite and us. We have been able to achieve change, not at the point of a gun, not on the basis of threats, not on the basis of draconian legislation, but rather on the basis of persuasion, argument, discussion and debate. The people who are actually engaged in the change actually believe in it. That is what is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to have an Australia which is even more competitive than it is today, it will not be because Australians get browbeaten by some ex-professor or by some suburban lawyer from Melbourne;  it will be because people believe in it, want it, and are prepared to make the change themselves, whether that be in the context of their trade unions, in the context of their workplace or in the context of the management of their firm. They are the ones who have to want change, and they are the ones who have to do it. I believe that is what we have been so successful at in terms of having not only a reform agenda but a reform agenda which is capable of being embraced by all Australians. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Perhaps we are seeing the backside of the current Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last portion of this matter of public importance for today says that the OECD calls for more vigorous micro-economic reforms. I quote from the OECD report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unemployment, already over 10%, is projected to remain at over 10% for the coming two years, albeit starting to fall in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA>This is under a Labor government, a Labor government that purports to represent the working men and women in Australia, and under increasing ACTU domination of government policy. It is no wonder that unemployment is at historically high levels. The OECD sees no hope for this Government in falling unemployment levels, and the only hope for change is in a change of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bring to the attention of honourable members an editorial in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> headed `Generation of despair', which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia today has a sad, new symbol that renders obsolete any further argument over the national flag. It is youth unemployment, one of the greatest social evils of our time and a problem that will haunt us even when the economy has turned for the better.</PARA>

<PARA>During Question Time today the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) talked about flexibility. Well, flexibility is not one of the hallmarks of this Labor Government, with its rigid labour market programs. We do need some flexibility, do we not? I quote from the OECD report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The less responsive are wage increases to higher unemployment the more prolonged will be high unemployment following a tightening of monetary policy.</PARA>
<PARA>So it is our centralised system, our dependence on legal systems, tables of arbitration and an Industrial Relations Commission that lead us to control over wages that prevents us from opening up the job market. I give an example of a company in my own electorate which paid out over $1m in redundancy payments for 30 employees last year&mdash;$1m for 30 employees, at union insistence&mdash;and will never again hire another permanent employee; only temporaries will be added to its labour force. On wages policy, the OECD report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . wages policy did not deliver inflation performance comparable to Australia's trading partners'.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an indictment, is it not? This Labor Government, under this pathetic Treasurer, talks about what an excellent job the ALP has done in maintaining low wages. But those low wages have not had any impact on inflation any different from that of our comparable trading partners overseas. On productivity, the OECD says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although inter-country comparisons of productivity are notoriously difficult to make owing to differences in measurement conventions, available data suggest that while productivity levels in the Australian  agricultural and mining sectors are substantially above the OECD average, those in other sectors are well below the OECD average. In particular, productivity levels in Government Business Enterprises would appear to be roughly one-half the OECD average. For the manufacturing sector, the limited number of industry case studies available suggest that levels of output per person in Australia are lower than in key OECD countries. . . . According to OECD data, productivity levels have often been less than one-half those of Australia's trading partners in the ports, railroads and electricity generation.</PARA>
<PARA>In examining micro-economic reform, we need to look no further than the reform of our archaic industrial relations system. The OECD says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need to eliminate restrictive work practices has been particularly pressing. The complexity of Australia's industrial relations system has often been singled out as the principal obstacle to faster restructuring of the economy and more rapid productivity growth.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After those two awful performances from members of the Opposition, what can we say except that it is about time they went back to school and learnt something about economics? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) used words like `pathetic' in a personal attack. Let me tell the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the only pathetic thing in this place is his ideological obsession with extreme right, Thatcherite discredited political and economic philosophies&mdash;philosophies which have been totally discredited in the United Kingdom and throughout the world. Any country with a buoyant economy has totally rejected the approach of the Deputy Leader. I am amazed that he remains as Deputy Leader after all his mistakes. This Opposition is the most extreme, out of touch political party in the Western world. Even the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom has given up on more than 80 per cent of the philosophies and approaches that have been propounded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the OECD. I have an article by Tim Colebatch, a very respected commentator of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age </EMPHASIS>newspaper. The article refers to the OECD and says, `Why is the OECD hooked on economic castor oil?'. He talks about the reports of the OECD, the people who run the OECD, and the approaches of the OECD. I suppose if there is a group which is second to the Australian Opposition in terms of being backward in economic ideas and analyses, it is the people who run the OECD at the moment. Mr Colebatch says the following about the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . why does one finally close its report with a sense of weary depression? Basically because, while one should expect an OECD report to epitomise the best in economic analysis, this one epitomises some of the worst shortcomings of economic rationalists. Its focus is extraordinarily narrow. Its text is littered with inaccuracies, and with analysis so one-sided as at times to be deliberately misleading.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to mention that there are some absurd errors in this report, including a statement that only one per cent of 19-year-olds are in full time education in Australia. He looked only at secondary schools and forgot to look at TAFE colleges and universities. He has the wrong information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are supposed to take seriously an MPI based on this report. What further emerges is that the information on which the report was based was given to the OECD by the end of 1991, before the One Nation statement was even conceived. We had a change of leadership; we had the One Nation statement coming forward; we had all sorts of new approaches. None of those is taken into account in this report. What do we get in the MPI? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition who, as I said, has no respect for the truth, accuracy or even for intellectual rigour, tries to attack the One Nation statement on the basis of an OECD report which was written from information supplied before we even conceived the One Nation statement. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is walking out of the chamber. Of course he is walking out. It is about time he got some intellectual rigour into himself, instead of putting forth such a foolish MPI. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation statement has nothing to do with the OECD report because all the information was given to the OECD by the end of 1991. The Deputy Leader could at least have come up and said, `There is some relationship', and establish the relationship. There is no relationship. The fact is that this report, leaving aside its problems and its inaccuracies, does not even take into account all the measures of the One Nation statement. How can the Deputy Leader use it as the basis of an attack on the Government? It is typical of the Opposition. It grabs any excuse to attack the One Nation statement and discredit it. The Opposition is in real trouble following its pathetic performance in the Federal electorate of Wills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the electorate have demonstrated that they want additional measures, such as the One Nation statement, and they want new action; they certainly do not want the sort of rubbish which is being put forward by the Opposition. If the Australian people were to embrace such a program they would find a 15 per cent tax on every item, every service&mdash;food or clothing&mdash;anything they do and any action they take, be it cultural activities or child-care. There would be a 15 per cent tax on everything. When we ask what measures the Opposition is putting in place to protect low income earners, the people who are going to suffer as a consequence, we find that there is absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An undergraduate student in economics drafting a consumption tax proposal could have come up with a better proposal than the sort of rubbish which we have had from the Federal Opposition. How anyone who has examined the Fightback package in any detail could take it seriously is beyond the imagination. The reality is that, even within its own dimensions and context, it is wrong. If one were to have a consumption tax, one could do a hell of a lot more with the extra $28 billion raised than the sort of nonsense those opposite propose in terms of the cutbacks and the sorts of taxes that they want to deal out, rather than having the decency to give back to the worst affected people the consequences of imposing the 15 per cent tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To come back to the OECD report, Tim Colebatch makes some very important points. He stresses the fact that the OECD report is based on a particular approach to economic policy. It is an approach to economic policy which, he says, is increasingly discredited throughout the world&mdash;not just Australia but throughout the world. The Federal Opposition has grasped this report and tried to make from it some kind of reality, whereas, as I pointed out, many of the forecasts in the report were based on information given before the One Nation statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) said, the One Nation statement was put forward in order to deal with the economic crisis of this country. In fact, many of the suggestions in the OECD report had already been taken up in the One Nation statement. I refer, for example, to the suggestion for further action on infrastructure development and further action on micro-economic reform. The biggest program to reform our road and rail systems ever put forward in this country was put forward in the One Nation statement. Would anyone listening to the attack that was made on the Government by the Opposition here today have noticed that? Would anyone have known about that? Of course not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the measures to change our electricity generation capacity or other measures to help develop our infrastructure to make it more competitive in international terms? None of that was referred to. The intellectual paucity of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is amazing. He ignored one interesting aspect of the OECD report and tried to give the impression that the OECD is opposed to the Australian Labor Party's approach to wage fixation, especially as it relates to the critical issue of inflation. On this point, the OECD report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Successive versions of the Accord were highly successful in checking wage drift and an acceleration in nominal wage growth, notably when the unemployment rate dropped to around 6 per cent in 1988-89.

When we look at governments we find that the biggest wastes of money are generally wrapped up in grandiose titles and grandiose schemes and given all sorts of laudable objectives.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am absolutely indebted to the Department of Industrial Relations, which set out the background to how this Bill came about and was brought into this place. The Department of Industrial Relations, in the building and construction industry background discussion papers published in Canberra in 1991, sets out what the Government's construction industry reform strategy was. It gave a summary as to how the Bill before the Parliament came to be here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to go through that to illustrate to the people of Australia how government wastes their money, why people pay  much more tax than they have to, and why it is incumbent on people who are in this Parliament to start looking out for the taxpayers of Australia rather than just putting through scheme after scheme that is going to waste their money&mdash;this one would cost about $10m over three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It all started with the announcement of Senator Peter Cook in September 1990 that the Government was going to subject the construction industry to micro-economic reform; that is an important point to bear in mind. All of this was done in the name of micro-economic reform. We just heard a speech about micro-economic reform. What this process illustrates is that, apart from being able to pronounce the word and maybe spell it, that is about all the Government and its members actually understand about micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us do a case study of how the Government engages in micro-economic reform. Senator Peter Cook announced that there was going to be some micro-economic reform in the construction industry. Following the announcement, the Department of Industrial Relations produced a publication. The publication is called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Reform Strategies for the Building and Construction Industry.</EMPHASIS> It is a background discussion paper and it was distributed and discussed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the first thing the Government did was to produce a discussion paper. It then called a meeting of Ministers of the Labour Advisory Group; it got all the labour Ministers around the States to have a meeting to have a look at this. What did those Ministers do, now that more Ministers had been brought into the net? They established a working group of officials. They brought in officials from the Commonwealth, the Territories and the States. They decided, as a working group, that they were going to look at it. The Commonwealth then initiated a review into superannuation, redundancy and long service leave in the industry. What did the review do? It gave a `descriptive analysis of the operation'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we had an announcement, a publication, a meeting of all the Ministers, a review, and a description of what was going on. What happened after the Government got the description? The Government established a Commonwealth interdepartmental committee, an IDC. That meant that the Department of Industrial Relations, the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, the Department of Administrative Services and the Department of Employment, Education and Training got together to prepare a discussion paper. After the meeting of all the Ministers there was an interdepartmental committee. We brought people in from every department and they produced a discussion paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was to be done with the discussion paper? It was obvious&mdash;a national forum was called to look at it. Three Ministers convened a national forum in Canberra in December. No doubt everybody who wanted to come to Canberra to take part in it was invited; in fact, there were 200 representatives. What happened after the national forum to look at the discussion paper coming out of the interdepartmental committee formed as a result of the Ministers' forum and the announcement? The papers were published and circulated&mdash;the proceedings from building for the future&mdash;around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the outcome of the forum that was held in Canberra in December 1990? I am trying to keep a straight face&mdash;the major outcome of the forum was the establishment of four working parties. We had a Ministers' meeting, an interdepartmental committee, a publication, a forum and another publication. We now had a major outcome:  four more working parties. The working parties were given specific terms of reference and they had to report back to their Ministers&mdash;the Ministers who started this whole process in the first place. There was one from the Department of Administrative Services, one from DITAC, one from DEET and one from the Department of Industrial Relations. The working parties reported to the Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do honourable members think happened after the four working groups reported to the Ministers? Wait for it: a subgroup consisting of the four chairmen of the four working parties was set up to try to consolidate the reports into one strategy. There were four working groups. After that, a subgroup was set up by taking one chairman from each working party and consolidating them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just describe that process: the Minister made an announcement; the Department produced a publication; the Commonwealth and State Ministers got together and established a working group of officials; the Commonwealth initiated a review; the review described what was happening; the Commonwealth set up an interdepartmental committee; the interdepartmental committee produced a discussion paper;  a forum was convened to look at the discussion paper; the forum published its documents; the forum called the four working parties together; the four working parties reported to the four Ministers; and the four Ministers put together another committee to consolidate the reports. After all that, the proposed Bill came before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do we know what the essence of that 10-stage use of taxpayers' money was? Do we know what came out of all of that? Does any honourable member think a blinding light as to how we are going to make the construction industry work in this country came out of that? Did a proposal come out of that as to how we might cut taxes or how we might get the Government to be leaner and work better and more efficiently? I will tell the House what came out of all of that:  a recommendation that we set up two new Commonwealth agencies. We had that 10-stage process to recommend that we set up two new Commonwealth agencies. That is what this Bill is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill proposes to set up the Construction Industry Development Council and the Construction Industry Development Agency. This means more jobs, more travelling allowances, more employment, more conferences, more publications&mdash;a process that could go on forever. I hope the taxpayers of Australia are proud that all of this is being done in the name of micro-economic reform. That is what this is all about. This is a proposal by the Government to introduce micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the Council going to do? It is going to act as a national forum; it is going to advise the Commonwealth; and it is going to liaise with other governments.

We have so many government bodies in this country that we need to have a few more to liaise with them all. Then, of course, sooner or later we will have to have someone to liaise between the Council and the agency. There is no telling where this could end. It could go on forever. </PARA>

As I said before, members of the Government can say the word and they can spell it but they do not know what the substance of it is.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is going to promote the adoption of agreements in the building industry. The agency no doubt will go around the construction industry in Australia promoting this great model, the Victorian Building Industry Agreement. It has been practised in Victoria for quite some time and it is the kind of agreement that these councils and agencies want to introduce. The councils and agencies do not actually do anything themselves; they are going to promote discussions about implementation of other documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This agreement came about when employers in Victoria agreed to introduce a redundancy pay scheme above the award. An employer who pays into this redundancy pay scheme&mdash;at the moment from 1990 to September 1991 it is $40 per employee per week&mdash;gets the benefit of this agreement. The benefit of this agreement is that if an employer does something on a building site that the unions do not approve of, the workers do not walk off and demand full pay unless the employer is in fundamental breach of the agreement. The idea was that it would stop workers walking off at a moment's notice and demanding full pay; they would walk off and demand full pay only if there were a fundamental breach. `Fundamental breach' is outlined in clause 10.3.1, which reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where an employer is alleged to be in fundamental breach of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the employees affected by that alleged breach may decline to work as directed in the area affected by the alleged breach.</PARA>
<PARA>The matter then goes to a disputes board. I continue:</PARA>

<PARA>The disputes board pays the employees for not working if there is a breach of this agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could be thought that employers would have to do something absolutely serious to breach this agreement; the mind could conjure up all sorts of things. But no, employers can breach this agreement, for example, by having employees work in inclement weather; by contracting out more than they should; by not providing the right protective clothing; or by not educating people as to safety requirements. They can also breach the agreement by letting somebody without a union ticket onto a building site; that is a heinous breach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This agreement has a whole code as to what one does to make sure that nobody ever walks onto a building site without a clear card. If somebody is found on a building site without a clear card, the boss is told. Clause 19.4.4 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provided that if the employee is unable to produce his/her Clear Card, he/she shall cease work and shall not recommence work until 24 hours has expired&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the employee goes to the sin bin for 24 hours&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and he/she has obtained a Clear Card and produced it to the employer.</PARA>
<PARA>If persons are found without a clear card they are sent off to the sin bin for 24 hours; they cannot get back onto the site until they do get a clear card. Then they are to take it up with the employer as to how somebody got onto the site without a clear card. Clause 19.7.5 says:</PARA>

<PARA>to the satisfaction of the union&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that he/she has been deceived by the employee as to his/her true Union status by the use of a false, forged or borrowed Clear Card&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the employer is not in breach. So, in order to avoid breaching, a person has to say, `I was deceived by a false, forged or borrowed card', but if somebody has come onto that site and has not deceived with a false, forged or borrowed card&mdash;maybe he did not have one or maybe he left it at home&mdash;then he is in fundamental breach.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In outline, this Bill establishes two bodies to be known as the Construction Industry Development Council, which will be called the council; and the Construction Industry Development Agency, which will, naturally, be called the agency. The primary purpose of the council is to act as a national forum for the construction industry in Australia, enabling industry and government representatives to put forward ideas to promote and facilitate the development of the construction industry in Australia. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) and the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs, of course, have the carriage of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary purpose of the agency is to promote and facilitate reform of the construction industry. This will be achieved largely through the implementation of agreements between governments, employers and unions and through the development of codes of practice for the construction industry in Australia. The agency is to have a limited life and is to cease to exist on 1 July 1995. A board of the agency is to be established to provide policy and direction for the agency. A chief executive officer of the agency is to be appointed to conduct the affairs of the agency subject to the requirements of the board of management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clauses dealing with the membership of both the council and the agency ensure that these bodies are representative of the major interests in the construction industry. Other clauses in the Bill deal with the constitution, powers and meetings of both the council and the board of the agency and the financial arrangements and reporting requirements for the agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial implications are that the cost of the construction industry reform strategy, of which this Bill forms an integral part, will be approximately $10.8m. It is anticipated that this cost will be substantially offset by contributions from all of the industries involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To set out how this Bill first came into being, one has to look at the changes that have been progressively made over the last few years. Finally, on 3 December 1991, the construction industry reached a watershed in its turbulent history. On that date the key parties in the industry&mdash;the employers, unions and government&mdash;came together and formalised the growing consensus that had developed between them. The result is the construction industry in-principle reform and development agreement&mdash;a clear commitment by the parties to achieve substantial and genuine reforms in the industry within the next three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other components of the Government's construction industry reform strategy&mdash;the establishment of the tripartite Construction Industry Development Council and the Construction Industry Development Agency&mdash;were also announced on that date. The foundations for a unified, healthy and competitive construction industry are now in place as a result of the actions of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) noted in his One Nation economic statement, since 1983 the Government has transformed the industrial relations landscape. There have been fundamental labour market reforms, combined with a dramatic reduction in industrial disputes and responsible wage outcomes. This transformation has been based on cooperation between employers, employees and the Government, with the accord between the Government and the union movement playing a central role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The construction industry reform strategy is a fine, practical example of how the Government's considered approach to industrial relations can bring about fundamental and lasting reform, something that the previous Government could not manage to do. This reform, in turn, is part of the framework of a comprehensive strategy of developing a more efficient and competitive industry. This is bolstered even further by the participation and support of the various State and Territory governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry is in a prime position to take up the challenge presented in the One Nation statement by the Prime Minister; it is beginning with more than $1 billion worth of new construction work over the next two years. This is a challenge that we must meet. The construction industry reform strategy which was launched by the Government in December 1991 seeks to bring about a quantum leap in the production and competitiveness of Australia's construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This strategy is now even more important in view of the substantial infrastructure spending announced in the One Nation economic statement of the Prime Minister. The infrastructure program outlined in that statement includes expenditure of over $1 billion to upgrade Australian roads, rail, ports and airports. I certainly hope that Badgerys Creek becomes a major part of this development. Virtually all of the expenditure will be on major construction types of works. It will be a major item in welding these units together. The capacity to design and construct these projects to international best practice standards of time, cost and quality is essential if we are to gain the full benefits from this expenditure. This is what the construction industry reform strategy is designed to achieve, and I am sure that with the cooperation of all parties it will certainly achieve that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Government is committed to working with the industry to achieve the necessary reforms. There appear to be many questions related to this Bill and it must be pointed out that the Keating Labor Government intends to continue improvements in all aspects where the Federal Government has an input. To this end, it has asked the question: why reform? The building and construction industry is vitally important to the Australian economy. The industry employs almost 500,000 people in all and it spends in excess of $40 billion a year&mdash;it is one of the major industries in this country. It is an input cost to all economic activities. It offers large export and import replacement opportunities for industry and business and it is critical to attracting investment in new resources and manufacturing projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Problems beset the industry from all quarters, and the Government is continuing to eliminate where it can. Management performance, for one, is below that required of an international competitive industry. There is a long record of poor industrial relations and representation of employers and employees is fragmented over the many organisations&mdash;over 100 at the last count. There are many inadequacies in regulatory and approval systems. These problems result in a cost disadvantage of up to 20 per cent by Australian companies on international standards, which discourages foreign investment and certainly accounts for why we have the existing problems. High levels of contractual disputes continually occur. Low levels of research, development and training also exist in the industry. Low exports and poor quality of goods and services and industrial disputations and restrictive work practices have continued to be fostered within the industry and must be eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The good news, of course, is about the proposals. The construction industry reform strategy developed by this Government, industry and unions is aimed at lowering construction costs and creating an internationally competitive industry through substantial increases in efficiency and productivity. The strategy is about overcoming the problems which I have outlined above. An in-principle reform and development agreement signed by major industry parties, a code of practice to apply initially to major public works, and extensive consultative arrangements, including the establishment of a Construction Industry Development Council, a Construction Industry Development Agency and the use of on-site consultative committees, will ensure success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amongst all other items we will ensure that the workplace bargaining alternative presently provided by section 115 of the Act needs to be more clearly defined. It must offer a more effective process for employers and workers to reach agreement. Experience with section 115&mdash;certified agreements&mdash;demonstrates how constructive such arrangements can be. However, the Government, employers, unions and the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, known as the AIRC, have all acknowledged the need for further flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for legislative changes was highlighted in the parliamentary statement of the Minister for Industrial Relations on 17 October 1991. The legislative changes will ensure that workplace bargaining will not occur in an `anything goes' way. The AIRC's role as umpire will be preserved to prevent exploitation. In future, section 115 agreements will be certified by the AIRC provided that the agreements meet the following criteria: they are genuine and fair to both employer and employee and minimum award standards will be protected at all times; they contain a dispute settling mechanism and consultative arrangements; and, if an agreement applies to a single enterprise, it must be negotiated through a single bargaining unit and be the result of consultation with the employees who will be covered by that particular agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will not alter the penalty or sanction provisions under the Act. The Government's approach to workplace bargaining is based on cooperation and consultation with the parties to achieve meaningful change and ensure fairness. All members of both Houses will fully agree that the construction industry reform is now even more important in view of the substantial infrastructure spending announced by the Prime Minister in February in the One Nation statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The infrastructure program includes expenditure of over $1 billion to upgrade Australian roads, rail, ports and airport infrastructure. Virtually all of this expenditure will be on construction. The One Nation statement also provides for improved depreciation and investment arrangements for business which should generate further private sector expenditure on plant and equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a joint statement the Ministers said that the One Nation program is good news for the Australian construction industry where activity has been declining markedly and was forecast to decline even further. The construction industry reform strategy was launched by the Government in December 1991 and seeks to bring about a quantum leap in productivity and competitiveness of Australia's construction industry. The strategy is to be implemented by the Construction Industry Development Agency, which is a statutory authority. The legislation to establish the agency is currently before the Parliament. Under the strategy, a key focus will be developing major projects as model projects. Best practice will be applied from the planning stage forward covering management and the construction processes, including contractual issues, quality assurance, work and management practices, and the development of a skilled and flexible work force. Clearly, if Australia is to get the maximum value from the important projects they must be designed and constructed on time and at the least possible cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what the Government's reform strategy is about. Support has been received from almost all the States and Territories, all the key organisations and firms in the industry, and all major unions involved. We must press ahead quickly and implement the reform strategy so that Australia gets the benefit. We cannot delay the process any further, as is proposed by some quarters, notably the Opposition. It says that it will oppose the passage of the legislation currently before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The building and construction industry in Australia is one of the most significant industries in this country. It is an industry that we have sought to reform over the period of our government. In fact, we were the only government in Australia that, in the end, moved to deregister by legislative action the Builders Labourers Federation because of its role in creating industrial disharmony and resorting to illegal tactics in the industry. We did that; indeed, we did it twice because it had to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recognition of those changes, there is a need to go further and build on them to make it a more competitive industry. Yet we have had this extraordinary display from Opposition members in which they say they oppose the Bill but, nevertheless, trot out the reasons why reform in the industry is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not an industrial relations exercise; it is an industry exercise. The Bill is about reforming the industry. That means, therefore, that it looks at industry development and research and development. The industry spends less on R&amp;D than does any other industry in Australia. It looks at training. It looks also at how we should sort out regulations which, in some sense, prevent the efficient operation of the industry and, because it is complete, it deals with industrial relations as well. It would be wrong to assume that one can solve problems in the industry by simply concentrating on industrial relations matters and that there are some simple, glib industrial relations explanations. There are not. Industrial relations problems reflect the problems of the whole industry, and a holistic approach is required to deal with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are proposing to set up a reform agency which will look at improving productivity in the industry quite significantly, because that needs to be done. We seek to ensure that contracts are delivered on time and on cost. We will promote the building and construction section in Australia as a future export industry. We will engage in innovation by nominating, with the agreement of the parties, demonstration sites or special sites in which new methods of work can be trialled. New ways of doing things can be experimented with so we can learn how to do things better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill depends on there being a degree of cooperation in trying to achieve the purposes of reform. We have heard from the Opposition that one ought to make war on the unions. I would not want to contend that no reforms are needed on that front, as there surely does need to be reform. However, I do not think there needs to be the sort of&mdash;for want of a better word&mdash;reform that the Opposition preaches. Certainly, I do not think that one can reform the industry by trying to eliminate the trade union movement from it, as the Opposition seems to be arguing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key element of any reform process is that we succeed in doing something significantly better. The Bill will allow us to do that. We have had extensive consultations, ranging over most of last year, with the industry organisations and with the consumers in the industry. I refer to the Building Owners and Managers Association and the major investors in the industry. We went through that process exhaustively. We achieved an in-principle agreement which they have all signed and agreed with totally. They have all committed themselves to the goals of the in-principle agreement&mdash;stretch targets and hard goals&mdash;which were set down in black and white. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the Opposition's contentions in this debate is that there has been insufficient commitment to this concept from the industry. I do not know what Opposition members have been reading or how they interpret `insufficient commitment', but not only is the Commonwealth Government committed to it, but also the signatures of the governments of Victoria, South Australia, the ACT and Western Australia appear on the in-principle agreement. The signature of members of the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors&mdash;the organisation representing the major construction companies in this country &mdash;appears on the agreement, as do the signatures of members of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Metal Trades Industry Association, a number of other trade unions involved in the industry, the Building Owners and Managers Association, the Building Industry Specialist Contractors Organisation of Australia, the Australian Earthmovers and Road Contractors Federation of Australia and the Master Plumbers and Mechanical Services Association of Victoria. We have a commitment by organisations representing the stakeholders in this industry to arrive at the reform targets that we have set down.

The federation movement finally won the day because the people of the six colonies shared several fundamental concerns about their future. Amongst these concerns were the questions of defence and immigration.

Marvellous Melbourne was already acknowledged as one of the finest cities in the world. It seemed as though the young nation was destined for great things.

Yet it is these bureaucrats who have seen the total destruction of many businesses and many families. They can be likened to the Nazi SS as they exterminate our industries and businesses. If bureaucrats were made responsible for their actions in the same way as company directors, what a change there would be.

One illustration always chosen of the recent construction history of Australia is the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation and the role that it played in setting in place a very large construction activity, shared between the private sector and government and involving unions.

The sad part about the honourable member for Dunkley's speech is that the industry asked for these agreements. This is not something that was dreamt up in Canberra. A consultative process took place involving the industry, and the industry said that this is what it needs. I have talked to many people in the industry and they say that if only they could get pre-start industrial agreements in place, many of our industrial relations problems would be resolved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Woodside, operating on the North West Shelf, is now a very large contributor to our export earnings. If the honourable member for Dunkley talked to the seniors in Woodside, they would tell him that the conduct of industrial relations there is difficult. It is a difficult, dangerous site in a remote locality, and it has been successful because of pre-start industrial agreements. We cannot walk away from that. The fact is we do have those in place. We cannot wish away the workers. The sad thing about the remarks of the honourable member for Dunkley was that he was saying that either they are all terrible communists and troublemakers bent upon an eastern Europe solution or they do not exist. The fact is they do exist and they have rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Workers are often organised in a way that, from time to time, is totally unproductive. Many of the stoppages and frustrations on building sites are due to the lack of cooperation between trade unions and employers. That is being brought out in the New South Wales royal commission, surely. We all know that. But we will not get anywhere if we just stand here and say, `Let's not worry about that as an approach; let's just go ahead and let the private sector solve it'. The private sector comes back to us and says, `But we want you to fix it up'. That is always very high on the list of complaints. We have to acknowledge that. That is the truth of the matter. It is no good my coming in here and saying otherwise. When I talk to my local business people that is exactly what they tell me. One of the things they always try to get in place is an industrial agreement that will cover the site. Optus Communications, which is now setting up, is setting in place pre-start industrial agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">T<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>his legislation is about that. I want to try to persuade the honourable member for Dunkley that there is an element of this legislation that is very fundamental: we cannot get out there and compete unless we can be sure that we have a workplace that is going to be safe and in which industrial agreements are going to stick. Pre-start agreements certainly give us that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the experience with Woodside. It was a very happy experience there in what was a very crucial project. We could look at a number of other sites, but I would take up too much of the time available to debate this legislation. The question of pre-start industrial agreements is very fundamental. When we look at the practices they proscribe, we see that they are not practices that anyone in this place would find they could agree with. All sorts of restricted practices are listed there, and they have said basically they do not want these restricted practices on the agenda. It is interesting because some of them are traceable to unions and some of them are traceable to management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I find unfortunate about the honourable member for Dunkley's position is that the solution is not just to be found in management and it is not just to be found in small business. The world is not like that. Of course part of the solution is to be found with management and small business; no-one would disagree with that. But management and small business will not necessarily take on many of the major projects. They may come in as subcontractors, they may come in as consultants, but many of the major contracts that are taken on in my own State of Western Australia, such as the major rail project in the northern suburbs of Perth, are being taken on by large business. Our local government authority in the city of Stirling, and prospective employers and so on, would like pre-start industrial agreements because they enable them to undertake these projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say with all good will to the honourable member for Dunkley that this is not about merely addressing a bureaucratic structure. It is not that at all. The industry is saying to us that this is what it wants us to do, and we are responding. I heard the speech of the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) and his introductory remarks on behalf of the Opposition. I was dismayed because all he proceeded to do, frankly, was to list the names of who was involved and then bag them as if somehow they were involved in some sort of eastern European conspiracy. </PARA>

This legislation is about award conditions. If we remove minimum health standards and minimum social security standards, and if we do not have low income housing, the future is a Los Angeles.

Unless we challenge the assumptions, we will not learn anything. Fundamental to these assumptions is the question as to the way in which we organise the world. In looking at the building and construction industry, the way we are organising the world is asking how we can better go about structuring it. There is an extraordinary list of very busy people in the industry, as well as State governments, who have given their time to set down a consultative mechanism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the issues that we have not properly addressed in the past&mdash;those opposite have to answer to this&mdash;is the role of State governments in terms of significant bureaucratic impediments.  I must give due credit to the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Greiner, who has been one of the significant reformers in this area. I have been here nine years and I have heard all sorts of States rights issues trotted out by the Liberal and National parties. They say, `You cannot interfere with State governments, because that is interfering with the States'. The answer is that States very often interfere with the productive activities of business. The States have more red tape, more bureaucracy, than has the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that one of the significant things about this matter is that we have actually dragged some of the States in here and said, `Look, lift your game'. And they have lifted their game. There is now a much better recognition of what is going on. We are looking at the whole situation. We are looking at a partnership arrangement between the Commonwealth, the States, local authorities and the significant players in the industry. What significant players in the industry? I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The signature of the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors, the organisation representing the major construction companies in this country appears in the agreement, as do the signatures of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Metal Trades Industry Association, a number of trade unions involved in the industry, the Building Owners and Managers Association, the Building Industry Specialist Contractors Organisation of Australia, the Australian Earthmovers and Road Contractors Federation of Australia and the Master Plumbers &amp; Mechanical Services Association of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Those organisations are not involved in some bureaucratic stranglehold. They are trying to achieve a better outcome&mdash;and it is significant. A better outcome for the industry yields many more jobs and much higher levels of productivity in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We may as well be honest about this. One of the difficulties has been an absolutely appalling industrial relations record on many major sites. We have seen it develop over the years. I recall my days in Sydney when Norm Gallagher and Jack Mundy were playing games with industrial relations there, watching the New South Wales Institute of Technology building being constructed and the inability of managers to cope. At least we now have some people saying, `There has to be a better way of doing things'. That is what this legislation is: a better way of doing things. I am saying that to Opposition members. I am not trying to make a political point;  I am trying to make a very fundamental management point about how to get an industry going better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it important to us? Clearly, in terms of 500,000 people being employed, it is very important. In terms of its contribution of 60 per cent to the nation's fixed capital expenditure, it is very important. There is a lot at stake here. The other thing that is significant is that in technology Australia has often been at the leading edge. The concrete pump, for example, was developed in Australia, and it is a very important development. We have seen it used on many industrial sites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can go around the major Australian cities and give ticks or crosses to the sites that are going well or badly. Across the board we want to see industrial sites working well. It makes no sense to have people out on strike. One of my most moving experiences while working in Sydney in a high-rise office was seeing a fellow knocked down from what was then the old Australia Club building while he was using a sledge-hammer on a brick wall. I mentioned to some people that I wondered what the safety position was. I actually saw this man fall off that wall that was 12 storeys high. No attention, no concern, was paid to industrial safety. When the men stopped work, as they ought to have done, there was a headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph</EMPHASIS> referring to the outrage of the workers and another strike. The fact is that a bloke was dead. He had a wife and a couple of children, and he was dead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not benefit any of us to have that type of situation arising. The issue will look after itself if we have proper pre-start industrial relations agreements that recognise safety standards. That is very important at the moment also because we have a terrible problem with asbestos in many buildings in Australia. It is an in-built negative in terms of our GDP. If we had proper pre-start industrial agreements and we knew what we were doing in the construction industry, we could remove the asbestos from the buildings. It was done in Perth the other day when a building was imploded, collapsed with the use of explosives, and the vapours and so on were able to be contained in such a way that it was safe for the people on site. That is the way to go about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am saying to the honourable member for Dunkley and to those opposite that we have an industry that is very big, that has an output of $40 billion annually;  but we can have a much higher level of output. We want to be in a situation in which we can not only operate our industry in Australia as a role model for good industrial relations but also, as is happening, incidentally, increase our export performance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another interesting thing. Let us look at the most effective managers in Australia. This is one of the things that concerned me when I was working in this area. When I went to a site and saw all the signs written in English, I would say to the management, `All your safety signs are in English', to which that person would say, `Oh, yes'. When I asked whether the members of the work force had been tested to see whether they could speak English, I found that that never happened. It is little wonder that there was such a big safety problem. In fact, on some sites where the common language was Greek or Italian or Vietnamese, there was no built-in safety factor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We, as a nation, suffer badly from that. Our safety record shows that the hours lost because of bad safety procedures are five times the hours lost from disputes. The construction industry figures prominently in that record. Again, we have to ask how we approach it. We approach it by standing up in this Parliament and supporting legislation that, like this legislation, is not about bureaucratic interference. Let us go through the names of the people involved. The Board members include Mr Martin Albrecht of Thiess Constructions and Mr David Chandler of Fletcher Constructions, who will be in this not just because they want to sit around and engage in a bureaucratic activity, and Mr Jack Ritch of AMP, Mr Malcolm Kinnaird of Kinhill Group, Mr Robert Milne of Hooker Cockram, Mr Malcolm Farrow from DITAC and Mr Bob Marshman from DIR, who are people whose obligation will be to try to get improved performance in the construction industry. </PARA>

I note that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Brereton), who is at the table, has been in Western Australia already looking at some major projects. We are talking about very significant changes. I have talked to the employers in these organisations, such as Dominion Mining with the Yakabindie nickel project. Part of that is construction because there will be construction of the mine site; then there will be the actual mining operation. We are talking about very significant yields there. I am very pleased that we now have someone whose basic responsibility is to ensure that we keep a watch on this&mdash;not to interfere but to get things out of the way, to clear the hurdles. That is the Parliamentary Secretary's job, and I am very encouraged by that. I am not saying this as a political point. I am simply saying that, if one is out there looking at Yakabindie or the Marandoo iron ore project and one has the Parliamentary Secretary representing the Prime Minister who can say, `What do we need to do to remove these impediments?', we have gained a great deal. Certainly management will tell one that, and certainly the workers on the site will, too. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The thrust of this Bill is very much in line with what the Government is on about in education, in compulsory trade unionism and the dominance of the trade union movement in the construction industry. I draw the attention of the House to the attitude and the policies of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in centralising the control of education in Canberra. The thrust of this Bill is another attempt by a central agency to run the construction industry by regulation and by coercion in the hope that it might improve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend to members of the House the speech by the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) who has had a long experience in industrial relations matters both personally and from his own observations. His basic thrust, with which I entirely agree, is that this Bill is based on the power of the trade union movement, and in particular the power of the building unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill bases a lot of its standards on the lower standards of those bigger, more powerful unions and the dominant builders in the commercial building sector. The Bill is an integral part of what the Government calls its construction industry reform strategy. For reasons that I will allude to later, the Government seems no longer to want to call this pathetic attempt at micro-economic reform a building and construction industry reform strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like firstly to discuss part 3 of the Bill which establishes the Construction Industry Development Agency, with a sunset provision, I am pleased to say, of 1 July 1995. The real power resides in the agency's board, whose members are appointed under clause 20. It is notable that the Minister for Industrial Relations has almost complete discretion as to whom to appoint&mdash;a very important aspect of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any reform process must have the support of the industry. It is a scandalous situation that this new body, established with $10.8m in government funding, has no representative from the specialist contractors or smaller contractors; other speakers have alluded to this. Not only are they such an important force in the so-called cottage industry&mdash;a somewhat derisory term, I think, for an industry whose average cost of construction due to its lack of union coverage is some 45 per cent lower than it would be if the residential building sector were fully unionised; contractors overall form some 84 per cent of the work force in the entire building and construction industry. The subcontractors in the residential building industry and their sensible working practices keep the price of an average $115,000 new home at $15,000 below what it would cost if the tentacles of the unions&mdash;whether overtly or by stealth&mdash;were grasping the domestic construction sector. The only industry representatives come from companies of the scale of Hooker Cockram, Lend Lease and the Fletcher Challenge subsidiary, Fletcher Construction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's in-principle reform and development agreement states that its objective is to reform the construction industry nationally. That is what I mentioned in my opening remarks. This is the attitude of the Government to change the thing on a national basis, not an industry by industry basis or at the construction site level. In a rather hidden division 7, clause 54 gives the Minister the power to order the board to comply with written directions&mdash;quite a sinister suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To look at the intent of this Government, we have to go well beyond the Bill that we have before the House tonight. An interesting document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Improving Work Practices in the Australian Building Industry</EMPHASIS> by Professor Ireland, published in 1988, made many recommendations. It should have been compulsory reading for Mr Peter Berry, an adviser to the Minister for Industrial Relations, who stated late last year that the biggest problems facing the industry were incompetent and criminal employers. That is a very powerful suggestion to put forward, and I do not agree with it. What an odd attitude for a government that has paraded its so-called accord for all to see. I suggest that Professor Ireland may well disagree with that observation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Ireland recommended secret ballots to approve strike action where more than 5 per cent of time had been lost due to industrial action. He suggested that no direct payments be made to employees on days on which there is inclement weather. He commented on the difference in time lost on commercial and industrial sites in the UK and the USA&mdash;typically about 2 per cent there compared with the 10 or 11 per cent in Australia. Professor Ireland also stated that in the United States on-costs for builders ranged from 8 per cent to just over 10 per cent. In Australia, businesses are struggling under a burden of paying close to an extra 45c in every dollar. It is no wonder that our unionised sections of the building and construction industries are uncompetitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Will the Bill address these issues? The Government's reform strategy gives us little hope. Honourable members should listen to these two opposing objectives, set out on the same page. Objective 7 states that an aim is to encourage more efficient and flexible work practices and arrangements. Let us remember that. Objective 13 is to ensure that there is strict adherence with accord and agreement provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Opposition's view, they are in direct conflict. On the one hand, the Government's accord process and adherence to award provisions is in contradistinction to our approach to making more flexible working arrangements, especially in the building industry. These two statements could cover almost any case. If there is little flexibility, the Government could say that its strategy is working under the latter objective. This might be despite the rights of the thousands of subcontractors or the rights of builders being effectively trampled upon by a policy of callous omission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Keating Government sees little wrong with an approach to industrial relations that knows only compulsion. We see it in the proposed increases to compulsory employer funded superannuation from 1 July this year, the Government's proposal. We, on this side of the House, are hopeful that that proposal does not get up. It also shows itself in the training guarantee levy and, revealed more in what is not in the Bill than the actual clauses we are discussing, it is again shown today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The building and construction industry in Victoria is suffering very badly from this deliberate recession that we `had to have'. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has said that over the last year the number employed is down 21.5 per cent to just over 118,000 persons. This represents a drop of three times the magnitude experienced by any other major industry sector in my own debt-ridden State of Victoria. Engineering construction in that State is down over 32 per cent on the previous year and does not make happy statistical bedtime reading, to say the least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst some of this can be attributed to the cyclical nature of the industry, most of the decline can be laid fairly and squarely at the feet of the present Keating Government, which has presided over the loss of 90,000 jobs within the last year in the State of Victoria and seen the latest projected new expenditure on capital by business drop a further 11 per cent. We do not need to look at the official figures in Victoria, or the policies of this Government, to understand how badly the Labor Government under Premier Kirner has performed in that State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with any industry in dire straits, radical measures need to be adopted. We look in vain in the Bill for any ending to iniquitous compulsory unionism. The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) and the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) are very much on the public record as indicating the pressure for compulsory unionism in the building industry. The order of the day is `no ticket, no start'. Yet a discussion paper prepared by counsel assisting the Royal Commission into Productivity in the Building Industry in New South Wales clearly showed what could be achieved if time lost through inclement weather, safety and industrial stoppages was reduced from 30 per cent to 10 per cent and, concurrently, a system rewarding the employee more for the time he or she was on site was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That inquiry produced some very startling figures on the lack of productivity because of inclement weather and industrial disputes. The discussion paper suggested that hours should be paid only on the basis of those worked, which would rise from 36 hours to 46 hours out of the 51 hours available during a possible working week. That sounds very good in theory, but if this is the only focus, past mistakes will be repeated. We need to have a climate in which genuine enterprise agreements&mdash;at either the individual employer or individual project level&mdash;are encouraged, but without the threats of intimidation, of black bans, or of any refusal to countenance the use of non-union labour that even so-called respectable organisations such as the Builders Workers Industrial Union have been known to employ from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is significant that the Government has left the building industry officially out of its reform strategy. Why? Because the builders of the Australian dream house show just what can be achieved by contractors working for themselves, rather than at the behest of some union shop steward. Of course, this is not popular with the present Government because its ACTU mates are dead against the private contractors and they see a threat to union membership in the building industry and throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Mr Alan Hickinbotham, the large South Australian home builder, the Hickinbotham Group, said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 23 March, `Any Government "reforms" of the residential housing industry could increase prices by $2,000-$4,000'. Australia clearly needs to bring the clients of the building and construction industry into sharp focus. If this is not the case, there will continue to be a smaller industry both in Victoria and nationally than should be the case. Why cannot both builders and their employees, together with subcontractors, realise that both the nation and themselves lose out if sensible agreements are not entered into at the individual level, as has been the case with the subcontractors and their builders?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reform should not be imposed by a small, unrepresentative board subject to blatant political interference such as this Bill sets out to do. It has to come from within. It is very much part of coalition policy that enterprise agreements and genuine approaches by those working in the industry should emerge from the builders and the work force on particular building sites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Construction Industry Development Council established under clause 4 is more widely based than the Construction Industry Development Agency, but there is only a statutory requirement under clause 11(1) to meet at least once a year. That is a remarkable situation. One wonders how much value one can get out of that particular group. There would be no `funny money' payments under the iniquitous CERT scheme that some of my colleagues have discussed in earlier speeches, and whilst the ordinary time rate would remain at $12.39, site allowances would rise from $102 to $368 at a typical commercial project in the centre of Sydney. Provided employers profits would be enhanced by having workers on site for more hours of the week, they would benefit. The pre-tax earnings of employees would rise by up to $266 per week, but the actual cost to the employer per hour would fall from $27.55 to $26.69. So we see that if we improve the productivity of employees on the job in the Australian construction industry, especially in the commercial construction industry, we will achieve remarkable gains in productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the economic statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), these are achievable, rather than the very rubbery growth rate figures of 4 3/4 per cent which are supposed to take place on 1 July. I do not see any signs of that happening. What does the Government do? In part 3, clause 14, it reiterates a commitment to the so-called `top down' strategy which has failed on so many previous occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the working party from the Department of the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) completed in March 1991, suggested that the new Agency sought to be established under this Bill should develop as a priority measure to assist the creation of a single award for the industry. Now we come to some of the real punch lines. As I said, a single award for the whole industry, nationally based, would combine the building industry and the commercial building sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scrutineering role of the Agency must be called into question. No doubt those present on the opposite side of the House would say that the market has failed in respect of the large numbers of subcontractors who have been thrown into liquidation from time to time. It must be remembered that these subcontractors accept the risk factor, especially under the Keating Government. Most of them want the freedom to work for as many hours as they choose and have little difficulty in being remunerated for the hours actually worked and the achievement of the task that they set out to do. On many of the bigger projects those involved in the labour put in the hours but do not achieve the work programs that are set out on a day by day basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The acid test is that the cost of domestic building is some 45 per cent lower than in the commercial and industrial arenas where there is a plethora of one out, all out, rain allowances, heat allowances, wet area allowances, overtime, one in, all in. Even Lewis Carroll would be in wonderment about the remarkable number of oncosts that keep being added to these commercial projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Will all these powers of scrutiny mean that closed shop unionism by stealth will appear in the so-called cottage industry? This is what the Opposition is so worried about. This Government really believes in the so-called right to strike. There is no more an absolute right to strike than there is the right to impose my wishes on my next door neighbour. It must depend on the circumstances and reasonable dialogue between the parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The creation of super unions in most areas has occurred at the same time as union membership has been falling to a coverage level of only 31 per cent in the private sector. I think all Australians should be very aware that union coverage in Australia is only 31 per cent in the private sector. There is an impression in the community amongst voters that the unions have a greater coverage than that. Of course, the thrust of this Government&mdash;this Bill is part of it&mdash;is to maintain union strength by union amalgamation and by bringing in Bills such as this that maintain the situation of no ticket, no start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us remember that under Mr Hawke, when he was Prime Minister, trade union membership declined. It was a remarkable situation. It will continue to decline as this Government introduces Bills such as this which are brought in for the very purpose of ensuring that trade union membership is maintained against the thrust of the industry which has an inclination and a desire to employ subcontractors. To not extend closed shops to small private contractors and builders of a subcontracting nature would be a benefit to all industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is little pressure for change from within. Most clients of the smaller builders and subcontractors are pretty happy with those they engage. Of course, there will always be some rotten eggs, but the introduction of compulsory unionism would impose far more cost on the average wage earner who buys his or her first home than those relatively few shysters in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, along with other members of the coalition, cannot support the Construction Industry Reform and Development Bill, however laudable some of its objectives are. I note some of the comments of those opposite in supporting some of their theoretical objectives. The Australian construction industry along with its omitted colleague, the house building industry, deserves better than to be treated in this cavalier, compulsion based approach that is the case with this Bill, which is notable not for what is contained therein but for what is omitted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to enter this debate and support the Construction Industry Reform and Development Bill 1991. The Bill represents an endeavour on the part of the Government to implement a reform process in the building and construction industry that is one of a series of reforms this Government has been about in improving the economic viability of a number of our key industries. It is the latest in a series of those cooperative strategies that has been built in consultation with those directly involved in the industry&mdash;employer and employee representatives&mdash;and, of course, relevant government bodies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been, quite properly, some mention during this debate about similar strategies that have been adopted in other industries. Before I go to the specifics of the building industry, I too would like to refer to a couple of those areas. The foremost amongst those are the reforms that have taken place on the waterfront and stevedoring industries where the Government has been instrumental in seeking major changes in work and management practices to improve the efficiency on our wharves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite at each turn seek to decry those achievements or to ignore them, but I think it is important that the record be set straight. The reforms that have been undertaken on the waterfront have seen the most dramatic improvement in efficiencies in that area certainly in peacetime. In the bulk cargo area, grain handling now involves a labour component of between 50 per cent and 80 per cent less than was the case only 12 to 18 months ago. The turnaround time for grain handling vessels has dropped from 4 1/2 days to 2 1/2 days. Indeed, in November last year, the Australian Wheat Board in its annual report recorded that the improvements were so dramatic that it now regarded Australian grain handling ports as amongst the most efficient anywhere in the world, saving Australian grain producers some $10m a year. That fact has been recognised generally in the broad economic debate, even if it has not been recognised by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 31 October last year, Peter Roberts penned an article under the headline `Full Marks on the Waterfront'. There he set out the improvements that have occurred in the stevedoring industry with the containerisation handling capacity of our ports. I draw the attention of honourable members to the improvements that have occurred there. The article referred to the turnaround of containers per hour in Australian ports and, in particular, looked at the improvements that have occurred in the port of Melbourne. It commented that not so long ago we had a turnaround of about 12 or 13 containers per hour. Directly as a result of reform processes initiated by this Government in association with the industry, that number of containers has increased from 12 or 13 per hour to 22 per hour; indeed, on an international comparative basis, we now rank amongst the best in the world in the turnaround of our containers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The article referred to some of the European ports. It is worth noting that the port of Melbourne has a turnaround of 22 containers per hour; Felixstowe, 19.7; Hamburg, 27.4; Bremerhaven, 21; and Zeebrugge, 19.5. We rank amongst the best container port handling facilities in the world today, yet only a year or two ago that was not the case. In the shipping industry, again often cited as an area where work practices have not been internationally competitive, Australia this year will crew its ships at less than the OECD average. Five years ago, in most cases, it was about 20 or 30 per cent above the OECD average. This year it is below the OECD average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there had been a massive strike on the wharves, or if all Australian shipping had stopped in the last 12 months for a period of some weeks while these reforms were negotiated, and the Government rode in on a white charger and got that sort of result, the entire nation would know about it and would say what a tremendous achievement it had been. But this Government has not been about disruption or confrontation; it has been about genuine improvement in work practices. In those two critical areas&mdash;on the wharf and in the merchant navy&mdash;often cited by the Opposition and their supporters outside this place, the improvements have been dramatic. They now place us on a par with the best practices in the world; they have been done by cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who has been at the forefront of that cooperation? It has been the very workers and unionists those opposite have been at pains to attack throughout this debate. Opposition members have got their minds fixed in the 1950s. It is about time they understood that a total change has gone through Australia in industrial relations in the last decade; a change which has swept them by; a change which I am amazed they still refuse to acknowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industrial relations in the 1990s is not the industrial relations of the 1970s. That is a fact well understood by the trade union movement, by the workers in the workplace and by business people in the community involved in these negotiations. Conaust, a major stevedoring company, is on the record as acknowledging an 80 per cent improvement in productivity in one year. The business community knows that is the case. It is about time the Opposition stopped trying to peddle the sorts of myths and stories of the 1950s that had some application as we went through the 1960s and even into the 1970s, but have long since gone from our industrial relations and social fabrics. </PARA>

It makes an important contribution to the economy. Streamlining its efficiencies will have flow-on effects throughout the economy, not just because of the amount of money involved but because it represents an input cost into virtually all other aspects of the economy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal objective of this agreement is to develop a reliable and internationally competitive industry through real and lasting improvements in efficiency and productivity, as well as providing more satisfying, stable and rewarding employment for workers in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that that is a statement of objective which all members of the Parliament would wholeheartedly endorse and would work out ways of implementing. Regrettably, it is not so. Members of the Opposition have taken it upon themselves to oppose the Bill and the establishment of an authority dedicated to implementing that objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specifically, the agreement identifies some workplace reforms that are required and to set up a mechanism for implementing reforms on a cooperative and sensible basis. The parties have agreed to negotiate through the restrictive practices that they believe need to be eliminated, and to do that in the first six months of the life of the Construction Industry Reform Agency. It is a commitment to the process and it is a commitment to giving it priority. That is in the national interest, and the people involved know it is in their interests as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at some of those restrictive practices. They are errors of judgment or behaviour on the part of both management and workers. They are set out in the document. I do not propose to go through them in full detail, but there are a couple of key areas that need to be mentioned to illustrate the point that they refer to problems of both worker practices and management practices. They include such situations as inclement weather resulting in workers' refusal to transfer between sites or the withdrawal of key personnel, such as crane drivers or first-aid officers; the arbitrary and unreasonable restrictions on movement of labour and materials; the non-observance of award provisions&mdash;and if there is an industry where that is a major problem, it is this industry; and also cash-in-hand payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cash-in-hand payments have become a double problem because not only do they cultivate the cutthroat, go to the lowest common denominator approach to industrial relations, but also they are designed to circumvent the tax revenue legislation of this Parliament. I am pleased to say that some years ago the Government instituted procedures for prescribed payments tax in the industry which have gone some way towards overcoming that difficulty. There is a general broad raft of problems associated with the non-observance of awards. Other practices include situations in which employers have provoked industrial disputes by the dismissal of a shop steward or some other site personnel in an attempt to escape penalty provision of contracts, and the consistent refusal by employers to work in accordance with occupational health and safety standards and regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Health and safety is a key feature in this industry but one in which corners are often cut. The people at the end of the day who pay the price for cutting those corners are not the accountants or the managers but the workers whose safety is put at risk. The honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) pointed out some of those problems a little while ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no doubt that the process set in train by this legislation is a much needed one. The commitment which has been given by governments around this country, by employers around this country and by trade unions around this country gives us good reason to believe it will meet with success. Why should it not do so? As I have mentioned earlier, the goodwill of unionists and employers, through the good offices of the Government, has seen these sorts of reforms put in place on the waterfront and in the shipping industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I went through the material for this Bill and listened to some of the comments from those opposite, I wondered what it was that they were so concerned about, what it was that led them to oppose this legislation, to oppose a reform process and to oppose a consultative mechanism which has already demonstrated its worth in other critical areas of the economy. Is it because those opposite think that strikes have been a major problem, that we have this massive labour unrest and really need the sledge-hammer to crack the peanut? The facts do not bear that out, in spite of what the prejudice and rhetoric of honourable members opposite might lead them to think. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the seven years of this Government, days lost through strike action per 1,000 employees stands at about 232 days, whereas in the six or seven years of the last Liberal Party government, it stood at 591, which is about 2 1/2 times the number in Labor's day. And it was not just the odd hiccup. If one looks at the figures on an annual basis, one finds that those opposite managed to break records year after year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industrial relations record of honourable members opposite is absolutely abysmal. I demonstrate that by referring to a couple of recent years:  in 1990, working days lost per 1,000 employees was 210; in 1989, it was 190. When the Liberal Party was last in office, in 1982, 358 days were lost. That was one of the Liberal Government's best years; it was the second best year that it had. In the year before, 1981, 797 days were lost. That is nearly four times the number of industrial disputes we had last year. That is the sort of industrial relations record those opposite had. Members of the Opposition cannot say that we need to adopt their approach in this Bill because industrial relations is not working and because there are too many strikes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it that labour costs have gone through the roof? If we look at unit labour costs, we see they are now lower than they were in 1981-82; so it cannot be labour costs. What is it that drives the people on the Opposition benches to oppose these measures? Regrettably, one comes to the conclusion that it is a dogmatic doctrinaire commitment to a philosophy that is not supported by the facts and not persuaded by recent programs of reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, I got an insight into that from the Tasmanian State President of the Liberal Party, Mr Eric Abetz, in a radio interview that he did on the ABC on 23 April. Mr Abetz was asked about a meeting of the H.R. Nicholls Society that was conducted in Tasmania, and he commented that he had spoken to the organisation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . which has amongst its luminaries such people as Peter Costello, David Kemp, Ian McLachlan, all who now serve on the front bench of the Opposition. . . </PARA>
<PARA>I can recall some years ago when the H.R. Nicholls Society, which conducted its secret meetings up on the Sunshine Coast, was concerned about the glare of publicity. And well it might be, because its policies are disgraceful. Regrettably, the Society now appears to hold pride of place in the Opposition. Mr Abetz went on and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">John Howard basically embraces the H R Nicholls views and he of course is shadow minister for industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA>There, I think, we have the problem with the industrial relations policy. Mr Deputy Speaker, time is running out and there is other important business the Parliament must deal with before the adjournment. I will omit from my contribution today some other comments which no doubt I will have the opportunity to present on another occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, however, one important point that those members opposite need to consider in addition to those that I have already mentioned. There is a doctrinaire, nearly religious hold that some members opposite have with their idea of the reform of the industrial relations system, as if there is a particular structure which, having been legislated for, will solve the problems. For Opposition members, that appears to be their interpretation, their brand of workplace bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just point this out. It comes from a publication put out by the Metal Trades Industry Association, an employer organisation. It was noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Japan has company bargaining and an amazingly good productivity record. America also has company bargaining, but a record on productivity growth that is worse than ours.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not sure what we glean from that system of bargaining and what it does for productivity growth. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Germany has an enviable productivity record, but a system of centralised collective bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA>Those opposite, in this and all debates which impinge on industrial relations, have failed to understand that industrial relations is not about systems, it is about people; it is about people interacting one with the other; and it is about people interacting on a fair and equitable basis in the knowledge that it is not always an even playing field, it is not always a just playing field, and that there is a need to have an umpire. There is a need to know that we have recourse to somewhere and that we also have the rights of representation. Until honourable members opposite wake up to some of those basic fundamentals they will continue to get it wrong; they will get it wrong on Bills like this; and they will get it wrong on industrial relations generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Government for its initiative in introducing this Bill. It is a good Bill. It will see improvements for those involved in the industry; it will help create a stronger industry for Australia; and it will be for the good of us all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) and other Government members for their contributions to this debate. Unfortunately, we have seen one of the most appalling contributions to a debate in this Parliament by the Opposition during the eight years that I have been here. The Opposition obviously has no concept of what this reform strategy is about. It has not talked to the industry; it has not understood that the industry came to government for this particular reform package. The Government responded and has come up with this particular piece of legislation and the methodology involved in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of selective quoting of the objectives of the Bill. Those objectives were included in the in-principle agreement. It is appropriate that I put those objectives on the record:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(xiv)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">substantial reduction in lost time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These particular objectives came out of four working parties. They were brought together and headed by industry groups. One of the most significant things that most Opposition members have missed is the Chandler committee which headed up the industry policy area. It identified the fact that in this industry, 60 per cent of the gains from reform that needs to take place is in management practice and industry policy areas and not in industrial relations. That is acknowledged not only by the trade union movement but also by the employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a number of theatrical performances, no more than the one we got from the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), who quoted how this was going to cost the agency $10.8m of taxpayers' money over the three-year period. What he failed to note and failed to inform the House is that one-third of that $10.8m is coming from industry; it is not all taxpayers' money. The industry itself realises that there is a need for reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The board of the agency is perhaps one of the most talented groups of people ever brought together. Many public companies would be pleased to have that particular group of people as their board of directors, but I do not think there are many companies in Australia that could afford to have those people as their board of directors. The board was never intended to be representative of all the industry organisations; that is the role of the Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many honourable members on the Opposition benches referred to the housing industry. We were also clear about this in the Bill. It specifically excludes the housing industry. It is about non-residential construction. Even more so, it is not just about central business district high-rise. We know that particular area has had huge problems. I notice that the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) took part in that debate. When we were on a parliamentary committee together we looked at a project called the North West Shelf. One of the critical problems that Australian industry had in participating in that North West Shelf program was the lack of measurement standards by which to engage an Australian contractor against an overseas contractor. It is interesting to note that many of those contracts went offshore, some to Indonesia and some to South Korea. I am pleased to say that the only one of those contracts on the Goodwin platform that is on time is the Australian component; all the others are over-budget and behind time. So, perhaps Australian companies are now learning that Australian industry can perform the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other integral part of this package is not just the objectives that all of those people have agreed and signed and put in place, but the fact that we are now working to a code of practice to get some pre-qualification for contractors wishing to bid for government works. It is interesting to note that not only does this particular Bill have the support of the unions and the companies involved in the industry, but more importantly it also has the support of BOMA, the Building Owners and Managers Association of Australia. They are very supportive of this particular strategy&mdash;to such an extent that when the need recently arose for a short term replacement for Mr Ern MacDonald, who is the Chief Executive Officer of the agency, BOMA made Mr Peter Barda, its Chief Executive Officer, available four days a week to continue to run this strategy. This further emphasises the fact that this is a strategy that is supported by all sections of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we proceed further towards internationalising our economy and we see the opening up of eastern Europe, the competition for capital for major projects will be more and more difficult. If Australia is going to be able to attract capital for infrastructure projects, then our construction capability is going to have to be more internationally competitive. That is the aim of the Construction Industry Reform and Development Bill. It is about making the Australian construction industry once more internationally competitive, and able to take advantage of the huge opportunities in South East Asia as it becomes more industrialised and more developed. Many companies have already taken that course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important part of this Bill is getting in place some model projects and model sites. If honourable members opposite want to know if it is an effective strategy they should ask the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife). I went down and looked at the Junee gaol project when the honourable member for Hume was present. It was being built by Thiess contractors based in Queensland. This is a unique project with strong involvement of the work force in the actual design and development of the project. The work force is trained on site, utilising the local TAFE college, and it is a fine example of a model site. There are many more. The Victorians would be aware of the excellent southern stand at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. That was constructed by John Holland Constructions when Graeme Duff was its Chief Executive Officer. Many of the principles involved in this great southern stand at the Melbourne Cricket Ground are part of this strategy here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, without delaying the House any more, I am pleased with the Government's contribution. I hope that honourable members opposite will go and talk to industry and find out what its views are and find out that this is a response by government to an industry demand. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The objectives of the Bill before the House are: firstly, to modify the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act 1987&mdash;hereinafter referred to as the ANSTO Act&mdash;so as to provide the agency with immunity from the application of State and Territory laws; secondly, to ensure that ANSTO can meet national interest requirements in respect of the control and management of radioactive materials; thirdly, to establish the formal independence of the Nuclear Safety Bureau, the NSB, from the operations of ANSTO; fourthly, to allow the principal Act to take account of ANSTO's commercial activities in regard to the Government's 1989 announcement that revenues can be retained by research agencies and not transferred to the Consolidated Revenue; and, fifthly, to put in order a number of housekeeping matters such as the terms of appointment and resignation pertaining to the director of the NSB.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will speak about some of the background to the legislation which is before the House this evening. ANSTO is the corporate successor to the Australian Atomic Energy Commission established under the Atomic Energy Act 1953. The functions of ANSTO include the undertaking of research and development in respect of nuclear science and nuclear technology, and the provision and sale of goods and services in connection with matters related to its activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the case that, in recent years, ANSTO, as with other public sector research agencies, has modified its activities in order to align its resources and activities with commercial imperatives of various types. The Bill before the House is partially in recognition of this fact&mdash;that is, the Bill enlarges the definition of ANSTO's statutory objectives to encompass the agency's wider commercial programs which it has taken on in recent years. By so doing, the Bill also accords ANSTO crown immunity for the conduct of these more diverse programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This aspect of the Bill has been in response to other legal matters which have come to the fore in recent months. That is to say that the necessary amendments result from a decision by the New South Wales Land and Environment Court in February in which the judge ruled that ANSTO was acting in breach of the New South Wales Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979. The ruling of the court effectively prevents ANSTO from bringing to its Lucas Heights research laboratories any radioactive materials for conditioning or damaged radioactive sources for repair. The ruling also constrains ANSTO's ability to create and store radioactive substances on site as a result of its various commercial activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The court deemed these activities to be outside the principal research function ascribed to ANSTO under its Act. Therefore, ANSTO was subject to New South Wales law. More broadly, the ruling revealed and reaffirmed the advice of the Attorney-General's Department that, as a statutory body, ANSTO, did not, under its principal Act, share the immunity of the Crown from State law, particularly because it was conducting commercial and other programs which were not implied or enumerated under its original legislative charter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The action in this regard was brought by the Sutherland Shire Council. It sought to restrain ANSTO from transferring to Lucas Heights 17 cubic metres of radioactive waste held at the St Marys site of the Australian Defence Industries&mdash;the ADI&mdash;site at Penrith. The Council required ANSTO to remove from Lucas Heights some 2,000 cubic metres of radioactively contaminated soil which had been stored there following the decontamination of the former CSIRO site at Fishermans Bend in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The court orders, which I have obtained, reveal the following four issues. The first issue concerns the safety of the storage of CSIRO's soil and proposed storage of the ADI waste was not at issue. The second issue was the judge's confirmation of ANSTO's expertise in managing the waste from either the St Marys or Fishermans Bend sites. The third issue was that the decision reached by the court accorded with advice from the Attorney-General's Department that the ANSTO Act did not provide that, in all cases, ANSTO's activities were those of a Commonwealth agent and, therefore, that the agency must in certain circumstances be fully subject to the laws of the State of New South Wales. I should add that ANSTO did not attempt to defend its immunity before the court. The fourth issue was that, as a result of the decision, ANSTO must not receive any waste or radioactive materials from other sites or activities. Therefore, the court orders signal that ANSTO cannot receive the low level waste currently stored at the St Marys site, and that ANSTO must transfer the existing Fishermans Bend waste to a national repository by 5 February 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the ANSTO Act has proved deficient in achieving this end, it was always the Commonwealth's intention that ANSTO operations give respect to all New South Wales State laws regarding environmental standards and so forth while allowing ANSTO to fulfil its charter. Consequently, the amendments to the Act serve to define ANSTO's powers in respect of conditioning, managing and storing radioactive materials. The amendments before us, therefore, will place beyond doubt ANSTO's national responsibilities in these regards. The amendments also extend to radioactive substances arising from other activities conducted on the site, such as those from ANSTO's commercial operations regarding radioactive traces and medical isotopes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other amendments to the Bill, which I will mention shortly, also explicitly detail the Commonwealth's intention to ensure that ANSTO's commercial programs do not compromise its crown immunity. I would point out to the House that the Sutherland Shire has a long history of opposition to the storage of nuclear waste at the Lucas Heights research laboratories. This concern reflects the extent to which the Shire perceives the issue to conflict with its own environmental and planning laws and its own anxieties about the impact of the presence of stored nuclear waste in a region characterised by increasing residential development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, the Shire fears that, if the St Marys and Fishermans Bend wastes are both stored at the site, Lucas Heights will become a de facto national nuclear waste repository. Similarly, the Sutherland Shire Council has a concern that ANSTO's increasing commercial activities will give it cause to attract much more such waste for conditioning and management from other sources, as well as creating increased amounts of waste from other activities conducted in conjunction with the industry. As the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) appreciates, these are legitimate concerns. It should be in the Commonwealth's powers to provide the necessary information and inspire confidence in the local community that ANSTO's operations do not compromise its health or safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the New South Wales Land and Environment Court orders relevant to the decision unambiguously affirm ANSTO's capability to store and manage safely low level wastes of types existing at the St Marys site and those which are currently stored at Fishermans Bend. The court decision states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also conceded that ANSTO has special expertise and skill in handling and storing of radioactive wastes and that although radioactive wastes are stored elsewhere in Australia . . . there is no other place in Australia where such wastes can be stored as efficiently and safely as on the land at Lucas Heights under the supervision of ANSTO.</PARA>
<PARA>In the negotiations concerning the transfer of the waste from both sites, ANSTO's own Safety Assessment Committee, as well as the New South Wales Radiation Advisory Council, endorsed the transfers and agreed that they involved minimal risks. The judge also found that ANSTO had kept the Sutherland Shire Council informed of all its planning and intentions in this regard. In effect, the legislation before the House ascribes a broad range of activities for which ANSTO is to receive immunity against State laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 5(1) of the Bill inserts into part II of section 7 of the principal Act four new subsections which provide for exemptions from various State and Territory laws. The first two of these subsections specify the areas of ANSTO's activities which are exempt from the application of State and Territory laws. These broadly defined activities, as outlined in proposed section 7A, subsections (1) and (2), comprise the following matters: the organisation itself; the organisation's property and transactions; or anything done by or on behalf of the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The immunity also extends to ANSTO's commercial activities. The Bill, therefore, also embraces such areas as companies in which ANSTO has a controlling or other interest. The Bill extends immunity to any company, the company's property or transactions, or anything done by or on behalf of the relevant company which is associated in some formal way with ANSTO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsection (3) of proposed section 7A specifies several general categories or classes of State and Territory laws to which ANSTO's operations, as specified in the two earlier subsections, do not apply. They are the use or proposed use of land or premises; the environmental consequences of the use of land or premises; radioactive materials or dangerous goods; or licensing in relation to employment, carrying on a particular kind of business undertaking or conducting a particular kind of operation. As a result of the new subsection 7A(4) proposed in the Bill before the House, the Commonwealth will be able to act through regulations to prescribe any laws within the classes of laws as defined in section 7A(3) to which ANSTO might be subject at some future time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition parties consider that ANSTO should be guaranteed the ability under statute to carry out its prescribed activities in the ways which best serve the national interest. Despite this, I must stress that in matters such as those in which ANSTO is active, every conceivable effort must be made to keep the community abreast of developments and confident that its health and safety interests will not be taken for granted or forsaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The grant of immunity before State laws, as provided in the Bill, also carries with it a very serious responsibility on the part of the Commonwealth, and ANSTO itself, to deal openly and honestly with the wider community. I know well that the organisation itself has made a systematic attempt in recent years to break down the barriers to the wider community and to become a part of that community itself. Its series of open days and the access it provides to New South Wales school students are examples of the kind of activity which often goes unnoticed by the Parliament. These efforts must continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth must be active, too. The Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce advises me that the Sutherland Shire has been reassured in these matters. I am uncertain as to the scope of these</PARA>
<PARA>negotiations. The issues, however, are too important for the Commonwealth not to put the legwork into building bridges, in creating a climate of confidence in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering the merits of the Bill, the following matters need to be kept in mind. First, on the advice of the relevant safety authorities and the Minister, storage of the relevant low-level nuclear wastes does not put public safety at risk. Secondly, there are advantages in the legislation in so far as it provides for public health and safety. The Government advises that if the court orders as mentioned earlier are accepted, ANSTO will not be able to bring radioactive substances to Lucas Heights for conditioning or for purposes of repairing damaged radioactive sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of damage to radioactive sources, if a package containing radioactive isotopes for industrial or medical use were to be damaged in transit, it would not be able to be transferred to the Lucas Heights Research Laboratories' hot cell for repair. As a consequence of this, the damaged radioactive source could not be repaired, period, as similar facilities and services do not exist anywhere else in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hitherto, ANSTO has strictly abided by all New South Wales environmental and pollution laws, and the Minister has made explicit public assurances that this will continue. ANSTO has an impressive track record in this regard and more should be made of its commitments to maintaining the highest level of environmental monitoring and assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation will also strengthen the independence of the Nuclear Safety Bureau, a move which will give cause for the community to have even greater confidence that the operation of the nuclear plant itself&mdash;the HIFAR and MOATA reactors&mdash;is in safe hands, free from even the vaguest form of interference from other interests. The amendments to the ANSTO Act establish the Nuclear Safety Bureau, which is now responsible to the Minister for monitoring and reviewing the safety of the nuclear plant operated by ANSTO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NSB is empowered to impose conditions or restrictions on the operation of the nuclear plant. However, ANSTO itself appoints the staff of the NSB and theoretically may assign the NSB other functions as it sees fit. This is a far cry from the existing arrangements, whereby the NSB acts virtually through the Board of ANSTO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, the coalition has called for a review of the structure of this arrangement for fear that the public might not perceive the NSB as acting in a disinterested manner in respect of the operation of the research reactors, especially in times of union disruption over alleged safety issues. There is no prima facie evidence of any sort that the NSB has compromised its role in this regard. The legislation, nevertheless, concedes the importance of the coalition's stated position and moves to establish the NSB as a distinct, separate and independent body from ANSTO. The financial impact&mdash;no doubt of interest to honourable members&mdash;will be $150,000 to meet the added administrative costs of operating an independent NSB. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has confirmed publicly that the Lucas Heights research laboratories will not become a de facto national radioactive waste repository. The Government has underpinned the amendments with public commitments to provide for the establishment of a national nuclear waste repository as soon as is practicable. This is the only fundamental solution to the problem at hand&mdash;that is, the safest and most effective means by which Australia can store and manage its various types of nuclear waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has endorsed the importance of giving consideration to the role of such a facility or facilities. Any reasonable progress which can be made in developing Commonwealth and State understandings in respect of the importance of overcoming the storage issue should be endorsed. Again, it is important in this matter that the Government act to build up a spirit of common cause and community confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his second reading speech, the Minister claimed the Department of Primary Industries and Energy was active in working on arrangements which would facilitate progress towards a national nuclear waste repository. This will be no easy task. As we have witnessed in respect of moves to create an intractable waste disposal and storage capability, there is a great deal of community anxiety embedded in these complex issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the Government's claimed intention to assure the Sutherland Shire community that it has no intention of making the Lucas Heights laboratories the site for a storage of nuclear wastes, i<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>t has moved to order a full investigation of the technical, legal and other issues concerning the conditioning, management and interim storage of the ADI and Fishermans Bend wastes, and has called for a report by December 1992 identifying all practicable options. These processes are important for the community dialogue they create, as they are, too, for their ultimate findings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also bears on certain administrative matters. The legislation also incorporates various housekeeping matters in regard to the employment conditions of the Executive Director of ANSTO, the lifting of the value of contracts which ANSTO may enter into without ministerial approval from $200,000 to $1m, the repeal of the legislative requirement that ANSTO transfer its external earnings to Consolidated Revenue in line with the Government's 1989 announcements, and the repeal of the intention under the Act to establish an advisory council to advise on and audit ANSTO's operations. This role is now carried out by several other internal and independent bodies, such as the program advisory committees of external experts. These are not considered controversial matters by the coalition parties. The Opposition therefore supports the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to rise in support of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Amendment Bill, which will amend the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act of 1987. Ever since Dr Oppenheimer discovered the explosive capacity which can be generated by the process of nuclear fusion almost 50 years ago, there have been many who have urged the ending of all research into nuclear power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it should be recognised that there are many different ways in which our current nuclear science and technology can be used for peaceful purposes. In order to encourage the peaceful use of nuclear technology, the Federal Government legislated in 1987 to revise the role and change the name of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission to the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, ANSTO. This new legislation is necessary to ensure the Government's commercialisation objectives for ANSTO are fulfilled and to adapt the role of the organisation for changing circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has been of the opinion that for research institutions to meet their full potential they have to open themselves up to the competitive environment of private enterprise through adopting a more corporate outlook. ANSTO can feel satisfied with the progress it has made in achieving this objective. It reached its target of financing 30 per cent of its budget through its commercial activities two years ahead of schedule, in the 1990-91 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ability of ANSTO to achieve its corporatisation objectives has been constrained by the original ANSTO Act, making the amendments which are before the House tonight very necessary. These changes to the legislative framework will ensure that ANSTO has the ability to carry out fully the commercialisation of its activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another change that will occur as a result of the legislation is in regard to the immunity of ANSTO from certain State and Territory laws. Determining the extent to which ANSTO, as a Commonwealth authority which is situated entirely within the borders of New South Wales, is subject to New South Wales law has been somewhat of a problem. Historically, the policy of Federal governments of all political persuasions has been that any bodies under its control operate under State laws where there is no existing Commonwealth law. Advice from the Department of the Attorney-General that ANSTO may be fully subject to New South Wales State law has made changes to the Act necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth never intended ANSTO to be subject to State law, and it is important that this issue be addressed as it reduces the organisation's ability to function effectively and could even result in safety problems which are obviously unacceptable when nuclear technology is being used. To address this problem, ANSTO will be made immune from certain State and Territory laws. These amendments will be retrospective on the advice of the Department of the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of change is in relation to the Nuclear Safety Bureau. A national safety bureau was established under the 1987 legislation in order to monitor the safety of nuclear plants operated by the organisation. This bureau, which is responsible to the Minister, has its staff appointed by the ANSTO board. Even though the NSB is completely independent of ANSTO in practice, the manner in which the Act was structured left this independence open to question. The new restructured Nuclear Safety Bureau will be funded independently of ANSTO, ensuring that the integrity of its work is beyond question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several other administrative matters will be tidied up through the passing of this legislation. ANSTO will now have the ability to enter into contracts of up to $1m without having to receive approval from the Minister for Science and Technology, ensuring that its decisions are more commercially orientated. That is not saying that the Minister would not be commercially orientated anyway, but just the same I think it is worth making the comment for the present Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free). Some additional costs of around $150,000 will result from these changes in the short term, as increased costs will be associated with separating the two organisations in the manner I described earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the section of the Bill relating to radioactive materials and waste. The Minister knows I have a bit of an interest in that area. How we as a community deal with problems associated with radioactive materials and waste is an issue of great concern to many of the constituents in my electorate of Oxley, particularly in the Esk area. The Esk area is currently in the electorate of Oxley, but with the Federal redistribution the new seat of Dickson is being formed and the Esk area will actually go into that seat, which my colleague the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) will become the member for after the next Federal election.<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS> The honourable member for Fisher has taken a very keen interest in that area, of course, and just recently he actually visited the area, along with the Minister for Science and Technology, who is in the chamber this evening.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANSTO&mdash;and its predecessor, the Australian Atomic Energy Commission&mdash;has been involved in the management of radioactive waste materials generated by itself and other organisations for many years. Its ability to carry out such a task was recently challenged in the New South Wales Land and Environment Court when the Sutherland Shire Council sought a restraining order to stop the transfer of radioactive waste from the St Mary's site of Australian Defence Industries to the Lucas Heights Research Laboratories. ANSTO had planned to store these waste products at Lucas Heights until a national repository for radioactive waste material could be built. A court decision in February this year found in the council's favour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANSTO was restrained from transferring any waste from the ADI site and was ordered to remove the existing waste within three years. This was in spite of the fact that Lucas Heights was found by the judge to be the safest site in Australia for the storage of radioactive waste products. This decision has the unfortunate consequence of preventing ANSTO from carrying out services which are necessary in the interests of public health and safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Radioactive waste is generated in several ways, including medical research and treatment, and it is important that an effective method of waste storage be maintained. The amendments to the 1987 Act in relation to this matter will ensure that ANSTO has the ability to store and manage radioactive materials and waste from its activities or companies in which the organisation has a controlling interest. These amendments are not intended to circumvent the decision of the New South Wales Land and Environment Court and ANSTO will abide by its ruling by removing the waste from the Lucas Heights site by February 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Environment Court decision has led to an increase in the level of community awareness of the need for a national repository for low level radioactive waste. I am particularly pleased that this item has at least been put on the main agenda. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has been seeking the cooperation of the State governments in investigating possible sites, and this has been going on for some time. A report is in the process of being prepared at present to investigate the issues surrounding the conditioning, interim storage and management of the ADI and CSIRO wastes. The Government does not intend allowing the Lucas Heights Research Laboratories to become a national waste repository. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, the debate over the need for such a national facility is of great interest to the people of the Esk Shire particularly, a community which is currently in my electorate but which, as I said before, will be moving into the new Federal electorate of Dickson. I recall that the Minister and the honourable member for Fisher visited there with me recently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland Government's decision in February of this year to build a storage facility for used radioactive materials in a State forest outside of Esk, just north-west of Ipswich, has understandably led to a considerable degree of community concern. This move follows the State Government's repeal of a decision of the previous National Party Government in Queensland to establish a similar facility in Redbank, which is also within my electorate of Oxley. We seem to attract radioactive waste; I do not know why. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This project resulted in a massive campaign by local residents and the broader community including, of course, local politicians from all levels of government&mdash;including myself and the now Premier as well. The impact of this is that it certainly helped the Goss Government to be elected in December 1989. The State Government is, of course, to be applauded for listening to these community concerns. It faced the matter head on and really solved the problem for the people of Redbank. But it is rather difficult to understand how the State Government now can continue to ignore the concerns of the people of Esk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one can deny that the State Government has a problem with the storage of radioactive waste and needs to establish a facility somewhere in Queensland, even if there is to be a transit collection point for a national facility. The problem has existed for many years and it was neglected by the previous National Party Government. It is another one of those big problems that the Labor Government in Queensland now has to tidy up. But radioactive substances are a fact of everyday life probably in most States, so there is an undoubted need for a store for the State's radioactive waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland radioactive waste is presently being stored in unsupervised stores all over the State. The State Government has correctly recognised that it must act in this issue to prevent what could become a major threat to public health and safety. The people of Esk are understandably very concerned that this facility is to be placed in their area, which is a centre of beef and vegetable production. When the Minister for Science and Technology recently visited the area with the honourable member for Fisher and me, I am sure that while speaking to the local residents he got the message loud and clear that they certainly do not want this facility in their backyard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a danger that consumers will shy away from buying produce from the area if they know it is also the site for a radioactive storage facility, even though it is low radioactive waste. I have made my view quite clear on this issue to both the Queensland Premier and the Queensland health Minister at every available opportunity. I am pleased that my colleague the honourable member for Fisher has been supporting me in this and has also made his views known to the people in the Esk area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some would say that it is just an example of the NIMBY mentality, the `not in my backyard' mentality, which is prevalent throughout Australian society. However, anyone who makes such remarks is clearly unfamiliar with the area surrounding the Esk case. Esk is in the centre of south-east Queensland, an area which all social planners agree is the fastest growing area in Australia. This decision flies in the face of the State Government's commitment to the development of south-east Queensland as a residential and tourist area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it difficult to understand how the building of a radioactive storage facility not far from the residential housing in the township of Esk can be justified by the Government in the light of its commitment to this process of development. Apart from the important social issues related to siting a radioactive storage facility in such an attractive and pleasant town, there are several issues relating to matters of public health and safety which need to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One area of grave concern relates to the fact that the transport route to the Esk State forest, where the facility is to be sited, is in the water catchment area of the Wivenhoe Dam. Of course, the Wivenhoe Dam is the major source of water resources of south-east Queensland, including particularly the city of Brisbane. If an accident should happen at this radioactive waste facility, radioactive material could seep into the watertable, and there is a danger that this watercourse could be contaminated. The risks associated with the transport of waste to the site is also an issue which has not been properly addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early stages there was talk that the route to the site for vehicles transporting the waste would be across the wall of the Wivenhoe Dam, the main Brisbane Valley Highway. However, the Government has since made it clear that these vehicles would be travelling by a different route. The waste will now be transported through Ipswich, up the Warrego Highway towards Gatton and then along the Gatton-Esk road until it reaches the township of Esk. When the transport vehicles get to Esk, they will go past a couple of schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously this would have grave consequences for public health in the area and, one would think, would be grounds enough for a rethink by the State Government of its decision. While it is laudable that the Government is concerned to attempt to avoid travelling too near the Wivenhoe Dam, unfortunately it has overlooked the fact that the preferred route has three creek crossings, each of which is part of the Wivenhoe Dam catchment area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a risk event is of sufficient concern to discard the original route, surely the risks of contamination associated with the revised routes mean they are also unacceptable. Indeed, it could be said that the transport of the initial mass and, subsequently, of the fortnightly load of radioactive waste is the greatest potential source of hazard to human life and health associated with this proposal. As the submission on the proposed radioactive waste storage facility to the State health Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The hazard follows from the use of road transport and the consequent risk of accident especially involving the incineration of the packaging and contaminants being released as a lethal dose to any person or group it touches.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The potential for long term illness or `unconnected' later death when a larger number of people receive a sub-lethal dose, has not yet been disclosed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The driver of the transport vehicle receives a measurable dose in the normal duration of the trip, even if no container is crushed or burned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It follows that distance is the factor which principally governs the level of transport risk.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously the road transport over such long distances to the site of the facility in such an area is impractical and dangerous. The incidence of rail accidents is substantially smaller than that associated with roads. The nature, size and strength of rail rolling stock favours it in instances of level crossing accidents with road vehicles. The likelihood of a railcar incineration is very small compared with a road accident risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rail transport offers the least risk for transfer of wastes to a national disposal facility when it is finally established. Presently there is not a satisfactory rail system which serves Esk, making it difficult for the site to fulfil any role as a transit point to a national facility when it is built. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One safety issue which has received little attention has been the recent escalation in the potential for terrorist style attacks on sensitive facilities. A radioactive waste storage facility, such as this one, which is remotely located and visited only fortnightly, would provide a real target for such an attack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to turn to the economic problems associated with the Esk site which I referred to earlier. Adverse publicity and association of a product or district with a health risk has the potential to destroy the marketability of the district's products. In accordance with regulations, fruit and vegetables produced in the region are clearly marked `Esk' and these products have always enjoyed a reputation of quality and purity. For instance, Esk is the State's top producer of watermelons. In fact, there is a watermelon festival at a nearby town of Coominya in about January every year. Vegetable growers in the district are now under a cloud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, beef production is the major pastoral activity in the Esk shire. As the Esk shire's submission on the radioactive storage facility points out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The beef produced creates export income for Queensland and Australia through the Korean, American and Japanese markets which are highly sensitive to quality and totally averse to contamination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently there is a push by U.S. meat exporters for an increased share of the Japanese market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any hint of radioactive waste being associated with Esk beef . . . will be an opportunity for U.S. interests to damage the reputation of not only Esk beef but also the Australian beef industry.</PARA>
<PARA>The siting of a radioactive storage facility in the area has the potential to damage beef's reputation not only in its domestic marketing but also in its international marketing. This would cost Australia and the users of the Kilcoy meatworks, located not far from Esk, and the people of Esk considerable income. This decision is regrettable, especially in the light of the fact that another potential site, Beerburrum, has been discarded as a site because of potential damage to the reputation of the region's products. That, of course, was the right decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all of this it has to be remembered that the decision as to where to establish a storage facility is one ultimately for the State Government and is beyond the jurisdiction of the Federal Government. That point needs to be emphasised. State government does have responsibilities in this area and, in this particular case, it certainly has to address this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have corresponded with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, making my views on this matter quite clear. While I have been in this place, I have been in constant contact with Ministers holding that portfolio concerning the situation at Redbank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for a national facility has been a matter of debate for much of the past decade. Despite discussions between the Federal Government, States and Territories, and despite the best efforts of Ministers of the Federal Government, little has happened to promote the building of such a facility. Unfortunately, State governments as yet have not come up with a suitable site for a national storage facility, making planning of such a facility extremely difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the time is long overdue for the Government to construct a national facility;  however, a more cooperative attitude from the States is needed to get this project off the ground. It is important for the people of Esk and for the people of south-east Queensland that action on this matter occur immediately. The establishment of a national facility for radioactive waste will not overcome the need for State governments to maintain their own storage facilities, to collect waste before it can be transported to the national facility. It should be necessary, as envisaged, that the national facility will be open only periodically during the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill tonight, particularly on behalf of those people in the Esk area and to point out the concerns that they have when it comes to the storage of radioactive waste. I hope that the State Government will have its officers take another close look at this question of radioactive waste because it is one of considerable concern not just for the people of Esk and all those in the south-east corner but for the nation. All State governments probably are not doing the right thing in handling the matter of the storage of radioactive waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose this Bill does highlight the need for government at all levels to address this very serious problem of the storage of waste, if little else. I know there are other aspects of the Bill, but I wanted to take the opportunity to highlight that particular point this evening.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the House has already been informed, the Opposition will not be opposing this Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Amendment Bill. Of course, what has really triggered it, as I think most of us understand, is that on 5 February this year the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales ordered that ANSTO be restrained from bringing radioactive waste from elsewhere onto its site at Lucas Heights for storage and that radioactive soil already brought from Victoria be removed within three years or upon establishment of a national low level radioactive waste repository. The case had been brought by the Shire of Sutherland in response to the recent arrival of 2,000 cubic metres of contaminated Victorian soil which was of CSIRO origin and in opposition to ANSTO's plans for storing 17 cubic metres of radioactive wastes from the Australian Defence Industries site at St Marys in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commendably, the Commonwealth has responded quickly to this court defeat by introducing this Bill which amongst other things seeks to render ANSTO immune from further New South Wales court orders similar to the one I just mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One reason for the Bill is that, because of the present lack of an acceptable site or sites, no national radioactive waste repository is expected to be operating for several years at least and as a consequence the Commonwealth wishes to be free to store its own and possibly other people's radioactive wastes at Lucas Heights as a temporary measure. Also, the Radiation Health Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council has completed and made available for public comment a draft code of practice and associated draft guidelines for the near surface disposal of radioactive waste in Australia. This code has been long in the making and is needed in an appropriate final form before any progress can be made, as I understand it, on siting a waste repository or repositories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support the legislation but I will make some remarks tonight about the more general subject in terms of the urgent need for permanent, safe acceptable sites and methods for radioactive waste disposal. The nature of the problem needs to be looked at first of all because not all radioactive waste is of the same dangerous level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definitions of radioactive waste are somewhat loose but there are basically four tiers. The first is very low level waste, which means radioactive waste which is of such low strength or `activity' and of sufficiently short half-life that disposal by the controlled release into the environment is permissible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second tier is low level waste mainly consisting of material of low activity and short half-life&mdash;by which we mean 30 years or less&mdash;which does not have to be specifically shielded while being handled and which contains only small amounts, if any, of long-lived alpha emitters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third tier is medium or intermediate level waste which contains higher activity material which requires shielding but not cooling during handling. Finally, there is high level radioactive waste which is of high or very high activity&mdash;in other words, spent fuel rods from nuclear reactors&mdash;and requires substantial shielding and cooling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia holds radioactive wastes of all these types. For example, very low level waste consists typically of hospital residues of half-life less than five years, which includes radioisotopes used for measuring body functions&mdash;not those used, I might add, for treating cancers&mdash;and very low activity research isotopes from universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Low level materials make up the majority by volume of the remainder of Australia's radioactive waste. They consist of contaminated clothing, packaging, equipment, soil, mining wastes and so on. There is a significant proportion of medium level wastes consisting of spent radiotherapy sources, other spent sources such as level and moisture gauges, smoke detectors, radiography sources, liquids of various types, spent ion exchange resins and an unusually large proportion of radium 226, a long-lived alpha emitter which gives rise to radon, a gas, and its decay products which are the principal agents of lung cancer in uranium miners. The half-life of radium 226 is 1,600 years, so we are not talking about a short term problem. Most of the radium is present in older wastes made up of luminous paint, luminous watches, contaminated articles and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's high level wastes consist of spent reactor fuel, in particular the 1,500 or so spent fuel rods from ANSTO's main reactor. These are now stored in concrete in underground pits and are expected to be reprocessed in the United States for recovery of fissionable uranium or plutonium. But the United States may well require Australia to take back the highly radioactive wastes resulting from reprocessing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is estimated that about 90 per cent by volume of all radioactive wastes in Australia have arisen from Commonwealth activities and are stored at Commonwealth facilities such as Lucas Heights. This does not include wastes from uranium mining which are covered under a separate code of practice. Of the Commonwealth wastes, Lucas Heights is storing more than 3,000 cubic metres, while defence establishments hold approximately 250 cubic metres. About 60 to 70 cubic metres are generated in Australia each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Relative to other countries which use nuclear power and/or manufacture nuclear weapons, Australia puts out quite small volumes of waste. Britain, for example, generates a staggering 40,000 cubic metres per year of low level waste alone. France accumulates 30,000 cubic metres of such waste, the United States has hundreds of thousands of cubic metres awaiting disposal, while Japan is storing over one million drums of processed low level waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present there are no facilities for final disposal of radioactive wastes in Australia, although the Western Australian Government has chosen a remote area for disposal of State wastes only. Nearly all of the 3,400 cubic metres or so of Australian stored radioactive wastes are therefore awaiting final disposal pending the location and development of an acceptable disposal site. There have been a number of problems in finding disposal sites, as the previous speaker mentioned. For example, in early 1978 the New South Wales Government began planning to remove about 3,000 tonnes of radioactive soil from Hunters Hill in Sydney to a remote rural site in order to decontaminate six house blocks. Although a disposal site at a disused gypsum mine was selected, word of the proposal spread quickly among the local Aboriginal people, graziers, local councillors and so on who all banded together and successfully lobbied against it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The then Premier of New South Wales then applied to South Australia to have the New South Wales waste accepted at Radium Hill, an old uranium mine. However, because of public and union opposition, the then South Australian Premier turned down the request. It is interesting to note that all of the Hunters Hill material is still located in situ. In March 1983 a fire narrowly missed the Melbourne office building in whose basement radioactive waste had been stored since 1976. Of course, this only added to the concerns of public servants who were working nearby and those worried about the inadequate containers being used. Some of those containers were in fact old paint tins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In resolving to relocate the wastes to a storage site outside of Melbourne, the Government in late 1985 chose a place called Dutson Downs near Sale over five other country sites. However, much local concern was generated for various reasons, including the presence of a nearby Royal Australian Air Force bombing range. Unions, local government and others were prominent in opposition. By February 1986 the decision to go ahead with that site was reversed after it was revealed that the State Government had been wrong on facts about the use of the bombing range. The waste is still located in government offices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australia, Tasmania and, as we have heard from the previous speaker, Queensland also have histories of difficulties with radioactive waste storage. In examining the breadth of interest groups and the arguments which have led to difficulties in siting these disposal sites, it is important to make the point, and it should be noted very carefully, that opposition is by no means restricted to greenie groups. The common rallying cry is much more likely to be `not in my backyard', as the previous speaker said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why are people so opposed to low level radioactive waste? Of course, there are a number of reasons: fear of radiation as invisible, scary and hard to understand; awareness of past disastrous accidents involving radiation, for example, Chernobyl; concern over the long half-life of some wastes; concern over a possible fall in property values near a disposal site; fear that a `temporary store' or State disposal site will become the national or permanent repository. Another reason may be that the very isolation of a rural site may lead to eventual entry by vandals, or conversely the site may be too close to housing, food production, tourism opportunities, and so on. There is also perhaps the belief that the wastes have arisen from the nuclear industry, nuclear energy or nuclear weapons production and the like, rather than from medicine, research and ordinary industry. The opposition may stem from radioactive wastes being brought a long distance from their source, from interstate or from overseas. People ask why it has to be sent so far away and feel that it must be particularly dangerous if it has to be sent so far away. There are also concerns about the transportation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The various objections are mostly rational. They are shared by a number of interest groups&mdash;property owners, Aboriginal people, industry, local government, and so on, and they can be expected to surface on each occasion that a new disposal site is canvassed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Partly in response to a 1975 NHMRC recommendation for a central repository for a longer lived radioactive wastes site, a Commonwealth-State consultative committee was set up as long ago as 1980 in order to coordinate policies. So we have been at it for some time. The present position is, unfortunately, that New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory have all refused to allow a national radioactive waste repository within their boundaries. Western Australia's position is not known in terms of the national situation, but its interest is very doubtful since it has set up the only radioactive waste disposal site in Australia at Mount Walton, a remote spot 130 kilometres north-west of Coolgardie. The first wastes will not be received until later this year but, significantly, the site is intended for State use only. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The political problems connected with radioactive waste disposal appear to have been underestimated generally and the parties have clearly reached a stalemate. Unfortunately, Australia has no clear guide from overseas as to the best method of disposal. Countries are using a variety of methods ranging from compacted earth trenches to vast underground caverns for their low level radioactive wastes. Inexplicably, there is no hard and fast international recommendation on disposal from, say, the International Atomic Energy Agency, which does not even define waste categories or acceptance criteria in its Safety Series publications. The national choice of methodology thus devolves to matters of cost, climate perhaps&mdash;is it wet or dry?&mdash;the degree of opposition to disposal, the volume of national wastes, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, a draft code of practice for the near surface&mdash;by that, of course, we mean shallow ground&mdash;disposal of radioactive waste in Australia and draft guidelines on classification and disposal have been released for public comment. The code applies to medical, industrial and research wastes, contaminated materials and radioactive wastes arising from the processing of minerals but not to very low level wastes or uranium mining residue. Calculations on the safety of waste disposal have been based on limiting radiation exposure of site workers and members of the public according to current international recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Key points in the draft code and guidelines are that the disposal site or sites should preferably be located in arid areas of low population and institutional controls over each site should last for 200 years. I have to say that I believe these propositions are questionable over such a long time span with climate change and various other factors. The aridity of an area cannot be guaranteed; there may not always be a low population, of course, depending on developments; and institutional controls will change over a long period. So even 200 years really is only at the beginning of the end of the scale in terms of the periods that we need to talk about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a mining nation of importance, Australia may already possess disused mines which could accept large volumes of these types of wastes. The Australian decision to place virtually all of its radioactive wastes in shallow trenches dates back 10 years, or more than 10 years in some cases, when more thorough isolation of low and medium level radioactive wastes deep underground was rarely considered overseas. We just followed the overseas model and put them near the surface. The possibility of separating long lived alpha emitters from low level radioactive waste deserves perhaps more consideration. If adopted, public acceptability of permanent disposal might be considerably improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that Australia's radioactive wastes are being temporarily stored at Lucas Heights and at dozens of other locations because there is no national repository for final disposal of the wastes. Since many of the present storage sites containing inadequately packaged wastes are located in urban areas and are almost full, the search for possible repository sites is becoming very urgent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding the present stalemate over siting, it is clear that each State and Territory does not wish to accept nationally generated radioactive waste. Even relocating internally generated waste has been difficult or unsuccessful, yet Australia is an arid continent of low population, large size and relatively stable geology and it should be, in many senses, more favoured than most countries in terms of its disposal options. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One possible solution to the siting dilemma perhaps is waste disposal on Commonwealth controlled or acquired land. This would be appropriate as most of the existing stored wastes are in fact of Commonwealth origin. If no Commonwealth land is suitable, the States and Territories should be encouraged, I suggest, to find their own sites, following the example of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I submit there needs to be a more serious study of public objections to siting attempts with a view to overcoming at least some of them. Although communities will never be enthusiastic over radioactive waste disposal near them, they could perhaps be reassured in a number of ways. We might, for example, think about Australia's stock and generation of radioactive waste, making the point to them that it is tiny by world standards, and is likely to remain so. Separation of long-life wastes for deep underground disposal may be an option. State or Territory sites would not necessarily accept interstate or overseas wastes. There would be strict limits on the life of each disposal site, plus careful monitoring. Australia's radioactive wastes are either of historical origin or are generated from socially useful activities, not including nuclear power. Substantial financial and other incentives may be offered to local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, if the Australian States and Territories, apart from Western Australia, of course, continue to oppose a national site within their borders and if they do not agree<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS> to establish their own facilities, the responsibility for dealing with this problem&mdash;it cannot just be left up in the air&mdash;is clearly with the Government. It should get on with the job&mdash;not just react when some immediate problem crops up, as has happened with the Lucas Heights site&mdash;and sort it out so we will not need to find ourselves in this panic reaction mode that we are in today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight in support of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Amendment Bill. However, I must say that in researching this speech I found the issues arising from the Bill to be more complex than was at first obvious. I am pleased that when the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), who is now in the chair, and the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), made their speeches, they agreed that what arises from this particular amendment Bill is the urgent need for the establishment of a national, low level, radioactive waste repository which many believe should be the priority of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, as we realise, no nuclear industry as such in Australia. However, radioactive waste is produced as a result of research activities and the manufacturing of medical products from ores such as uranium and thorium. While this research and these products are beneficial to our Australian community, the waste resulting from them is not. For example, a large volume of uranium and thorium ores were mined at Fishermans Bend in Victoria between 1941 and 1965. The waste disposal practices of that operation, however, would not have been considered safe by today's standards. Consequently, over many years there has been a long process of contamination spreading throughout that particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This problem of radioactive contamination was recognised in 1989 and was addressed by having the worst contaminated part of that area&mdash;predominantly the soil&mdash;transferred to the Lucas Heights Research Laboratories of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation. It was stored there for treatment. In an article written in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> at the time of that waste discovery, it was reported that the radioactivity on the Fishermans Bend site was 50 times above acceptable levels for the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The largest contaminated deposit found in the area covered about 400 square metres, which meant that about 500 tonnes of contaminated soil and waste product were under it. The news report of the day also stated that an unknown quantity of radioactivity had escaped from the site into the environment and was uncontrolled in its dispersal about the property. The article said that a government report found that `radioactivity had passed through the water drainage system and was present there'. According to that report, there had been no signs found on the property to indicate that it was radioactive and no documentation existed about that particular problem. It also stated that the site had been used by the CSIRO for research projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can we be positive that the research projects being carried out today by ANSTO are so well documented and so safely executed that there will be no danger at all for future generations? Perhaps the CSIRO at the time thought it was taking all precautions necessary, and look what resulted from that. Although most of the radioactive waste stored at Lucas Heights is said to be relatively harmless, there is always a possibility, I believe, of an extreme example of a waste storage problem occurring. Among the waste presently stored at Lucas Heights is 17 cubic metres of solid low level radioactive wastes which consist of luminescent dial watches, compasses and buttons, thermionic valves and shield radium sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Radium, as has been stated here tonight, is the most dangerous nuclear substance. It has a very long half-life and is therefore going to be radioactive for thousands of years. Radium emits radon, a radioactive gas which contains particles that, when breathed in, causes lung cancer. These radium solids are stored in concrete and then in a drum at ANSTO. However, the radon gas can still leak through. Consequently, I have been informed that people who are living and working in that area are theoretically more exposed to radon gas and, therefore, may be more susceptible to contracting lung cancer. It is greatly ironic that products that are made from nuclear ores can help save the lives of our people suffering from cancer, yet the waste from the manufacturing of these products can cause cancer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February this year, Mr Justice Cripps of the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales ruled that ANSTO must remove the Fishermans Bend waste from Lucas Heights and no longer be allowed to store waste from the St Marys Australian Defence Industry Munitions Filling factory. This court order followed a legal battle between ANSTO and the Sutherland Shire Council over the storage and conditioning of radioactive waste at ANSTO's Lucas Heights research laboratories. The Council sought an order from the court restraining ANSTO from continuing to use the land at Lucas Heights for the purpose of storing radioactive waste. As a result of this court case, and according to the amendments contained in this Bill, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation is to become immune to specific classes of State and Territory laws and regulations which it is currently fully subject to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANSTO Amendment Bill allows for the Fishermans Bend waste to be removed by the deadline of the court order. However, the Bill also allows for ANSTO to have immunity from certain State and Territory laws, essentially so that a court order such as the one mentioned cannot be passed on ANSTO again. It was found in the process of this court hearing that the land at Lucas Heights was under the authority at the time of the Council and, as such, it could only be used as a research station subject to conditions which may be imposed by the Council. According to the record of the hearing of Justice Cripps, the Council's consent was necessary if ANSTO intended to use the land for any purpose incidental or subsidiary to a research station, or if it was to be used for roads or utility installations. Use of the land for all other purposes is at this time, I understand, still prohibited. During the court hearing ANSTO was also forced to concede that to store radioactive waste for commercial gain was outside its legislative charter. According to Justice Cripps:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear that the Council has always opposed the use of the facility at Lucas Heights for the storage of low level nuclear wastes. However, it believed until about the middle of 1991 that, at law, it was not able to take any action to prevent it.</PARA>
<PARA>Justice Cripps also stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there are no difficulties known to ANSTO in the management of the interim storage of the (radioactive waste) although . . . ANSTO itself acknowledges that there is always a possibility that the material might be spilled in certain circumstances such as in times of heavy rain with the result that contaminated material could escape.</PARA>
<PARA>Although it was accepted by the court that the radioactive waste had to be stored somewhere, Justice Cripps also noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . all relevant Ministers (Commonwealth and State) consider that the national repository be established as quickly as possible provided it is not established in the territory of their responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA>Justice Cripps concluded that as the court could not order any landowner in New South Wales to accept the waste that must be removed from Lucas Heights, a political solution would have to be found and the problem would have to be addressed. This Bill, therefore, allows for ANSTO to include in its functions the conditioning, storage and management of radioactive materials and radioactive waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Bill provides for ANSTO to follow the court orders placed on it by Justice Cripps on 5 February this year&mdash;that is, not to accept any radioactive waste from the Australian Defence Industry at St Marys and to rid itself of the radioactive waste it is storing from Fishermans Bend within three years or when a national repository is established&mdash;it also allows for ANSTO to store other radioactive waste at Lucas Heights, if necessary, in the future, and to be immune from any further court action preventing this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this Bill allows for the problem of where to store radioactive waste in the short term until a national repository is established, it does not take into account the problem of what to do with the Fishermans Bend waste that must be removed or the radioactive waste that is already accumulating in Australia at the rate of approximately 100 cubic metres per year. Radioactive waste has been defined by the working party of the Radiation Health and Medical Research Council as `waste materials, either in solid or liquid form, either shielded or not which contain radioactive substances which are of no further current use'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The working party described the health hazard to humans of radioactive waste in its draft code of practice for the near surface disposal of radioactive waste in Australia. I am pleased that it is available for public comment until 29 May this year. In the case of the radioactive waste stored at Lucas Heights, it is considered to be a low level risk to humans by the Safety Review Committee&mdash;a body established by the ANSTO Act 1987 and which comprises six members, the majority of whom are independent of ANSTO. According to a special report by the Safety Review Committee to the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) on the management of radioactive waste at Lucas Heights research laboratories:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the risks associated with the management and storage of radioactive waste at Lucas Heights Research Laboratories are substantially lower than those commonly accepted by members of the public for a wide range of activities.</PARA>
<PARA>The report states that if appropriate precautions are taken, the presence of radioactive wastes at Lucas Heights will not present a hazard to the general public, providing that the area remains undisturbed and all future direct residential development or construction is precluded in the immediate vicinity. The Safety Review Committee seems unconcerned also about the release of gases from the radioactive wastes at Lucas Heights. Its report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Releases of gaseous effluent at current levels are estimated to provide an annual radiation dose of only one per cent of the present annual limit recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council for members of the public.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee is also satisfied that discharges of liquid effluent from the Lucas Heights research laboratories to the sewer meet the standards set under the New South Wales radioactive substances regulations and the standards for disposal of trade waste set by the Water Board, and that the effects of such discharges have been minimal. But I ask: how can we be certain that the effects of storing radioactive waste in that area continue to be safe? Can we be positive that in the future the people living in that area will not be affected in any way at all?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Committee found ANSTO's laboratories at Lucas Heights to be storing the radioactive waste safely, it also stated that there was no place established for the safe disposal of this waste and that no non-Commonwealth radioactive waste should be stored at the Lucas Heights site. If carried out, this may not make a great deal of difference to ANSTO anyway. According to a briefing paper by the Parliamentary Library's science, technology and environment research service:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is estimated that about 90% by volume of all . . . radioactive wastes in Australia have arisen from Commonwealth activities and are stored at Commonwealth facilities such as Lucas Heights.</PARA>
<PARA>The Safety Review Committee recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in the future, the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments begin . . . by identifying specific objectives and target dates for appropriate low and medium level radioactive waste repositories and that they allocate sufficient priority and resources to achieve those objectives and targets.</PARA>
<PARA>According to an article in the March 1992 edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Environment Review</EMPHASIS>, the absence of a national repository for nuclear waste is a major problem, particularly for ANSTO which has 10,000-odd drums of radioactive waste stacked under a tarpaulin in its grounds at Lucas Heights. ANSTO has to worry not only about the radioactive waste already being stored by it, but also about the waste that is continually produced as a result of its research. The report that I have referred to states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact that small stockpiles of low-level radioactive waste like these exist in spots around Australia is not the issue at stake. It is the greater problem of what to do with them. Everyone is agreed that a national radioactive waste repository is the best answer, but the (Not in My Backyard) syndrome has turned what seems a logical solution into a political nightmare.</PARA>
<PARA>As honourable members realise, ANSTO has been given three years to remove the waste it is storing from Fishermans Bend but, according to Dr David Cook, the Executive Director of ANSTO, there is nowhere for it to go. Dr Cook is reported to have said that he believes it is unlikely that a national repository will be found within three years, yet there is nowhere else for that waste to go. He is also quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The case has focused minds in the political arena on the fact that decisions, however unpalatable in the political sense, have to be made, because we are generating this kind of material.</PARA>
<PARA>According to the article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some states, like Western Australia and Queensland, are looking at establishing state repositories to store the waste, but Dr Cook believes this is short-sighted. The amount of radioactive waste that Australia produces, mostly from the use of radioisotopes in medicine and industry, is too small to warrant a multitude of storage sites.</PARA>
<PARA>According to the brief on radioactive waste disposal in Australia prepared by the science, technology and environment research service:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One reason for the Bill is that, because of the present lack of an acceptable site or sites, no national radioactive repository is expected to be operating for several years at least. As a consequence, the Commonwealth wishes to be free to store its own&mdash;and possibly other&mdash;radioactive waste at Lucas Heights as a temporary measure.</PARA>
<PARA>That briefing paper defines low level radioactive waste as mainly material of low activity with a short half-life of 30 years or less, which does not have to be specially shielded while being handled and which contains only small amounts, if any, of long-lived alpha emitters. It states that medium level waste:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . contains higher activity material which requires shielding but not cooling during handling. Long-lived alpha-emitters can be present, usually up to a set level. High level radioactive waste is of high to very high activity and requires substantial shielding and cooling.</PARA>
<PARA>According to the same brief, Australia holds radioactive waste of all of these types. However, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are at present no facilities for final disposal of radioactive waste in Australia, although Western Australia has chosen a remote area for disposal of State wastes only. Nearly all of the 3400 cubic metres or so of Australian stored radioactive wastes are therefore awaiting final disposal, pending the location and development of an acceptable disposal site or sites.</PARA>
<PARA>A number of States, including New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, have had difficulties in finding suitable storage sites for radioactive waste, again according to the science, technology and environment research service. All these States have been faced with trying to find a site to store large amounts of radioactive waste in an unexpectedly, so they stated, short time. In every case, community and local government opposition to having a storage site for nuclear waste in their backyard has been the major barrier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the briefing paper, there are many lobby groups against the storage of radioactive waste which have various objections, most of which it says are rational and can be expected to rise every time a new disposal site is suggested. The paper states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present position, as revealed in February 1992, is that NSW, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory have all refused to allow a national radioactive waste repository within their boundaries. Western Australia's position is not known, but its interest is very doubtful since it has set up the only radioactive waste disposal site in Australia . . . Significantly, the site is intended for State use only.</PARA>
<PARA>According to the same paper:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a mining nation of importance, Australia may already possess disused mines which could accept large volumes of alpha-emitting wastes. The Australian decision to place virtually all of its radioactive wastes in shallow trenches dates back ten or more years, when more thorough isolation of low and medium level radioactive wastes deep underground was rarely considered overseas . . . Since many of the present storage sites contain inadequately packaged wastes, are located in urban areas and are almost full, the search for possible repository sites is becoming urgent.</PARA>
<PARA>The issue of finding a safe site for a national radioactive waste repository, and establishing it before the final date of the particular court order comes into effect, I believe should now be of paramount importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly pleased that the Opposition is not opposing this Bill because I, like other members of parliament, have full confidence in the Minister in the adoption of the amendments to this Bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Amendment Bill 1992 does three fundamental things: firstly, it continues the expansion of the Lucas Heights facility as a storage for radioactive materials and waste; secondly, it gives the organisation immunity from State laws; and, thirdly, it expands the charter for privatisation. Fundamentally, it entrenches ANSTO for the long term future and it does it by retrospective legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On all counts, in my view, this Bill should not be passed. It sets up directions for the long term future of the nuclear industry in this country and it affects some hundreds of thousands of people who live in the Sydney area. What we really have is a knee-jerk reaction to a decision of the Land and Environment Court passed in February this year and we have a stamping on the legitimate concerns of the people of the Sutherland shire. I remind the House that the Sutherland shire has one of the largest populations of any shire in Australia. It is actually much greater than the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill should have at least gone before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts. A foolish short term decision was taken many years ago to establish Lucas Heights in what was then bushland around the Sydney area. It was totally predictable at that time that the future population growth and the urban sprawl would eventually surround the facility but that was ignored; just as what is being ignored today is the fact that the Sydney urban conurbation will extend in 30 years from north of Newcastle to south of Nowra and will consist of about seven million people. This facility is absolutely in the centre of that urban conurbation. I think that if honourable members were honest they would agree&mdash;as I am quite sure the majority of Australians would agree&mdash;that is about the last possible place to put a storage facility for nuclear waste, given all the problems that have been gone over many times in this House, such as transport of nuclear waste and the problems of terrorism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For over a decade, this House has been debating the fact that we need a national repository for waste. This Bill tells the public that we were not really serious; in fact, we are entrenching it at Lucas Heights forever. I think it is quite dishonest of any honourable member to pretend that this is only a temporary storage facility. Over recent years, there has been a constant expansion of the facility, the bringing in of nuclear waste from Victoria at Fishermans Bend and St Marys. No reasonable person, knowing that history, could not believe that Lucas Heights is now the permanent national repository for nuclear waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the privatisation and the many calls for Australia to be a repository for the world's nuclear waste, the financial incentive to expand the Lucas Heights facility is quite overwhelming. If the Government wanted to devise a method of building public hostility to Lucas Heights, it did so with this Bill. It stamps on the New South Wales planning laws, privatises the facility to create the incentive to expand it, and expands it in the Bill itself. It is no wonder that the Sutherland shire is full of rumours about the facility, and the fears are going to get greater. It is no wonder that the Sutherland <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>Shire, in support of the local community, has already spent so much money. It is now being stamped on by this House. The Sutherland Shire Environment Centre states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Court action taken by Sutherland Shire Council is the only action taken against ANSTO in 34 years of operation, and was supported by the local community. . . . this Bill is an over-reaction to the N.S.W. Land and Environment Court's decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 5 of the Bill completely destroys the rights of N.S.W., and particularly Sutherland Shire citizens to control their environment.</PARA>
<PARA>Or have any say in it for that matter. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would allow the Federal Government to build another reactor at Lucas Heights and remove the right of citizens to prevent it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would allow any type of industry to be established in the Technology Park.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would allow any type of radioactive materials and waste to be transported through the State and Sutherland Shire; and any amount of gaseous and liquid discharges could leave the site.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would allow any activity to take place on the site, e.g. enrichment or waste treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the ANSTO Act was passed in 1987 local people gained some confidence that the activities of ANSTO would be curtailed and that less secrecy would prevail. This confidence will be destroyed if the Bill is passed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If ANSTO is a Research Establishment, as it claims, it should behave like one. No other scientific establishment seeks to flout State Planning and Environment laws.</PARA>
<PARA>The truth is that none of us knows where the nuclear industry is headed. Therefore, none of us knows the future for this site. No amount of public relations exercises and smooth talking about minimal risks is going to appease the Sutherland Shire and the residents. If we want nuclear research and the associated waste dump, we have to find another site. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to identify myself to the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack). The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Amendment Bill arises out of the actions of the Sutherland Shire Council in going beyond its area of responsibility. The Commonwealth Government has an overriding responsibility to ensure that nuclear material and nuclear waste is safely stored until such time as we find a permanent repository. This legislation merely enshrines that and stops the local, often ill-informed and emotional view from taking over at the expense of the entire nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As many people have said, this Bill underlines the need for long term storage of waste in Australia. We have to look at waste in several categories. Certainly, a lot of the low level waste would be much better incinerated and reduced to ashes; in that way the volume would be reduced. While there would be a concentration of the radioactivity, there would be only a very small amount of material, which could then be safely contained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Radioactivity is such an emotional topic these days that it is very hard to get a logical debate. At Windscale some years ago there was a small leakage of alpha-emitting radiation. The leak was detected by the plant, which made efforts to send it back to the plant; there was a spillage and it escaped into the ocean. Hysteria was such that there was talk of the whole ocean becoming radioactive and there were reports that the beach was twice as radioactive as it was before. This may have been true, of course, but we are talking from a very small base. I remember pictures of people clustered on the granite rocks at the end of the beach making a wild dash across the beach into the sea and then a mad dash back across the beach rather than come in contact with the radioactivity on the beach. The joke, of course, was that the granite rocks on which they were standing were many times more radioactive than the beach itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that when we opened this Parliament House I made a point of going over it with a scintillometer. This Parliament House is about three times as radioactive as the old Parliament House. I notice that some of my colleagues on the Left who were anti-uranium did not elect to stay out of the House. I guess the attraction of the rather more splendid accommodation than that in the old one was just too hard to resist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate is ideal for the storage of high-level nuclear waste. I am very happy to have high-level nuclear waste stored in my electorate. The Western Australian Government has looked at a site in my electorate and this site is ideal for the storage of nuclear waste or chemical waste. It has all the requirements. It is a low rainfall area and it has internal draining&mdash;that is, no water runs out of the area at all. Where underground water exists&mdash;and it is very rare&mdash;it is extremely salty. When I say `extremely salty', we are talking about many hundreds of thousands of parts per million&mdash;many times saltier than the sea. This is an ideal place for the storage of waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My own view is that there should be a repository in my electorate for chemical waste and perhaps for low level waste. Such low level waste may arise, for example, from the treatment of mineral sands. I might add that this demonstrates the appalling ignorance we get on the subject of radiation. The Conservation Foundation, that group of Commonwealth-funded frauds that causes so much angst in the community, went to the State Government and said, `Look, you must stop these wicked French mining these mineral sands in Australia and taking them over to France; they are taking all our jobs with them; they will take out the thorium and they will make bombs'&mdash;which, of course, is technically possible, but economic madness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While not swallowing the thorium line, the Government thought that they were certainly taking jobs out of the country, so they said, `Yes'. The Government went and said to the wicked French, `Look, we want you to process this material in Australia; we want to keep the jobs in Australia', to which the French said, `Well, as a matter of fact we are looking to build a new plant; our plant in France at La Rochelle is running at about 110 per cent capacity; America is approaching 100 per cent capacity. We need a new one and it is either Australia or Japan; frankly, we would rather deal with Australia'. It started very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the French went down to the south of Perth to inquire about getting some land. They asked the Government what the land would be worth, and the Government said, `A ballpark figure would probably be $350,000 to $400,000', to which the French said, `Are you talking in acres or hectares?'. They had made similar inquiries about land in France. When they were assured this was for a farm, they were astounded and decided that they really had made the best decision. No sooner had they started, however, than back came the conservationists to the Government and said, `You must make these wicked French take the radioactivity with them if they process in Australia; they cannot process here and leave this wicked thorium lying around'. Their agenda, as usual, was simply to stop development. </PARA>

Despite the brave words of the Liberal Party when it was in power under Malcolm Fraser, with a total mandate, it did absolutely nothing. It would not even let existing mines sign new contracts. That was left to the incoming Labor Government to do. That was the golden opportunity to change things around, but it was never taken. Even so, with the small part of the world's trade that we do get, we supply a lot of uranium to Japan. It seems to me to be arrant nonsense to be suggesting that we should say to Japan, `You must store your high level wastes on your little island riven by earthquakes', and pretend that that is safer than bringing it back to Australia and storing it safely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, we have a process developed by Dr Ringwood at the ANU, and developed further by ANSTO, for the containment of high level waste. I refer, of course, to synroc. Synroc actually locks the nuclear activity up into the atomic lattice and is virtually unleachable. It is many times safer than borro silica glass. I am not saying that borro silica glass is not safe; in actual fact, I think it is probably safe enough. Certainly, the new iron silicates that the French are dealing with are better than the borro silicates. But even so, the radioactivity retention of synroc is many times better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal for the storage of high level waste was simply that it would be mixed up with this artificial mixture which, when heated under pressure, makes a rock-like material. Therefore, it got its name of synroc. This would be then encased in stainless steel and lowered into bore holes drilled in the ground. I think these bore holes were to be something in the order of two foot ten inches wide&mdash;to use Christian measurements&mdash;and they were about one kilometre deep. The idea was to put one of those containers in, and backfill it with 100 metres of high yielding clay. When we got close to the surface&mdash;when I say `close to the surface', I mean perhaps 300 or 400 metres&mdash;we backfilled the whole lot with crushed sedimentary rock. That would be incarcerated in a geologically stable area for all time. Australia would have the best technology, the best geology and the best geography for storing this high level waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that, on 1,000 square kilometres of land, if we put these bore holes in at 100 metre centres, by the time we got to the end we could go back and start again because the decay cycle of that high level waste would be over. That is assuming that the longest lasting ingredient was plutonium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot of misunderstanding about radioactivity. People say, `Shock, horror! Plutonium glass has a half-life of 240,000 years', and it does. The reason it has such a long half-life is that it is not very radioactive. The very radioactive and the fissionable materials have very short half-lives; they burn themselves out very quickly. That is where the really dangerous elements occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was touring one nuclear facility. At the end of the tour, the scientist fished into his pocket, pulled out a lump of metal, slapped it on my hand and he said, `That is our end product. That is plutonium metal'. I noticed that it was quite warm, and I did not know whether this was from body heat or the heat of radioactive decay. So I asked him and he said, `That is the radioactive decay'. I said to him, `Are you not a little concerned having this ensconced in your pocket around the family jewels?'. He said, `No. I have it wrapped up in gladwrap and there is 100 per cent prevention'. Gladwrap was preventing the escape of alpha. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am told that they have some novel uses for it in some of the schools. Alpha particles are completely contained by gladwrap. Of course, alpha is the most dangerous type of radioactivity that we had to deal with because of its propensity to escape into the atmosphere and attach itself to other things which get inhaled. Alpha is the main cause of lung cancer. Technically, I am told it is the exclusion of a helium nucleus&mdash;a very large, slow moving part&mdash;without any great penetrating power. But if we inhale it into our lungs, it can sit there for 20 years and may just give us lung cancer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I digress from the Bill for a moment which, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will notice that I have kept very closely to. The health industry tells us that one of the reasons that there is a high incidence of lung cancer in Cornwall is cigarette smoking. The reality is that it is much more likely to be as a result of all the yuppies buying the old miners' cottages and double glazing them, preventing any ventilation and subjecting themselves to very high doses of radon and radon's daughter products which are emitted naturally from the granite in that area. I would say, almost certainly, that is why that part of the UK has the very highest incidence of lung cancer. It has nothing or very little to do with cigarettes. But then why should we spoil a good story when there is so much funding going to that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to take back just Japan's high level waste and store it safely and properly in Australia, it would probably be a $2 billion industry. I have said that I am quite happy to have the storage in my electorate. I think, however, we would be much better off to look at places somewhere to the west of Broken Hill. With all the goodwill in the world, Broken Hill is looking down the barrel of being one of the world's great ghost towns. The ore-body has a finite life. It is going to be worked out and there is going to be nothing for these people in Broken Hill to do. I will warrant that, rather than walk away from that town, the Barrier Council will sit down and discuss rationally and constructively the idea of a repository for nuclear waste somewhere in the vicinity of the Hill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told that there are areas of ultra basic rock in that area which are geologically very stable and would be ideal for this sort of purpose. Of course, when Broken Hill goes down the tube, Port Pirie follows it. It has very good infrastructure; it has a very good railway line. It would seem to me that one would be much better off ridding the people of Port Pirie from that very dangerous lead that emits from the smelter there and replacing it with relatively less dangerous nuclear waste. It would seem to me that the logical thing to do would be to have Port Pirie as the gateway port for the disposal of high level waste. However, if it does not want it, as I have said I am very happy to have it in my electorate and have the hundreds of thousands of jobs in Western Australia that the nuclear industry, if properly addressed, will create in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It always amazes me that the Left of my own Party is so emotionally involved in this subject. This has become an absolute cause for it when it offers a potential for so much employment in Australia. One must ask why this has come about. The policy of the Labor Party prior to 1976 was to process, store and reprocess uranium. That was our policy in 1976 and we changed it. We changed it overnight on a whim. I must admit that in those days, having read all the anti-propaganda, I was convinced that this was a diabolical commodity and I actively tried to get that policy changed, and I was successful. Having done that, I then decided that my contribution was not enough and I should go to France and campaign in France. I rightly observed that it did not matter what one did in Australia, in the world scheme of things we are irrelevant. We really had to stop it in France. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So off to France I went. With my wife interpreting, I harangued crowds in supermarkets and spoke around France in picture theatres. I might add that I spoke eloquently, but in English that probably was not well understood, despite my wife's translations. However, while I was there I also decided to look at the nuclear industry and realised what a fool I was making of myself. I was completely wrong, so I changed my mind. When I am wrong, I find it best to change my mind. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is an attempt by the Government to try to codify and make safe the proper containment of waste. There has never been any suggestion that anything unsafe was being practised at ANSTO. That has never been suggested&mdash;not even by the Sutherland Shire. It seems to me that the Government is making sure that one facility in Australia has the technology, the understanding and the facilities to store this waste, and that it is simply being empowered to do so by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think we are ever going to see&mdash;as the honourable member for North Sydney thinks&mdash;anything other than basic research at Lucas Heights. The facility lends itself to research and, frankly, not to much else. But we do have to address this problem. I suggest that the Commonwealth Government and other States of Australia, having conspicuously failed to do this themselves, should seriously approach the Western Australia Government with a view to using facilities which the Western Australian Government has identified. The Western Australian Government may, like most State governments, pander to its own constituency; but I believe that if the financial inducements were sufficient, the Western Australian Government would expand its facilities to look at taking the Australian waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need only one storage facility of this kind in Australia. I think that Western Australia could easily accommodate low and medium level waste and could also handle a lot of chemical waste and the destruction of chemical waste. As I have said, the storage of high level waste is a different thing altogether. I believe that synroc is the process to use. I believe that the Government should show a little intestinal fortitude and have the guts to really tackle the nuclear industry head on: to look at the enormous number of jobs that can develop in Australia and to look at the contribution it can make to safe storage of high level wastes in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really is nonsense to suggest that it would be better for us to let the Japanese dump it in the ocean, as they invariably will when the problem becomes too pressing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;First of all, I thank all honourable members who participated in the debate: you, Mr Deputy Speaker; the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran); the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent); the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio); the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack); and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). I also thank the Opposition for its support of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Amendment Bill. I listened to all of the speeches carefully and generally found them to be thoughtful and constructive, although not universally so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central issue that emerged from the debate is that while State and local government authorities have their responsibilities and while the Commonwealth will continue to cooperate, consult and report in an open manner, as it has in the past, the principal responsibility in this matter is with the Commonwealth. Accordingly, the Commonwealth seeks specific immunities for the operation of ANSTO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comments on the amendments seemed to turn to two issues. The first issue is the suggestion that the amendments will allow the Lucas Heights research laboratory site to be used as a national radioactive waste dump. I say categorically, as I said in my second reading speech, that the Government has no intention of permitting Lucas Heights to become a national radioactive waste dump. This is no more clearly demonstrated than by the specific exclusion of the Fishermans Bend waste in the amendments. After 5 February 1995, consistent with the decision of the New South Wales Land and Environment Court earlier this year, it must be removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the Bill incorporates a requirement for specific regulations which, of course, are subject to disallowance by the Parliament&mdash;so much for the alleged fascist legislation&mdash;if ANSTO is to continue to condition, manage or store any wastes which are not generated by its activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government recognises that a permanent national radioactive waste repository must be established. My colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has been actively seeking the cooperation of the State governments in locating areas for a suitable site. In the spirit of the bipartisanship which has characterised much of this debate, my colleagues in the Opposition might encourage their colleagues in New South Wales to actually respond positively to the correspondence of September last year from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While such a site is being identified, wastes such as that already at Lucas Heights must be stored safely. The Government has ordered a report identifying all possible options for the safe interim storage of the Fishermans Bend waste and the St Marys ADI waste&mdash;after February 1995 in the case of Fishermans Bend and, of course, before that in the case of St Marys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The second issue that has been raised is that of States' rights and the ability of Sutherland Shire citizens to control their environment. As I hope my second reading speech made clear, the granting of immunity for Commonwealth bodies from State and local government laws and regulations is nothing new. Similar clauses were included in recent legislation which established Australian Defence Industries and the Civil Aviation Authority. The predecessor of ANSTO&mdash;the Australian Atomic Energy Commission&mdash;also had crown protection from State and Territory laws. It was never the Commonwealth's intention that ANSTO should be fully subject to State laws, and neither should it be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Australia's centre for nuclear science and technology expertise, ANSTO undertakes what is essentially a national role in the effective development and implementation of the Commonwealth's nuclear safeguards, uranium export, non-proliferation and nuclear arms control policies. These are not matters which can be subject to the approval of individual local councils or State governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding the question of the safety of local residents, ANSTO's safety record has never been seriously challenged. If one reads the judgment of the court, this was, in fact, underlined and reinforced by what Judge Cripps had to say in his summing up. The ANSTO is required to meet rigorous standards and it cooperates closely with the State Government authorities in doing so. In fact, the amendments underline the Government's commitment to the safe operation of the Lucas Heights facility by strengthening the independence of the Nuclear Safety Bureau. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposing this Bill should also consider carefully the implications for public welfare if the Bill were to be withdrawn or defeated. The ANSTO would not be able to deal adequately with incidents involving spills of radioactive substances or packages damaged in transport. The provision of nuclear medicine services would be severely curtailed. The number of sites where radioactive waste is stored in Australia would increase dramatically, as would the volume of material stored there, as ANSTO would no longer be able to receive spent source material for recycling, treatment or storage. The New South Wales Government, for example, has relied on this service to reduce substantially the volume of material at its radioactive waste store at Lidcombe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is precisely for these national interest reasons that the Commonwealth must retain control of facilities such as the Lucas Heights Research Laboratories. The Commonwealth has no intention of allowing Lucas Heights to become a de facto national radioactive waste repository nor, however, does it intend to hand control of the reactor over to a local council, a State government department or a State Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think a number of particular comments addressed to the chamber by the honourable member for North Sydney need a little additional comment, although I believe I have addressed the bulk of his remarks. This Bill does not provide, as he suggested, for the continuous expansion of Lucas Heights as a place for storage, or for its establishment as a permanent national repository. As I have pointed out, the Bill requires the removal of the Fishermans Bend waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill hardly stamps on State law. I believe it seeks to establish the appropriate balance of power for the Commonwealth to fulfil its responsibilities in this matter. I was amused to hear the honourable member for North Sydney equating the interests of the Government of New South Wales with those of the people of New South Wales. I would have thought the evidence in recent times would have been to the contrary. Without infringing on the spirit of bipartisanship, which has been a feature of this debate, I would shudder to think that one would consider handing over control of matters nuclear to the current New South Wales environment Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill does not, as the honourable member for North Sydney suggests, pave the way for the construction of a replacement reactor at Lucas Heights. If the honourable member for North Sydney takes the trouble to read my statement of last Thursday, when I tabled the ASTEC report on national facilities, he will see that a lengthy and exhaustive process of inquiry will be undertaken before any decision is taken about the construction of a replacement for HIFAR, let alone where that replacement reactor might be constructed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, on the question of retrospectivity, I inform the honourable member for North Sydney that at present on the site there is non-ANSTO generated waste which was not subject to the decision of the court. Were these amendments to fail, the storage of this material would be illegal. That is the reason for the retrospectivity. I hope those comments satisfy the honourable member for North Sydney. It was evident to me that he had not read the Bill as thoroughly as he might have. I know he is a person who will now go back and read the legislation, the explanatory memorandum and the supporting material and perhaps get a better grasp of it before falling into the trap of generating cheap but inaccurate headlines. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was some understandable jocularity associated with the result of the division on the second reading motion. Honourable members who have been participating in or listening to this debate will know what an unmitigated stunt the calling of that division was by the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) and the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary). Anybody who listened to the contribution of the honourable member for North Sydney will know immediately that he has neither read the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Amendment Bill or the judgment of the New South Wales Land and Environment Court delivered in February which necessitated the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cliche ridden hyperbole which led the honourable member for North Sydney to describe it as fascist legislation is utterly disgraceful. He never once addressed the major issues which arose out of that court case. There was just a string of endless cliches put together. In fact, some of those cliches were very familiar to me. I could tell the honourable member for North Sydney who within the Parliamentary Library wrote his speech, and I will certainly mention the name to him later. It is not as if he came up with anything original. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for North Sydney ignored a number of aspects that are vital to understanding this legislation. It can only be understood if the judgment of the New South Wales Land and Environment Court is read. Firstly, that judgment found that there is no safety issue associated with the storage or transportation of radioactive waste or nuclear waste to the Lucas Heights Research Laboratories from the Australian Defence Industries site at St Marys near Penrith or with the transportation of 2,000 tonnes of contaminated soil from CSIRO at Fishermans Bend to Lucas Heights. Let us put that to rest once and for all&mdash;no safety issue associated with ANSTO's handling of the material or its storage. In fact, the judge expressly declared ANSTO to be the most appropriate authority with the greatest expertise and experience to handle this waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the honourable member for Sydney ignores totally Crown immunity. As the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) pointed out in his second reading speech and again in his reply, we have a number of Commonwealth agencies which have immunity from State and Territory laws, such as the Civil Aviation Authority and Australian Defence Industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a national facility. It does not belong to the Sutherland Shire Council nor to the New South Wales Government. Who are we kidding? It has always been the practice of ANSTO to abide by the New South Wales planning and environment laws. The Minister has given undertakings that it will continue to do so. The judgment of the New South Wales Land and Environment Court was that the principal Act governing ANSTO defined it as a research agency. In later years, because ANSTO has sought out commercial opportunities, it has gone beyond the role specifically defined for it by the legislation;  therefore, it did not have Crown immunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that, the honourable member for North Sydney has to answer the question: what do we do with the waste? No-one else in Australia can deal with it. What do we do with the ADI and CSIRO waste? What do we do with the industrial and medical isotopes? What happens if there is a breakage in medical equipment? It has to be transported to ANSTO for repair. Under the judgment of the court it cannot even be transported to ANSTO. What do we do with all of that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is exactly why this is a stunt by the honourable member for North Sydney and the honourable member for Wills. We have the sight of the honourable member for Wills looking like a rabbit caught by the headlights of a motor vehicle, not knowing what he has done. If the honourable member for North Sydney has not read the legislation or the judgment which led to the legislation, we can also be quite certain that the honourable member for Wills has not read it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt at all that this House will be subjected to a number of divisions of this sort from the two honourable members, all designed for one purpose only: to align themselves with the weird and the wonderful who are easily persuaded that they are being represented by these honourable members. When the honourable member for North Sydney calls this Bill fascist legislation and something of a conspiracy by the major political parties, I for one will not tolerate it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation has been carefully thought out by both the Government and the coalition. We have stated at great length the reasons why we have accepted the legislation. Yet the honourable member for North Sydney totally ignored any of those complex or compelling reasons for the legislation. So it is really up to the honourable member for North Sydney; if he is genuine and sincere, he can tell us: if the waste is not stored at ANSTO and treated and managed by ANSTO until a nuclear and radioactive waste repository can be developed, as the court said&mdash;this will be new information, of course&mdash;by 5 February 1995, what do we do with it in the meantime?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt the honourable member hopes that the novelty of the first division called by the two Independents, which saw the Government and the Opposition total 128 against two, will gain him some publicity. No doubt the gullible media, which give the honourable member for North Sydney and the honourable member for Wills more than their fair share of publicity, will fall for it. But the truth is that on any examination their contribution to this debate is certainly not worth the slightest bit of attention. The way the honourable member for North Sydney wraps himself in treacle-like smugness I cannot accept. I do not mind being lectured by Mother Theresa or the Dalai Lama, but I will be blowed if I am going to accept it from somebody whom I regard as a total political opportunist. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great pity that the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), has to resort to character assassination arguments on this issue. For him to pretend that there is no public concern not only in this country but around the world over nuclear storage is quite ridiculous. To have to resort to character assassination arguments to deal with what is genuine concern by the Sutherland Council and the people who live around that area is unacceptable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that for the last decade we have been talking about finding an alternative site and now we move into a situation of privatisation and expansion of the facilities. How can any reasonable person believe that the Government is really serious about finding an alternative site? We all know in a practical world how difficult it will be to find an alternative site. But, as I said previously, given the expansion of the population of Sydney, we have to do so and it is urgent. For the honourable member to just stand up and character assassinate and trivialise the arguments is really beneath him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Remuneration and Allowances Legislation Amendment Bill specifically deals with the creation of a new salaries structure for the restructured Industrial Relations Commission, certain recommendations of the Remuneration Tribunal and certain salary proposals for university vice-chancellors and might in other circumstances have passed by without very much public notice. But any opportunity that the Government may have thought it would have of this legislation passing by without any kind of public notice, any kind of press speculation or any kind of political interest was, of course, completely shattered on 14 April this year when a man by the name of Mr Ken Turbet tendered his resignation as a member of the Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth while if I read a few paragraphs of Mr Turbet's letter to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook). It is a very instructive letter and it exposes&mdash;from the vantage point of a man who certainly does not share my political philosophy&mdash;some deep-seated tensions and hypocrisies inside the broad labour movement regarding the conduct of industrial relations in Australia. In his letter Mr Turbet writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I respond to your letter to the President, Mr Justice Maddern, dated 8 April 1992, by advising of my intention to tender my resignation, as a Commissioner of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, to the Governor General with effect from 10 May 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>This is really the essence of the importance of the Turbet resignation; he then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reasons for my resignation after 14 years as a Commission member, which was preceded by 16 years service to the trade union movement and 20 years membership of the Australian Labor Party are three-fold.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the coup de grace:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, the Government cannot be relied upon to keep to its word.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me say that again: `Firstly, the Government cannot be relied upon to keep to its word.' One will not find many people on this side of the House dissenting from that proposition. But it is an extraordinarily apposite and relevant proposition, especially coming from a man who has devoted all of his adult life to the service of the labour movement and to the maintenance of an industrial relations system which we on this side of the House are determined to alter and alter permanently so far as the future of this country is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Turbet then goes on to detail a current example of how the Government could not be relied upon to keep its word. He speaks of the recommendations of the Gleeson Committee on the Remuneration Tribunal and he details that Mr Gerry Gleeson, the former head of the Premier's Department&mdash;a man who was the closest adviser that Neville Wran had when he was the Labor Premier of New South Wales&mdash;recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government should only seek to disallow a remuneration determination of the Tribunal if extraordinary circumstances arise.</PARA>
<PARA>To this the Cabinet said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need to maintain the independence of the Remuneration Tribunal is recognised and the Government accepts that it should only seek to disallow determinations in exceptional circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Turbet goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet the first determination you receive from the Remuneration Tribunal concerning the AIRC following this announcement of policy you reject. There are no "extraordinary or exceptional circumstances" surrounding the Remuneration Tribunal's decision. There are, in fact, 15 pages of detailed reasoning supporting the decision. The word of the Government in the form of an official policy statement just wasn't worth the paper it was written on.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we have a Labor man of 40 years saying that a Government statement was not worth the paper it was written on. The letter goes on to detail very serious allegations against the Minister. Mr Turbet says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . my . . . most compelling reason for resigning is your Government's total lack of understanding of and respect for the Constitutional requirements of Section 51. . . of the Constitution. There have been five referenda directed at altering this provision. All have failed. The Industrial Relations power is therefore in the same terms as when originally drafted. . . </PARA>
<PARA>He then particularly castigates statements made by the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in April 1991 when he said that the national wage decision made at that time had been made by just five officials and that the accord was the primary national income determining institution, not the Commission. He then goes on finally to castigate the relationship that exists between the Secretary of the ACTU and the Prime Minister. He has this to say&mdash;and these words are very redolent of charges that have been levied by us against the Government since 1983:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The so called Accord process has been manipulated to such an extent that it is only the Prime Minister and the Secretary of the ACTU who are now involved in its decision making procedures.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have a man who has been in the Labor Party for 40 years saying that the industrial relations of this country are run exclusively by the Secretary of the ACTU and the Prime Minister. Yet no doubt in the lead-up to the next election as those opposite go around the country, as they undoubtedly will, trying to impugn the integrity of the Opposition's proposals on industrial relations, they will seek to resurrect the role of the Industrial Relations Commission. They will seek to say to the Australian public that the Industrial Relations Commission stands between decency and the Australian way and the marauding changes that are proposed by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The supreme irony of that attempt will be the fact that it has been the Labor Party, the ACTU and, in particular, the present Prime Minister, who have done more in their covert, seditious way to undermine the role of the Industrial Relations Commission than any other group of people in this country. I have never disguised my desire to reduce the role of the Industrial Relations Commission in the industrial relations affairs of this country. I believe, and have believed for many years, that what this nation needs is an industrial relations system that elevates the direct contract between the employer and the employee above all other industrial arrangements. I believe we need in this country an industrial arrangement which essentially says to people, `You go and make your own arrangements and, provided you observe certain prescribed minima regarding hourly rates of pay, regarding such things as annual leave, sick leave, health and public safety requirements, you ought to be free to make any arrangement you choose'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we can reach in this country an industrial relations system that is based upon that approach, we have a genuine hope of enjoying the productivity break-out and the productivity benefits that we all know are there to be had if only we can deliver to Australian employers and employees the industrial relations system that will bring forth the productivity benefits to inspire the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party will try to resurrect the role of the Industrial Relations Commission, but it will endeavour to do so in vain. The Government decided in April last year to torpedo the national wage decision. When the Secretary of the ACTU returned from a union conference in Europe immediately after that decision was brought down, he rang up his mate, the then Treasurer, and said, `We have got to defy this decision'. Ever since then, the two of them conspired to defy that decision and to undermine the position of the former Prime Minister, whose mind was on other things&mdash;I think it was gold. A certain luncheon had received a great deal of notoriety; that luncheon involved raising money for the 1987 election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we all remember that the former Prime Minister's attention was a little bit diverted. He was a little worried about what his mates over in Perth had been doing at that luncheon in 1987 and his mind was not fully on the industrial relations game. If it had been on the industrial relations game, there is no way that he would have allowed the government that he then led to torpedo a decision of the Industrial Relations Commission. He would have known, if his mind had been well and truly on the game, that to allow that to happen would be to reduce the authority of the Industrial Relations Commission and to kneecap the strongest participant in the Government's industrial relations argument. It would have been, in his eyes, the soccer equivalent of `kicking an own goal'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The former Prime Minister would have understood the mistake that was made by the Government if his mind had been fully attuned to that particular issue; but, of course, it was not. It was possible for the Secretary of the ACTU and the then Treasurer to bring about a torpedoing of that particular decision of the Industrial Relations Commission. From that day onward, the authority of the Industrial Relations Commission in Australia was permanently reduced. There is nothing that those opposite can do between now and the next election to resurrect the authority of the Industrial Relations Commission. They can try as much as they like. They can say how much they believe in an impartial commission. I can tell those opposite that the Commission does not believe in them any more. The Commission is in open revolt against the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I predict that before another four or five months elapses there will be further resignations from the Industrial Relations Commission. Some of those resignations will cause greater embarrassment to the Government than the resignation of Mr Turbet, to which I referred earlier in my remarks. It is one thing to be confronted by an alternative government that says, quite openly, `We believe that your role is too big. We believe that your role ought to be reduced. We believe that, rather than you having the lion's share of determining wages and conditions in Australia they ought to be determined by contract'; it is an entirely different thing for an incumbent government to say, `Of course, we think you are the pinnacle. We think you are the umpire, the keeper of the ring, the arbiter of fair play', and all those things, and then spend most of its time trying to badmouth the members of the Commission. Anybody who knows anything about industrial relations knows that the personal relations between senior people in the ACTU and the members of the Commission over the past few months have deteriorated to an all-time low. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are open about our intentions. I have had discussions with the President of the Industrial Relations Commission, who is realistic enough to acknowledge that, come a change of government, life will be very different and the Commission will have a much diminished role. But his attitude, quite properly, is that if the Parliament of Australia changes the law and gives the Commission a different role, it will cop it because that is how it operates in a democracy. But those opposite, in typically hypocritical fashion, say, `We love the Industrial Relations Commission. We want it to control everything'. Then they go about transferring the authority of the Industrial Relations Commission away from it into the hands of Bill Kelty and the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A duumvirate runs Australia's industrial relations now. Most Australians are aware of it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reforming Australia's industrial relations system is undeniably the major economic reform that this country needs. That is a view that I have adhered to for many years. It is a view that is strongly shared and supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). Despite all of the attempts that are being made by the Government to paint the industrial relations program of the Opposition as being extreme, radical and insensitive to Australian workers, the truth of the matter is that the accord process has failed the most important test. The most important test is productivity. Those opposite can grimace and guffaw and carry on as much as they like, but if they look at the OECD examinations of the performance of the Australian economy, if they look at any objective analysis of the performance of the Australian economy, they will find that over the last few years the one thing that we undeniably come last in is productivity performance. </PARA>

When I stopped being Treasurer of Australia in 1983, this country owed the rest of the world $21 billion. The latest count has it at $145 billion. Those opposite think that is a good performance. What is their reply? Their reply is that they created 1 1/2 million jobs. They created 1 1/2 million jobs at a cost of $70,000 a head.

The only way in which over the next few years we can climb out of the enormous international debt level that the Prime Minister more than any other person in Australia is responsible for&mdash;it is the Prime Minister's debt, although it is a debt that the Australian public has to bear&mdash;is to dramatically lift our productivity performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I think even those opposite would acknowledge, national productivity does not exist in a vacuum; national productivity is the sum total of the productivity of individual firms around this country. It is our view that the only way we can achieve the productivity break-out that Australia needs is to have an industrial relations system that is focused exclusively on the enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite would have us believe that they are interested in enterprise bargaining. They would have us believe in their form of Claytons enterprise bargaining, where nothing can be agreed unless the union says yes and the Industrial Relations Commission says yes. That is their enterprise bargaining. There is one thing that members of the Labor Party will never do when it comes to enterprise bargaining: they will never actually let the enterprise bargain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have the details of an example in my drawer. It is an example that ought to be emblazoned on the minds of every member of this House. A company employing 500 people went to its work force towards Christmas of 1990 and said, `Look, we are in a hopeless financial position. We are going to effect the following economies with management. Will you, as a work force, make a contribution and agree to the deferral of the 17.5 per cent holiday loading this Christmas on the understanding that if we trade into the black next year, you can not only have the 17.5 per cent, you can also have 25 per cent holiday loading for the following Christmas'. There was a ballot amongst the 500 employees&mdash;none of whom, incidentally, belonged to a union&mdash;and they voted overwhelmingly to accept the company's offer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So they trotted off to the Industrial Relations Commission, and the Industrial Relations Commission said, `We can't vary the award'. As those opposite would know, such an agreement constituted an award variation. Under the present pre-World War I industrial laws of Australia, which are supported and embraced by this present Government, what did the Industrial Relations Commission do? It said, `We can't vary that without getting a request from the union, because the union is a respondent to the award'. So, reluctantly, because the law required it the company went off to the relevant union, to which none of the employees by their own decision wanted to belong, and said, `On our behalf, would you please make an application for variation of the award?'. The union in effect said, `Get lost. We are not interested'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the company went back to its employees and said, `We are very sorry, we can't give effect to this agreement, because we can't get an award variation. We are not prepared to put the agreement into effect because we could get prosecuted for a breach of the award.' It is pretty obvious what happened&mdash;the company retrenched a number of its employees early the following year. That is Australian industrial relations; that is how much flexibility there is in Australian industrial relations; that is how much enterprise bargaining there is in Australia at present under the laws that those opposite would have us support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does pass very strange to me, that the Government, whose leader has spent an inordinate amount of time over the last few weeks castigating those on this side of the House for their regard for certain historical attitudes and values in this country, should cling with such tenacity, as he so obviously does, to an industrial relations system which owes its origins to pre-World War I Australia. If ever there were an anachronistic institution, if ever there were a set of attitudes and values of the past which ought to be thrown out, it is our attitude towards industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think we should ever adopt a blindly radical or a blindly conservative attitude towards past attitudes and practice.

I think we ought to throw out those things that we inherited from the United Kingdom that have not worked very well, such as some of our stupid trade union attitudes.

It wants to hang on to many of the old craft union attitudes; the `them and us' attitudes. It still talks about class struggle; it still talks in terms of nineteenth century Europe and struggles between classes in countries in Europe and in the United Kingdom. It is a very strange double standard. It picks on the good things that we have inherited to throw out, but it wants to hang on to the bad things.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;However, in this speech, I will deal primarily with the economic relationship between Australia and Britain and particularly with British investment in Australia. On 30 March 1992, figures obtained from the Overseas Trade Services Department of the British High Commission in Canberra cited over 700 UK companies and/or their subsidiaries established in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to investment, in December 1991, the UK was the third highest investor in Australia at $48,076m, being surpassed only narrowly by Japan at $51,030m and the United States at $53,922m. To be more specific, in 1990&mdash;the latest date for available figures&mdash;the UK was the highest investor in manufacturing with $14,950m being invested, compared with the United States at $13,577m and Japan at $4,124m.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently in Perth, the British High Commissioner, Sir Brian Barder, made reference to the economic relationship between Britain and Australia. I quote from his comments on that occasion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Britain's position in Europe and Australia's position in the Asia Pacific give both countries new opportunities to strengthen our mutual relationship. Each of our countries can give the other opportunities it would not otherwise have. A growing number of British firms see the value of having a base in Australia to get into Asian markets . . . The flow of Australian investment to Britain shows clearly that many Australian firms see Britain as their best base for European operations.</PARA>
<PARA>Sir Brian went on to give numerous examples of Australia-Britain cooperation in business ventures. For example, in the defence field, GEC Marconi has signed a contract with Australian Telecom for the design and supply of an advanced radar network for the defence of Australia; the value is over $250m. </PARA>

The Prime Minister's insulting demeanour towards Britain has been widely reported in the media of that country, as it has been here. Although some might assert that business is business and the public relationship between the two countries will make little difference, it should also be pointed out that, privately, insults are hard to forget.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, as you are no doubt aware, in 1982-83 it looked as if Australia would lose its steel industry. One of the first acts of the Hawke Labor Government on coming to power in March 1983 was to come up with the steel plan, which saved the steel industry in Australia, albeit at a massive cost in jobs in the Illawarra region. The steelworks at Port Kembla went from employing over 22,000 persons to working today towards an employment of some 7,000 persons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The social and economic impact on the Illawarra region has been drastic not only for the jobs lost in the steel industry but also for the many supporting small enterprises. Recognising the severe social and economic problems, the Hawke Labor Government instigated the steel regions assistance program and made available some $40m to assist the Illawarra. There were four categories: education, roads, tourism and infrastructure. The infrastructure component was some $19.7m to assist projects of long term value to the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Various infrastructure projects were put up. In discussions, I had urged that some of this money go towards the construction of the Port Kembla grain terminal, but I always argued against all the money going to the grain terminal. At first I had argued for $8m, but then upped it to $10m, which would have left $9m for projects in the region. This would have greatly assisted the region in tackling some of the social and economic problems generated by the huge loss of jobs in the steel industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was overruled, in a manner which to this day I am angry about, and one day I will tell the full story. Owing to interference by the then State Government, the whole $19m was allocated to the construction of the grain handling facility. This was $19m allocated for work in the Illawarra, for projects of benefit to the Illawarra, but taken from the Illawarra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Thursday, the New South Wales State Premier announced the sale of the New South Wales Grain Corporation for some $90m. The facility at Port Kembla itself cost many millions more than this to build. To say that this sale at this price was a gift&mdash;indeed it must be regarded as the sale of the century&mdash;would be putting it very mildly indeed. It is an outrageous decision; in fact, it is a disgrace. The New South Wales Premier said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is great news for wheat growers in New South Wales.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Illawarra has contributed $19m so that Nick Greiner can make a generous gesture to the wheat growers of New South Wales. No area of New South Wales can less afford to be so generous than the Illawarra. The point I am making is that this $19m was not a grant from the Federal Government to help construct the grain terminal; it was $19m specifically allocated for projects in the Illawarra region. Because the money went to the grain terminal these projects did not go ahead. The Illawarra was deprived of $19m worth of projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to this House that morally the $19m should be returned to the people of the Illawarra. There are many projects in that area that would benefit from the injection of these funds. If the Greiner Government refuses to return the funds, I would suggest to the Prime Minister&mdash;and I have written to him in this vein&mdash;that the amount of $19.7m, which was given to the Illawarra under the steel regions assistance infrastructure program, should be deducted from the New South Wales Federal assistance grants and directed instead to the Illawarra region. It would be really outrageous if Greiner, who has consistently kicked the Illawarra, should steal $19m from the people of the Illawarra. That money belongs to the Illawarra region and should be returned from the profits of this ill-considered and morally bankrupt sale. </PARA>

He is happy to grovel at the feet of the British. But, more importantly, he has a flag on the desk that is made in Taiwan, which makes an absolute joke of the premise that he is putting forward. If the honourable member really is fair dinkum about the farmers in his electorate he should stand up and tell the British what we have said: we are sick and tired of being treated by them as third class colonials. Idiots like Sainsbury the Trade Minister in Britain do not give a damn about Australian farmers or this country. Britain is part of the EC, and that is its entitlement, but there is no way that we as proud Aussies are going to cop that and get down and grovel at the feet of the British. That is not the Australian way. If the British do not like it, that is just too bad.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to put on record once again that I am proud of my British heritage. But I am an Aussie first and foremost. I do not want a knighthood like some of those on the other side and I am not prepared to sacrifice Australia's self-prestige for the sake of grovelling at the feet of the British aristocracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Wide Bay well knows, the best way to get a knighthood in Queensland in the past was to be in the bag of the National Party and that led straight to Boggo Road. If those opposite really want to get on about that stuff, that is fine. If they want to talk about freedom and democracy, let us talk about 1942 to 1945. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to focus particularly on Labour Day. Today in Queensland we celebrated Labour Day, something we on this side of the House can all be very proud of. It supports the traditions in Queensland going back to 1891 of the right of men and women to organise and fight for a decent wage and for a decent set of living standards, regardless of ethnic background, and for the right and dignity of human beings in this country to get a decent livable wage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ironic that those on the other side of the House have attacked organised labour through the Bills that have been introduced over the past 12 months. Those in the National Party, who are agrarian socialists, want to maintain the various structures of regulations but do not want working men and women to have the right to organise and sell their labour in a cohesive manner with central wage fixation. We only need to look at the difference in philosophy to determine what happens when this does not apply. We saw that very clearly on our television screens over the past few days. We heard a lot about the great free enterprise society where people have a choice to join organised labour through voluntary agreements and that has broken down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the argument about how great voluntary agreements are and the freedom and the rights of individuals to argue against corporations. That exists in the United States, where illegal Mexican labour is used to break down award conditions. It is used to promote the horticultural industry in America which hides behind protective tariffs and cheap Haitian and Peurto Rican labour. Of course, these people do not have a minimum wage, they do not have a Medicare system, they do not have the sort of structure that we have for unemployment benefits. They have a pension system of about half of what we have. They also have a repatriation system that is about half as good as we have. If that is all put together, what do we get? We get Los Angeles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a sad indictment on the strongest country on this earth that, with all the greatness it has produced&mdash;men such as Jefferson, Adams, Munroe, Lincoln, and this century Roosevelt, Wilson and Kennedy&mdash;it still has not reached the stage to learn that every human being deserves a minimum wage, universal health cover, and an opportunity to rise regardless of his ethnic background. I think it is sad that that has happened. I believe that Americans need to look at themselves and where they are going because they have so much to offer the world and have done so much. I think that is a tragedy. That is certainly not the road that Australia should follow. As we celebrate Labour Day today in Queensland, one great thing is that we will never reach that situation, provided we have a strong and viable trade union movement and a belief in social justice. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to raise a matter that is important to me and that relates to the carers of the disabled. I will take the opportunity this week, if I can, to get up in the adjournment debates to repeat some of the stories that have been told to me in the last month of what is happening under this Government to the carers of the disabled in this country. First of all, I will read a letter from two people from Tanunda in South Australia who have written to me, even though they are outside my electorate, because they cannot find any sympathy from anyone in this Government. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mrs Gallus,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As parents of a daughter aged 37, we are most concerned that we will shortly be unable to continue providing the care she needs as we are both very close to 70.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our daughter is totally dependent on us for all of her needs and functions. We receive support but even with the help we get it is becoming increasingly difficult especially when she needs assistance at night&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>remember that these people are in their seventies&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are most concerned at the lack of appropriate accommodation for our daughter here in the Barossa Valley. The only accommodation for people with disabilities is with Barossa Enterprises and they can only support people who need minimal support because of the level of funding they receive. The local Nursing Home at Tanunda has been a great help but even they are not equipped with the staff to support someone as disabled as our daughter&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is due, once again, to the level of funding that they receive&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can you please help us in some way to achieve the accommodation and support our daughter so desperately needs.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to say that when they are no longer able to care for the daughter in times of desperation she is placed in a nursing home for the elderly. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our daughter needs all the stimulation and activities she can get to maintain what physical abilities she has. Even though our daughter was supported in the Nursing Home, we noticed the effect her short stays have on her. We ask you to consider what it must be like for one so young to live in such an environment.</PARA>
<PARA>Remember that she is 37. They conclude:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We ask that you speak with those who are responsible for providing funds to the disabled, to work together to try and resolve this difficult situation, as there are many other people in the same situation as ourselves.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, there are. This is one of the great problems facing carers of people with disabilities today. As the parents get older and move into their late sixties, seventies and eighties, they can no longer care for their disabled children who are in their thirties, forties and fifties. Yet there is nowhere for them to go. The reason there is nowhere for them to go is a direct result of the policies of this Government. I will read from another letter from a carer of people with disabilities. I shall not read the name because I have not actually been given permission to give it. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't think the State Government can begin to address the needs of any of these families without Federal financial input. The `emotional blackmail' that Howe speaks of is actually being used by the feds against families of disabled people. . . I enclose a copy of Howe's speech&mdash;useless drivel!. . . The Federal Government is abrogating its responsibility by hiding behind a philosophical shield emblazoned with the motto `normalisation and deinstitutionalisation!'.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that on subsequent nights this week I can read further letters to the House. </PARA>

That Committee is under the very capable chairmanship of the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), who is diverting me from the rare five minutes that I have here. I would like to place on record the work that is being undertaken by the FAC and its development plan for the Melbourne Airport. The plans are stunning. Public criticism has been made by ill-informed groups such as the Committee for Melbourne chaired by the former President of the Liberal Party, Mr Elliott, and they tend to shoot off at the mouth about these things. If one could see the work that is taking place there, I am sure one would be impressed and could see the future.</PARA></TALK.START>

It will be the key link that ties together the road, the rail, the air and the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the lunch break, we also had a very fascinating presentation from ANL, Australia's public sector shipping line, which is in profit and operating well since taken over by this Government. ANL has entered a joint venture with the CSIRO to develop in Australia a brand new packaging concept, which the CSIRO has developed, which will transform the face of fresh produce marketing and the delivery of Australian produce. We were informed of a test that was done. A truckload of fresh flowers was picked in Perth and transported by road across to Melbourne wrapped in this packaging, and it took a week. Then it was put on a ship and delivered to Tokyo. It was opened six weeks after going into the container. After a transport cycle of seven weeks, the flowers looked as though they had been picked yesterday. That is totally an Australian invention; it is a CSIRO invention. It is great that the ANL put up the capital to develop it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will have to hurry along, and hurry along we did. We hurried over to the South Dynon Rail Terminal where we saw that trucks now unload their containers in an average time of 12 minutes, not the three to six hours that is conveyed out in the countryside by our Opposition. Twelve minutes is the average time in Melbourne now for a truck to unload or collect a container at the railway yard. Then we went over to Webb Dock where we saw the latest in container shipping. Again, how long does a truck stay at the wharf? In common mythology, it takes anywhere between two and three days; in fact, it takes half an hour to three hours. That is the mythology that we have to get on with dispelling. That was the point of this exercise. Then we went to East Swanson Dock to have a look at the same thing there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did have with me as guests over 50 public opinion leaders from around the western and northern sections of Melbourne, from the Geelong Standard Rail Committee, the Goulburn Valley producers and up the Calder Highway to Mildura councillors. I worked out that those people between them represent one million Victorians. All I can say is that their minds were blown to see the fact as against the mythology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final thing I want to say is that I publicly issue an invitation to the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), who is at the table on the Opposition side&mdash;he is a gentleman that I like and have regard for&mdash;to join me on the next one of these visits. If he were ever to become the Land Transport Minister, I would want him to continue these good works that are being done by our Labor Government for people. It demonstrates our commitment to public sector operations and our commitment to making the transport sector reforms work. </PARA>

Accordingly, the State Pharmacy Board of Queensland would be the appropriate body to consider the pharmacist's conduct and to decide if breaches have occurred sufficient to justify deregistration.
