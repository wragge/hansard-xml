<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the House expresses its deep regret at the death on Saturday, 14 November 1992, of Alan William Jarman, a member of this House for the division of Deakin, from 1966 to 1983, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</PARA>
<PARA>Alan William Jarman was born on 22 July 1923 at Melbourne, Victoria, and was educated at Wesley College, Melbourne. He obtained a Bachelor of Commerce degree from the University of Melbourne. He served with the Australian Special Wireless Group as a pilot officer, Citizen Air Force Reserve, from 1942 until 23 December 1946. Prior to entering Federal Parliament he was a qualified accountant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1966 Alan Jarman was elected to Federal Parliament as the Liberal member for Deakin. He gave faithful service to his electors and to the nation as a member of the House for the next 17 years. His parliamentary appointments included Deputy Chairman of Committees and also membership of several parliamentary delegations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alan Jarman's career in the House was loyal and hardworking. I knew him quite well, having served with him for an overlapping period. His commitment to his electors was low key yet effective. I am sure he is remembered with fondness by many members of this House and by those with whom he served&mdash;a number of whom are still in the Parliament today. On behalf of the Government I extend our sincere sympathy to his family in their bereavement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to second this motion of condolence for Alan Jarman as a mark of respect for a fine Liberal and for the community which he served in this Parliament for 17 years. He was one of those parliamentarians whose formative experiences were the war and the Great Depression. His boyhood memories of soup kitchens and people living rough gave him a sense of social justice. His wartime experiences gave him a sense of what could be achieved by people working together.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the war he served in the new field of signals intelligence. In doing so he helped to intercept, break and analyse Japanese naval codes. Like many other ex-servicemen, he was determined to help shape the peace not by extending wartime controls but by aggressively confronting all doctrines which made men and women mere servants of the all powerful state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with such future Liberal leaders as Ivor Greenwood, Lindsay Thompson and Alan Hunt, he broke what was then the extreme Left dominance of student politics at Melbourne University, becoming student representative council secretary and then president. On leaving university, he qualified as an accountant, and he successfully ran a chain of furniture stores before entering politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At his first attempt to enter parliament, Alan failed by just 200 votes to defeat the sitting member for the then safe Labor seat of Melbourne West in the Victorian upper House. Two years later in the 1966 Holt landslide he won the seat of Deakin, a seat which he held through six subsequent elections. The fact that he defied the electoral trend in 1972 and again in 1974 testifies to his skills as a local member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Federal MP, Alan still had time to gather a group of locals nearly every Friday afternoon for a few drinks in one of the hotels in his electorate. On one occasion he declared that the 19-mile charity walkathon that he had entered would be just a short stroll compared with the ground he had covered doorknocking during election campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a local level, Alan Jarman was active and influential in many areas. For example, he established a coalition of local forces to preserve as green space what is now the Blackburn Lake Reserve. In important respects, Alan was a very modern politician. It is a grave mistake to think that Australia's politicians have only just discovered Asia, for in his 1967 maiden speech Alan Jarman applauded `the new awareness of Australia's role in Asia'. He declared that as Australians we cannot divorce ourselves from involvement with Asia; that we are part and parcel of Asia. He rightly saw the Colombo Plan as an important foundation of Australia's expanding ties with Asia, and as early as 1966 he praised the presence of 14,000 overseas students in our education system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although he never became a Minister, Alan Jarman was acknowledged by his colleagues as a politician of substance and a politician of compassion and, more importantly of course, he was acknowledged as such by the electors of Deakin. The fact that he worked tirelessly and without pay for charity after his retirement demonstrates his commitment to the best ideals of public service&mdash;a commitment which he has now passed on to his son, David, who is now a prominent member of the Victorian Liberal Party. On behalf of the Liberal Party which he served so long and so well, and on behalf of the Federal Opposition, I extend my deepest sympathy to his family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in supporting this condolence motion. I salute particularly the 17 years of service that Mr Jarman gave to his country through service in the House of Representatives. I also salute the fact that he is one of the few remaining former members to be mentioned in condolence motions who served in World War II. Sadly, it is part of the passing of time that there will be fewer occasions on which we may pay tribute to those who served their country in World War II, who then went on to enter parliament and give outstanding service in this forum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition summed up Mr Alan Jarman in terms of both his entrepreneurial activities and his activities as a grassroots member of the Parliament. He had the custom of happily meeting and mixing with his constituents on a Friday afternoon at an appropriate watering hole. The opportunity to provide that grassroots contact is often overlooked as our schedules become more jammed, but it is more important today than ever before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I salute the work of Mr Jarman in terms of his priority for and focus on Asia as a region, which he launched in his maiden speech. That has further unfolded over the years since that time in 1967. I make the point that just before that period Harold Holt, as Prime Minister, made extensive visits to Asia and really charted a course for Australia. That was readily supported by Mr Jarman in his maiden speech and in subsequent activities as the member for Deakin. On behalf of the National Party, I extend sympathy to members of the Jarman family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to join in remarks on this condolence motion. I thank the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for moving the motion and for making the time available. I believe the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) encapsulated well Alan Jarman's parliamentary career. I knew Alan before he came into the Parliament. In fact, I was President of the Liberal Party when he discussed with me whether he should seek preselection for Deakin. He won preselection, and then went on to win the seat. He was a great admirer of his predecessor in that seat, Frank Davis, who similarly served this Parliament extremely well on many committees and locally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alan was absolutely dedicated to the Liberal Party. The Leader of the Opposition has mentioned that after the war he enrolled at Melbourne University and, along with Ivor Greenwood and Alan Missen, and others who came to eminence in the State sphere, was active in student politics and was Secretary and President of the Student Representative Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a very decent, sincere, hardworking man. He came to this Parliament with some finely honed political principles and developed particular loyalties in the Parliament. I well remember this generally quiet and non-aggressive person being outraged by the attacks that were made over time on John Gorton and Bill Snedden. Not only was he a loyal Party man outside the Parliament but he developed particular loyalties in here. His son, David, has carried on working hard in the Liberal Party. He is on the Executive of my own electorate committee. To him and the rest of the family I extend my sympathies on the death of a fundamentally decent man with whom it was a pleasure to work in this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the remarks that have been made about my friend Alan Jarman. It will be 26 years this weekend since he was elected to this Parliament. Only a few of us who were elected along with him are in this chamber now. Alan, it has been said, was a good, true and loyal member of the Liberal Party in Victoria, where he played a prominent part in the immediate post-war years, and he was a good, loyal and true friend in this place. I will not discuss what he did; that has been done adequately and well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a credit to this Parliament and a credit to what parliamentary life is all about. It is something that his two children, David and Catherine, and their families should be very proud of in the years ahead. I regret his passing. He was particularly affected by the death of his wife two years ago. The last two years of his life were spent in loneliness. He suffered a sad illness which took two years to take its effect. I pay tribute to Alan, and I am very pleased to have been able to say a few words today on his passing. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KD4">Mr ALDRED</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Deakin)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Alan Jarman was very highly regarded in the electorate of Deakin&mdash;not only during the 17 years from 1966 to 1983 when he was the Federal member, but right up to the time of his death, just over a week ago. Others in this place have given details of Alan Jarman's worthy parliamentary career, including his committee work. I will dwell on the contribution to the Deakin electorate of Alan Jarman, the man.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his maiden speech, delivered on 2 March 1967, Alan pledged to represent the electors of Deakin honestly and sincerely. This he did, and it is for this that he is best remembered. Alan Jarman was certainly a man of great integrity and principle who did not shirk from taking a strong stand on an issue if his belief were fervent enough. Early in his career, in October 1970, he argued in Parliament and in the press in favour of lifting sanctions against Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. He believed that imposing sanctions and the threat of bloodshed was not the way to bring the Rhodesian Government, then led by Ian Smith, to recognise the basic democratic principle of one vote, one value for blacks as well as whites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alan Jarman held strong anti-abortion views, which he maintained throughout his parliamentary term. He was also a dedicated environmentalist. He was one of the six backbenchers who openly criticised their own Government for allowing the Tasmanian Government to proceed with the Gordon below Franklin Dam, which was, as many of us recall, a very controversial issue at the time. However, it is perhaps for his work among the people in the electorate of Deakin that he is most fondly remembered. Alan Jarman was a man of the people. Many branch members recall his compassion, his unswerving adherence to principles and his great hospitality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the time that Alan represented Deakin, he and his wife, Alison, always opened their home to friends and branch members. People still remember that they had extensions built onto their home to accommodate Liberal Party meetings and functions, including the Young Liberal get togethers initiated by their son, David, then prominent in the Young Liberal movement and now metropolitan Vice-President of the Victorian division of the Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alan Jarman was a great grassroots political campaigner and had one of the highest recognition rates among all Victorian Federal members. At last recorded measure, it was over 75 per cent of Deakin electors, an extraordinary achievement on any count. I well remember his very effective campaign slogan, `Our man is Jarman', and I know that he took great personal pride in minimising the swing against the Liberal Party in Deakin in 1972 and, particularly in 1974, in increasing his majority from 700 to 2,800 votes when other marginal seats such as Isaacs and Henty fell to the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not know Alan Jarman intimately, but I did meet him on a number of occasions. The most recent was a birthday party for one of the longstanding Deakin branch members with whom Alan kept in close contact. Despite failing health, he gave a stirring speech on that occasion, the theme of which was the value of local branch members and their importance in the preselection process. It was for him a very fitting swan song. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I add my condolences on behalf of the people of Deakin to Alan's son, David, and his daughter, Cathy, on the sad loss of their father. Alan Jarman is no longer our man in Deakin, but it will always be remembered by us that he was. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my maiden speech in February 1985 I paid tribute to the public career of Alan Jarman, my Liberal Party predecessor in the seat of Deakin, and today it seems appropriate for me to add a few personal comments. Alan Jarman was a very public spirited man. One could not have a conversation with Alan without his returning to the theme of what he could do to help the community and groups in the community. He had an extraordinary knowledge of many of those groups and the people who ran them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alan may have hankered for a return to Federal politics after 1983, but he never allowed his desires to interfere in the wise counsel that he gave to me and my office. We will always be grateful for the time that he spent assisting us in the early years of my incumbency in Deakin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alan Jarman was held in great affection. The current member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) has mentioned the affection in which he was held by members of the Liberal Party in Deakin. I inherited almost intact the electorate committee and, as the years rolled on, members of the committee recalled Alan and his contribution to the electors of Deakin with great affection. I could always tell when an argument was coming to an end in the electorate committee, because finally somebody would say, `Well, that was the way Alan did it', and that would be the end of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was also held in great regard by the electors of Deakin. For years when I went around to functions in the electorate&mdash;to churches, fetes, schools and community groups&mdash;people would say, `But isn't that Alan Jarman's seat?'. When I explained the situation, they would look a little nostalgic and sometimes a little disappointed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alan Jarman was a distinguished Australian. I know and like David Jarman very much, and I extend my deep condolences to him and the family on my behalf, on behalf of the people of Deakin, and on behalf of Alan's many friends in the Liberal Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add a few words in support of the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and endorsed by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and my colleagues. Like the member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), I would like to say to the Prime Minister, `Thank you for bringing this motion on'. It is not usual that a man who was a member, and is no longer a member, has a motion moved in his memory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Politics is a strange animal. It brings together people from all parts of Australia. Whether we sit and observe from the press gallery or are part of it down here, we have a strange association. I guess my association with Alan Jarman was no closer than that of many from either side of the House. I knew him as a member of the Liberal Party; I knew him as a very committed Liberal; but I also knew him as a person who both before and after his time in parliament was committed to the public good. I think, behind all our political differences, it is probably that which characterises most who enter public life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members have a commitment to exercise a responsibility to better their country and those interests with which they might have been associated. Alan's interests were in the service of the university postwar, in politics and then in charities. It is not only for his role here but also for his work after he left this Parliament that I would like to pay tribute to Alan's memory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of us have a few years left to us when we give up whatever is our principal workaday responsibility. I trust even you might have that, Mr Speaker. I think there is a role for each of us in doing something for the community as Alan Jarman did. It is important that we understand the contribution he made. I think it was tremendous that he was prepared to give so much of his time and effort to charity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to join with others in extending to David, Catherine and other members of his family my respect for the man, my sympathy for the cause for which he worked and my very considerable understanding of the way in which, in the last two years after the death of his wife, he was able to maintain the faith. He did it well, he did it with respect and he certainly did it with the admiration of those who knew him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to extend my condolences to the family of Alan Jarman. Alan Jarman was always considered something of a family friend because my mother had been at Melbourne University in the late 1940s when Alan, together with Ivor Greenwood and Lindsay Thompson, had been so active and so prominent. Later we were effectively neighbours of Alan and his family. They lived in Linum Street in Blackburn when he was the honourable member for Deakin and we lived around the corner. I think Alan was the first member of parliament that I ever met. I considered him a very curious creature and something which, as a teenager, I knew not the essence of. But he was somebody who had a very important place in the community and who was very well known. As has been said already, he was always considered `our man Jarman in Canberra'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In due course, I served on Alan's electorate committee and got to know him more in the political sense. He was tremendously proud of having held Deakin in 1972 when seats around him had been taken by the Labor Party&mdash;seats such as Diamond Valley and Casey. I remember sitting in that large room at the back of his house, which has been referred to, planning leaflet distribution for the 1983 campaign when the room filled with smoke and ash and it was the bushfire of Ash Wednesday. Shortly afterwards the electoral fire swept through the eastern suburbs of Melbourne and Alan lost his seat of Deakin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his retirement he came to live in the electorate of Higgins. I know he thought it was a wry event&mdash;as did I&mdash;that at one stage he had been my representative and, in due course, I was his representative in the Federal Parliament. At his funeral last Friday honourable members from both sides of the House, including David MacKenzie&mdash;who, if memory serves me correctly, had won Diamond Valley&mdash;were present and it was a great tribute to Alan Jarman. He always reminisced about the fact that he moved the confidence motion in John Gorton in the party room in March 1971. The confidence motion was defeated by John Gorton himself and nobody, when they had been anticipating the outcome of that vote, had put Gorton in the anti camp&mdash;which is the way he eventually voted on that day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alan was tremendously proud of his children, Cathy and David. They are both married and both have children. They can be tremendously proud of him. He was a good father. To me, he was a good neighbour and a good representative. To the House, I believe he was a good member. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to report to the House that the Bush Administration and the European Community, the Commission of the European Community, reached agreement over the weekend on world trade in agriculture. This is a world first because in no other international trade regime has there ever been a role for a multilateral institution in agriculture. The battle for agriculture was fought by a number of nations, no less than and principally by Australia and its leadership of the Cairns Group, which my colleague the Treasurer put together during his tenure as Minister for Trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate started with our success in moving agriculture into the OECD communique of 1986. A lot of opposition from the European Community was encountered and President Reagan then moved agriculture and the communique on to the 1987 Tokyo economic summit, the G7 summit. We then saw it formally go on to the Uruguay Round as part of the agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people have played a role in this. I would like to just mention one or two events and one or two people. At that OECD meeting in 1986 there was great difficulty in getting any movement on this issue. Of course, the United States officials Clayton Yeutter and the late Malcolm Baldridge, the Commerce Secretary, played a role in this; but a person who played a particularly significant role was the Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs in the State Department, the Honourable Allen Wallis, who was a confidante of President Reagan's and who was, I think, responsible for getting the Americans to support the position we were putting at the 1986 meeting. He then went to argue, as he was Sherpa for President Reagan at the summits, to put agriculture on the GATT agenda at the 1987 summit. It then went into the Uruguay Round and it was there prosecuted by a number of countries, but the great bulk of them&mdash;the Cairns Group of countries&mdash;were led by Australia, and for our part by the work of Ministers Dawkins, Duffy, Blewett and Kerin, who for a period of over six years have prosecuted this issue with might and main. The officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade committed themselves very substantially to this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have here is not a general agreement&mdash;this now has to go with other issues back to Geneva&mdash;but we have what I think is the basis of such an agreement with the European Community in the broad and the United States Administration, the Bush Administration, agreeing on these very substantial reductions in support for subsidised agricultural products, which have been so costly and so deleterious to the interests of Australian farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this matter now resides to some extent with the French, the French technically have a veto in this matter, but whether they will be so blatant as to exercise the veto against the rest of European Community opinion, therefore damning the round in agriculture, and therefore with it probably intellectual property rights and services and the rest, I think is an issue which they will have to make their minds up about. But no doubt there will be a lot of politics played. French farmers are currently demonstrating in the streets of French cities, but again the wider interests of the European Community will have to be brought to bear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement calls for a 21 per cent cut in the volume of subsidised agricultural exports, which is a 38 per cent reduction for the Europeans, because it is 38 per cent on 1991-92, and the 21 per cent is 21 per cent over the base period 1986 to 1990. So it is actually 38 per cent rather than 21 per cent. If one looks at both the United States and the Europeans it is 21 per cent, but in the case of the Europeans it is 38 per cent. On top of that there is a further 36 per cent cut in the value of export subsidies. So there is a 38 per cent cut in the volumes and a 38 per cent cut in the values of export subsidies. The agreement also includes a cut of 20 per cent in the value of internal supports for agriculture. So we have the problem at source of too great a production of agricultural produce in Europe being dealt with a 20 per cent cut in the value of internal subsidies and, in respect of exports and subsidies for exports, a 38 per cent cut in the volume of agricultural exports and 36 per cent in the value of the subsidies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a result which, if adopted in the full GATT Round, will mean, for the first time in the lives of any of us, that we will have a much better market for agricultural products around the world. It means that this is a milestone decision not just for Australia, but for Third World countries, developing countries which have nothing to sell but agricultural produce in the main.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to pay tribute to President Bush, who has been a committed internationalist and whose administration has fought this issue, with Carla Hills and Secretary Madigan, with might and main right the way through. They were not able to get the breakthrough coming up to the US presidential election, but President Bush pressed the matter on further by bringing it to a head with the tripling of tariffs on European agricultural produce to make the point to the Europeans, which I think has brought them back to the table and exposed the opportunism of French agriculturalists on this issue. I think while President Bush's presidency will be assessed against many things, perhaps the showpiece of it being the defeat of Iraq in the war against Kuwait, there can be no greater legacy than the successful completion of the GATT Round for his presidency, and for all the countries that have had confidence in the United States in arguing and bargaining this position right through the period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conservative estimates suggest that a successful Round outcome will boost global incomes by $120 billion a year. It will be worth around $1 billion a year to Australia and increase national income, which of course can be terribly significant, and will be significant, to our farmers in this country. With programs such as EEP, the American export enhancement program, which has been of much concern to Australian farmers, with all of those subsidies and volumes going down, it means that in the long run the portents are not for expansion of those programs but for winding them down. The direction is right, and we will end up with a much better result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth making the point, I think, about the value of any country running two streams of policy in trade, multilateral relationships and bilateral.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the honourable member ought to understand the fundamentals of the issue which are that the Papua New Guinea Government is dealing with armed secession on Bougainville, which is part of the territory of Papua New Guinea. We hope this can be done in a way which avoids further bloodshed. Ultimately a political solution will be needed to bring about a lasting settlement of the issue. This is a long running issue; it has been on for a long period of time. Bougainville has been the centre of wealth for the nation of Papua New Guinea and the community of Papua New Guinea. We as a neighbouring member state have provided humanitarian assistance and we have counselled the Government of Papua New Guinea to seek a political solution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is no evidence, as was implied in some of the debate&mdash;I am not sure whether that was implicit in the honourable gentleman's question&mdash;that Australian supplied defence equipment is being used in ways other than those agreed by Australia and Papua New Guinea upon that equipment being delivered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know this has raised some concern in the Solomon Islands, and I have had some communication with Prime Minister Mamaloni on this issue. He wrote to me about it, and I have responded, saying that Australia is ready to review our annual defence cooperation program and to address any concerns that he might have; that we have made clear our concerns about the situation in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands border and have called for both governments to resolve their differences through direct high level contact; and that we are willing to consider requests from the Solomon Islands Government for appropriate assistance in border management. Those offers have been made and, while there has been, I think, an unwillingness on the part of the Solomon Islands to talk to Papua New Guinea, I can only urge that a dialogue continue, that a dialogue be re-established. Particularly after the Wingti Government was elected, there was a new opportunity for the Solomon Islands to raise this issue. I wrote to the Prime Minister in October and I await a response before taking any further steps on the defence cooperation issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I mention the support that Australia does give to the Solomon Islands under such things as the Pacific patrol boat program. When I was in the Solomon Islands for the South Pacific Forum, Australia was building a concrete pier and a base for the two vessels that we have given to the Solomon Islands under a Pacific program. One could only conclude by the civil works being undertaken, the nature of the Australian military involvement in the construction phase of those civil works and the general interest of Australian officials in the aid program towards the Solomon Islands that it is one which is tailored exclusively to the benefit of the community of the Solomon Islands. So I have communicated these thoughts to Prime Minister Mamaloni and I am awaiting a response from him. But the principal issue underlying both the issue there and that in the honourable member's question is the problem of the secessionist movement on Bougainville. The Government of Papua New Guinea has a right to protect its sovereignty over that territory, and that is the cause of the dispute. We are urging that it be settled by negotiation, by political settlement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member no doubt will be pleased by the latest figures released by the CES on vacancies reported to it, which are up some 165,000, which is 27 per cent up on the June quarter and 18 per cent higher than the corresponding quarter in 1991. The seasonally adjusted trend in the total number of vacancies notified to the CES each month continues to show an upturn, as it has done since May. Between the September quarters of 1991 and 1992 there have been increases in vacancies notified to the CES from every major industry category. The largest increases were in manufacturing, transport and storage and wholesale and retail. Consistent with these encouraging increases in the number of notified vacancies, the number of people placed in jobs by the CES has also risen substantially. In the September quarter it placed 119,000 people in jobs, which was a rise of 19 per cent on the June quarter and was 16 per cent higher than the corresponding quarter in 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The success of the CES in placing people in jobs has been underpinned by the extension of the Government's comprehensive range of labour market programs. September quarter commencements in the labour market programs were up 47 per cent on the same quarter in 1991, the biggest increase being in Jobstart wage subsidies, community-based Skillshare programs and programs for especially disadvantaged clients. Despite the difficult labour market conditions and the deliberate emphasis on disadvantaged clients, 43 per cent of people assisted by labour market programs were in unsubsidised jobs or further education three months after participating in the programs. Over the year to September, this meant that nearly 124,000 people achieved a positive outcome from CES programs, 28 per cent more than in 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is perhaps most significant from all of these statistics is that they indicate the way in which the Government and the CES, through pursuing Government policies, have been successful in coming to grips with what is the most serious unemployment issue as far as this country is concerned, and that is the situation of long term unemployed job seekers. Those out of work for more than 12 months gained 27 per cent of all CES job placements, and that is up 3 per cent on some two years ago. Ros Gittins, in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, pointed to this worthwhile piece of analysis:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main effect of the Jobstart subsidy program and the CES's changed behaviour under the Newstart strategy is to counteract the labour market's inherent bias against the long-term unemployed. . . . provided the Government keeps it up . . . we can expect that the total number of long-term unemployed will peak at a level significantly less than it would have, and will then fall at a faster rate than it would have had if nothing had been done.</PARA>
<PARA>The point about both the existence of the CES and the role it performs and those labour market programs is this: quite clearly, that public labour exchange, which virtually every member of the OECD has to assist its government and its people in providing work opportunities, is achieving very substantial successes both in the confidence of the business community in reporting vacancies to it and in the confidence of those who are unemployed in taking opportunities through that labour exchange to gain employment. In addition, those very carefully targeted labour market programs are working to pick up in particular the most disadvantaged sections of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the proposal, among many, in the Opposition's propositions that both those things should be wiped out. The Opposition proposes to wipe out the CES&mdash;it would no longer be in existence: its job brokerage function would be handed to private providers and a 15 per cent tax would be imposed on them on the provision of work&mdash;and to cut $700m from labour market programs which are addressing the disadvantaged. This is in the middle of a period of great economic difficulty when it is commonly acknowledged on all sides of politics that long term unemployed people will be with us as a problem for some considerable period, even as the economy goes into very substantial recovery. There could not be a more heartless proposal. Above all, what that proposal reveals is the Opposition's total ignorance of what is happening in this area of the job market and its callous disregard for those who confront these situations, whatever crocodile tears might get wept from time to time at the box office.</PARA>

I therefore ask the Prime Minister: given that the 1991-92 Budget was stimulatory, given that the One Nation statement was stimulatory, and given that the 1992-93 Budget was stimulatory, can he explain to the House why Australia has suffered the worst collapse in jobs over the last two years of any of the 10 main Western economies; why our current account to GDP ratio among those countries is predicted to be the highest in 1993; and why we still have about $180 billion worth of debt?

As a result of the cyclical change in the Budget and the structural change coming from the policies of the Government, that debt will now go out to 18 per cent of GDP&mdash;still one of the lowest in the world.

What he means by transitional effects is that unemployment will go up as a result of a combination of your policies, which are about cutting back on the Budget sector, taking 1 1/2 to 2 per cent out of the Budget sector, and jacking up interest rates.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of this matter of public importance today is to initiate a three-day debate on the magnitude of our economic problems, the parlous state of the Australian economy and the inability of this Government, in the midst of the worst recession in 60 years, to offer any effective solution to the problems that are now bedevilling the average Australian and the average Australian family. For the benefit of those listening to this broadcast, I note that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has yet again ducked debate and refused to participate in the defence of what he knows is the indefensible; that is, his continuing politicking at the expense of the people of Australia rather than any genuine attempt to deal with the problems of the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my matter of public importance today, I refer to the fact that the forecasts in both the One Nation statement and the recently brought down Budget are now totally discredited by just about anybody who has assessed them as well as the outturn of economic events. Yet the Government continues to fail to offer an honest and open assessment of where the Australian economy is and where it expects it to go in the next few months, let alone the next few years, as a result of the Government's unbelievably horrendous economic mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the point of view of the debate, I think it is appropriate to start with the first question that I asked the Prime Minister in Question Time today. I drew attention to the fact that, since he brought down the One Nation statement, for every nine jobs that had been lost in this country only one had been created. Nine times as many jobs had been lost rather than created since he brought down the One Nation statement, which he has claimed was a stimulatory policy designed knowingly and consciously to kick-start, as he said, the Australian economy. Indeed, that was the same explanation given in relation to the 1991-92 Budget, the One Nation statement and, of course, the recent Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They were all designed to pursue a stimulatory economic policy to kick-start our economic circumstances. Yet, as we stand here today, there is absolutely no evidence of any kick-start. There is absolutely no evidence that the economy is showing any sustained tendency to turn around. In fact, it is drifting alarmingly. There is every possibility that this economy will at least double dip, and certainly could stay particularly flat for the next 12 to 18 months at the very least, even under the unbelievably stimulatory policies that this Government claims to have put in place in the last couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is instructive against that background to recall the Prime Minister's grilling on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> last week, to which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) has referred. The Prime Minister was unable to provide any sense of direction to this country. He could not answer any questions about the likely course of economic events in Australia, and he certainly could not defend the fact that One Nation had not done what he said it would do. It had visibly failed. Kerry O'Brien pointed out incessantly that One Nation and other economic statements had failed, and the Prime Minister sat there without any answers. That must go down in Australian history as one of the most bumbling performances on any television interview in the last 10 or 15 years at the very least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is instructive to look at the forecasts that were made by this Government at the time of the One Nation statement and to get a feel for how circumstances have shifted relative to those forecasts. I think it is important to understand, as we all do this, that One Nation was nothing more than a political document. It was a cynical, political and dishonest attempt to misrepresent the circumstances on the arrival of a new Prime Minister in a desperate effort to create the circumstances where he may go to an early poll. Clearly, as time has gone on and economic circumstances have continued to drift away, the Prime Minister's exaggeration of those forecasts&mdash;to say the very least&mdash;if not blatant dishonesty has been totally exposed to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is instructive to go back to those growth numbers and look at what was projected at that time. GDP growth for the year 1992-93 was forecast to be 4.75 per cent. There was no evidence in the economic data available at that time that could have led anybody in his or her wildest dreams to argue that our economy could grow in the financial year 1992-93 at 4.75 per cent. According to the One Nation statement, unemployment was to average 10 per cent in 1992-93, and it was to fall to 9 1/2 per cent by June 1993. We were to see phenomenal employment growth of 2 1/4 per cent to achieve that outcome, with a slight blow-out in the current account deficit, which at the time it was said would be manageable. In terms of fiscal policy, we were told that the Government Budget deficit this year would be $8 billion and that by 1995-96 the Budget would have returned to surplus. These were the key elements of the One Nation scenario that was painted in terms of the economic prospects of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just a few months later it was seen in the Budget that those forecasts were completely unsustainable and unachievable. There was an attempt to give a somewhat more honest statement, still blatantly political, by down-scaling some of those forecasts that were given at the time of the One Nation statement. So instead of GDP growth for this financial year being 4.75 per cent, it was lowered to 3 per cent. Instead of unemployment averaging 10 per cent, it was admitted that it might average 10 1/2 per cent. But it was said that there was no need to worry; it would still fall to 10 per cent by the middle of next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was admitted that employment growth would be less than half of what was assumed just a few months earlier&mdash;not 2 1/4 per cent, but only one per cent. It was then subsequently admitted that the Budget deficit could not in this financial year be held to $8 billion, as was forecast; it would blow out to about $13.4 billion, and that a surplus, nevertheless, by the middle of the decade was still a realistic possibility. The rhetoric got thicker and more wordy, but the direction that the Government tried to paint was pretty much the same. Just a few months after those forecasts have been made in the Budget, it is quite clear that not even those budgetary numbers can be achieved in this financial year, let alone taking a medium term prospect of projecting a Budget surplus by the middle of this decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be interested if the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) would comment on some of the recently released data, which all seem quite inconsistent with the direction that was painted in the Budget even just a few months ago and, as I say, predicting a considerably flatter economy than was the case at the time the One Nation statement was brought down. Let us look at some of the recent numbers. Unemployment was already 11.3 per cent in October. It is supposed to average 10 1/2 per cent for the whole year, and it is supposed to fall to 10 per cent by the middle of next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unemployment rate so far in this financial year has been 11 per cent in July, well above the 10 1/2 per cent average; 10.9 per cent in August; 10.8 per cent in September; and 11.3 per cent in October. It is staggering that we are already heading significantly further in the direction of increased unemployment. I think it is particularly important that today neither the Prime Minister nor the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) was prepared to give an assurance that the unemployment rate would not rise above 11.3 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of my retailing colleagues here, the honourable member for Corinella, is quick to emphasise that when he says, `Tell me about it'. If we go outside these hallowed halls and talk to people in small business or in the retailing business anywhere in Australia they will tell us about it. If we look at retail sales numbers over the last few months, we see that July was 0.6 per cent, August was 0.1 per cent and September was flat. Yet the whole 3 per cent growth forecast for this year has been predicated on a dramatic pick-up in consumer spending.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In September, motor vehicle registrations were down 3.8 per cent and dwelling approvals were down 1.2 per cent. Capital expenditure for the June quarter was down 12 per cent. Total housing finance approvals were down 5.5 per cent. Housing finance approvals for new homes in September were down 11.3 per cent. Perhaps most importantly, given the significance of consumer sentiment, the Westpac-Melbourne Institute's index of consumer sentiment was down a whopping 8 per cent in the month of September. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that there is absolutely no chance that the Australian economy will turn out anywhere near the 3 per cent growth forecast that this Government has predicted. There is absolutely no chance that unemployment will fall to 10 per cent by the middle of next year&mdash;and honourable members opposite know it. They know it will get worse before it gets better. Yet they do not have the political courage to say so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I challenge the Treasurer to have the political courage to come clean and admit the full revised version of the forecasts for the course of this financial year and beyond. Anybody looking at our economic circumstances today, in the context of what is an increasingly difficult world circumstance, could not conclude that those growth numbers could be achieved. Most of the private forecasters&mdash;who used to be to a significant extent influenced by the Treasury and by the Government&mdash;have now left them. Even Westpac, which is one of the bulls out there in terms of private sector forecasting, has lowered its growth numbers for this year to 2 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the truth? How flat will the economy be? How high will unemployment go? I notice that those opposite come in with these little catch phrases such as `Unemployment will always be lower under us than under you', but that is only designed to distract attention from the fact that they are not prepared to admit that unemployment could rocket away under them, and they know it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at the state of the world economy. Zero growth is predicted in the German economy; the OECD is constantly scaling down its growth numbers for the rest of Europe; and for the first significant period in the entire postwar period there is flatness in the Japanese economy. There is the possibility in the United States that the economy could triple-dip. A lot of the Asian nations which have sustained growth in the last 12 or 18 months are crucially dependent on the US, Japanese and European markets, so they too will slow down. The falling commodity prices take us back to the levels of 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How will we get any significant stimulus to the Australian economy when we look at the circumstances of the world economy? Those opposite cannot run around and say that it is all due to the world economy, because it is not. In the postwar period this is the first time we have gone into a recession first. The Government took us into a recession at the end of 1989, which was way ahead of the world economy. We have passed the three-year anniversary of the arrival of this Government's recessionary period. There have been three years of pain and hardship for the average Australian, but those opposite still cannot tell us what growth there will be this year. And they still cannot tell us how high unemployment will grow. They cannot tell us whether one million Australians will be unemployed before we reach Christmas this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite know that the economic circumstances are drifting. Since the Prime Minister took over from his predecessor at the end of last year, those opposite have only been playing one political game after another and pulling one political stunt after another. Everything has been designed to distract attention from the fact that they have no answers. They cannot move. They know what has to be done, but they are not prepared to, or cannot, take the decisions to turn this country around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad story is that this country has been left to drift under what must be the worst economic mismanagement we have seen in the entire postwar period.

The fact is that vacancy rates particularly of commercial property in Melbourne and Sydney, are well over 20 per cent. Some people say that that is a 10-year problem to work off. Look at the extent to which bad debts are being written off by the banking system. Banks do not have any capacity to significantly expand their lending.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the Leader of the Opposition wants a debate, if he wants to be taken seriously in this country, how much longer will he allow a situation to proceed in which he will not have a press conference in Canberra? It is now a year since he has presented himself before the gallery in Canberra and been subjected to the kind of analysis and questioning that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and I are on a regular basis. Why is the Leader of the Opposition so terrified of those in the gallery who want to pursue him on his prescription for the economy of this country? He can come in here, day and night, and talk for as long as he likes, but no-one will listen because he has lost any shred of credibility he had. When he first became Leader of the Opposition, he said he wanted a serious debate about the circumstances confronting the country. He said he wanted to be a participant in that debate. He said he wanted to carefully analyse the problems and then suggest some solutions. But as soon as anyone criticises his solution, he cries foul and goes into his bunker and will not come out of it. He has now decided to abandon any semblance of balance in his approach to this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The speech he made today was replete with hyperbole and pessimism. When he comes to this debate trotting out statements such as, `This is as bad as the 1930s' or `This economy is doing the worst of all those in the world', he knows that he is wrong. He is just revealing that he is a compulsive pessimist. What he wants to do, time and time again, is talk this country into the kinds of circumstances which he imagines that it is in or destined for. I do not want to disappoint him too much, but the fact is that those people in Australia whose job it is to make these forecasts of economic growth and where inflation is going disagree with him totally. The forecasters in Australia&mdash;those in his own former profession&mdash;say that Australia will do better in 1993 than any other OECD country, with growth particularly, and that it is doing better than any with inflation at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Either the Leader of the Opposition wants to proceed with a sensible debate on the basis of an analysis of the real situation or he wants to manufacture his view of what is going on, concentrating only on the negatives and pessimism in order to construct his case.

People will not listen to someone who knowingly distorts, who knowingly engages in deception, who knowingly gets involved in an inaccurate analysis of what is happening in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have only to look at what has been said by someone from his own side of politics. I refer to what is probably the most damning article ever written about a Leader of the Opposition, particularly from someone who is at least a refugee from the Liberal Party, if he is not still a paid-up member of it. He used to be a key adviser to the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> a week or so ago, he absolutely demolished not just the approach of the Leader of the Opposition but also his analysis and his attempt to construct it on the basis of some rigorous analysis of the situation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At times Hewson has gone to disingenuous lengths to rationalise his politics-driven economic analysis. Asked how heading for depression is compatible with slow real growth, he maintains that `there were quarters of growth in the 1930s in that Depression, too'. Well, so there were. However, as a one-time economics professor Hewson must know that growth from a collapse of 10 per cent cannot be compared with recovery from the 2 per cent falls experienced in the 1982-83 and 1990-91 recessions.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to talk about a comparison of unemployment now with that during the Great Depression, referring, as I did in Question Time, to the fact that the participation rate is continuing on a long term upward trend. Mr Henderson said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just compare the current recession with that of almost a decade ago. In 1982-83 the participation rate stood at 60.6 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is currently about 63.2 per cent. It is difficult to be precise with figures. But the best calculations indicate that if the 1982-83 participation rate had applied, Australia's unemployment rate in 1991-92 would have averaged 6.8 per cent rather than 10.4 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>I guess his last summary of what the Leader of the Opposition has contributed to this debate is the most damning. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sure, we all expect that politicians will play politics. But there is a fine line between polemic and irresponsibility. Claims that Australia in 1992 is `back to the Great Depression' can only do enormous harm.</PARA>

The OECD wants a plan to get Europe and North America going because it understands how important it is to have growth.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the classic irony of the Leader of the Opposition. If things are as bad as he portends, why would he not at a minimum be proposing that there should be some responsible fiscal stimulus in order to deal with the question? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> This comes on top of the Opposition Leader's repeated opposition to every relaxation of monetary policy which has occurred in the last couple of years. On every occasion that the Government has done something to try to provide a stimulus to the economy&mdash;whether through a relaxation of monetary policy or the application of a sensible, responsible and well targeted fiscal stimulus&mdash;the Opposition Leader's approach has been to oppose it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government stands here proud of the action which it has taken because it believes that it is appropriate. It is now receiving the compliments of the rest of the world in terms of the approach it has taken&mdash;an approach, I might say, which has been taken more recently by Japan, which is now being advocated by President-elect Clinton and which is now being discussed actively in Europe as a means of trying to breathe some life back into the European economy. </PARA>

Then he not only puts forward a bankrupt set of propositions which would not just make unemployment worse but also he tries dishonestly to misrepresent his own policy prescriptions. He knows as well as anyone that with the combination of higher interest rates&mdash;which he knows will be necessary in order to stifle the inflationary effects of the GST&mdash;this will have a depressing effect on the economy.

He made it perfectly clear that he thought it was an important change for Australia to make to its taxation system. The Treasurer might not like to be reminded of this point, but the Secretary of his own Department, by implication, holds the scare campaign that the Government is running in utter contempt.

The Treasurer said that this was a terrible thing and we had a reiteration of all the Labor rhetoric about that. Yet the Treasurer might recall that it was he who, on 29 November 1983, talked about the devastating depression in which we found this economy. The Australian economy in 1982 was in nothing like the bad shape it is in today and he was prepared to call that a devastating depression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So he played the man and he did not listen to his own departmental Secretary's advice on tax reform, which he is too scared to confront&mdash;he does not have the decency or the courage to do that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But one of the central parts of the Labor Party's attack today on the coalition has been this attack about fiscal stimulus. Apparently what Australia needs is fiscal stimulus: pouring taxpayers' money down a black hole, dollar after dollar, and, in the old Labor way, never counting the cost of the programs and never analysing what the impact of the cost of those programs will be. Labor&mdash;as the Whitlam, Hawke and Keating governments have shown&mdash;thinks that money grows on trees. But one of the interesting aspects of the Labor Party's claims about fiscal stimulus is the proposition that apparently the OECD believes that all OECD countries should enter into some sort of fiscal stimulus, although the Government uses the words `in appropriate circumstances'&mdash;so it depends what it means, I suppose. </PARA>

During the last decade, the Labor Party, having had control of most of the States in this country and the Federal economy, has proven the old adage that Labor cannot manage money. Yes, it can handle money; but Labor cannot manage money. We can look at the chaos in Victoria&mdash;the loans affair, the Pyramid Building Society, the State Bank and the VEDC. Look at WA Inc. From my own point of view, I think we ought to look at the State Bank of South Australia fiasco which was revealed, by all objective standards, in the Royal Commissioner's report, which damned the Labor Party for its incompetent management of that bank and the South Australian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government, and in particular the then Treasurer and now Prime Minister (Mr Keating), hastily tries to scurry away and says, `It is nothing to do with us'. The then Treasurer said that he did not know about WA Inc. The Federal Treasurer, the person who was responsible for running the national economy, did not know about it! He did not know about the Victorian financial fiasco! Incredible, is it not? He said, `Never heard of it. I did not know a thing about it'. He was running the economy with the Reserve Bank in his pocket and he said,`Sorry, I did not know about the disaster of the Victorian economy and the management by my mates in the Labor Party down there'. South Australia&mdash;ditto. He said the same thing: `I did not know anything about it'. One of biggest banks in the country has gone to the wall with debts of $3 billion, he had the Reserve Bank in his pocket all of that time, he was pulling all of the levers in the economy, and he did not know about it!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who are we expected to believe? Does the Treasurer think that the public of Australia believes that the then Treasurer knew nothing about what was going on in South Australia? We happen to know that the board of the Reserve Bank, which includes the Secretary of the Treasury, discussed the problems of the State Bank of South Australia at a board meeting as long ago as 1987. Are we expected to believe that the Secretary to the Treasury left that board meeting having heard that discussion about concerns in the State Bank of South Australia, having heard that the Reserve Bank was worried about it, and decided to keep that a deadly secret from the Treasurer of this country? Are we expected to believe that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are we expected to believe that in 1987 when the then Premier and President of the ALP decided to hold down interest rates on instruction to the State Bank, during that election campaign the man who controlled the levers of the economy, the then Federal Treasurer&mdash;the man fighting for political survival&mdash;was never told about this strategy? Does the Treasurer seriously think that we are going to believe that? I know Mr Bannon has said that he did all this on his own initiative but, if we look at Mr Bannon's words from his press conference yesterday, it is interesting to see that he never revealed whether he discussed the strategy subsequent to his decision with the Federal Treasurer. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition talked about some of the difficult indicators, for example in retail sales.

In other words, he is suggesting that the OECD policy makers do not know what they are talking about when they suggest that what is required at this time in Western economies is stimulation through the public sector.

It is proposing to introduce a 15 per cent tax on all goods and services; that is, on food, on the basic necessities of life, on electricity, on anything that ordinary people need. One virtually cannot move without paying a 15 per cent tax. Anything that one spends a dollar on is taxed at 15 per cent. What is the Opposition going to do with that 15 per cent tax?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal in Fightback is to stimulate certain sectors of business, but not to lower income taxes. There is not going to be a reduction of income taxes as a result of that package. The Leader of the Opposition is hoping that the package will cause an inflationary effect, because the cost of living will go up. As soon as the economy gets that inflationary effect there will be some catch-up in wages&mdash;not much but some&mdash;but as soon as the workers receive a bit of that they go into higher tax brackets and the money is taken off them. </PARA>

If the retail sector is slow&mdash;I ask anyone who has a modicum of logic&mdash;is the solution to impose a 15 per cent tax on everything so that the price of goods goes up 15 per cent? If people at the moment are not in a position to buy enough goods, are we going to suggest that by imposing another 15 per cent tax people are going to buy more goods?  What sort of nonsense is that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the same sort of nonsense which suggests that in the middle of an economic recession we do not stimulate the economy.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Leader of the Opposition is suggesting that we impose this consumption tax and that somehow businesses will flourish. How are the businesses going to flourish?  The issue is not the cost factor, because the costs to business in Australia have been reducing in the last few years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the current context, that stimulation has to be given through the projects that we have announced in the public sector, through the sensible creation of jobs in infrastructure, in our rail system, in our road system and in our various projects to help people get new skills so that they can participate in the work force. Those are the sorts of positive measures that we have put in place. Certainly they will work in the medium term and hopefully they will work in the short term.

<PARA>The February One Nation statement was specifically designed to both revitalise the nation's key economic infrastructure and to deliver a responsible fiscal stimulus to the economy. Over recent weeks the Government has reviewed the progress of the expenditure of funds allocated to infrastructure projects in the Budget to ensure the goals of One Nation, particularly the delivery of the stimulus to the economy and the consequent employment effects, are being met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This review has demonstrated that, while most of the projects are proceeding in line with expectations, logistical and design delays would make it very difficult for the National Rail Corporation to spend prudently in 1992-93 the full amount of the $283m provided for the national rail system; and the funding provided for upgrading the electricity transmission links between the south-eastern States will not be required in 1992-93. At the same time, it has become clear that the demand for some labour market programs has been greater than was originally anticipated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to maintain the level of stimulus to the economy, the Government has decided to reallocate in 1992-93 $150m provided for rail projects and $24m provided for electricity infrastructure to other infrastructure and labour market projects. The reallocation of funds in 1992-93 from these projects does not reflect a lack of commitment by the Government to them, or their integrity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures substantially involve a rescheduling of expenditure to ensure that the desired fiscal stimulus is achieved and that projects are implemented effectively. Indeed, in 1993-94 the Government will increase expenditure on rail infrastructure by $100m and labour market programs by $16m above the amounts previously included in the forward estimates. These increases will be largely offset by reductions in spending on other infrastructure projects for which funding has been brought forward to 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has decided to introduce legislation to appropriate moneys for the specific proposals on the grounds that this is the most transparent means of providing for the Government's priorities and conveying these to the Parliament. In this regard, the Government considers that relying on the Advance to the Minister for Finance to provide that legislative authority would run the risk that there may be insufficient funds available from that source to meet other urgent and unforeseen requirements. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) seeks a total of $125.39m. Details of the amounts sought are:</PARA>
<PARA>. $17.54m for entry level training and $59.1m for labour market assistance to job seekers and industry through the Department of Employment, Education and Training. In particular, the Government has offered an enhanced package of assistance to every major employer willing to offer to employ at least an additional 100 people who have been unemployed for at least six months or who qualify as young trainees, with the same assistance available to incorporated regional authorities who propose to employ full-time additional 200 persons;</PARA>
<PARA>. in the case of new employees, these subsidies represent roughly 30 to 40 per cent of the wage costs for each employee;</PARA>
<PARA>. small business, which currently employs 60 per cent of all trainees, will also benefit directly as the subsidies for trainees will apply to all employers. In addition, there will be an increase in the rate of subsidy paid for the employment of apprentices who have been unemployed for six months or more, incentives to increase the employment of second and subsequent female apprentices in non-traditional trades, and an increase in the level of payment for off-the-job training to both TAFE and private providers;</PARA>
<PARA>. the increased funding and improvements in the labour market and training programs are expected to result in 31,000 new positions. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also seeks:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">$18.75m for the sport and recreation program through the Department of Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories to fund the construction of sporting and other facilities by local government and community groups throughout the country. Construction of these projects will commence quickly, creating jobs in many communities throughout Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">$30m for the Federal black spot road safety program through the Department of Transport and Communications. This program is a cost effective initiative to significantly improve safety standards at sites with a history of traffic accidents. In addition to improving the safety standards on Australia's road system, this increase in expenditure will create new employment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government intends to implement these measures quickly and believes that this is in the best interests of the nation. </PARA>

<PARA>Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1992-93 complements Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1992-93, which I introduced earlier. The Bill seeks a total of $56.25m, the details of which are:</PARA>
<PARA>. A total of $1.25m through the Departments of Administrative Services and Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories for the refurbishment of the Old Parliament House to provide access for the public to this significant part of Australia's heritage. The facilities offered to the public will include displays of our nation's political and constitutional history as well as other aspects of Australian society; and</PARA>
<PARA>. $55m for grants to local councils for social and economic infrastructure under the local capital works program provided through the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. Bringing forward expenditure on this program reflects the success of the program in quickly getting under way activity which will stimulate the economies of those areas which have been hardest hit by the recession while ensuring that those communities receive a lasting benefit from the infrastructure improvements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, clauses 6 and 7 of this Bill will reduce the appropriations for electricity grid and transport infrastructure which were originally provided for in Appropriation Act (No. 2) 1992-93 by $24m and $150m respectively. These appropriations are permissive rather than mandatory in that they merely provide an upper limit against which money can be expended for these purposes. While the Government could have restricted expenditure on these items to reflect the changed priorities by administrative means by the Executive or officials, we considered that it is more appropriate that this restriction be achieved by the more transparent action of amending the Budget appropriations so as to give effect to Parliament's role in approving the upper limits on expenditure under the authority of the Appropriation Acts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation comes to us in somewhat of an odd form. The reason for the Radiocommunications (Transmitter Licence Tax) Amendment Bill, the Radiocommunications (Receiver Licence Tax) Amendment Bill, the Radiocommunications (Test Permit Tax) Amendment Bill and the Radiocommunications Taxes Collection Amendment Bill being introduced in this way is that they are all effectively tax Bills and, therefore, have to be introduced in this place, whereas they are a consequence of a major reform that will be introduced in the Senate, where the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) resides, at some stage later today, and ultimately that primary Bill will come here. We are having a cognate debate on four Bills which impose taxes. On behalf of the coalition, I indicate that we will be supporting each of these Bills, but primarily we will be supporting the primary Bill, the radiocommunications reform package, which is part of the new Bill called the Radiocommunications Bill 1992, which will ultimately come to this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I want to make a few remarks about each of these tax Bills and the Radiocommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill, and then make some remarks about the spectrum management arrangements that this new reform package will bring about. I suppose that in future I will be able to come back and talk some more about this legislation, when it comes from the Senate. I am not proposing any amendments to any of the Bills in question&mdash;the primary Bill, the consequential Bills, or the tax Bills&mdash;although I do have some concerns about the process. The centrepiece of the process is that there is to be a market based approach to some segment of the spectrum and it is to be managed by a new agency called the Spectrum Management Agency, which will start on 1 July 1993 and which will be based in Canberra, as the existing spectrum managers are here also. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will commence with the Radiocommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1992. As I have mentioned, this legislation commences on 1 July and repeals a range of existing legislation. Frequency reservation certificates and temporary permits will no longer be required under the new radiocommunications licensing regime provided for under the Radiocommunications Bill when it finally becomes an Act. The transitional provisions will ensure that many of the instruments made under the old Act will be taken to have been made under the new Act, and regulations, standards, frequency band plans, permits and certificates will carry across the new Act. Transmitter licences which have been granted under the old Act will continue in force under the new Act but will not be reissued upon their expiration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequential amendments will update references to the old Act in other Commonwealth legislation and will make other changes consequential to the enactment of the new Act. This legislation includes amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1991 to allow Austel to include in standards made under that Act matters related to interference to radiocommunications. This will avoid the need for issuing separate technical standards under the 1992 Act. The Radiocommunications Bills before the House form a package, as I have said, related solely to taxation matters. The amendments are consequential on the establishment of the Spectrum Management Agency, which will determine all such taxes, but all such determinations, I am pleased to see, are disallowable instruments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will digress for a moment about disallowable instruments. It is my view that the Parliament needs to continue to be involved in a whole range of government activities. That requirement, which I have pushed consistently in the broad range of communications issues for disallowable instruments to be a requirement of the law, I think helps to buttress the institution of the Parliament in our democracy. I am pleased that the Clerks' office on this side of the Parliament&mdash;I do not know what happens in the Senate; most of us are mystified as to what happens in the Senate&mdash;has a special list of all disallowable instruments and that tells us at what time they expire. It is there to alert honourable members, if they are interested, as each of us should be but so few of us are, about the legislative processes, what is actually in legislation and what it does, rather than putting out press releases all the time. By doing the job that we are charged to do we can have a better idea of what is coming through this place. It provides the opportunity for oppositions and government members who are not Ministers to have an additional mechanism by which they can watch the activities and the progress of the Executive and the bureaucracy. I commend the use of the disallowable instruments and the summary that is now passed out to honourable members from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first Bill is the Radiocommunications (Transmitter Licence Tax) Amendment Bill. There are currently 90 different kinds of transmitter licences which can be granted and for which a tax is payable. The Bill addresses that matter. Under the Radiocommunications (Receiver Licence Tax) Amendment Bill there is currently a number of different kinds of receiver licences for which tax is payable. Under the Radiocommunications (Test Permit Tax) Amendment Bill test permits are issued by the Minister to persons wishing to operate substandard devices for purposes related to research, education or demonstration, and the word `test' is removed to avoid any suggestion that the purpose of such permits is limited to the testing of radiocommunications equipment. Then there is the Radiocommunications Taxes Collection Amendment Bill. Of course, taxes cannot be imposed unless they can be collected. Taxes are currently payable on all the annual grants of licences and permits. Under the Radiocommunications Bill the apparatus licences will be granted for a period of up to five years. This amendment will allow users to pay in annual instalments rather than a lump sum at the beginning or at the end of the five-year period. The Bill also provides that taxes may be recovered as debts due to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that I will be taking the full allocation of my time. I notice that there is only one other speaker on the Opposition side and that is the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arguments about what we should do and how we should manage the spectrum in this country commenced with a very good, detailed report from the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics, which highlighted the fact that, with the emerging and competing technologies that are wanting space on the spectrum, we need to have a different management system, and that the dark art of spectrum management which is unknown to many&mdash;I am certainly only a novice&mdash;needed to be more fully explained and exposed and moved out of the administrative area into some sort of a market arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arguments that were canvassed in the BTCE report were such that they were for a full market approach. That report was tested in a special report completed by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, of which the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), the former Minister, was Chairman, and of which the honourable member for Mitchell was also a member. This report, which is very detailed and well written&mdash;it has been received by the Government and by the Opposition with their full support&mdash;argued that there ought to be a move towards a market system of spectrum allocation. It recognises that spectrum is a scarce commodity, that those who want it cannot always be satisfied under the allocation system, and that, therefore, because of the requirement to get as many people as happy as possible, those who claim to have a priority in what they want to do will have to bid for it. That is how the system will work. But it is not, and it ought not, to be seen to be a management system that applies to all areas of the spectrum. In this country, because of the scarcity, we require that certain parts of the spectrum be kept for television, for example, and radio. The areas which are planned for those people's use are dealt with by a completely different management regime, and that is focused on the Australian Broadcasting Authority which manages that part of the spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Civil Aviation Authority and the Defence Department are not impacted by these proposals. They are a bit like pepper and salt; they are sprinkled throughout the spectrum from the high frequency to the low frequency. The radio spectrum resource provides the potential to communicate information via the electromagnetic radio waves which are artificially introduced by means of transmission equipment. The spectrum resource is defined in terms of the range of useful frequencies over which radio waves can be transmitted, and it is used to relay information through space between geographically separate points without the aid of wires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of observation, I make the point that what is happening in the technological areas now is an amazing transition: the services that are now transmitted primarily by airwaves are now seeking to be transmitted by wires or optic fibre. The converse is the case: those that have always sought to be delivered by a wire, such as telephones, are now seeing the greatest growth with their delivery by way of using the airwaves. The classic example is that the ordinary telephone comes to people's houses by way of a wire, but now people also have the option of taking on a mobile phone which utilises spectrum space. Where is the growth? It is in what is the convenient method of communicating: the mobile phone, which is the only area in which there is tremendous growth currently in the telecommunications area, and which seeks to use spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this interesting transition, as these two trends pass each other, we will see greater demands on spectrum. Interestingly today we have made decisions about pay television which we will see at some stage in the future in this country. Ultimately the best delivered method of that sort of entertainment will not necessarily be through the airwaves. Initially, it will be off the satellite, but ultimately it will be by way of cable or optics. This will provide far greater capacity and far greater channel capacity and choice, and they will be interactive; that is, a message will come into people's homes and they can dial whatever they want. The message will go out and people can do their home banking. All that is going to be done by way of optic fibre rather than by way of telephone over the airwaves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of that is changing. All of a sudden video and data are going to go down the wire, and voice communication is going to go over the air. It is those sorts of changes, if I am not being too convoluted about it, which have to be reflected in how we manage the spectrum. One of the basic properties of the electromagnetic wave is its frequency, which is the rate at which it oscillates when radiated in the form of radio energy. The unit in which frequency is expressed is the hertz&mdash;a bit like the car rental company&mdash;one hertz being equal to one cycle per second. The range of useable frequency ascends from three gigahertz to around 300 gigahertz. This range is referred to as the radio frequency spectrum; it is the use of that spectrum that this reform relates to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have here a chart&mdash;it is not a Picasso painting&mdash;which is a demonstration of what the radio frequency looks like. It is for the benefit of the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), who I know likes to keep things simple, and I guess in radio frequency discussions one has to do that. What we are trying to demonstrate here is that the market process that is being proposed does not relate to those parts that are marked in white on the chart; that is, the areas of FM, TV, UHF, satellite broadcasting, TV, VHF, MDS&mdash;the microwave distribution system which, if the pay TV Bill does get through tonight, could start providing localised pay TV early next year&mdash;AM radio, Radio Australia, and so on. Those areas are not affected by this reform but the other bits shown on the chart are. This very interesting chart details who uses the spectrum. The top of the chart shows that submarines use a very low frequency. At the other end it shows that another range of users use the high frequency. The Minister is left to make a determination as to which part of the spectrum is going to be used for the market processes. Therefore, the decisions of the Minister will be vital as this area develops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the process of this reform needs to be reasonably fast, but we are going to be limited by the physical properties of the spectrum and the great difficulties that we have had over time in clearing spectrum and the conversion arrangements, which can take a long time. Generally the principle has been to wait for equipment to run out and then ask for room to be made for somebody else on the spectrum. This process is designed to clear the spectrum a little quicker because, in my view, that administrative process is not going to deliver spectrum space to deal with what I believe will be an increasingly rapid emergence of other users who want to get access to that spectrum space. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a detailed matter. It is not a confusing matter but it is an extremely important matter because at the centrepiece of the telecommunications and broadcasting areas and potential services lie the use and access to the spectrum. Whilst we have a limitation now of the number of television licences, in the future with free to air television we may well have more people who want to compete for such space, and television takes up huge slabs of spectrum. I think the reform proposed by the BTCE and by the Parliament is a timely reform. Interestingly it comes at the end of a period of some changes in telecommunications. In a lot of those areas I have argued in this place over the last little while that that level of reform is limited. It needs to go further than it does. In a sense we are being driven by the march of technology in this area and we need to recognise that fact and accommodate ourselves to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I seek the indulgence of the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) to table a small paper that the Opposition has prepared which goes into considerably more detail about different areas of the Act. It also makes some points about how the system will work. I will detail some of the concerns that I have, but I do not think it is appropriate to take the time of the House to go through all of the matters now, so I seek leave to table the paper. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a couple of points that I want to make. Broadcasting services can be delivered directly by satellite&mdash;MDS, microwave and cable. That is the technology trend that we have to recognise. There is no longer a scarcity of communications channels as such, and the radio spectrum will be eased by digital compression and the terrestrial cable by digitalised fibre optics compression. Digital compression is a new term that we have picked up in this place over the last month because it has a major impact on pay television. What it effectively does is to move us away from the old analog system. We can cast our minds back to the pay TV debate when we were arguing about analog and how we would split up the transponders, the channels and so on. But now, of course, we have a digitised environment. We in this place have all embraced that digital video compression is the method by which pay television ought to be delivered. It provides a different approach completely and it is an approach which maximises choice. What we have long argued is that we ought not to have artificial constraints imposed upon the use of digital compressed video, which my colleagues in the Senate will have a little more to say about tonight with respect to pay TV.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very significant change from only a month ago. When we look at this area and at pay TV, we ought to recognise the change that has been brought about. A broad band network can carry both point to multipoint, for example, television broadcasts, and point to point, for example, telephone conversations, interactive and non-interactive services. That is the point I was making before about the crossover that is taking place. That crossover to technologies is the centrepiece of the requirement on public policy makers to respond in how we manage and grant access to this spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view what will happen is that there will be an emergence of spectrum management agents&mdash;a bit like real estate agents. They will identify spectrum space opportunities for particular service providers and will do all the necessary bits and pieces for the Spectrum Management Agency to secure that spectrum and then seek to get the relevant licence for the relevant fee that will need to be bid for. One of the concerns that I have is that, if that emerges, we do not want to have people buying up spectrum space to try to capture spectrum space in an anti-competitive way. I do not think enough thought has been given to some of those dangers. </PARA>

Obviously this legislation and the main Bill being introduced in the Senate pretty well wind up the process dealing with these issues in the period of government from 1990 to 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay a significant compliment to the officers of the Department who have been working their way through many changes in policy and changes in approach to give effect, in legislative terms, to what we have decided to do in these areas. They have also, obviously, provided professional input to our thinking on this issue. I commend them for the expertise and professionalism with which they have tackled these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Government was re-elected in March 1990, and the Ministry of Transport and Communications was taken up by the present Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley), there was a keen awareness within the Government that there needed to be an acceleration in the area of micro-economic reform as it related particularly to transport and communications. As I was Chairman of the Government's Caucus committee in this area, I can say that there was no shortage of lobbyists, representing a whole range of interests, who reinforced that view. The first people I spoke with were from the radio industry. They were very concerned about changes in technology, changes in spectrum and their relative position vis-a-vis all the changes taking place in communications technology, in marketing and in the public or commercial broadcasting fields. Down the line from what we call commercial broadcasting has been a range of interested users of various kinds of radio communications technology, be they emergency services groups, volunteer groups or public broadcasters, who have all taken an interest in this and have had some say in the way the spectrum has been changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was pleasing to note that, towards the end of his contribution, the honourable member for Bass made adequate reference to the emerging digital compression technology. I think it is fair for everyone to understand that, even with the work that has been done by the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), and the recommendations which have been submitted to and adopted by the Government about changes to spectrum management, we are trying to keep up with rapidly changing technology and rapidly changing demands for scarce space. We know full well that, whatever changes we may be making and facilitating at the moment, it is quite likely that with the arrival of digital compression in radiocommunications the whole picture will change quite dramatically. It is a little difficult at the moment for a government and people at our level of involvement to say exactly how that might take place. I make the point that we will be relying heavily on the professionals in the Department to keep ahead of those developments and perhaps to let us know how we should be positioning our thinking on dealing with digital compression in the field of radio spectrum management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been dramatic reform in the field of communications with Minister Beazley, ex-Minister Richardson and now Minister Collins. The legislation has been completely rewritten and introduced in the form of the new Broadcasting Authority and its various aspects. There was an urgent need to clean up and enforce clear rules of ownership of broadcasting licences, particularly as they related to commercial television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many honourable members will remember all those debates about how much foreign ownership there ought to be, the cross-media rules, and the whole box and dice. It seems as if we have thought about nothing else for three years. I would say that in the broad portfolio of transport and communications this has been no more than just one of a number of issues that have had to be dealt with. But within the communications area the debates have covered the field of the ownership of commercial broadcasting licenses, be they radio or television, the restructuring of the broadcasting legislation, the development of the new Broadcasting Authority, the work that has been done on spectrum management and radio licences leading to the legislation in place now and the establishment of Austel as the telecommunications industry regulator and the body that will play a key role in licensing equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Bass said, in the past changes in licensing and broadcasting patterns have tended to try to accommodate changes in technology. We are now finding that the technology is rapidly outstripping the ability to just put in place a set of rules and regulations that adequately covers it. So we have had to develop approaches which are more flexible and yet still enforceable, and at the same time we have had to look to the question of industry policy to ensure that there is as much Australian involvement as possible in the manufacturing of&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his support on that principle, because it is an overriding principle within the Government and one that he has argued vociferously through Caucus discussion. In fact, one might say that in the Government he is the advocate of Australian industry. Obviously, part of the requirement of Austel has been to ensure not only that the equipment which is licensed meets the needs of spectrum management, but also that the Government's industry policies for the development and maintenance of the industry are reflected in the sort of equipment which is licensed. That is going to be evermore so a requirement as pay television and digital compression, mobile phones and the rest of it come into these fields.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also been through a massive reform of the telecommunications system, including opening up to competition the monopoly Telecom with the introduction of Optus and the second and third mobile telephone licences. All those issues relate to scarce use of ear space and hearing space and the technology by which we reach people in their homes. Minister Collins, who came to the portfolio halfway through the year, has all of a sudden found himself having to embrace a wide range of issues. I think he has been able to do so in a way that reflects the need not only to satisfy the various interests but also to understand the processes in the Senate, which requires some expertise. It is often a bit of a maze that we certainly do not understand here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins has had the difficulty of trying to negotiate support for his legislation not only through this House&mdash;and I think the honourable member for Bass has been both understanding and cooperative right through that process, and he is commended for that&mdash;but also through the Senate. For whatever reason, Senator Collins has met many frustrations. So I guess that understanding and working through that process in order to achieve these vital reforms is very difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation that we are passing today is obviously going through the House with the support of the Opposition. It is basically a machinery function, and that is fine. It is the process by which we are introducing another set of major reforms in a very fast moving, probably the fastest moving, part of our economy in spectrum management and new technology in broadcasting, be it radio, television, telephones, mobile phones or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the outset of my contribution, it is an area where officers of the Department in particular have had to take a very pro-active approach in making sure that the legislation not only meets the needs of users in the industry but also keeps pace with changing information, changing decisions that have been made within the Government and changing priorities. I assure all who have assisted the Minister in that process that they have both my encouragement and my sympathy for the traumas that have been involved. Having said that, I support the legislation and welcome the fact that the Opposition is also supporting it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support the remarks of my colleague the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe). I thank him for his contribution and, as always, his very intelligent commitment to the broadcasting issues. His involvement in the communications area is considerable and acknowledged by people in the community, both professionals and consumers. I am sure that it is also acknowledged in his electorate. As the honourable member for Burke pointed out very accurately, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) has been helpful in respect of this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are four Bills before the House concerning essentially the management of the spectrum generally. The honourable member for Burke referred to the Spectrum Management Agency. I want to address a couple of issues in relation to spectrum management matters. The first is a matter of concern in relation to radio stations. There has been a cycle, and people would have been aware that in the 1980s there was clearly an asset valuation that saw radio station prices become somewhat unrealistic. That was the first thing. The second thing was the move largely from many radio stations out of the AM band into the FM band, again at somewhat inflated prices. We are now in a more realistic period where radio stations are finding their feet, so to speak. Many radio stations are finding great difficulty in returning a profit, because they are trying to service overvalued assets. However, the thrust of what the honourable member for Burke said is that we are now adopting a very intelligent approach to the management of radio stations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is always this tension between the need for regulation and the need for greater freedom in the marketplace for players in the spectrum. But we also have to acknowledge that, if there is not proper spectrum management, things do happen. The honourable member for Burke referred, very accurately I might say, to the development of things such as the mobile telephone networks; we also have equipment such as CB radios being developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless there is proper management, which implies regulation of radio signals to begin with, we run the risk of getting conflicts, including sometimes interference between free to air services. These include radio signals and other signals that are likely to cause disruption. I want to make the general point that, whilst we talk about deregulation, unless we have management we end up with unsatisfactory conflicts in the marketplace which cannot always be easily resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One source of irritation in my electorate occurs when there is interference in radio and television signals. The law is somewhat silent on this. There was a torts case in England in which there was an attempt to establish that overhead transmission towers with high voltage lines were causing interference with television signals. The law is not really on the side of the individual consumer in this respect. As members of parliament, we do from time to time get approaches on matters like this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to be conscious of the need to manage. In Perth there is one particular aspect which my colleague the honourable member for Burke, who is from Melbourne, would not have to face. This is a ground conductivity problem. Perth is basically a sand plain with high concentrations of limestone, which absorbs radio signals. The signals do not bounce very well, so AM stations in particular have a distribution problem. The growth of Perth as a city has meant that it is difficult for some of the AM stations to get their signals to the outer suburbs. I particularly refer to 1080 and 882 6PR, which have some problems getting their signals distributed. With more sensitive spectrum management I think that this can be more readily addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times we have seen developments in the public broadcasting area. This goes back to the days of Whitlam. I refer particularly to a station in Perth called Radio 6NR, which is having some difficulty changing attitudes towards its sponsorship and the requirement that there be certain sponsorship announcements during certain hours of broadcast. This is an issue raised with me that we need to be conscious of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To explain this for the benefit of the House, 6NR takes a signal from the BBC, the BBC World Service, and the BBC requires that the program not be interrupted by sponsorship announcements. If we insist that the station broadcast sponsorship announcements, it cannot continue to offer this service. I would like the advisers to know of this matter because it is something that needs to be addressed and examined.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This station also tries to offer uninterrupted coverage of football games. In fact, it adopts the same notion that sponsorship announcements should not interrupt the coverage. It is a matter to be addressed. I am told that the current requirements are somewhat restrictive, so I would appreciate this matter being investigated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another local problem involving spectrum management concerns radio station 882 6PR. Honourable members would be aware that in various States of Australia the TAB either owns or has an interest in radio stations, obviously to get a coverage of racing. Here I refer to getting to air the greyhound racing and trotting events. It happens that the TAB owns 882 6PR in Perth. Conflict has arisen because the TAB has been insisting that 6PR should put an increasing number of race meetings to air. This has  considerable potential for conflict with the talkback offerings of the station. Quite frankly, in the long term, this imperils the station's survival because there is not a sufficient racing market to sustain a station the size of 6PR. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to resolve this, 6PR management&mdash;Cheri Gardener and her colleagues&mdash;very intelligently approached the ABA to see whether it could apply for a special narrow cast licence. The intention is that 882 6PR will offer its normal program&mdash;and these days it is largely a talkback program with a very good news service&mdash;interspersed with major metropolitan race meetings and the rest of the race meetings will be serviced by a separate transmitter and a separate signal. The signal that has been identified is 1206 on the AM band, formerly occupied by a station called 6KY and which has now become KYFM.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am talking here about race meetings in luminary places such as Wauchope. I expect that the Deputy Speaker, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar), although he is a man of considerable savoir-faire, has probably not been to Wauchope. Nor have I, so I do not know that the whole population of Australia glues itself to these broadcasts. The honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) will be aware of some of these out of the way places that are asking for these events to be put to air. That is fine, let us do that, but let us not occupy major metropolitan radio stations with these events. By all means put metropolitan broadcasts from places such as Randwick and Flemington to air, but certainly not the more out of the way ones. I think that we can have the best of both worlds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am encouraging the radio station and the TAB to pursue that course of action. When we next hear Wauchope races being broadcast in the new year I hope it will be on this other transmitter, on the 1206 position on the dial, and not on 882, because then we can ensure that the 70-odd people employed by 6PR will be able to service both those markets. While many people are devoted to having a punt, many people believe that enough is enough and that it is better to separate these two services. I put it on record that I think this is an issue that needs to be addressed. I might say that the ABA is being very helpful. An application has been lodged and a spectrum point has been identified at which the station can broadcast. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to commend the 6PR radio station manager, Cheri Gardener. She has been very concerned about serving her listeners, the people who support the station by way of advertising, and certainly the staff of the radio station. I believe this issue can be sensibly addressed under this new arrangement. Interestingly, this process is somewhat deregulated as we have not had to go through this whole public hearing stage. I think that is a very important innovation as the TAB is likely to be the only major bidder for such a facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now move to another issue relating to spectrum management. It relates to the ABC. The ABC puts to air an excellent program called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Grandstand</EMPHASIS> which, as we know, from this weekend will be broadcasting, amongst other things, the Australia versus West Indies cricket match from the Gabba. I wish the Australian players well. Probably the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) will be there; I know she is very busy and an effective campaigner. The match will involve some distinguished Queenslanders, Craig McDermott being one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC does very well in putting this program to air, but there is a particular problem in Western Australia as we have a three-hour time difference. We are not enlightened enough to have daylight saving. On Sundays the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Grandstand</EMPHASIS> program does not begin until 12 noon, which is 3 o'clock in the afternoon in Melbourne and Sydney and 2 o'clock in Brisbane. Listeners in Western Australia are being denied a lot of coverage of these important events. I am hopeful that test cricket can go to air earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment we have a gardening program and an arts program in the morning. I am devoted to gardening, but I think the coverage of gardening could well be run at some other time. I have a considerable worry that historically the ABC has been somewhat preoccupied with arts coverage. Basically the blue singlet community, if I can use that term, is ignored by the ABC, with the exception of sporting broadcasts. Those people pay tax too. Why is it that the ABC is resistant to dealing with the ordinary person? I am troubled by that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the ABC can take the matter on board&mdash;and I am sure that Neville Oliver, as the Director of Sport for ABC radio, will take it on board&mdash;and that the refusal of 6WF to put <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Grandstand</EMPHASIS> to air earlier can be dealt with. We do need a proper coverage in a State such as Western Australia. It has significant implications for many listeners, and I want to draw attention to it in this radiocommunications debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC has obviously already undertaken the cost of producing the program. What it now needs to do is to take that next huge step for people&mdash;that is, to press the button and let the program go to air. I know it is a big step, but it is a step that can be taken. It will let the program go to air in Western Australia, where it is fudged by putting to air a local program&mdash;in this case, a narrow audience requirement&mdash;which could have been put to air at any other time during the week. I appeal to the ABC to try to address this issue in a sensible way, and I am sure that it can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are talking about the proper management of the spectrum, we ought to be talking about the proper management of radio stations which are operating within that spectrum. I want to address those remarks specifically, and I appeal to Glenn Darlington and George Grljusich in Perth to try to address the matter. I know you, Mr Deputy Speaker, have heard of those people. I hope they can address that matter properly and let the ABC coverage continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a particular interest in this matter. ABC metropolitan stations used to carry the parliamentary broadcast signal. I thank my colleagues because, were it not for the cooperation of members of Parliament in having the signal moved from metropolitan ABC to another spot on the dial and using the stand-by transmitters, we would be dominating radio stations such as 2BL, 3LO, 6WF and 5AN all around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliament was sensible. It let the signal be moved and made good use of the spectrum. But I think the ABC has to say, `Having done that, how can we sensibly make these adjustments?'. In the light of that, I appeal to the ABC to listen to this question, because in Western Australia distance is a considerable problem. WA tends to be somewhat remote, and it is organisations such as the ABC that keep us linked in. It can do that only if it puts to air programs that have broad-based listener interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next matter regarding the spectrum is Radio Australia's coverage. On Saturdays Radio Australia puts to air the 3LO coverage from Melbourne, which is the sporting coverage, and that goes to people all around the world. On Sundays it puts to air the 2BL coverage, which covers Sydney rugby league and other matters. These are already produced by the ABC, so they are relatively cost-free, with the exception of one or two people in the Radio Australia studio on Saturdays. I was alarmed to see that Radio Australia was moving to cut these broadcasts. Australia is noted for many things, one of which is sporting achievement. In the international arena, people&mdash;be they expatriates or from other nations&mdash;are interested in how Australia is performing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ought to do two things. This Parliament ought to say to Radio Australia, `You should keep your sporting coverage there because it is important that people around the world can hear about what is happening in sporting matters'&mdash;and they do. In particular, I am thinking of service personnel who are posted overseas. I was appalled at the initial response I received from Radio Australia, which said that it does not have a strong commitment to servicing Australian expatriates. I find that appalling. Why should that be the case? It did say there was a Cabinet submission that said it had to lower its commitment to expatriates. I have not been able to find where Cabinet said, `You shouldn't be servicing an expatriate audience'. My response was, `Expatriates pay tax. Why should they not be serviced? Why should people who are in embassies and consulates, who are overseas working for Austrade, who are overseas working on business&mdash;and we are encouraging people to go overseas on business&mdash;and service personnel who are overseas not be provided with a service?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the decisions are made by people who seem to take delight in polishing Volvos in Manuka and who live in comfortable situations. But there are many people in my electorate who work in outback places in Western Australia, as they do in South Australia and other large electorates, who do need coverage by organisations such as Radio Australia&mdash;that includes the electorate of Maranoa. I need to remind those people who live in great comfort in downtown Melbourne, Canberra or Sydney that there are people in outback Australia whom we ought to be servicing. Guess what? The ABC services them mostly, but Radio Australia also services them. I remind Radio Australia, and Mr Broinowski, that it does have a total obligation. He should ask the AWU members who work in many remote localities on drilling rigs and offshore platforms in remote mining localities what Radio Australia and the ABC mean to them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 originally was to amend three Acts. Subsequently, it was expanded to deal with four items and, at 2 o'clock today, we found that yet another item had been added to the list, yet another amendment&mdash;an amendment to the Australian Institute of Marine Science Act 1972. I have to say that the processes of this place are breaking down. How on earth is anybody supposed to seriously address these sorts of matters when they are thrown in at the last minute, with no notice, I might say, to the Opposition? In some way or other I suppose they are supposed to sneak through.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) will address this matter a little later, but I have to say that it is a scurrilous way of dealing with the business of this country. As we saw the other day, introducing 70 Bills in a matter of a fortnight is a ridiculous way of dealing with legislation and matters of great import. I have no idea whether this amendment is a matter of great import because I saw it only about 20 minutes ago. In fact, nobody in this place saw it until Question Time when it was thrown on the table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This omnibus Bill deals with four items which I will take one by one. The first item is to extend the life of the Automotive Industry Authority from 1992 to 2000. The second item proposes amendments to the National Measurement Act to extend the role and powers of the National Measurement Commission and tighten the policing of the accuracy of measurement equipment. The third item amends the Science and Industry Research Act 1949 to provide for decisions about residual terms and conditions of appointment relating to the office of the Chief Executive of the CSIRO to be made by the Minister rather than by the Governor-General. The fourth item in this omnibus Bill relates to the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905 and the Trade Marks Act 1955 and provides for stiffer penalties to be imposed for counterfeiting and forgery of trademarks and for falsely describing imported goods or goods intended for export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is opposed to two parts of this Bill; namely, the extension of the life of the Automotive Industry Authority to the year 2000 and the amendments to the National Measurement Act. We will, therefore, be moving amendments at the committee stage to have these clauses omitted. I would like now to deal with each part of this omnibus Bill in turn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Automotive Industry Authority is a Commonwealth statutory body, established in 1984, to oversee the implementation of the Commonwealth Government's post-1984 plan for the Australian passenger motor vehicle industry. The Automotive Authority's functions are to encourage industry to develop in a way consistent with the policy of the Commonwealth Government, to promote change within the industry directed to improving its efficiency and to monitor the performance of an outlook for the industry. The proposed amendment to extend the life of the Authority will involve ongoing annual running costs of some $1.1m and cover administrative expenses and salaries and 215,000 annual property operating expenses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's well-known policy with regard to the automotive industry is to phase out protection to 5 per cent&mdash;not to zero as is put about by the Government, erroneously&mdash;by the year 2000. This is in line with our policy of negligible protection for all industries at that time. That is because we have a longstanding opposition to direct intervention in these industries&mdash;in fact, in all industries&mdash;and there is no purpose, therefore, in retaining such an authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times, there has been a Morgan poll on the car industry. We do not know who commissioned it; nevertheless it has been published. A number of interesting points came from that Morgan poll. For example, when asked whether near zero tariffs would mean a more efficient car industry, no car industry, no difference, or they could not say, a majority of Australians answered that near zero tariffs would mean a more efficient car industry. In fact, 42 per cent answered that way and 34 per cent answered another way. In other words, they said that there would be no Australian car industry. That is a point with which we totally disagree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the same people were asked the proper questions arising from the coalition's policy, questions which encompassed the whole range of coalition policy&mdash;and those questions would be whether near zero tariffs would mean a more efficient car industry, a better car industry or a more profitable car industry, along with tax cuts of the order of 50 per cent of the business taxes that those industries pay, along with personal tax cuts of 30 per cent across an average of Australian consumers of cars, along with a fuel tax reduction of 30 per cent of people's fuel bills, whether they are private citizens or in business&mdash;we would get a completely different set of figures again. We would not only have a majority of people saying that there would be near zero tariffs under these circumstances with those other very beneficial changes, meaning that we would have a more efficient car industry, but also we would have many more than 42 per cent of people opting for those changes. In other words, I suggest that when the right questions are asked, different results come out&mdash;results which are more accurate in regard to the sorts of conclusions that people ought to reach rather than those that are reached on questions that are a little short of information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's well-known policy, as I have said, is to reduce industry protection to 5 per cent by the year 2000. This Morgan poll shows that without the right questions being asked we can still get 42 per cent of the population considering that reduced tariffs will lead to a more efficient Australian car industry. Of course, a whole lot of other benefits come about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An independent analysis done by ACIL consultants, which represented the car industry only a couple of years ago in its submission to the Industry Commission, says that the industry will produce about 350,000 more Australian cars by the year 2000 under our policy than under the Button plan. Even if it is half right, a great deal of benefit will be conferred not only upon the consumers&mdash;who under our policy will benefit from cheaper cars, the reduction of taxes, the reduction of costs, the reduction of their own taxes and, therefore, more after tax income, the reduction of fuel costs and so forth&mdash;but also upon the dealers and the manufacturers because they will have more throughput. As everybody knows, we have to have a minimum number of vehicles going down a production line to get the economies of scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People will benefit through greater competitiveness and through the maintenance of a higher share of the Australian market vis-a-vis imports. For instance, we are now looking at the export of the Mitsubishi Magna and other cars. We will be able to export more cars because our costs will be lower. If those things come to fruition, which we would expect, then there will be greater employment of people in that industry. The people in the industry will have more secure jobs, because those jobs will be based on a greater throughput and a greater certainty of export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that people understand these facts in these sorts of debates. We will make sure that people benefit from the micro-economic reform which we will bring about. It is quite tragic that this Government has given up on micro-economic reform. Honourable members do not have to take my word for it; the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) said not long ago that&mdash;and I paraphrase his words&mdash;there is no further to go on micro reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free), who is at the table, is smiling at that mistake. It is a monumental mistake. It is quite wrong to say that we have gone as far as we can go on micro reform. I think it was Ross Gittins who, in an article in the last day or so, wrote, `Of course, we have done some micro reform, but we have not done nearly enough'. That is absolutely right, because the lack of cost savings impinges upon the cost of making a motor car, whether the motor car is made in this country for consumption in this country or whether it is made by a car company that wishes to export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For each year from 1994 through to the year 2000, the ACIL report said that car manufacturers and car dealers would be better off under Fightback. Cars will be more affordable&mdash;they will be cheaper to buy and cheaper to run. It also said that as the coalition will abolish fuel tax and because consumers will be paying less income tax, as I have said earlier in this debate, people will have higher disposable incomes and will be able to buy more motor cars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There would be no purpose in retaining the Automotive Industry Authority, which is a sort of vestige of Labor's failed policies for the Australian car industry. Honourable members do not have to take my word for that; they should ask all of those people who have lost their jobs in the automobile industry in the last three or four years. Thousands upon thousands of people have lost their jobs under this Government's policy. They have lost those jobs because the Government has not made the savings which it could have made in the public sector. It has not made the micro reforms which are so important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, in South Australia the bill for power at the Mitsubishi works went up by 18 per cent in the year before last. On the one hand, we are saying to these manufacturers, `You have to get your prices down. You have to cut the costs of making these things', and on the other hand a State government is allowed to put up, through its own inefficiency no doubt, one of those costs by 18 per cent. We will be opposing that particular part of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments to the National Measurement Act 1960 will provide for the certification of reference materials, many of which come from overseas, so that the measurements made using such materials satisfy the traceability provisions of the Act. The amendments also provide for the pattern approval and certification, as found appropriate, of measuring instruments used for legal purposes other than trade measurements, so that such measurements will comply with the traceability provisions of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the test procedures used to determine the amount of error in a measuring instrument to be specified in certificates of approval, uniform trade measurement legislation being introduced by the States and Territories requires the test procedures to be specified so that uniform testing is ensured following the licensing of industry personnel to perform instrument certification. The amendments provide for the examination of measuring instruments to ensure compliance with their approved pattern. They also provide for the clarification of Australia's obligations under the convention establishing an international organisation of legal metrology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consultation process between industry and government has been non-existent. This has been admitted by Senator Button in the other place. If it has not been non-existent, it has clearly been deficient. Indeed, the weighing industry was not even consulted during the preparation of this Bill. As Senator Bishop outlined in the other place, Senator Button himself recognised that there was little or no consultation in a letter that he wrote to that industry association on 8 September. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your Association has also criticised the lack of consultation on the legislative amendment, and expressed fears that this is a means for the Commission to introduce a load cell pattern assurance scheme by stealth. I understand the Commission accepts that consultation on the legislative amendments was deficient and more attention will be paid to informing and consulting stakeholders in future.</PARA>
<PARA>Bravo! That is a fine admission by Senator Button. However, it does not help the weighing industry one bit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major concern of that industry is that the National Standards Commission which administers the Act will expand its role into areas already covered by the States&mdash;which I read out earlier&mdash;leading to the duplication of those matters and higher costs for the industry. In the States, the industries are monitored by the weights and measures branches of the Department of Consumer Affairs. The Commonwealth Government involvement in this area has essentially been to set the standards, with the checks on compliance being handled by the States. The amendments take the Commonwealth Government into the area of compliance checking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also appears that no serious attempt has been made by the Government to weigh up the costs and benefits of the amendments proposed, particularly the costs of sampling procedures. The weighing industry submitted that previously the National Standards Commission proposed to apply a fee of $1,550 for each sample load cell tested. There appears to be no limit in the amendments on how many samples can be taken and at what frequency. Therefore, there is potential for very substantial costs to be imposed on the industry, and these should be examined properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some justification for government regulations for measuring equipment, to the extent that consumers who are not in the position to check the validity of measuring equipment&mdash;for instance, at petrol bowsers and the like&mdash;can be protected through such regulations. However, the amendments will provide for regulation far beyond the scope of consumer assurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there is already a substantial delay&mdash;about a year, in fact&mdash;in gaining approval for new products through the National Standards Commission. Yet the amendments propose that the Commission should expand its role with no additional Budget outlay. There is a case for the Commission to concentrate on its existing role, to do it properly and to deliver the services it currently provides more effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum states that the amendments to the National Measurement Act have no financial impact. However, as we have pointed out in another place, the National Standards Commission in the recent Budget gets an increase in operating expenses from $1.45m in 1991-92 to $2.17m in 1992-93, which seems to me to represent about a 50 per cent increase in operating expenses in one year alone&mdash;a bit like the Budget itself. We will be pursuing that matter further in the committee stage following the Estimates reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were two amendments moved in the Senate by the Australian Democrats. The first was to delete the clause relating to entering premises for the purpose of selecting and measuring an instrument to be used in carrying out a procedure, and removing any sample from the premises for the purpose of carrying out that procedure. This amendment was not opposed by the coalition, as we had grave doubts about the search and seizure powers and the manner in which they were to be imposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment, that any regulations made under this section must provide adequate safeguards for the rights of persons affected, was also not opposed by the coalition, as we believe in protecting the rights of the individual. The coalition will be moving an amendment in committee to have the clauses related to the National Measurement Act omitted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendment to the Science and Industry Research Act 1949 provides for decisions about residual terms and conditions of appointment relating to the office of the Chief Executive of the CSIRO be made by the Minister rather than the Governor-General. It brings the section of the Act into line with current legislative practice. We will not be opposing this section of the Bill, as it is basically a housekeeping amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main purpose of the last section of the Bill concerning trademarks, which was added some time after the Bill was originally processed, is to impose stiffer penalties for counterfeiting and forgery of trademarks and for falsely describing imported goods or goods intended for export. These amendments are in line with the recommendations of the report of the working party to review the trademarks legislation entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Recommended changes to the Australian trademarks legislation</EMPHASIS>. The amendments also incorporate the concept of implied knowledge on the part of the defendant to cover both actual knowledge and recklessness, and provide for the characteristics of the defendant and the surrounding circumstances to be taken into account in the proceedings of the Trade Marks Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments have come about as a result of serious concerns raised by the industry, namely the Anti-Counterfeit Action Group and other parties, about the inadequate levels of penalties for forging trademarks and for importing and selling counterfeit goods. There have been an increasing number of interceptions by Customs of falsely described goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry has not in the past mounted any cases against alleged forgers or counterfeiters as the court costs would have far outweighed returns and certainly would have outweighed the penalties handed down to the offenders. The penalties have not been reviewed since 1985. This legislation provides for a fiftyfold increase in penalties and the option of a two-year imprisonment. The penalties are based on those imposed under the Copyright Act. We will not be opposing that section of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 makes several amendments to the Automotive Industry Authority Act 1984, the Science and Industry Research Act 1949, the Trade Marks Act 1955 and the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905. The first major amendment introduced by this legislation is in part 2 of the Bill which alters the Automotive Industry Authority Act 1984 to extend the effective life of the Automotive Industry Authority by some eight years. The original termination date for the authority was to be 31 December 1992; however, under this legislation the termination date will be extended to 31 December 2000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment is necessary as a result of the industry statement brought down by the Government in 1991 in which the Prime Minister announced new arrangements for the</PARA>
<PARA>automotive industry until the end of this decade. When it gave this commitment, it also announced that it would maintain an independent body over this time period so that the performance of the industry could be monitored and the Government could be kept informed on the progress being made. The decision to maintain this watchdog body was made on the recommendation of the Industry Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since its establishment, the Automotive Industry Authority has developed a reputation for providing unbiased and independent advice to the Government, based on its unparalleled level of expertise. The work the Authority already has in place means that it is the best body to carry out the monitoring role the Government has in mind for it to the end of the decade. In order for it to continue functioning in this capacity, the authority will need $1.1m to cover administrative expenses and $215,000 in annual property operating expenses. This figure is based on the present level of funding and has been agreed to be a reasonable level by the Department of Finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill includes a minor amendment to the section of the Science and Industry Research Act 1949 that relates to the office of the Chief Executive of CSIRO. The Bill brings that section into line with the practice for other statutory bodies where decisions about terms and conditions of appointment are made by the Minister rather than the Governor-General as is the case under the existing legislation. This amendment will have no financial impact on the CSIRO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same cannot be said about the proposals being put forward by the Opposition in the area of science and technology. It should be of no great surprise that the Fightback document does not even mention science and technology. The only mention of the area at all is in terms of cuts to funding which would occur if the coalition were to occupy the treasury bench. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the coalition's policies there would be a $20m cut to science and technology agencies during the first three years of a Hewson government, energy research funding would be cut by $30m, higher education research funding would also be cut by $39m, but, above and beyond this, the introduction of a GST would have a devastating impact on commercial and industrial research which would attract a 15 per cent tax. The good news relating to R&amp;D tax concessions is that I noticed the Opposition has decided to follow the Government's lead and support the 150 per cent tax deductibility, which is encouraging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps most disturbing of all is that the CSIRO, and other organisations that carry out similar research, would suffer a 10 per cent cut in funding in what is described as an efficiency saving by those opposite. It is incredible that cutting back on Australia's research and development effort could be described as an efficiency saving. This is the type of short-sighted attitude that has held back scientific research in this country for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every time cuts are made, the first place they are made is in research and development, because economic gurus, such as the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), see little benefit from such research in the short term. On top of these deep cuts to funding, I understand that the Opposition is seriously considering proposals that include the privatisation of the Government's $100m CRCs, restructured funding for CSIRO along the lines of the New Zealand model, and the abolition of the Australian Institute of Marine Science. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's policy amounts to the withdrawal of government support for industrial research. Those opposite would sell the industrial research projects undertaken by the CSIRO and other public sector agencies at bargain basement prices. Only research done for its own sake would be supported by those opposite, and they have demonstrated no understanding of the need to link research in with the development of commercially viable goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many other research agencies would suffer cuts. The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, an organisation that performs nuclear research and provides medical isotopes for the thousands of sick people, including cancer patients who require isotope treatment, would suffer direct cuts of $18m over the first three years, severely limiting its ability to operate effectively. On top of this, ANSTO also estimates an additional cost of $100,000 a year to administer the GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Science and Technology Council would see its funding reduced by $1m under the coalition, with the council itself being merged with the Prime Minister's own science council. Such a cut in the council's budget could not be achieved without a substantial cut in functions undertaken by the body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bureau of Meteorology would see its funding reduced by $30m over the first three years of a coalition government. The effect of this cut would be to delay installation of new equipment and reduce the quality and frequency of meteorological reports and warnings, which are crucial to a lot of our areas. This would make these things difficult for industries such as tourism, farming, shipping and aviation which rely heavily on the advice provided to them by the bureau. While this Government is committed to providing adequate government support to Australia's research and development effort, those opposite clearly are not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third major change that will result from this Bill is the amendments it makes to the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905, which makes it an offence to trade in goods to which a false trade description has been applied. During the past year the Australian Customs Service has found an increase in the number of garments and footwear to which a false trade description has clearly been applied. Clearly, penalties for importing falsely described goods have to be introduced in order to discourage this activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The penalties that currently apply for this offence under the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act have not been increased since the legislation was introduced over 87 years ago. To address this problem, part 2A of the Bill will introduce increased penalties for contravening the Act, and it is expected that these amendments will result in an increase in revenue received by the Commonwealth. Two recent decisions of the Federal Court held that decisions for articles of uniform cross-section but of indeterminate length were not registrable under the Designs Act 1906. These decisions have the unfortunate effect of cancelling many registered designs, going against the spirit and policy behind the original legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 2B of the Bill will make a change to the Designs Act 1906 to overcome this problem. The amendment is retrospective so that any of the current design registrations affected by the two Federal Court decisions are not invalidated. The amendments also include provisions that protect and compensate anyone who acted in the belief that the registration of a design was invalid as a result of the Federal Court's decisions. The Government does not anticipate that this amendment will have any significant revenue implications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third Act that will be amended by this legislation is the National Measurement Act 1960. This Act is the basis for the Australian national measurement system. The objective of the Act is to ensure that these measurements are consistent across Australia and are also congruous with measurements in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill amends the Act to take into account the uniform trade measurement legislation that has been introduced by State and Territory governments. The effect of these amendments is to allow a broader range of legal measurements than are presently covered by the Act. In addition, the amendments will clarify Australia's obligations under the international convention on legal metrology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the amendments will ensure that Australia's legal measuring instruments meet national and international standards. When an international convention was signed in 1959 to establish an international organisation of legal metrology, Australia supported this convention. The organisation was given the task of calculating international requirements for legal measuring instruments and those countries that are part of the convention are morally obliged to implement these decisions as far as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the world moves more and more towards an international market for world trade, the importance of this convention has increased, particularly in regard to its relationship to the GATT agreement on technical barriers to trade. The amendment contained in part 2B will clarify Australia's measurement obligations under this convention and will reduce the difficulty of signing mutual recognition agreements with Australia's trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) was presented with the report of a working party which undertook a review of the trademark legislation. This report included recommendations that the present penalties for selling or importing of counterfeit goods and for forging trademarks be increased. In this Bill the Government addresses this issue by amending the Trade Marks Act 1955 in order to introduce increased penalties for counterfeiting and forgery, the first increase in penalty since 1985. The decision to take this action was announced by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) as part of the Government's package of assistance to the textile, clothing and footwear industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the amendments introduced in this Bill continue this Government's record of targeted support for Australia's export earning industries. This Government has done more than any other government to open up Australian industry to international competition. The reforms introduced by the Government have had as their aim the increased efficiency of domestic industry, in order to encourage industry to take up the opportunities that exist in international trade. We on this side of the House recognise that this is the only way that Australia will be able to enjoy sustainable levels of growth and employment in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This strategy has met with a considerable level of success, with exports of elaborately transformed non-metal manufactures growing at an annual rate of 15 per cent. This compares very favourably with the rate of 5.5 per cent which prevailed during the last five years of the previous Government. Since 1987 the overall level of manufactured exports has more than doubled. Under this Government the export of services has increased by 82 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the past six years, Australia has had the highest level of growth in manufactured exports of any country in the OECD. We are now double the OECD average for growth in manufactured exports. Clearly, we have taken great strides forward in developing the export base in Australia under this strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this Government has done everything possible to encourage the internationalisation of the Australian economy, it will continue to provide Government support to Australian industry against unfair competition from foreign competitors. Honourable members opposite are seeking to cut all Government assistance to industry by reducing all tariffs in Australia to zero and stopping all other assistance to industries undertaking the restructuring they need to become internationally competitive. </PARA>

Bodies such as the Automotive Industry Authority have played a vital role in the process of restructuring, and the need for the continuation of active government involvement in the process of restructuring is obvious.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Nationals are slowly realising the devastating implications for domestic industry of Government support for import competing industries being withdrawn altogether. There are even members of the Opposition Leader's own Party who strongly disagree with the policy direction being taken by the coalition at the moment. Take, for example, the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) who, on 9 September this year, told this House that his Party's Rambo-like obsession with reducing industry assistance is clearly an increasingly dangerous and exposed minority position in the world at large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's policies on industry assistance have also caused a great deal of concern among business people involved in the industries that would be affected. Of course, the Automotive Industry Authority was set up to help the car industry through the restructuring process. The Opposition's zero tariff policies, if they were introduced, could very well wipe out Australia's automotive industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All four of Australia's major car manufacturers&mdash;Ford, Toyota, GMH and Mitsubishi&mdash;have said that future investment in Australia's car industry is in jeopardy as a result of the coalition's tariff policies. In March of this year, on the Channel 9 program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Sunday</EMPHASIS>, the head of Ford Australia, Mr Jac Nasser, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certainly at zero tariff levels, or very low tariff levels, it would be extremely difficult to justify new investments in the automotive industry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Bob Johnston, the President of Toyota Australia, also said that Toyota would not be able to survive on zero tariffs. In March, Toyota announced an $800m investment in the motor vehicle industry in Australia, but this investment would be unlikely to proceed under zero tariffs. Rather than creating jobs, the industry assistance policies of those opposite would actually result in higher unemployment. That would be the end result. Rather than the constructive measures introduced by this Government, such as the Automotive Industry Authority, measures which are designed to help industries to adapt to the pressures of the international marketplace, those opposite would simply tear down the tariff barriers and leave industries to fend for themselves. This Government will continue to support industries in their efforts to become globally competitive through measures such as the ones contained in this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I may, I will turn quickly to the Government's amendment to the Australian Institute of Marine Science Act 1972, and refer to AIMS. I wish to place on the record my appreciation of Dr Joseph Baker. Dr Baker wrote to me just the other day&mdash;and, I am sure, to a lot of other members as well&mdash;advising that his seven-year term with AIMS has finished. I believe that Dr Baker has done an outstanding job in his work there.  I had the opportunity, with one of the parliamentary committees, to visit the AIMS operation south of Townsville, where my good friend the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay)&mdash;not the Minister for Science and Technology, who is at the table&mdash;is the Federal member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The operation of AIMS is actually quite incredible. I think that the amendment that has been put forward tonight by the Government will certainly further enhance the opportunities for AIMS to expand. I believe that Dr Baker has done a tremendous job. I have also had the opportunity to meet him here in Canberra on the odd occasion as well. I think that with Australians like Dr Joseph Baker, who make such a strong contribution to these sorts of projects, particularly in the marine science area, we have a great future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that it is only with people like Dr Baker that that will be achieved. I am sure that he will be sadly missed by AIMS. Certainly, he will not be lost to industry generally. I understand that he is going back to the position he had before. I would just like to put on the record my appreciation of Dr Baker. I am sure that my colleagues in the Parliament would support me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might leave it at that. I am very pleased to have the opportunity tonight to rise and support the amendments. I believe that they are a continuation of the commitment by this Government to deal with many of the problems facing the industry, science and technology area. It is an area that is vital to Australia's future. I am sure that we need to work more and more to ensure that Australia expands in that area. I think that all the young people in the country today who are studying science have a bright future and I am sure that with the continued commitment of this Government, that future will be assured.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is regrettable that the Government saw fit to have only a solitary member in the House when we are debating this important legislation. The Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill provides the opportunity for the Opposition to examine the Govern ment's policy and what it has achieved over the last three years. The Government's policy and its provision for industry and commerce has been quite disgraceful. We only need to think back to 26 February 1992, when the Government responded to concerns from industry and tabled a document entitled One Nation. Obviously everyone has forgotten about it now, because over the last 12 months the Government has not talked about One Nation; it has talked about everything but One Nation. One would have to ask: what has One Nation done for industry and commerce in Australia? The promise in that document of 800,000 new jobs over four years has been broken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has failed miserably in its ambition mainly because of its faulty industry and commerce policies. It has not provided the policies to enable us to thrive and progress. Almost one million people are now out of work. Those figures in the One Nation statement are grossly exaggerated. Nothing in that policy provides encouragement for industry to take on employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will run through a few of the measures that were outlined in the One Nation statement because I think it is timely to remind people of exactly what One Nation promised for Australia. I want to refer to two initiatives on page 5 of the document. Those initiatives were to get things moving by implementing the proposals that the Government said it would try to implement: providing $300m to Australian families with children&mdash;that is fair and reasonable&mdash;and providing major capital works programs of permanent benefit to the nation. I want to address this latter measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amongst those major capital works programs were some of the big projects, as those opposite called them, such as building a rail highway and competitive ports. After 12 months of One Nation, those big projects have had funds taken away from them, particularly the rail network, which was to provide a standard gauge national rail highway from Brisbane to Perth via Melbourne and Adelaide. Rail transport is extremely important in this nation for industry and commerce. The Government, however, has now seen fit to dump that program and completely walk away from it. It has given no idea of when that work might occur and when the cost benefits for industry and commerce might flow on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, on page 8 of that document, also made reference to generating power. I want to refresh the memory of honourable members about this program. It is in the area of power generation that some of the biggest cost savings can be achieved for Australian industry. In this country we have the capacity to produce cheap energy, yet the Government has seen fit to divert funds from the south-eastern Australian grid into other programs. The Government has turned from the long term job creation schemes and long term benefits for industry and commerce to short term fixes in an effort to go to the election with a diminished number of people on the unemployment list. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government made a promise in One Nation of offering $100m to upgrade the transmission link between New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. That has diminished by more than $25m. Of course, that program will now be put on hold and industry and commerce throughout Australia will not reap the benefits of lower power costs. In fact, power costs will increase as a result of the Government's decision not to proceed with that program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government also mentioned in One Nation that it was going to provide the opportunity for the private provision of public infrastructure. We have had 12 months during which that opportunity could have been taken up and absolutely nothing has happened. The Government does not want anything to do with the private sector in this nation providing the infrastructure. There are very good firms and industries who are interested in providing that infrastructure; and they would provide it at a very economic cost. But the One Nation document spells out that they were going to do it. Twelve months have elapsed and absolutely nothing has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 11 of the document the Government directed its attention to exporting. It said that it would help build a productive base for Australian exports and that the potential increase in our exports by 1994 is $20 billion. It would have to revise that target now because nothing has happened in its program. It says that, of this, the potential to increase trade to Asia is $13 billion. Those things have not happened. It is important for industry and commerce to know that the Government is assisting them in meeting export demand. We have a huge reservoir of markets just to our north-east, right into China, and all the near South East Asian countries. We have India not that far away with massive markets for our industry and commerce to project their exports into those nations. The Government has achieved nothing in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At page 13 of that document the Government talks about textiles, clothing and footwear, which are important industries in Australia. This omnibus Bill allows us the opportunity to raise many of these concerns because the Government said it was going to help the textile, clothing and footwear industries to become more competitive. What it did was to provide $30m to allow the industries to adjust to the phase-out of reductions in tariff. That $30m might have sounded like quite a healthy amount of money, but under the Fightback package, if today we abolished wholesale sales tax, fuel excise and payroll tax alone, we could save $300m for those industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is the Government talking about a tenth of that. Instead of removing all of those oncosts to those industries the Government gave them $30m to help them adjust to any structural changes. It could have done something positive. It could have abolished payroll tax, the wholesale sales tax and the fuel excise tax and saved industry $300m. The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free), who is at the table, should think of all the jobs that would mean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its conclusion, the Government went on to say that, under its strategy, within four years the Federal Budget will return to surplus and it will have created another 800,000 jobs, clipping 3 percentage points off unemployment. The Minister at the table knows that One Nation has failed absolutely: it is dead in the water. The Government has done absolutely nothing in the last 12 months to help industry and commerce in this country. It has set out a strategy, the strategy has failed completely, and there is nothing for industry and commerce. They are not just my words. In today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> there is an article by Michael Lynch entitled `Industry reform hits snag', which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Seventy-eight per cent of senior executives from large and small manufacturing companies believe that government policies act as an impediment to economic reform, while a similar proportion (76 per cent) agreed that engineering academics were generally out of touch with industry needs, according to a survey by the Institute of Engineers, Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study was off a small base&mdash;17 companies&mdash;but it involved in-depth, hour-long questioning sessions with executives covering a range of issues. The questions were developed by the Institute of Engineers, with assistance from the Business Council of Australia and&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>wait for it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Federal Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce.</PARA>
<PARA>So they put the questions up; the questions were not engineered by the coalition. These were questions put to industry by the Government's own Department. That study, and the answers to those questions, said that most manufacturing companies in Australia believe that Government policies act as an impediment to economic reform. What a damning indictment on the Government and its policy. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The survey showed that while 92 per cent of executives recognised the importance of fostering innovation, only 57 per cent had put in place specific practices to encourage it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three-quarters of the respondents identified concepts like benchmarking, standards of international best practice and total quality management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just over half thought Australian industry had a good workplace culture, although most saw trends towards improvement.</PARA>
<PARA>That article is a damning indictment of the Government's policy for economic reform, and most industry people recognise that fact. On the other hand, the Fightback package which has been prepared by the coalition parties has taken notice of what industry is saying. It has looked at the cost impact that various measures have on productivity and the things that are preventing industries from getting up to world best practice standards and total quality management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the biggest impediments in Australia is the wholesale sales tax on manufacturing industry and commercial activity. It gets into the field of retailing as well with some of our large retailers, but under the Fightback package we will be abolishing wholesale sales tax. That will save Australians $9.4 billion. Most people do not realise that they are paying wholesale sales tax on a whole range of issues. Right now they could be paying anything from 10 to 20 or 30 per cent on many of the goods they buy, and those taxes are hidden from them. That is one item that would help all manufacturers, all industry, and all commerce in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue is that the petroleum tax, the fuel excise tax, will be abolished. Most business people will tell us that one of the major oncosts in industry and commerce is the cost of transport and what it represents to the cost of an item which they have to manufacture or sell. Under the Fightback package, petroleum taxes will be abolished, saving $6.6 billion. Petrol and diesel will be cheaper, and that will bring down the cost of transport of raw materials going to industry for manufacture and the delivery cost for the finished product. It will save around 19c also for private operators and owners of vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third issue that I want to address is payroll tax&mdash;a massive impost on business throughout Australia. Payroll tax works against the best interests of continued employment growth. The larger a firm grows, the more efficient and productive it becomes and the more staff it puts on, the more it pays in payroll tax. The coalition in its Fightback package has said it will abolish payroll tax. This will flow on to every industry and commercial activity in Australia. It will save Australian business close to $6 billion. This is the main hidden tax on job creation. Businesses can go back into the business of creating more jobs as a result of the abolition of payroll tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other things which apply to industry and commerce in this statement which we have given an undertaking to abolish. One of them is the training guarantee levy. We believe that should be abolished. At the moment there is a one per cent payroll levy on all employers, and we will remove that. This will mean more jobs because that tax is working against the interests of every industry, every manufacturer and every commercial activity in this nation. It impedes the progress of a manufacturing enterprise in developing its industry, particularly where an industry is hoping to get into export markets. Our competitors on world markets do not have this burden of payroll tax&mdash;a tax that is working against the growth of employment in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing that is really important to the Government appears to be to have a lot of short term measures, which it has spelt out in the One Nation package. As I have said, over the last 12 months since this package was introduced, the Government talked about it for about the first two months, maybe three months if we are really stretching the point. But when have we heard anything about One Nation recently? We have not heard one word about One Nation, mainly because the Government's forecasts in One Nation have proven to be totally wrong and totally inadequate. The Government has not addressed the fundamental problems facing Australia. The answer to those problems is to remove the oncosts of industry and commercial activity in this nation so that industry and commerce can get up and run again, become efficient and productive and employ more Australians in their work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this is probably the last time that we will hear about the One Nation package. It is strange that it has to come from somebody on the coalition side, but the Government is not prepared to talk about it at all. </PARA>

That is spelt out in fact in the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> from which I quoted. They are not my words; they are not the coalition's words. They are from people in industry, answering questions that were put to them by a department of this Government. It framed the questions. It put them to industry and industry answered. But the Government does not want to listen; it does not want to make things more productive for industry in Australia. What it wants to do is to put more and more impediments in the way of industry to manufacture successfully and compete in world markets.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Amongst other matters already dealt with by my colleagues on this side of the House, the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill provides for various amendments to the Australian Institute of Marine Science Act 1972. Effectively, the Bill alters substantially the effect of sections 9 and 10 of the Act which bear, respectively, on the functions and powers of the Australian Institute of Marine Science, or AIMS as it is commonly known. In doing so, the Bill represents an effort to align the existing or traditional mission statement of AIMS with contemporary policy directions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the case that increasingly over the past decade the Parliament has come to accept the importance of redirecting a deal of the public sector scientific research effort so that it captures direct economic benefits for the community. This policy direction has been most in evidence in the application of the requirement on research agencies, including ANSTO, CSIRO, and more recently AIMS, to obtain up to 30 per cent of all their expenditures from external or non-appropriation based sources. This instrument, however crude it may appear to some, has been important in altering the character of the public research sector. In essence, the external funding requirement, in hand with other factors such as the enlightened management of the agencies and the willingness of their staff to embrace change, has driven public research bodies into more commercial orientation with respect to their operation and management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who are not familiar with the public research sector will not appreciate the fundamental changes in attitude and culture which have swept the research community in the past few years. Some have adapted more quickly to change than have others. But, irrespective of the pace of change towards a more commercial orientation across the sweep of their programs, the wider community can be assured that those who work under the aegis of the national public research sector have worked hard to meet the Parliament's changed policy perspective of their role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember well that in the late 1980s whenever I went to such bodies as CSIRO and so on there was great consternation about the difficulties wrought by changing policy. But this feeling has largely dissipated now and by and large there is a broad based acceptance of the legitimate requirements that this Parliament has enacted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill gives formal legislative recognition to the role of commercial programs within the charter of AIMS. There is nothing unusual in this regard. The Parliament has only just amended the ANSTO Act in the same way so as to legitimise its commercial programs and to allow the organisation to achieve a much greater degree of interaction with private companies and industry groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specifically, a number of amendments have been made. The first amendment places in all relevant parts of the Act the phrase `marine science and marine technology', where, in the past, `marine science' was used. One can immediately see the change in emphasis with the introduction of the words `marine technology'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment modifies section 10 of the Act in such a way as to allow AIMS to perform, to participate in the formation of companies and to maximise the financial return to AIMS from any of its intellectual property rights, inventions, designs, computer circuits and so on. It has been confirmed by AIMS, particularly after discussions with the Australian Government Solicitor in Townsville, that the amendments will maintain the original philosophy of the Act but allow for an extension of its interpretations to cover those issues relating to income earning and to bringing about the objectives of reaching the 30 per cent appropriation level for AIMS from non-appropriation based sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On advice from the retiring Director of AIMS, Dr Joe Baker, I am led to believe that the commercial strategies of AIMS may be summarised as directly applying the results of its research and the expertise of its staff to the relevant industries, and separately to local, State and Federal Government agencies with respect to proposed commercial developments. The emphasis is on a number of commercial areas. The first is the oil industry, specifically with reference to the operation site and to that location on the coast where the oil products are transferred; the studies relate to chronic and acute effects. The second area is the mining industry, specifically with respect to those industries that are operating in an area which will directly or indirectly affect the coastal zone and the marine environment in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area is the tourism industry which is based in, and/or dependent on, the marine environment. The fourth area is mariculture, with specific reference to prawns, but also with respect to understanding the differences of genetic stocks for other potential farm species&mdash;for example, giant clams and barramundi. The fifth area is fine chemicals and biologically active substances from the sea which may be a base for the establishment of an Australian pharmaceutical or fine chemical industry. Honourable members can see that AIMS has an extensive commercial program agenda and we certainly respect AIMS for the way that it has gone out and sought industry involvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In drawing to a conclusion my remarks in regard to the AIMS amendment&mdash;if I can call it that&mdash;I would like to pay tribute, particularly with the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) present, to the retiring Director of AIMS, Dr Joe Baker. As of two weeks ago, Dr Baker's seven-year term as Director of the Institute concluded and I am told he has assumed a senior research position in the Institute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian society has a great many heroes. I have heard members of this Parliament pay tribute in this House to sportsmen or sportswomen in their electorate or to those who have reached dizzy heights in the arts. But we do not recognise often enough researchers or scientists who contribute in so many different ways to the enrichment of Australian life and most importantly of all, I dare say, to economic progress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Joe Baker has overseen the establishment and early years of the Australian Institute of Marine Science and deserves the recognition of the House. On a personal level I have always found Dr Baker to be an extremely knowledgeable and fair man. He is one of those truly wise people and I have found him to be of tremendous assistance to me in any number of ways in better understanding specifically the Institute of Marine Science but also marine science more generally. I am sure that Dr Baker will not be lost to AIMS or the cause of marine science. This is in no way a valedictory; it is instead a tribute as he departs the formal position of Director of AIMS. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank those honourable members who have taken part in this debate and I will respond to some of the points that have been made. The honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) devoted some of his time to a discussion of tariff policy and automotive industry policy. Like the Opposition's GST, its tariff policy and approach to the automotive industry is a dud. It is not a question of asking people the wrong questions and getting the wrong answers. The people know what the questions are. They are giving the Opposition the answers, and it does not like them. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) described the GST, the Opposition's tariff policy is also a dud.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study to which the honourable member for Barker referred, which shows the effects of coalition policy on the automotive industry, has been questioned by the industry and serious commentators. Its growth projections are unrealistic. For example, nobody believes that motor vehicle sales will top one million units by the year 2000. On the other hand, the Government's automotive industry policy has a proven track record. I point out to the House that exports tripled between 1984 and 1991. In 1991, $1.6 billion worth of automotive products were exported. All indications of the increasing international competitiveness of the Australian industry are that in 1992, despite the recession, our major market exports will at least equal the 1991 figure. If current trends continue, we should export $1.17 billion worth of automotive products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, the coalition's policies will put all of these achievements in jeopardy. Under this Government it is anticipated that the industry's investment between 1992 and 1995 will increase by 15 per cent in real terms over the previous four years. Moreover, the industry has made it quite clear that, should the coalition seek to impose its policy, much of that investment may not go ahead. In other words, that additional investment is in jeopardy should the coalition win office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also point out that the role of unions during these trying times has been most constructive. Rather than calling strikes or making unreasonable demands, they have worked closely with employers to improve both productivity and quality. Over that time industrial disputes have declined. The honourable member for Barker stated that labour turnover in the industry was high. This is, in fact, not the case. In 1991 average labour turnover, excluding retrenchments, in the producer section of the passenger motor vehicle industry was 5.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Barker raised six points when speaking about the amendments to the National Measurement Act. First, he stated that consultation with the industry was deficient. I understand that the Weighing Industry Association of Australia has formally supported the concept of pattern compliance on a number of occasions: at the Macquarie University trade measurement seminar in 1982, in the report of the working party on funding of trade measurement control in 1983, at the 1984 meeting of a delegation from the trade measurement industry consultative committee with the then Minister, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), and at the second industry liaison meeting in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given this level of support for pattern compliance by industry, given the fact that support has not until now been withdrawn, and given the fact that the industry has placed on record no objections to the investigative powers of the States and Territories, the Commission was of the view that industry had provided longstanding support from 1982 to 1986 for the concept of pattern compliance. Once the concerns of the Weighing Industry Association became apparent, the Commission took every opportunity to assure the Asssociation that it had misunderstood the amendments and that its concerns were unfounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the accusation that the National Standards Commission will expand its role. This is quite true. As a result of a program evaluation of the Commission undertaken by Dr Kevin Foley, additional resources have been provided to the Commission in areas other than trade measurement&mdash;resources that it has been crying out for for some time. The increased resources relate to such areas as national measurement policy development, aspects of legal measurement, national time policy, skills enhancement and capital funding for the establishment of an electromagnetic susceptibility test facility to ensure that substandard trade measurement equipment is not dumped into this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point was made that the amendments take the Commission into the jurisdiction of the States trade measurement legislation. In response I say that, when the function of pattern approval was transferred from the States to the Commonwealth in 1965, the power to investigate offences was omitted. The National Measurement Act includes an offence if trade measuring instruments do not comply with their approved pattern, and there is a penalty associated with that offence. However, the penalty is currently unenforceable as there is no power to investigate offences. The amendments relating to pattern compliance are there to address this anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth point that was made relates to the costs accruing to industry&mdash;that they will be about $1,500 for each load cell. The amendments do not include the power to levy charges for pattern compliance testing, and the Attorney-General's Department has advised that the Commission will not be able to charge for such testing. I add that this advice has been communicated to the Weighing Industry Association of Australia on several occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth point raised was that the amendment will cause additional delay in pattern approval. It is not intended that a significant amount of compliance testing will be carried out, as the Commission does not have the resources to fund it and such testing is regarded as a last resort. Therefore, the amendment will have no significant effect on pattern approval delays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, it was claimed that the amendments will have no financial impact, whereas the Commission's appropriation has increased from $1.45m to $2.17m. As I think will be clear to honourable members from my previous comments, this increase provided in this Budget, an increase which has been sought by the Commission on a number of occasions, relates to program activities which are not related to these amendments. So I hope the honourable member for Barker is a little happier than when he spoke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I respond briefly to comments by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), particularly his charge that the Government has done nothing to assist Australian industry over the last 12 months or for a period before it as well. I do not know whether the honourable member for Bendigo took the opportunity to read an excellent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of last Saturday week entitled `Clever by design'. It is a very worthwhile summary of recent developments in Australian industry, particularly the role that government programs have played in assisting it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bendigo also may not have taken the opportunity to read the science and technology policy of the incoming Clinton-Gore Administration in America. He will find some surprising similarities between steps that the new administration intends to take to assist American industry and steps that are being taken here. He may be interested to find, for example, that the Clinton-Gore Administration intends to introduce an industry training program funded by a measure which is remarkably similar to the training guarantee levy in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among other things, the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> refers to the far-sightedness of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), the man responsible for programs such as factor F for the pharmaceutical industry, the partnerships for development program for the information, technology and telecommunications industry and the export facilitation program in the car industry. I think that a reading of this article might assist to redress what is obviously a clear deficiency in the grasp that the honourable member for Bendigo has in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank my good friend the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) for his support of the AIMS amendments. As always in these matters he responds positively when the Government has a good measure, and I hope that I will be around for quite a while to offer him a good example which he may follow in the fullness of time. Certainly, I welcome the support of the Opposition for the AIMS amendments. They are important. As the honourable member for Gippsland pointed out, these amendments bring AIMS into line with other government research agencies in providing for them to undertake commercial activities which spin off from the core research activities. With the Australian Institute of Marine Science at Townsville soon to be establishing a branch operation in the north-west of the country with an Indian Ocean focus as well, I think it is particularly important that these amendments receive swift passage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I echo the honourable member's warm words of commendation, congratulations and good wishes to the retiring Director of AIMS, Joe Baker. I was pleased that the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) also mentioned Dr Baker in his contribution. While all this goodwill is flowing around the place about AIMS, I wonder whether the honourable member for Gippsland is in a position to tell us whether he still has in his Party's draft policy a proposal to abolish AIMS. Perhaps the Christmas spirit might move the honourable member to recant on yet another nasty feature of Opposition policy. In the spirit of goodwill, I thank those who have made a contribution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose part 2, comprising clauses 3 and 4. This amendment concerns the Automotive Industry Authority and the proposal of the Government to continue that authority to the year 2000. In the other place, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) was asked, in effect, why the authority should continue. As far as I can see, he referred to it on two occasions. On the first occasion, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has compiled a very useful set of measures for assessing quality in automotive manufacture. With changes in productivity improvements in design and so on, these are all crucial issues for an industry of this kind. It is very important to have objective measures of what has been happening. For that purpose, the life of the Automotive Industry Authority, in the view of the Government, should be extended.</PARA>
<PARA>On the second occasion, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Automotive Industry Authority has been a source of objective information about a whole range of issues, and it has been partly its guidance that has brought the automotive industry in this country into very much better integration in the world automotive industry. That is something for which the Authority is to be very much congratulated. It performs a very useful function.</PARA>
<PARA>`Bravo', I say. That is fine, but it costs $1m a year to provide that information; to provide, as the Minister says, a series of measurement arrangements by which the industry measures for assessing quality in the automotive industry. I think that is perfectly okay. But why do we spend all that money when these industries are now mature industries? These businesses are mature businesses. Their parent&mdash;and each one has a parent in another part of the world&mdash;is a mature parent. They have access to the Massachusetts Institute and everybody else, and they can make those judgments like anybody else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important in this debate to answer this fundamental question: why do we need these separate authorities which are set up to evaluate the performance of very senior world players in their own right in their own industry, some of which have been going since the inception of those industries? The American firms concerned have been going since the inception of the automotive industry, one of which, General Motors, prior to the war was in the business of buying a whole range of automotive manufacturers. It obviously had an enormous range of expertise from those areas. The other, Ford, is a household name throughout the world. I have no idea how the Automotive Industry Authority can add to their knowledge and their ability to make measurements in regard to quality and such like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) raised a couple of subjects which I think I ought to mention. He raised the subject of facilitation schemes and how well they have done. It is worth pointing out at this point that a facilitation scheme, which is a scheme whereby an import credit&mdash;that is, the ability to import something duty free&mdash;is raised by adding value in Australia and received by exporting that added value in the form of a motor car, or as a part from a motor car in this case, is paid for by the Australian taxpayer. So we can actually go around and be very pleased with ourselves for exporting a whole lot of product in this industry. I think that is very commendable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we have to understand who has encouraged those exports, and we have to understand that when those imports come in to offset those exports by the build-up of an import credit, that money is made up for that deficiency and the duty paid is made up by the Australian taxpayer. When the Government says that it is very pleased with the results of its facilitation schemes, whether in this industry or in the textile industry, it ought to say&mdash;which it never does&mdash;that offsetting that is a whole lot of extra imports that come into this country, albeit imports that come in duty free, when import duty has to be paid on other imports of like type. It is a very important matter to understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister said that there was throughput in the industry of 5 1/2 per cent in the workplace in 1991. That is incredibly high. Here we are in the middle of this Government's recession, its own self-started recession before that of anybody else in the world, designed by the man who for most of Question Time sits right where the Minister is sitting, and suddenly, in the middle of that recession, we have an employment throughput of 5 1/2 per cent. I bet not many industries in this country would care to boast of an employment throughput of 5 1/2 per cent. Yet the Minister stood here a moment ago and said that he thought it was a good result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is a pathetic result. In fact, it is a higher result in turnover than we would see in Japanese industry in a non-recessionary time. If the Minister looks up the figures, he will find that to be the case. This shows that those opposite have no idea of how to run business. As the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) said in the MPI today, those opposite really do not understand money. All they understand is policy which is designed to appease some people. They have failed in a Federal sense, they have failed in a State sense, they have failed all over this country, and it is time they realised it. The statement about a turnover of 5 1/2 per cent in 1991 was an incredible one. It is very revealing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to comment on one other thing the Minister said. He said that under the coalition policy the car manufacturers have not committed themselves to reinvest. Let me get this absolutely clear. Toyota has said it will reinvest. General Motors has said it is continuing to reinvest, as it has said since 1986, and that came from the mouth of Bill Hamill at a public meeting in Adelaide not long ago. Ford has not said it will reinvest under the Government's policy&mdash;in fact, under either policy&mdash;and neither has Mitsubishi. Why is the Minister not accurate on this subject? Neither of those two companies has said it will reinvest under the Government's 15 per cent and no tax cuts. Let us make sure everybody is accurate on this subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to my original point, which is the subject of this amendment, having been provoked into diverting slightly&mdash;within, I am sure, the reasonable latitudes of this Parliament. The Opposition opposes the Bill in regard to part 2, clauses 3 and 4, because we do not think that such an authority is necessary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In order to decide whether or not to agree to an extension of the Automotive Industry Authority from 1992 to 2000, I have a very simple question to pose to the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free), the answer to which will help me enormously in reaching my decision. Who wants the authority's life extended? I would like to know. Let them come forth. Let the industries or the companies that are lobbying for the continuance of this quango for another eight years identify themselves, because my constituents would like to know just which of those big companies think that the taxpayer should needlessly fund a $1m authority.

I do not for the life of me see how billion dollar businesses in Australia such as the car companies could expect the authority to continue at taxpayers' cost, particularly when we know that the design of supposed successors of that authority can so easily be done and are being done in different ways by the car companies themselves. Let us tell the impoverished people of Australia, and Gippsland specifically, which of those companies are calling for the Automotive Industry Authority to continue in its present form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have another question to pose to the Minister before I finally reach a conclusion on this matter. How can he have boasted only a few moments ago and at the same time chided the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) for not recognising the tremendous advances in design engineering in Australia? He even quoted a newspaper story on the design engineering successes. I am sure that is very true and it is something we ought to be very proud of. But he cannot tell me there is some special skill attached to the Automotive Industry Authority. It is not the reservoir of a body of knowledge not available anywhere else. If the design engineering in Australia is so magnificent, as he would have us believe, as a result of government policy&mdash;which I find slightly hard, if not impossible, to accept&mdash;the big car companies, with all their billions of dollars of turnover, can certainly employ those skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On practical grounds, the car companies and manufacturers have easy access to the supposed skills the authority provides. On social and even moral grounds, I do not believe the taxpayer should be funding an authority which is really a cash transfer to the big car companies. In the absence&mdash;expected, I sadly have to concede&mdash;of the Minister answering my two questions satisfactorily, I am forced to support the amendments of my colleague the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) and reject the Government's attempt to extend the life of the Automotive Industry Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until recently we have not had a very sensible debate in this country on any logical grounds in regard to the car manufacturing industry. Fortunately, due to people such as the honourable member for Barker and a number of my other colleagues, we have finally raised the understanding of the Australian electorate, firstly, as to the cost of the tariff policy of the Government and, secondly, as to the cost to the car manufacturers themselves of an array of Government taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As that survey which was released in the last couple of days shows, there is a very wide understanding by the electorate at large that the tariff policy of the Government to impose a degree of protection on the car industry cannot continue unchecked. It will not under the Government. People so often fail to appreciate that the Government will bring down the car tariff to 15 per cent by the year 2000 with no offsetting benefits to the car industry by way of reduced taxation, whereas that is exactly the policy and approach of the coalition. Our abolition, without qualification, of wholesale sales tax, fuel excise and payroll tax, the training guarantee levy and the freezing of the superannuation payments by employers will all result in tangible benefits to the car manufacturing industry. Most importantly, they will lead to lower prices for consumers and, therefore, stimulation of the car market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the Government can do is try to buy a few friends and wield a bit of influence using taxpayers' scarce funds by propping up unnecessarily an Automotive Industry Authority which has long outlived any usefulness it could creditably have claimed. The Opposition opposes the Government's moves to extend the life of the authority to the year 2000. I wholeheartedly and unreservedly endorse the amendment moved by the honourable member for Barker. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) correctly anticipated my reaction. I will try to stop being nice to him because it only encourages him. The objections raised by the Opposition during this debate centre on the continuation of the Automotive Industry Authority at a cost of $1m to the taxpayer. There was an extraneous matter raised by the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), to which I should reply, on the question of labour turnover in the industry. I am advised that in the 1980s the turnover in this industry was over 30 per cent. It is currently 5 1/2 per cent. It has compared favourably over time and, I am advised, also with overseas experience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The functions of the Automotive Industry Authority include the encouragement of the industry to develop in a way consistent with the policy of the Government; to promote change within the industry directed at improving efficiency; to monitor the performance and outlook for the industry; and to provide information and advice on the industry to the Government. The Government believes that these functions are important; the Opposition clearly does not. That is an important difference that ought to be spelt out, particularly in Victoria and South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ought to be clear about the size of the industry that we are discussing. Last year the automotive industry employed over 50,000 people in the production of cars and components, with about 250,000 people employed in the retail, repair and service sectors. A total of 271,000 locally produced vehicles were sold, with an ex-factory value of $4.8 billion. When we talk about an industry of that scale, I think an investment of $1m in an authority charged with the responsibility of performing the functions I have outlined is certainly good value for money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Barker has argued that the automotive industry is a mature industry which does not require this kind of assistance. It is simply a measure of the Government's commitment to the future of this industry that we believe that an authority performing these functions should continue. Clearly, the Opposition does not. It is still struggling with the devastating front cover of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of not so long ago which dealt with the motor vehicle industry, pointing out that this is the industry which the coalition wants to kill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for this opportunity to speak on the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Amendment Bill 1992 which will amend the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Act 1982. This Bill will not be opposed by the Opposition; in fact, it is supported by the Opposition. My colleague Senator Hill said that the Opposition actually thinks that the centre has done an `excellent job to date'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centre was established in 1982. In his second reading speech in the Senate, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) said that the centre is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a small statutory authority which promotes and assists collaborative research between Australian and developing country institutions on problems of mutual concern.</PARA>
<PARA>He then eulogises the organisation, tells us that it was established 10 years ago, and deals with the review of it by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, I thought it was remarkable that a Minister could make a speech about an organisation which is universally believed to have done a good job without giving credit where credit is due. It disappoints me, in the spirit of bipartisanship that is often invoked in this House, that it was not recognised very properly as an initiative of the former Fraser Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One wonders why one hears such spirited laughter at this initiative which has been so widely eulogised. Yet there is no recognition that this was an outstanding initiative of the Fraser Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In examining this legislation, I thought it might be worth while to look back at what my colleagues said at that time. I looked at some of the comments of Mr Tony Street, then the honourable member for Corangamite and Minister for Foreign Affairs; and Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, who was the Minister for Finance and who spoke about this matter in the Senate. It was noted then that one of the major tragedies of our time was that millions still died simply because they did not have enough to eat. As Prime Minister Fraser had mentioned at CHOGM, the lack of adequate food probably affected 250 million people in the Commonwealth and maybe 500 million people worldwide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Guilfoyle noted that Australia was uniquely placed to assist developing countries in the area of agriculture. She said that we were recognised as having particular expertise and experience in agricultural research and development over a wide range of climatic and environmental conditions, from dry land farming to tropical livestock and agricultural production. She went on to say that in 1980-81 our spending under the aid program on agricultural research and related activities was estimated to have been about $12m. That is quite a significant amount. It was, however, based to a considerable extent upon ad hoc requests for assistance from aid recipient governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addressing that problem as well as others, she said that there had been `a lack of an effective mechanism to identify agricultural problems in developing countries'. She commented on the lack of a satisfactory mechanism for marshalling the collective expertise of bodies such as universities, State departments of agriculture, the CSIRO and suitably competent private individuals and also the failure of Australian laboratories to provide support for scientists engaged in agricultural research in developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She said that, in order to overcome these difficulties, the Government had considered how to develop an expanded, better coordinated and more identifiable Australian effort aimed at achieving nutritional self-sufficiency in developing countries. After very widespread consultation within the Australian scientific community and with other interested parties the then Government decided to establish the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. That body was set up with a sunset clause which was in vogue at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government sought a review from the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade which in its report overwhelmingly endorsed the continuation and expansion of ACIAR for its remarkable achievements on a cost-effective basis. This Bill before us is a result of that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the Bill is primarily to extend the life of this organisation beyond its current limited life as specified in its Act. In addition, the Bill provides for three new functions for the centre, changes the size and constitution of the centre's board of management and the Policy Advisory Council and addresses four administrative issues aimed at improving the centre's efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Act contains, as I mentioned, a sunset provision which limits the life of the centre to 12 years and provides for a review to examine whether the centre should continue. Flowing from this review, the Bill repeals the sunset sections of the Act, thus providing for a further life for this centre. Consideration of the future of the centre drew attention to the desirability of giving the centre additional functions. The Bill provides for the centre, in the context of its research programs, to establish and fund training schemes and conduct and fund development activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also confers responsibility on the centre for providing support to international agricultural research centres, thus moving the centre beyond its normal bilateral mode of operation. We are assured that the changes to the size and constitution of the board of management and Policy Advisory Council will improve administrative efficiency. The other amendments are of a technical nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These recommendations to amend the Act have come about, as I have said, as a result of a quite comprehensive parliamentary review by the Joint Standing Committee. The Government has adopted all of the Committee's main recommendations and this Bill gives effect to them. Of primary importance is the amendment to repeal the sunset provisions. This clause was built into the legislation at the time of its enhancement to ensure that it could be disbanded if its charter was not fulfilled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other amendments provide for the expansion of the charter to allow the centre to operate its own training programs, currently being run by AIDAB, and to implement projects which apply the results of research initiated by collaborative programs. The present charter does not permit this and AIDAB has declined to implement some proposals regarded by ACIAR as important. The coalition supports the Bill and endorses the moves to expand the centre's field of operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is proposed in the context of the centre's 1982 mandate and it is against a background of mounting crises in world food security that we believe this organisation still has a very important role to play. The immediate concern of providing direct food aid to assist in famine stricken parts of the world has given way to the need to find durable solutions to the problems of food production and to eliminate persistent food shortages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of ACIAR was a part of Australia's contribution to the global effort to encourage developing countries to implement effective food strategies by strengthening agricultural research, technology and training facilities. Australia has had expertise and experience in agricultural research and development over a wide range of climatic and environmental conditions. We have already at this stage been supporting such research, both bilaterally and internationally, through our contributions to the consultative group on international rice research and for bodies such as the International Agricultural Research Institute in the Philippines as well as resources within Australia&mdash;in CSIRO, the universities and other State bodies, as Senator Guilfoyle mentioned in her address that I quoted from earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the lack of an effective mechanism within Australia for systematically identifying agricultural problems in developing countries as well as effectively utilising our own resources was hampering any real progress Australia could make in this area. ACIAR was established to ensure that there was better coordination. The Bill occasioned substantial debate when it was introduced in 1982. That debate reflected a happy coincidence of views about the role that such a centre could play as Australia's contribution to the alleviation of world hunger. I think that spirit of cooperation is still apparent in this debate to expand and continue the mandate of ACIAR. As I said, ACIAR is a small body responsible to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Its functions as set out in section 5(1) of its Act are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(a) to formulate programs and policies with respect to agricultural research for either or both of the following purposes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i)identifying agricultural problems of developing countries;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii)finding solutions to agricultural problems of developing countries;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)to commission agricultural research by persons or institutions in Australia (whether the research is to be conducted in Australia or overseas) in accordance with such programs and policies; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)to communicate to persons and institutions the results of such agricultural research.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)In performing its functions with respect to agricultural research, the Centre shall have regard to the need for persons or institutions in developing countries to share in that research.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)Nothing in this section authorizes, or permits, the Centre to carry out research on its own behalf.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia would also benefit from the activities of ACIAR through enhanced contact between our agricultural scientists and their overseas colleagues; through the increased information that Australia has at its disposal on agricultural problems of developing countries; by strengthening the links between Australia and overseas scientists and institutions; and, finally, some of the solutions produced in the research sponsored by the centre would be of direct and practical benefit to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joint Committee review 10 years later has confirmed that ACIAR has fulfilled its functions. The report commented on its excellent record of meeting its mandate and focusing its energies on areas of high priority and concern to partner countries, with a high degree of success. Some of the conclusions of the Committee included: first, in accordance with ACIAR's mandate, its projects address high priority problems in agriculture for both Australia and the partner country. The projects are collaborative in nature and the results of the projects are published widely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, ACIAR projects are a most effective form of official development assistance, focusing on areas of high priority for the partner countries with great success. The Committee acknowledges that, even with a sizeable error factor built in, the outcome of ACIAR's research to date has proved most efficient, unlike a number of projects undertaken under the general aid program. Third, the Committee was satisfied that the financial operations and measures to ensure accountability were sufficiently rigorous to ensure the disposal of its funds were in keeping with the objectives for which they were appropriated. Fourth, given the success of ACIAR's work, the Committee believes there is room for a significant increase in the Budget allocation for the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is indeed encouraging to see that at least one area of Australia's foreign aid effort is operating to the mutual benefit of the countries concerned. Some selected ACIAR projects were appended in the Committee's report and it would be instructive to speak of some of them in this address tonight. First, a three-year project involving Australia and Malaysia to study economically important fruit-flies and develop control methods revealed that only six of the plethora of fruit-fly species occurring in Malaysia were of economic importance. The collaborators very successfully developed the idea, already under investigation in Queensland, of using a bait spray to control them. A bait spray has been developed and marketed. We are told that it is safe, economical and very effective. As a result of this project, superior fruit-fly control methods for Malaysian fruit and vegetable industries are now available. Independent assessment indicated an economic benefit to Malaysia of $176.3m over 20 years. The concept is now being developed for other countries in South East Asia and the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, another project involving Australia and Thailand led to the development of tests that can rapidly diagnose the presence of foot and mouth disease and also the strain of virus causing an outbreak. Having the test available will allow Thai veterinarians to quickly diagnose foot and mouth disease outbreaks and correctly identify the virus strain causing them. Cattle and buffalo can then be vaccinated with the correct vaccine for the specific virus type. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefits to Australia are also substantial. Some 15 per cent of Australia's rural exports could be shut out of traditional markets in the first year after an outbreak has been confirmed, if it is not quickly controlled. That would involve an estimated loss of more than $5 billion. Having the test available has already saved Australia's livestock industries countless dollars in lost exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Third, a project between China and Australia has led to the use of biotechnology to provide resistance in wheat to barley yellow dwarf virus. Barley yellow dwarf virus is the world's most serious viral disease to cereals. It causes major losses in high rainfall wheat growing areas in Australia and prevents China from achieving self-sufficiency in wheat production. No variety of wheat is resistant to the disease. During the two three-year projects, Australian and Chinese scientists collaborated to identify genes in wild grasses giving resistance to the virus and to transfer these into the wheat using a novel biotechnological approach. For the first time they have produced wheat plants that are resistant to the virus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All wheat growing countries stand to gain from this unique research that will for the first time permit control of this universally serious virus. It is too soon for an independent economic assessment, we are told, to have been carried out in relation to that research, but obviously it would be significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These projects undoubtedly benefit not only the parties involved, but other countries as well. Australia's efforts in working cooperatively with developing countries to meet their own food requirements is now more vital than ever. A successful policy to achieve that aim must operate within the overall aid program which is based on sound principles and achievable aims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has developed a blueprint for an improved foreign aid program which it believes will deliver aid where it is most needed in the most cost-effective way. The objectives of the aid program are spelt out very clearly. The coalition's aid policy is based on the principle that the overriding purpose of the aid program must be a reduction of poverty. Although aid may serve other economic and political ends, the effectiveness of aid should be judged primarily in terms of the contribution it makes to reducing poverty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Poverty in the developing world, unlike in developed countries, is not an issue of inequality and relative deprivation. It is a question of absolute deprivation measured by very basic indicators, such as nutrition, life expectancy, under 5-years mortality and school enrolment factors, rather than by income. People living below the global poverty line have a very tenuous grip on life. They are vulnerable to natural diseases and the influence of global economic forces. The poorest of the poor, perhaps 18 per cent of the population of the developing world, are estimated to have annual per capita consumption valued at less than $US275. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is to the alleviation of this poverty that Australia's aid programs, in the Opposition's view, must be directed. Aid programs conceived primarily to meet political or commercial ends, while also allegedly contributing to humanitarian goals, frequently seem to go wrong and miss all three goals. I recently had the opportunity to speak to the third annual report on Australia's overseas development cooperation program. In my comments I noted that Australia's overseas aid program continued to lack direct and real commitment to direct aid and resources to areas which have been neglected over time and which have emerged as areas of great concern. Clearly, the Government needs to focus more attention on ways to achieve a better outcome in our aid program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The success of ACIAR is encouraging and the coalition would accept the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to increase ACIAR's share of the global aid budget from a level of about 1.3 per cent to 3.5 per cent by 1997. In the recommended expansion of ACIAR's mandate, the coalition is concerned that it does not become mired in bureaucracy in the same way as other agencies have become, but continues to operate its charter in the exemplary way in which it has done to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply note in relation to that that the restructuring of the organisation gives it a new role in training. That was a matter that was picked up by the parliamentary Committee in its report. I noticed that on page 48 of the Committee's report, there was discussion about training programs. The Committee noted particularly the activities of the Crawford Fund for International Agricultural Research. The Crawford Fund is a non-government organisation which was established in 1989 for funding training schemes for students from developing countries. The Australian Government, of course, had undertaken to contribute $500,000 over five years, commencing in 1989, towards the fund. The contribution was linked to training awards associated with ACIAR projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee in its report noted that some 150 awardees had undertaken training in agricultural development and research projects and that most of this training was for short periods of hands-on practical training. Of course, it was in this context that the Committee, noting the important work that had been undertaken in that area, went on to make certain recommendations. It recommended that the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Act 1982 be revised to allow ACIAR to conduct project related training, both informal and postgraduate, and that responsibility for the administration of ACIAR's training scheme, together with concomitant resources, should be transferred from AIDAB to ACIAR. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in this context that I would note some of the activities of the Crawford Fund for International Agricultural Research. It is a fund which was an initiative of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering. It has been widely supported. It has received the funding to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of very distinguished Australians are involved in the activities of the organisation. I am particularly pleased to note the involvement of a former member of this House, the Rt Hon. J.D. Anthony, as chairman of the board. A number of other very distinguished Australians&mdash;Mr Bridgland, Sir Neil Currie, Mr Frearson, Sir Brian Inglis, Mr Leslie, Sir Rupert Myers, Professor Tribe and Mr Vaughan&mdash;are members of the board. It has been able to raise funds. It has played a very significant role in bringing these training opportunities in Australia to so many people from abroad. This has involved many of the collaborative organisations that I have mentioned here in Australia, as well as those overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the support of the activities of the Crawford Fund by such a variety of public and private sources is something that is very worth while. I know that honourable members, particularly from this side of the chamber, recognise the very worthwhile activities in which the Crawford Fund has been involved. It is a fund which, by its name, recognises the role of a very distinguished Australian in these areas, one with whom I have had associations and one with whom, over a long period of time, my family has also had longstanding associations. I think it is very worth while to have the activities of an individual remembered in a fund of such outstanding importance as a living memorial to a person who has contributed so much to Australia and the wider areas of aid and agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with a great deal of pleasure that I support this Bill on behalf of the Opposition. Perhaps in conclusion, I should note your involvement, too, Mr Deputy Speaker, as a member of the Joint Committee that reviewed ACIAR and brought it to the point where we are now able to confirm its continuing role and to ensure that its very valuable research is continued and well supported.</PARA>

However, after the recent review of ACIAR's operation, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade unanimously recommended that ACIAR be allowed to continue its wonderful work without the impediment of a sunset clause.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to be a member of the Committee which appraised ACIAR's operation. I am delighted that the Government has accepted our recommendations on that body. In speaking to this Bill, which gives the green light for ACIAR's continuation, I praise ACIAR for its valuable work which brings enormous benefit to Australia and to developing nations, mainly in the Asian and Pacific areas. To those who argue that charity begins at home, I stress that money expended by ACIAR in commissioning research is of crucial benefit to Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I chuckled slightly when the honourable member for Dundas tried to claim credit for the Liberal Party following the success of ACIAR. It is true that ACIAR had its gestation as a result of a decision by the Fraser Government, but ACIAR's flowering has occurred as a result of the assistance, understanding and encouragement provided by this Government. This is a bipartisan debate and the people involved in the ACIAR success story would not want their fine achievements sullied by party political jousting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is a pity that the honourable member for Dundas had a few cheap shots at this Government's aid policy. He said that his Government's policy would spurn commercial ventures in order to focus on the immediate relief of poverty. It is unfortunate&mdash;and I do not have sufficient time to expand the argument&mdash;that the honourable member cannot grasp that the permanent relief of poverty needs commercial ventures of the type that increase a developing people's expertise in agricultural matters so as to enable them to ward off the onset of periodic bouts of bad weather, et cetera, which give rise to episodes of poverty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this country we hear so often of the brain drain. We hear about our top scientists leaving Australia for overseas postings. I find it particularly pleasing, therefore, that our Australian universities, CSIRO and the State departments of agriculture throughout our nation have the opportunity to participate in such important research projects as are carried out by ACIAR. I repeat: the benefits to both Australia and the developing countries in which ACIAR commissions projects are substantial. I am pleased that the Government, in its response to the Committee's report on the review of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, has agreed that there is no reason why ACIAR should not foster collaborative projects in Africa, in the Middle East and in South America, subject to those projects being resource dependent. ACIAR's primary focus will continue to be South East Asia, but there is definitely merit in staged expansion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the chairmanship of Senator Chris Schacht, the Subcommittee called for submissions and held public hearings in Canberra, and hearings and inspections in Sydney and Brisbane. A total of 165 submissions were received and it is pleasing to note that more than half of this number were received from overseas. In its report, the Subcommittee stated that `maximisation of food production is an essential element in ensuring strong economic growth'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Australia has extensive expertise in agricultural research, it was not until the creation of ACIAR in 1982 that that expertise was effectively applied to developing countries' agricultural problems. The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research has unquestionably carried out its role with not only efficiency and cost-effectiveness but also enormous success. It has been of tremendous benefit in solving problems which are also of benefit to Australia but, more importantly, have been of enormous benefit to our developing neighbours. In Sri Lanka, for instance, waterways and reservoirs were choked with the worst possible water weed, salvinia. Again, I quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The three year project led by Dr Peter Room and Dr Wendy Forno of the CSIRO Division of Entomology was carried out in collaboration with the Sri Lankan National Resources, Energy and Science Authority, other government agencies and . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It then refers to a local university. The project sought to repeat in Sri Lanka the spectacular results Dr Room's CSIRO team had already achieved in Australia and Papua New Guinea. It succeeded. In less than 12 months, a beetle destroyed dense mats of salvinia that were completely choking reservoirs. The benefits to rice farmers, fishermen and their families, hydro-electricity production and rural people generally were enormous because of the reduced spread of disease by mosquitos. Independent assessment indicated unlikely economic benefit to Sri Lanka over 25 years of some $25m&mdash;a tremendous benefit to cost ratio. Now ACIAR is enabling the CSIRO team to release the beetle in Malaysia, the Philippines, Fiji, Kenya and Zambia. It is particularly pleasing that a biological solution has been discovered, rather than a chemical solution, which in itself could cause further problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are so many other success stories. I have had delegations of poultry farmers in my electorate of Hunter come to visit me recently. My constituents are concerned that Australia may allow imports of chicken products from Thailand, Denmark, Canada and the USA. My farmers are extremely concerned about the threat of Newcastle disease, which is the No. 1 killer of chickens worldwide. The farmers' concerns were partially justified&mdash;I say `partially' because I have considerable faith in our Australian Quarantine Inspection Service&mdash;but as Australian poultry farmers they were concerned because Australia is one of the few countries that does not have Newcastle disease in its chicken flocks. But we cannot be too complacent, as outbreaks have occurred in the past and the disease is widespread in all our South East Asian neighbouring countries. While vaccines against the disease are commercially available, each bird must be caught and inoculated&mdash;a somewhat difficult thing to do in villages. Also, these vaccines must be kept under refrigeration, which again is difficult in places without electricity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ACIAR informed the Subcommittee that Australia has a benign strain of the virus which causes no disease symptoms. Research has shown that infection with this benign V4 virus gives chickens immunity to the virulent Newcastle disease virus strains. In 1983, ACIAR commissioned what turned out to be a very successful research collaboration between Professor Peter Spradbow and his research group at the University of Queensland and Malaysian scientists. They were able to develop a new vaccine that can be kept without refrigeration in the hottest of tropical conditions and that can be fed to chickens coated on chicken feed. Currently, the vaccine is being used to control the disease in two States of Malaysia and is being assessed for its value in other Asian countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of the eradication of Newcastle disease will bring economic benefit to our Asian neighbours who rely on chickens as their major food source, but it will also benefit Australia. Control of Newcastle disease among our neighbours will reduce the risk of outbreaks, and stockpiles of the vaccine will provide a backup control method to the currently used mass slaughter if an outbreak should occur. The Australian vaccine industry is already exporting the new vaccine to affected countries. Quick diagnosis and prompt vaccination against foot and mouth disease is another success story developed by veterinarians from the Australian Animal Health Laboratory and the Department of Livestock Development in Thailand. Not only is this research benefiting Thailand and other Asian countries but it may save the Australian livestock industry millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One project of particular interest to me, having visited China in recent years, is the project to improve the Australian eucalyptus, acacia and casuarina tree species in southern China. Again, CSIRO has played a major role in the research, identifying many promising species and lines of eucalypts, wattles and casuarinas in Australia. China plants forests to satisfy its immense internal demand for fuel wood, poles and sawn timber, and it is government policy to increase the amount of wood used for paper pulp. The environment is important too, with plantations being planted for environmental protection and the rehabilitation of degraded lands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, being a major wheat growing country, has also benefited from research into the barley yellow dwarf disease, using a novel biotechnology approach. The CSIRO Division of Plant Industry has collaborated with colleagues at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. China has been unable to achieve self-sufficiency in wheat growing production because of this barley yellow dwarf disease. All wheat growing countries stand to gain from this unique research, which will for the first time control this serious disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another success story involves the disappearing giant clams. Because of research carried out by Professor John Lucas and his team at the James Cook University in North Queensland, in collaboration with the Queensland Department of Primary Industries, many of our South Pacific neighbours are now harvesting the giant clam from hatcheries. These countries are now receiving income, and denuded reefs are being restocked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have dwelt at some length on the success stories of ACIAR simply because there can be no doubt that the continuation of ACIAR is justified. The Government's agreement to the recommendations of the subcommittee is most gratifying, and the five-year review is acceptable to all parties. Other amendments regarding the membership of ACIAR and the removal of the restriction on the number of overseas members can only lead to a more streamlined, attuned and efficient organisation. The Subcommittee's recommendations on funding, including trust moneys, transfer of funds from AIDAB to ACIAR, and increased funding for ACIAR, have been accepted by the Government. Other administrative changes will be of benefit to ACIAR, and there can be no doubt that the continuation of the statutory authority is well justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ACIAR can continue the marvellous research work that brings benefit to our Australian agricultural industry and at the same time help our developing neighbours, I am sure there will be no opposition to the continuation of the organisation's vital role. I was proud to be a member of the review subcommittee into ACIAR, and I commend the Minister's concern for this legislation. I have great pleasure in commending the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join other contributors to this debate in welcoming the legislation which has been brought before the House, the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Amendment Bill. As the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) also mentioned, he and I were members of the Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade which was entrusted with the task of reviewing the performance of ACIAR and making recommendations to the Government. A lot of those recommendations having been picked up in this report. Whilst the honourable member for Hunter did not wish to make political capital out of the debate which, as he said, was a bipartisan one, one does have to respond at least marginally by saying that in fact ACIAR was set up by my colleague of the time, Mr Tony Street, who was then Foreign Minister. I was privileged to be part of the discussions leading up to the establishment of ACIAR. I think it is one of the enduring monuments of that period of government. That opinion is backed up by the detailed investigation which has been initiated into its performance and has resulted in these recommendations and this piece of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the interesting things about it was that it was set up, as other speakers have mentioned, with a sunset clause. There was quite a lot of debate within the Joint Committee, analysing the performance of ACIAR, as to the effect of the sunset clause. There was quite a degree of discussion as to whether the fact that there was a sunset clause in place did, in effect, cause it to be lean and efficient or whether it would have been lean and efficient without the sunset clause&mdash;whether it would have done as well if it had been set up without the prospect of being reviewed in the future and just continued, as a lot of other statutory authorities have, without such a sword of Damocles hanging over its head. Nobody can really answer that question, but one of the conclusions coming out of the examination is that an appropriate committee of the Parliament should examine very closely the positive benefits of sunset clauses on a whole lot of legislation setting up statutory authorities where their performance is less satisfactory and effective than in the case of this particular organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of agricultural research is major, and I quote briefly from one of the submissions to the inquiry under the heading `The importance of international agricultural research'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agriculture plays a vital part in the process of economic growth in less developed countries. The change from traditional peasant farming to more productive systems of commercial agriculture is vitally important because it results in more food, more jobs, rising incomes and standards of living (particularly for the rural poor), and expanding national wealth. In short, improved farming systems constitute the foundation on which, in most developing countries, economic progress is built.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very succinct statement, in my view, of the benefits that come from effective agriculture in a developing nation. It is the very basis upon which ACIAR was initially established. This same submission to the Committee goes on to say at a later stage:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A mass of evidence exists to show how international agricultural research successfully provides more food for the hungry, more jobs for the unemployed, more income for the poor, more commodities for export, and more wealth to stimulate national economic investment and growth in less developed countries.</PARA>
<PARA>If all our aid projects could boast that sort of result, what a tremendous aid establishment we would have. I want to mention reasonably briefly an aspect of agricultural research which I believe is enormously important. Not only does it do great good in the countries in which Australian scientists and their collaborators are working but a lot of people these days, particularly in these straitened economic times, use the argument that charity begins at home and ask why we are spending this money on projects when we could use it more effectively at home to look after our own. I quote again from this submission, which deals with the benefits to Australia of ACIAR:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The economic advantages that Australia derives from its involvement in international agricultural research are mainly of two types.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, there are the direct benefits that come to Australian farmers through their use of the results of this research. Many examples exist of the ways in which Australian crop and animal production continues to benefit from the results from the research centres sponsored by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACIAR's work brings even greater advantages to Australian agriculture because it sets out specifically to investigate problems that are of importance to Australia as well as to its overseas partners. From its outset ACIAR has wisely stressed the concepts of "<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">mutual benefit</EMPHASIS>" and "<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">international partnership</EMPHASIS>".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The economic value to Australian farmers of the results that have come from international agricultural research are literally incalculable. The published evidence shows that the application of results from both ACIAR and the CGIAR centres has brought enormous benefits. Yet only a limited number of experimental programs has so far been subject to economic analysis. The returns from these studies shows that Australia's investment in international agricultural research has so far given much better value, in economic terms, than any other part of the overseas aid program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second main benefit to Australia from the results of international agricultural research is less immediate but, in the medium to long term, is at least as important.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The improved farming technologies that result from research lead to higher productivity, greater employment in rural areas and higher personal incomes. Most of these increased incomes is then spent on food, so that the result of agricultural development is that, while the <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">supply</EMPHASIS> of food expands, the <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">demand</EMPHASIS> for food expands even faster. The consequence of this is that more food has to be imported and the resultant growth of the world market for food benefits an exporting nation like Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>It is important to understand the mutual benefits that flow from an organisation such as ACIAR. The evidence which was brought out in the very detailed investigation carried out by the Joint Committee is encapsulated by those two statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of the individual benefits of the outstanding research efforts in a number of areas have been mentioned both by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin) in the second reading speech and by various other contributors to the debate. There is no doubt at all that, when one comes into contact with the dedicated work that agricultural scientists do around the place, one can only be impressed by the selflessness of so much of the effort that is undertaken. A number of the speakers in this debate have mentioned individual examples of outstanding research results which have then gone on to be implemented in practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we know, the legislation is based on the report by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. This is a very good example, and I guess it is in some sense a precedent, of the work that joint committees of the Parliament can do in examining in great detail some of the effects, in practice, of government legislation. I believe that, unfortunately, this chamber has broken down over successive governments in terms of the contribution that individual members can make to second reading debates and other legislative processes. I diverge for a moment to say that I think that Question Time has, unfortunately, become more of a farce than an exchange of information. I think that a lot of debates in the chamber are now set pieces rather than an honest exchange of views between members holding differing opinions on what should or should not be brought into legislative effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the work of the joint committees of the Parliament does allow individual members of the Parliament, particularly back bench members, to work together and investigate, in great detail, the effect of government legislation. This is a very good example of how effectively that can be done when the task is approached&mdash;I believe this is much more often than not the case&mdash;with honesty and dedication by members of those committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Whether this Joint Standing Committee is looking at this legislation, at Australia's relations with other countries or at the trade area, it does approach its tasks with a great deal of dedication. That involves all members from all parties within the Parliament. This is a very useful example of how governments can be appropriately advised by members of the Parliament from both sides of the chamber, and from both the Senate and the House of Representatives, working together to investigate and report on the effects of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, to its credit, has picked up the main recommendations of the report of the Joint Standing Committee. The Parliamentary Secretary said in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that ACIAR has been outstandingly successful. It is lean, professional and efficient and has an excellent approach to its task.</PARA>
<PARA>Having said that, I repeat that there was a degree of discussion in the Committee as to whether that was brought about by its own intrinsic merit and the capabilities of the people concerned or whether the sunset clause hanging over the head of the organisation contributed in its way to the effectiveness of the organisation. The Parliamentary Secretary also said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the overwhelming evidence of the worth of ACIAR's activities drawn out from its review and elsewhere, the Government has decided that ACIAR and its work should continue.</PARA>
<PARA>There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that that should be the case. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No provision exists at present for ACIAR to engage in training activities. Yet training is integral to the research projects ACIAR commissions, not only to enable their successful conduct but also at times there are excellent opportunities for broader capacity-building training. Up until now, this deficiency has been overcome by AIDAB reserving a small part of its training resource for ACIAR. In the future, ACIAR will be able to conduct its own project-related training.</PARA>
<PARA>Later on he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . ACIAR's functions should allow ACIAR to fund development activities when necessary to try to ensure adoption of the results of the research it commissions.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with that; but that is an area that does need careful monitoring. Having been an extension officer within the agricultural area for a number of years before I came into this chamber, I do know of the difficulties associated with effective utilisation of research results. One will have to be very careful that the overlap between the essentially research functions of ACIAR and the effort required to ensure the adoption of those successful research results does not get out of kilter. Having spoken to the members of ACIAR, I have no doubt that they are very aware of the potential dangers. But I draw attention to the fact that one can get into a bottomless pit if one chases too far the possible adoption of the research results amongst a community which, because of a number of factors, may not wish to embrace immediately the recommendations that come to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no use doing the research, finding effective solutions and then not having that research implemented. It is an enormously important area to which special attention needs to be paid. But ACIAR needs to be careful that too much of its attention is not posited on the implementation of the results with the effect that it loses sight of its main function which is to achieve the successful and practical research results. It is very good that ACIAR has developed close linkages with the centres overseas. The Parliamentary Secretary said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With ACIAR's future assured, the Government has decided that responsibility for this important part of the aid program should become one of ACIAR's functions.</PARA>
<PARA>We totally agree with that. There is a reduction in the size of the Council in line with the Committee's recommendation. In effect, we see this Bill coming forward very much as a result of what I regard as a responsible report from the Joint Committee. In my view that is to be applauded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that is demonstrated is the benefit of properly analysed, properly prioritised, bilateral aid projects. That is not to say that Australia should not have some input into some multilateral aid projects, but something like this does provide a very worthwhile opportunity for Australian expertise to be centred upon those areas where we can more effectively ensure not only that the aid moneys and the aid effort are effectively utilised but also, as I have already outlined, that they bring more direct benefits both to the recipient countries and to Australia itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, I think it is a very obvious example of the real benefits of effectively analysed and controlled bilateral aid efforts. That is not to say that there will not be some mistakes and that there will not be some failures. With the multiplicity of projects that are taking place, we cannot expect all of them to be equally successful. There will be some failures. What we have to do is analyse the totality of the effort and make sure that the economic benefit is very clearly headed in the right direction. In my view, there is absolutely no doubt of that, in terms of ACIAR's role and performance. I am very pleased that the Government has acted so quickly to pick up the main recommendations that were laid down by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, following its examination of ACIAR. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To sum up, I believe that agricultural research is enormously important. We are all sickened and horrified when we see the stark photographs and movie coverage of hunger, deprivation, malnutrition and similar sorts of situations which are brought very clearly into our homes from time to time. We cannot do much better than to ensure that populations are effectively fed with sustainable agricultural production. ACIAR is dedicated to bringing about that overall situation. I think the reputation of the scientists and others involved in the programs is second to none. I think they are bringing very great credit to Australia and, incidentally, to themselves. We always have had a very high international reputation for the excellence of our agricultural research. If I sound a little biased, I am not a researcher; I was an extension officer. But the research effort was required first to make sure that the material and the matter that one was presenting to the recipients was effective and would result in real benefits. ACIAR has done that. It can feel proud of itself. I am delighted to support the legislation which the Government has brought forward. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a delight to be able to wholeheartedly support the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) in his very positive comments about this excellent Bill, the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Amendment Bill. I agree with everything I heard him say. I did not hear the beginning of his speech, but certainly the latter two-thirds of it were exactly right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I can recall, the Government has fully accepted the recommendations of the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on ACIAR, of which the honourable member for Warringah was Deputy Chairman and of which I also was a member. In so doing, I think it has entirely appropriately removed the sunset clause from the original Bill establishing the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research and that ensures it a continuing life. Nothing could be more appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his second reading speech, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin) gave some excellent examples of the value of the research done by the centre. The first example he gave related to the centre's success in the biological control of salvinia, the water weed in Sri Lanka, and the benefit of that also in Papua New Guinea and no doubt in other countries. The estimated benefit cost ratio of that project was 32 : 1. The estimated income generated by resolving that problem was 32 times higher than the cost of the research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we were doing the inquiry, there were a number of examples of extraordinarily effective research outcomes, such as Newcastle disease in chickens and a number of other examples that the Parliamentary Secretary included in his speech, all of which point to the great effectiveness of this centre. As he said in his speech, Australia is the only industrialised country with a high standard of living which is in the tropics. Therefore, it is particularly appropriate for Australia to be involved in agricultural research which is of direct benefit to the developing countries which are also in the tropics. The centre has a fine record of success. It deserves to be better funded, and the Government has decided to do that. I am delighted that the Committee's recommendations have been so fully accepted by the Government and that it is now implementing them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to briefly congratulate the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Mr Kerin) for his paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Changing aid for a changing world: key issues for Australia's aid program in the 1990s</EMPHASIS>, which was tabled about 10 days ago. I know that the Minister put quite a lot of effort into this paper. It does describe effectively, lucidly and intelligently the value of Australian aid to the developing countries, the directions in which Australian aid is being used, the impact on particular countries such as Papua New Guinea, the South Pacific, Asia, Africa, and the ways in which our aid can be targeted so as to have maximum effect. I was delighted that, in the Budget, the Minister succeeded in increasing the attention to human development, family planning, population programs, health programs and education, as well as the types of policies that will contribute most directly to economic development through infrastructure, industry development and agricultural extension. I think the Minister is having a very significant impact and he is making many changes which increase the effectiveness of Australian aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister was also successful in maintaining the level of Australian aid as a proportion of national income. At a time of very tight budgetary constraint, that was a major achievement. It means that Australian aid is again this year 0.36 per cent of GDP. That is less than one would like it to be, but it is more than it was several years ago. The Minister for Trade and Overseas Development and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) should be congratulated for their success in arguing a difficult case in Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That stands in sharp contrast with the Opposition, which has announced that at a time of enormous need in developing countries&mdash;need that we can see, as the honourable member for Warringah said in his speech, on our television screens every night&mdash;it will cut $200m out of the aid program. That is just disgraceful at a time when there is desperate need for relief of poverty, easing of crises, as well as the constructive development assistance for which the Australian aid program is noted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am quite sure that in their heart of hearts many people in the Opposition greatly regret that policy. But it is something of which they should be ashamed because it involves a rejection of the humanitarian concern that has characterised Australian aid. Anyone concerned about poverty overseas now really has no choice in this coming election. He or she has to vote Labor, because voting Labor guarantees that the aid program will be $200m higher than if the Opposition were elected. I regret to say that that characterises much of its domestic programs as well, but I will not deal with those tonight. In order to allow this debate to finish, I will cease talking. I reiterate my wholehearted and strong support for this Bill. It is excellent that the Bill is receiving such strong bipartisan support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise with great pleasure tonight to make my contribution to the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Amendment Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure the continued operation of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. The centre's continued operation is fundamental to the improved agricultural, social and economic growth in developing countries. Such growth will ultimately serve Australia's interests through increased demand for agricultural and other products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research fostered through the centre represents a hands-on approach to Australia's overseas aid program. Assistance offered through the program is of a long term nature, and often provides the best opportunity for sustained economic development. The provision of food aid is a short term solution and it is generally recognised that improving the production of food by the countries themselves offers the best hope for a long term improvement in living standards and economic growth. If we fail to look at these aid programs in the long term and assist these countries to produce their own food, inevitably they will always rely on another nation for their food in the form of aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ACIAR conducts research programs in nine areas: animal sciences, crop sciences, economics and farming systems, fisheries, forages, forests, plant nutrition, post-harvest technology, and soil and water management and use. The work to date conducted by the centre has been of outstanding value. For example, ACIAR has promoted research to develop and prove the effectiveness of tests that can rapidly diagnose the presence of foot and mouth disease and identify the particular strain of the virus causing the outbreak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now refer to the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin). It is of particular interest because it demonstrates the cooperative approach that we must take in this aid program. The research into foot and mouth disease involved teams of veterinarians from the Australian National Animal Health Laboratory and the Department of Livestock and Development in Thailand. Foot and mouth disease is endemic in northern Thailand, and studies with the live virus there made it possible to refine a test and to prove it in the field with actual outbreaks. Such tests enabled Australian scientists to diagnose a false alarm in Queensland in only 17 hours when a disease outbreak was suspected in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988 I was involved with the United Graziers Association of Queensland. In fact, we were meeting in Brisbane at the very time that announcement was made. There was a risk that other countries would not accept our beef, or any meat exports from this nation, until we had positively identified whether the disease was in fact foot and mouth. The ability to quickly identify that it was not an outbreak of foot and mouth disease, I believe, was fundamental in our being able to guarantee to other countries that we do not have foot and mouth disease in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the value of the beef industry to Australia, the money that is spent on this project pales into insignificance. The value of beef exports for 1992-93 is estimated to be in the vicinity of $3.2 billion. So the ability of scientists to carry out this research where there is foot and mouth disease, which is endemic in Thailand, really demonstrates the mutual benefit to Thailand, in this case, and to Australia. Whilst ever there is foot and mouth disease in the world and whilst ever we have near neighbours where foot and mouth disease is present, the risk is always there that one day this disease will enter this country through some source. So it is to our mutual benefit to ensure that these other countries are able to rid themselves of foot and mouth disease. One of the projects promoted by ACIAR is that very research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having the tests available in developing countries enables veterinarians to quickly diagnose foot and mouth disease outbreaks and, importantly, to correctly identify the virus strain causing it. There are a number of virus strains, and the particular strain has to be identified. Cattle and buffalo can then be vaccinated with the correct vaccine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Based on documentation relating to 12 research projects, ACIAR claims that, for a total research cost of $27.4m, the expected benefits over the next 15 to 20 years will be in the order of $816.7m. That is an enormous gain to these developing countries, and I believe it represents very good value for our dollars spent in this area of aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst there will always be a place for humanitarian aid for humanitarian purposes, the benefits of hands-on practical assistance as supplied by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research must be acknowledged. The original Act that provided for the establishment of the research centre contained a sunset clause disbanding the centre after 12 years operation unless, following review, amending legislation was introduced. The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade conducted a review and recommended, amongst other things, the centre's continued existence, and thus the debate here in the House tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to expand on a number of recommendations that the Committee raised in its report. These concern the nature of assistance to developing countries and the need to improve such assistance. The main criticism attributed to overseas aid is that it provides a gift to foreigners when Australia has its own financial problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Critics would argue that foreign aid contributes to Australia's balance of payments deficit. On the other hand, there is a widespread belief that developed nations have a responsibility to overcome disparities in the wealth of nations. However, can foreign aid be better targeted? We in Australia, being very small fry in the international scene in our contribution to world aid, at least have a responsibility to stay close to the aid we dispense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Relationships between Australia and the recipients of our aid should be fostered and developed. If close contact cannot be maintained, Australia takes the risk of merely throwing money at the problem, achieving very little, and in fact in some cases causing irretrievable damage. I quote from an article published in the March edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> magazine which touches on the aid issue in South East Asia to illustrate this point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A young boy recently died of malnutrition and a neighbour is dying of some unidentified illness. Aid workers within the village blame the access to serum hepatitis for this outbreak. There is a belief amongst the villagers that injected drugs are a miracle panacea. With most of the drugs deposited by foreign aid agencies there is a lack of adequate supervision over their use that creates doubt about the value and appropriateness of such support.</PARA>
<PARA>This example illustrates the importance of targeting effective aid. The article goes on to suggest that the aid should be provided in a form that the villagers can control, such as funding for the construction of a kiln in order to build up a cash economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point to be considered in this example is that, without Western expertise, Western medicine and technology will benefit Third World countries very little. This view was supported in evidence from Dr Blyth to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have questioned the Thai senior executives of the Department of Agriculture as to why they are interested in having us come with our piddling little projects, when the European Community gives them very large amounts of money and carte blanche as to how to spend it. The answer is very simple . . . `Dollars are cheap. Anyone can get dollars in development assistance from the Western world. What we cannot get is people who will come and work with us'.</PARA>
<PARA>In contrast to the general Australian aid program, ACIAR does not meet the full cost of its projects. Partner countries are expected to make a financial contribution to the project, demonstrating the priority they attach to the research and emphasising the partnership nature of the work. Many submissions to the ACIAR inquiry were critical of this fact, however it is pleasing to note that no recommendation was put by the Joint Committee to review current funding arrangements in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the failure of many aid projects results from the fact that they are not undertaken as joint ventures. If a project fails, the recipient country has virtually nothing to lose. Take, for example, the establishment of a milk processing plant in a village in South East Asia. The project is undertaken on both humanitarian and economic grounds. Its establishment will encourage better nutritional standards for the villagers while also providing valuable employment opportunities. However, often the Western expertise leaves the country long before the technology and know-how is adequately transferred to the local management. The project is then at risk of failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, this is not an uncommon scenario throughout parts of South East Asia. Many aid projects, whether funded by the Japanese, American or Australian governments, fail due to a lack of long term planning on behalf of both parties involved in the project. In order to address this alarming situation, recipient countries should be given more of a stake in foreign aid projects. Under such a proposal, recipient countries would have a vested interest in the success of the project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the Chinese and Asian people's culture is typically face saving, the failure of joint venture projects would be much harder to tolerate than the failure of foreign owned and controlled projects. The benefit of long term assistance provided to developing countries through bodies such as the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research must be given greater recognition. I believe such assistance holds the key to future aid funding. This brings me to recommendation No. 9 of the Joint Committee, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that ACIAR's priority within the aid budget be increased and that by 1997 approximately 3.5% of the aid budget should be allocated to ACIAR.</PARA>
<PARA>Given the very real returns the centre is able to provide to developing nations and the Australian agricultural sector, raising the profile of the research centre should be a priority of the Government. There has been very little increase in the budget allocation to ACIAR for a number of years. In terms of percentage of total official development assistance, the allocation to ACIAR has remained in the range of 1.3 per cent to 1.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our commitment to foreign aid should be revised to more adequately acknowledge the benefits of sustained economic development and to consider the potential gains to the Australian nation. To vary aid expenditure to recognise such factors is not an impossible feat, as pointed out by Professor Tribe, the Executive Director of the Crawford Fund for</PARA>
<PARA>International Agricultural Development, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is said that it is administratively too difficult to vary expenditures on other aid projects in order to increase ACIAR's funds. This argument is unacceptable because in recent years substantial changes have been made to other items in the aid budget and, despite the bureaucratic problems that may be involved, there are compelling reasons why ACIAR should now be accorded a higher priority. The real question is how much higher?</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's response to recommendation No. 9, to increase ACIAR's priority within the aid budget, was to suggest that ACIAR's priority in the aid program be reassessed with a view to ACIAR's share of the aid program increasing as budgetary circumstances allowed. That is playing it safe. It is real Sir Humphrey stuff. The final recommendation of the Committee worthy of further consideration and action states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Australian Government examine the possibility of establishing an organisation along the same lines as ACIAR with the purpose of providing research and development assistance to regional countries in manufacturing systems, human resource development, etc.</PARA>
<PARA>If such research is good enough for agriculture, it should be good enough for other areas of Australian expertise. The extension of this hands-on approach to mutually beneficial forms of aid, as I have said previously, should be the way of the future. It is vitally important that Australia remain close to the aid we dispense. Increased awareness can only result in more effective aid targeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is a technologically advanced nation with a great deal to offer our Asian neighbours on a cooperative basis. For example, Australia is world proficient in the export of technology associated with distance education and remote medical services. We do not come second to any nation in those two areas. Our close proximity to the Asian area provides us with a natural advantage in servicing trade and aid concerns. Australian aid has the potential to promote Australian trade. We should never lose sight of that potential. This country must lead by example. Our example must be better than that of our competitors. We have the technology. We have the know-how. We have our foot in the door. Let us press home the advantage and make Australian aid in the Asian region work for Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank all honourable members who have contributed in this debate tonight on what is a particularly important issue, the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Amendment Bill. Generally speaking, there was a sense of bipartisanship; it was all peace and love there for a while tonight. Both sides generally agreed that the Government's laudable aims in this legislation should continue and that at every stage they should be promoted. As is always the wont, one or two discordant notes were introduced&mdash;in a mild sense, in terms of presentation&mdash;in respect of some issues. I will quickly address some of those.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some concern expressed by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) at the commencement of this debate as to who had responsibility for the establishment of this program. I think it is fair to say, as was conceded by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), that the Fraser Government did initiate this program, but that there has been continuing support for it under successive Labor governments. That has included a budget increase for ACIAR and international agricultural research centres in the 1992-93 Budget, and an ongoing commitment to budget increases as the Budget circumstances allow. I do not think anybody can walk away from that last comment about Budget circumstances allowing, and that is a theme I would like to come back to in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has also recognised ACIAR's contribution to the aid program and has built on and expanded the centre's functions beyond those functions it was accorded in 1982. Again, it demonstrates clearly that it is the Labor Government which has built on what was perhaps an initiative announced by a former government and given it appropriate priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ACIAR projects address poverty alleviation through enhancing the rural base on which economic development is dependent in developing countries. Agriculture certainly is the chief economic activity in many of those countries, and Australian expertise helps developing countries to improve their own agriculture, strengthen their economies and ensure that there will be enough food in the years to come. I think that was a theme that one or two other members addressed in their contributions this evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) in his contribution referred to the statement entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Changing aid for a changing world: key issues for Australia's aid program in the 1990s</EMPHASIS>, which was brought down by the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Mr Kerin) a few days ago. Whilst in that document it certainly is indicated that the Government agrees that poverty alleviation is essential, it also points out that broad based economic growth is essential to generate the resources necessary for sustained development, and all parts of the Australian aid program contribute to economic growth in developing countries. I think that is an important point that perhaps some people did not pick up on in their contributions. It is clear that our government has the view that poverty alleviation is essential but that economic growth in developing countries goes hand in glove with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some comments were made about two or three other issues which I would like quickly to turn to. Training programs under this legislation and in the ACIAR organisation will be focused on strengthening the capacity of research institutions in developing countries to carry out or continue agricultural research. Recipients of ACIAR fellowships will carry out research at both masters and PhD levels, which is directly related to ACIAR projects. Of course, this will enable them to return to their own countries to assist in further research or in institutionalising the results of current research. I think that was an issue which the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) was particularly concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the general theme of development, ACIAR development activities will be limited to small selected research related activities in instances where AIDAB is unable to take up development options soon enough or where it would be inappropriate for it to do so. Therefore, the nexus between our aid agencies and development assistance and so on is clearly made. Development activities will typically be, for example, in field trials, demonstration plots, et cetera, which will serve as the catalyst for the country's own extension services to take over. I think that is an appropriate comment that needed to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Warringah also made mention of the fact that he saw a continuing role for committees of this Parliament to examine proposed government legislation in a bipartisan way and bring forward recommendations which hopefully the government of the day will act upon so that we see a better piece of legislation. I could not agree with him more. I think it is an appropriate role for parliamentary committees, whether they be joint committees or committees of this place, to embark upon. It has happened in the past and I am sure it will happen again in the future. His support for that particular view, I think, is extremely welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comment was also made about the sunset clause concept. People will remember, I am sure, that this review process was undertaken largely because of a sunset clause being written into the legislation and that the inquiry was extended further at the behest of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans). A sunset clause as is being considered in this legislation has very damaging effects in terms of the inability to enter into contracts, insecurity, loss of productivity, et cetera. On equity grounds, the reimposition of a sunset clause on ACIAR was therefore not endorsed by the Government. The Government has, however, recommended that an appropriate committee investigate the matter of sunset clauses for statutory authorities. Again, that was a point that the honourable member for Warringah made. He believed it was important that a committee of this Parliament investigate that as an issue in a general sense, but I just make the point of its relevance to ACIAR. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) made some interesting observations in his contribution. In my view his criticisms were of the general aid program and unfortunately displayed a basic ignorance of how Australia's bilateral aid program is designed, implemented and monitored. Quite frankly, I think he has endeavoured to pick up several generalised criticisms of Western aid programs and implied that Australia's program suffers from the same malaise. I frankly do not think that that is the case. All of Australia's bilateral projects are agreed to jointly with the recipient government. In almost all cases there is a counterpart contribution by the recipient government. It has a stake in the project and therefore wants it to succeed. I think the argument he was making that there was not enough consultation is somewhat wide of the mark. There is also an ongoing framework of monitoring to finetune many of those projects as they evolve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Maranoa, interestingly&mdash;and this is becoming a frequent occurrence in a number of debates in this place where money is concerned and funding and budget priorities are up for consideration&mdash;made the comment, and indeed the plea, that more funding should be made available for projects under ACIAR's banner or in aid generally. It is interesting that that comment could be made and should be made by those opposite because, as was pointed out by the honourable member for Fraser in his contribution, in the Fightback document the Opposition proposed to cut its aid program, if elected to government, by $209m. I simply say to the honourable member for Maranoa that perhaps he ought to trot over to the Senate and have a chat with Senator Hill to find out where those cuts in the aid program will be targeted. Will they be in agricultural research programs such as this legislation deals with? Does that mean that the concerns that he rightly raised about animal diseases and so on will be just shoved off to one side because they are not quite in the priority area which Senator Hill might have them fit into?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is a need for clarification but, as I say, it is something which I think we on this side of the House have become used to. There are $10 billion worth of cuts being promised in a whole variety of Commonwealth Government programs under Fightback, yet honourable members opposite constantly come along here and argue that more money should be provided for various programs, whether they be road programs, aid programs or whatever they happen to be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I want to pay tribute to the men and women who have contributed to the defence of this country since 1914. In particular, I wish to acknowledge the role played by the Australian War Memorial, not only in commemorating the sacrifices made by citizens of this country but also in ensuring that the nation's experience of war is not forgotten.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the War Memorial was opened by the great anti-conscriptionist of 1916 and 1917, John Curtin, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour was less than a month away. To all intents and purposes, the war which had broken out in September 1939 was still a European conflict. The attack on Australia in 1942 finally exposed the nation's vulnerability to every citizen of the Commonwealth. During the decades following the Great War, successive governments had preferred to rely on the promise of imperial defence and the effectiveness of the naval base at Singapore rather than pursue policies which would assist the defence of Australia. However, given the mood and spirit of the times, the popularity of such ideas is not difficult to understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nation still mourned the loss of 60,000 of its male population and many believed that the Great War of 1914-18 had been the war to end all wars. Despite continued warnings about potential enemies and misgivings about Australia's ability to defend itself, many invested their trust in the new League of Nations believing that international disputes could be sorted out around a conference table. When, by the mid-1930s, it had become increasingly apparent that the ambitions of the dictators could well result in another war, the Lyons Government made a long overdue financial commitment to the defence and rearmament of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's struggle against invasion during the early 1940s has been well documented. Indeed, much of what it means to be an Australian is inextricably linked to the nation's collective experience of war. It is impossible to go anywhere in Australia and not encounter the ever present war memorial and its tragic roll of honour. So powerful are the images of Anzac and the digger tradition that on Anzac Day 1990 several thousand Australians&mdash;including many in their twenties&mdash;made a special pilgrimage to Gallipoli; a place so drenched with Australian blood that it surely deserves to be called a sacred site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in this context that the War Memorial has rightly become one of Australia's most important institutions. The preservation of its priceless treasures is a fundamental responsibility of this Parliament. Indeed, a proper level of support for the Memorial is surely something that extends well beyond the realm of mere party politics. While I believe in a much more limited role for government than has been assumed in Australia&mdash;especially during the last 20 years&mdash;for national institutions such as this it is government which must ensure their survival and continue to recognise their uniqueness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As increasing numbers of its visitors have no direct experience of war, the Memorial's mission becomes more vital and more complex. Young Australians, in particular, are entitled to know about their country's role in twentieth century war. They are entitled to know that participation in war is a difficult matter, something that involves a whole range of emotions and responses. They are entitled to know that when a democratic society goes to war many of the rights and freedoms they take for granted are severely curtailed. They are entitled to know that while many have supported Australia's participation in seven wars, others have raised their voices in vehement opposition. In short, they are entitled to learn, to think and to make up their own minds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fitting that this Parliament&mdash;the institution responsible for sending the nation's citizens to war&mdash;has reinstituted the two minutes silence at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month. I ask only that next year the traditional two minutes silence is ended by the playing of the Last Post, and that the poppy-sellers are accorded the respect they deserve in this building. A significant number of former members, some current members and several Prime Ministers saw active service. I believe that their sacrifices and the sacrifices of many thousands of others are worthy of an appropriate tribute on Remembrance Day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some 18 months ago I had the pleasure of announcing $650,000 of Federal Government funding within my electorate for the upgrading of the Fairfield bus-rail interchange under the Federal urban public transport program. The Fairfield area has an estimated population in excess of 182,000, with the level of growth over the next decade expected to increase that number. However, with more than 5,000 bus-rail commuter movements every day at Fairfield interchange, the facilities are no longer keeping up with the changing and increasing needs of the station's customers. In addition, commuter access to the interchange and the lack of operating space for buses and taxis are severely limiting the functionality of the exchange.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The funding will provide 12 bus bays, waiting areas, set-down facilities, a taxi rank and covered walkways to make it easier for people from my electorate and the city to transfer from buses to trains at the station. However, what initially seemed to be a straightforward project which had the approval of the Fairfield City Council and State and Federal departments of transport has, sadly, become more talked about than acted upon. After the funding was announced, the State Department of Transport decided it wanted to take part in it and largely took over the project. Continual and ongoing delays have now become the norm with Fairfield interchange. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has taken the State Department one year to appoint a consultant to come up with an appropriate design and manage the design and construction of the project. On 1 May this year the consultants engaged by the State Government&mdash;that is, Gutteridge, Haskins and Davey&mdash;informed Fairfield City Council that a development application for the project would be lodged in two weeks from that date. This vital development application was not lodged until 8 September, following numerous hold-ups and adjustments to the original design. The delays which have occurred throughout this year with the interchange were primarily over minor design amendments. It took meeting after meeting to come to an agreement over most of those changes&mdash;changes that should have taken no time at all to discuss and resolve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 9 October, the Federal Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), at my invitation, came to my electorate to turn the first sod for work on this project, with the promise that actual work would begin the following week&mdash;that was the State Government's commitment. It has now been brought to my attention that the State Department was still working on the contract for the project and nobody would have been able to begin work that week anyway. I have now been informed that as late as 21 October the consultants hired by the State still had not completed the contract for the project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not until 18 November&mdash;last week&mdash;that the Council received the set of final drawings and a copy of the specifications for the project for the Fairfield City Council's approval. This was the first time the Council officers had seen the specifications. According to Fairfield City Council and my investigations, several sets of plans had been received from the consultant where only some minor modifications were needed to have what was the cause of a problem rectified. It has therefore been a very long, slow process for the Council to approve the modifications needed to ensure the proper operation of the interchange and the effective drainage and future maintenance of the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As late as this morning, I was informed that the State Department still had not called for tenders for the contract and work on the interchange could therefore not commence until mid-January. I found this extraordinary as Fairfield City Council had expressed interest in tendering for the contract and, as we know, it would have been able to begin work on the project before Christmas. Late this afternoon&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;I was informed that the New South Wales Government had called for tenders for the contract today, with tenders closing on 11 December and work due to begin, if all goes to plan, on 13 January. I am talking about a project which was initially going to commence early this year and be completed by August 1992 at the latest. The delays in getting this project off the ground have been inexcusable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Fairfield have always needed this facility to be upgraded, but they need it now. It worries me that incompetence or lack of communication on the part of the State Government can push such a worthwhile project as this right off the rails. This project is being fully funded by the Federal Government, yet the State Department of Transport's handling of it has resulted in constant and frustrating delays. My electorate has an employment crisis and capital works projects such as the upgrading of the Fairfield bus-rail interchange would contribute to employment in my community. I have now been waiting more than 18 months for this to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a disgraceful situation and one which I hope will never be repeated. This project is fully funded by the Federal Government. Federal Government money will contribute to the building of this facility and the State Government took on this work. It is the State Government which has delayed this work for some 18 months, to the city's shame. People are still using an outdated facility when they could have been using a modern, updated interchange. Because of the lack of transport facilities, we need that type of facility and, as I said earlier, something like 5,000 commuters go through the interchange each day. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<TITLE>Rural Leadership Program</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="3458" SPEAKER="Andrew Mr J.N." NAMEID="HE4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WAKEFIELD">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly in this adjournment debate to bring to the attention of the House a rural leadership program which was announced at the National Farmers Federation conference last week. This rural leadership program is an initiative of the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. Its charter will incorporate research and development issues affecting the whole of rural industry. It believes that leadership will play a key role in the future viability of rural industry and in the future well-being of our nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leadership program has been developed after close study of two very successful role models by members of the NFF and by members of the public relation consultant, Fewster and Associates, through the company, Turnbull Fox Phillips. One of the key areas that this program drew on was the experience of the Californian agricultural leadership program, which has been operating for some 20 years, and the recently established Melbourne based Williamson community leadership program, which has also provided a basis for this new Australian rural leadership program. As I said, the Australian rural leadership program was launched at the conference of the National Farmers Federation on 17 and 18 November. It is an initiative of the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. The program is drawing on the experiences of the highly successful 20-year old Californian agricultural leadership program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program is to be supervised by a board which reflects a blend of agribusiness and rural interests, with Sir Ninian Stephen as chairman; Mr John Allwright, the immediate past president of the National Farmers Federation; Ms Trish Caswell, the executive director of the Australian Conservation Foundation; Mr John Fairfax, the chairman of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rural Press</EMPHASIS>; Miss Dorothy Ross, a past president of the Country Women's Association; and representatives of the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, Professor Snow Barlow and Mr Bruce Gowrie Smith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that the program is to be headed by Mr Mike Beckingham. Sir Ninian Stephen has commended Mr Beckingham. Sir Ninian pointed out that Mr Beckingham has had over 20 years experience, in Australia and overseas, particularly in the area of training and development. As a result of his experience in leadership training, the National Farmers Federation is optimistic that the program will indeed be a success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House may not be aware that Mr Beckingham is, in fact, a former colonel of the Australian Army. He will be responsible for the development and implementation of the program which will commence its first two-year course in April 1993. I commend this initiative of the National Farmers Federation to the House. I also commend the role that is currently being played by the promotions company in attracting young farm leaders to participate in this particular program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of members of this House who have been involved in rural leadership programs. As we move into the next century, the importance of having at the helm of agriculture people who are aware of just what it means to be involved in international trade and in keeping a competitive edge for Australia's primary industry cannot be overstated. I think that in the light of the announcement of the progress that has been made in the GATT talks, the importance of informed rural leadership in Australia becomes particularly acute. It is no longer sufficient for us simply to elect farmers to head up our rural bodies. We now need to elect primary producers who are skilled in marketing and leadership development and who have agricultural expertise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the National Farmers Federation for announcing this rural leadership program. I hope that from farmers and primary producers across the nation, it will find a range of men and women who are prepared to be involved in the program and so equip themselves effectively to be the rural leaders of the future. I thank the House for the opportunity to bring to the attention of the House this new initiative in rural leadership. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A young person reading the Hobart <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> might find an advertisement of this kind:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Students 13-15 part time work. Weekly wage. Details ONLY given today.</PARA>
<PARA>Then follow some times and a phone number, which is, I believe, a phone number in the Sandy Bay phone district. If young people were to ring that number, they would find a man who holds himself out to be a Mr Max Creed, who operates a business under the name Student Distributors. What they would find, were they to follow up this phone call, is that he would start them out on a trial night where they would be sent out to sell lollies. The lollies he would provide in baskets of 28, each to sell retail to householders door to door at $2.50. So the basket is worth $70. If they sold on the trial night, they would perhaps be invited back to continue to sell the product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way the sales would be organised is that the young persons would be dropped by their parents at premises in Edge Avenue, Lenah Valley, near a park. He would collect them in a hire car or similar vehicle, take them out to the suburbs, bring them back three or four hours later, when their parents would collect them. For their service in selling these products, they would retain 15 per cent of the sale price during the week and, if they took the products home on the weekend and conducted what is called home sales, they would be able to retain 20 per cent if they sold more than 24 bags. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of this is that a student who sells the whole collection of 28 bags of sweets in an evening would earn $10.50 and Mr Creed would earn approximately $59.50. Then, at the end of the week on Friday nights, Mr Creed pays the students, whom he has persuaded to join and sell these products, what is due to them. But he deducts from their pay packet the sum of 50c each for tax. To the best knowledge of those participating, no-one has ever filled in a tax declaration form. So, the net effect of selling these products would be that a student would have $10 and Mr Creed $60. The corporate creed which is marked on the bags of sweets is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are a profit making registered business. However, we believe the students need as much help as they can get. The purchase of any product helps us to provide cash prizes for students apart from commission earned.</PARA>
<PARA>I have had contact from a number of people who are concerned about this operation and in particular from one student, Simone Wilkinson, who has indicated that she is willing to go public, so concerned is she, having been a person induced to enter this scheme. To the best of her knowledge, no cash prizes have ever been offered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of her work was to earn $30 in the first fortnight. This works out at approximately four evenings of four hours, a total of 16 hours, or approximately $1.80 an hour for her labour. This is even below the $3 an hour minimum amount that would be permitted by the coalition were it to win power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this issue because it seems to me that this is one area where young people are potentially very much at risk of exploitation. It is an issue which demands attention from parents whose children may be induced to enter into these schemes. They are certainly being used as very cheap labour, and the matter of the withholding of some money on account of tax without any tax declaration forms being completed does seem to raise very important issues that go far beyond that simple point of potential exploitation of young people. These issues having been drawn to my attention, I believe that they are important, and I place them on record in the House. </PARA>

My Department's interpretation of the Convention was that prior informed consent was not necessary for port transit, that is, where wastes were not unloaded and did not cross the customs barrier. Subsequent advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was that the Convention should be interpreted as requiring such consent. I have instructed my Department to follow the latter advice with any future exports, to be quite sure the requirements of the Convention are met.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3462" SPEAKER="Duffy The Hon M.J." NAMEID="6G4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="DUNKLEY">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr Duffy</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) I am advised that a meeting of unit holders was held on 15 July 1992 and that the unit holders agreed to convert the trust from a redeemable listed trust (i.e. where some units may be traded on the stock exchange and other units may be redeemed from the trust subject to the terms and conditions of the deed) to a fully listed trust and as a consequence to cancel existing redemption requests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Before dealing with question 2, I have some preliminary comments. Recent amendments to the Corporations Law and the administrative policy of the Australian Securities Commission were developed to address various problems experienced by the unlisted property trust industry which had led to reduced investor confidence. The most difficult problem has been the diminished liquidity of investments. This has arisen as a result of the mismatch between the requirement on managers to buy back units on request usually at short notice and the illiquid nature of real estate as an investment in a depressed property market. These problems have been aggravated by the fact that there are significant discrepancies between the prices at which units could be redeemed by investors and their `true' value represented by the market's valuation of the property in the trust. Without a reassessment of existing redemption requests outgoing unit holders would obtain an unfair advantage over unit holders holding onto their investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to question 2, the Australian Securities Commission does not have a function of approving the actions taken by unit holders pursuant to a unit holders' meeting. The Commission's functions relate to the administration of the Corporations Law. Under the Corporations Law, the Commission must approve a trust deed and an amending deed where the trust deed and amending deed do not breach the requirements of the Law. In essence, as long as they contain the required covenants the Commission has no discretion about whether or not to approve the deed. The Commission is also vested with power to declare that a specified deed is not required to contain certain covenants required under the Law. The Commission's practice is to exempt property trusts seeking to be listed from the requirement that the manager and/or trustee affect a redemption or repurchase of the units. This is because liquidity of the trust is provided by reason of the listing. In accordance with the Commission's practice, it has published a Policy Statement No.16 entitled "Property Trusts and Property Syndicates" in which it sets out the conditions upon which it will grant such exemptions. One of the conditions includes a requirement that unit holders have before them a resolution as to how outstanding withdrawal requests are to be treated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Subject to the approval of the Commission, unit holders are able to vary the terms of the original trust deed providing the deed contains a clause permitting such amendments. Section 1069A of the Corporations Law sets out a procedure which permits the modification of an approved deed. The effect of the section is to require that where the trustee believes that a modification to the deed will adversely affect the rights of unit holders it must be the subject of a resolution at a unit holders' meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission's powers to approve or otherwise vary a deed amending the original deed is governed by section 1067(2) of the Corporations Law which compels the Commission to approve the deed unless the deed does not comply with the requirements of the Law or the Corporations Regulations. The Commission has no power to require variation of the deed of its own volition.</PARA>
