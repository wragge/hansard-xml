<TITLE>Ozone Depletion</TITLE>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the Speaker and Representatives in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We, the Lord of Knights of the Sovereign World Order of The White Cross, Prof. Dr. Paul Baron Neuman of Kara Bagh as President of the Confederation of Chivalry jointly with our Officers and Members in Australia and worldwide, citizens and residents of The Commonwealth of Australia in participation with the aims of our Orders of humanitarian knighthood for the defence and protection of life by this our humble petition respectfully showeth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We wish to voice our concern on behalf of the undersigned petitioners for the sake of the Australian nation as a whole. Indeed for the sake of all future generations should they survive the bleak future now already partly conceivable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Confederation of Chivalry jointly and on behalf of the undersigned petitioners who have petitioned before the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives over the approaching Greenhouse Effect have taken notice that the predicted effect of the ozone layer depletion would take place around the year 2000 and thereafter and that the governments of the world would gradually (in our belief rather reluctantly) reduce the causes of such depletion calling for step-by-step phasing out manufacture of said products by placing restrictions on the industries concerned. It should have come as a shock to all responsible in the wellbeing and government of the nations that the predicted time (the year 2000) was a mere optimistic assumption, a blind tapping into the unknown by Scientists in their uncertainty. A gross depletion of the ozone layer has already started and has built-up a huge danger field across Europe, Northern Asia and Northern America forming an increasing cloud of chlorine monoxide which is responsible for the destruction of the ozone layer. We trust that all the Honourable Members of the House fully understand the catastrophic effects which will transform the entire planet once the protective ozone layer has disappeared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely no responsible executive in whatever field and in whatever part of this world would in full view of these approaching dangers subject mankind and the delicate web of life to devastation and destruction, and yet we notice that very little is being done. Instead of emergency measures worldwide, it appears that business continues as usual, since possibly few would dare to upset Electorates in fear of higher unemployment (due to the closure of industries responsible for this ill course), apparently it seems unpopular "to rock the boat".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have noticed the immense destruction and total exploitation of the natural resources in the former Soviet Union caused during Bolshevik Rule keeping embarrassing and devastating damages to the environment away from the public eye, and it is not far fetched to assume that similar coverups are done as the general rule in the so-called industrial nations, including Australia. We have noticed with utmost concern and in sheer desperation that all warnings, appeals, protests and submissions have failed to impress any particular Government of the day, and it is with the same concern for the sake of all, that the Undersigned Petitioners in all humbleness and respect remind the Honourable Members of the House, that not only their own lives, but the lives of their own children will bear the consequences together with the Australian nation, indeed with mankind and nature, of the entire globe if measures are not implemented immediately. It may not even be for the sake of ourselves (since the measures come too late for us) but for the gradual recovery of the Ozone Layer offering an eventual liveable future for our children and grandchildren.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hold that for the bare survival of the inhabitants of this planet, financial priorities must give way to environmental priorities, curbing or freezing the actions of International Bankers and their Monetary Fund, which in all fairness must be held responsible for the situation mankind is in now. We must replace industrial policy with practical and natural support of our communities as a whole. We further believe that in the course of such a change of policy for the general public worldwide, diversification and simplification appear to be the only option open if we care to achieve a maximum positive effect. To educate ladies in spraying their hair so many times a day surely exposes the dark side of advertising and mass-marketing. People spray here and there and everywhere, be it for improving the odour in their houses, spray paint their walls, attack flying insects and hidden cockroaches or whatever the reason for spraying may be, including graffitti on trains and walls by the youngsters of our society today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is believed that a family of five must possess six cars in order to be up to the standards then it is surely a warning sign of excessive indulgence, mentally ill to say the least. Our forebears were living happily and contentedly using horse carts and bicycles. The effectiveness of these simple means of transportation had been best demonstrated by the Vietminh winning an entire war against the French, mainly with the transportation help of bicycles. We still have the option to rapidly introduce solar and electric power in replacement of coal and oil. Unfortunately it seems that such concept bears very little consideration by the powerful rulers of the world today, since oil appears to be still targeted as the major energy source for the future, otherwise the Gulf War would not have been fought, oil exploration in the sea would not be intensified and the American Secretary of State Mr Baker would not have had such a longing smile for the oil fields of Baku in Azerbhaijan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that it is of national importance for Australia to fulfil at last the great dream and promise made by the former Prime Minister Mr Hawke for the planting of millions of trees on this Continent, thus becoming a reality and not a mere vote catching fantasy. Australia, indeed, possesses the means and the resources, the people and the reason to create forest belts across the Continent, together with huge lakes and dams being a counter measure and possibly the only safeguard for the survival of all creatures on this Continent. We, the Undersigned petitioners, humbly submit that our Almighty Creator may still have some Grace in store for us all, that we should not adopt a fatalistic or selfish attitude, but rather believe in a very humble saying: "If I would know that the world is coming to an end tomorrow, I would still plant a tree today!"  It could well be that a selfless nationwide thinking in these terms may trigger a nationwide revitalisation programme being the true conquest against the decertification of the nation's lands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with humble submission that we, the Undersigned Petitioners wish to alert the Honourable Members of the House on this issue and we request taking steps as a matter of emergency, irrespective of forthcoming elections or political problems otherwise. That the Honourable Members of the House may contemplate that the heating-up of our climate would not only destroy the vegetation and therefore the basis of nourishment for most creatures, including man, but would also prevent a regeneration of the environment within several thousand years of future, thus being the end of the line for the planet and variety of life as we know it. The Undersigned Petitioners have submitted similar requests or are in the process of doing so to nations in all parts of our world. Since our concern encompasses each and every environment violation and we are certainly concerned with the future of the diminishing Taiga in Siberia and the rain forests of the Amazon. We are alarmed about the forward moving deserts in Africa and elsewhere, particularly since this phenomenon is related to man's hazardous exploitation to which he subjects any environment where money can be made or those parts of nature which have yet not proven to be a source of income. We therefore may respectfully include the many repeated warnings from all parts of the world, including from some scientists themselves, to keep hands off Antarctica as well as northern regions in similar climatic conditions. If the Honourable Members of the House may contemplate the degree of cruelty man has already imposed and will do so in the future upon the creatures of nature (man claims to be a caretaker on behalf of God), since documentaries have already been shown on Australian television, demonstrating the pitiful condition of sheep blinded due to cataracts in the mountainous regions of Chile and other parts of South America, caused by the ozone layer depletion.

<PARA>The first of the two reports I have presented has to do with the completion of a series of standing orders which deal with the opening of Parliament and the election of Speaker. They are in line with matters which have already been reported to this Parliament in the past and they incorporate a proposition which was agreed to by this House in the previous Parliament, that the senior member of the Parliament should take the chair during that election, with the exception that there has been built into the new proceedings a new Deputy Chairman's position, which would be the Senior Deputy Chairman, who would be a person nominated at the commencement of the Parliament by the Speaker.

It is a departure from the present process but, given the circumstances in the House and given the fact that there is a filtering device in the Selection Committee, it is considered to be appropriate that a member should, on his own initiative, be able to lodge a matter of private members' business without the need to show a seconder. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKELLAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade examined the effectiveness of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research known as ACIAR. Specifically, the Committee looked at, firstly, the effectiveness of ACIAR as an element of Australia's official development assistance program against its charter embodied in the ACIAR Act of 1982 and, secondly, the desirability or otherwise of the continued existence of the Centre as a statutory authority after the expiration of 12 years of operations, which is June 1994, the maximum length of existence specified in the current Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Australia has extensive expertise in agricultural research, it was not until the creation of ACIAR in 1982 that the expertise was effectively applied to developing countries' agricultural problems. The Centre was established by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Act of 1982 as a statutory authority within the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio. The legislation contained a sunset clause disbanding the Centre after 12 years unless its continuation was recommended by a new Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was a surprise to the Committee was that ACIAR is a really good news story. Outside the field of those involved in agricultural research, the work of ACIAR is almost completely unknown. Its work has great benefit and should be much more widely publicised. Furthermore, the high level of ACIAR's performance sets an example for other statutory bodies to try to match. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has made 21 recommendations covering the areas of management and organisation, ACIAR's research program, funding, relations with other organisations, ACIAR in the future, extending ACIAR's mandate and public awareness. The first two recommendations cover management and organisation. The Centre has two governing bodies, a Policy Advisory Council and a Board of Management. The Policy Advisory Council provides advice to the Minister regarding agricultural problems of developing countries and programs and policies with respect to agricultural research for either or both of the following purposes: firstly, identifying agricultural problems of developing countries and, secondly, finding solutions to agricultural problems of developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Membership of the Council currently consists of the President, the Director of the Centre, the person for the time being occupying or performing the duties of the Director-General of the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau and not fewer than 12 nor more than 16 other members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Board of Management of the Centre is responsible for the conduct and control of the affairs of the Centre. It consists of the President of the Council, the Director of the Centre, the person for the time being occupying or performing the duties of the Director-General of the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau and three other members appointed by the Governor-General from among the members of the Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes there is scope for a reduction in the membership of the Policy Advisory Council and that the membership of Australians and non-Australians should be equal. Furthermore, the Committee believes that there should be some degree of flexibility in AIDAB representation on both bodies. To this end our first recommendation covers an amendment to section 8(1)(c) of the ACIAR Act dealing with AIDAB representation on the ACIAR Board of Management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our second recommendation is that there be an amendment to section 19 dealing with the membership of the Policy Advisory Council including AIDAB representation. The size of the Council is to be reduced to 12 and half the Council members are to be residents of countries other than Australia. The Committee in its third recommendation recommends that the quorum requirement for a meeting of the Policy Advisory Committee be reduced from nine to seven and that the President have a deliberative and casting vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the ACIAR's research program the Committee has made four recommendations. The Committee supports ACIAR's primary focus on South East Asia and the South Pacific. However, the Committee recommends that as funding permits ACIAR should foster collaborate projects of mutual importance to other parts of the world including Africa, the Middle East and South America. North Africa and the Middle East in particular should be a priority because of Australia's expertise in dry land farming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for ACIAR and its contracted organisations to have some flexibility in determining the length of stay of Australian scientists in a country. The Committee recommends that ACIAR in conjunction with its commissioned organisations and partner institutions continue to evaluate the length of stay of Australian scientists in a country on a project by project basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although ACIAR's research program activities have been successful, improvement is still possible in several areas. Project length is currently three years, but in some cases this has not been sufficient. The Committee recommends that ACIAR be more flexible in determining project length, allowing projects to be approved on a case by case basis for periods of between three and five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some difficulties in the past relations between ACIAR research program coordinators and Australian scientists in the commissioned organisations. While most problems could be described as personality driven rather than institutional, the Committee sees merit in ACIAR setting out clear guidelines governing the relationship between ACIAR and the commissioned Australian research institutions and detailing the relevant responsibilities of each position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee looked closely at the question of the economic returns to the partner countries from the annual expenditure by ACIAR of $17m to $18m. The figures which ACIAR provided to the Committee, based on an economic assessment of the costs and returns of 12 research projects, are very impressive indeed. Based on these 12 research projects alone, ACIAR claims that for a total research cost of $27.4m&mdash;that is in 1990 dollars&mdash;the expected benefits over the next 15 to 20 years would be $816.7m, again in 1990 dollars. The Committee was rigorous in its questioning of the basis of the cost-benefit analysis but, even with a sizeable error factor built in, the Committee acknowledges that the outcome of ACIAR's research to date has, at the very least, proved cost-efficient, unlike a number of projects undertaken under the general aid program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to funding, the Committee has made three recommendations. The Committee was satisfied that the financial operations and measures to ensure accountability were sufficiently rigorous to ensure that the disposal of its funds were in keeping with the objectives for which they were appropriated. The Committee noted the Auditor-General's concern over the question of financial delegations and the related issues of payments into the trust fund and the types of financial statements required at present. The Committee recommends amendment to the ACIAR Act as a matter of urgency to rectify these technical problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the success of ACIAR's work and the fact that funding levels have remained in the range of 1.3 to 1.48 per cent of total official development assistance, the Committee believes there is room for a significant increase in the budget allocation for ACIAR. The Committee therefore recommends that ACIAR's priority within the aid budget be increased, and that by 1997 approximately 3.5 per cent of the aid budget should be allocated to ACIAR. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ACIAR does not meet the full cost of some of its activities for the Australian commissioned organisations. The Committee agrees that there need to be clear guidelines established that detail what will and will not be funded by ACIAR and therefore recommends that the ACIAR Board of Management formalise and issue a policy on the matter of overheads and cost recovery for the information and guidance of Australian collaborative institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relationship between ACIAR and AIDAB is longstanding and extensive and appears to be of mutual benefit. Similarly, relations between ACIAR and its commissioned organisations and their partner institutions are generally productive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although Australia contributes to the core funding of international agricultural research centres, there has been a significant decline in our contributions since 1986 and the current allocation of $7.4m is equivalent to approximately one-half of one per cent of the total aid budget. These contributions are administered by AIDAB, but ACIAR has a close working relationship with these centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee makes two recommendations on relations with other organisations: firstly, that funding for the international agricultural research centres, together with the resources needed to administer these funds, be transferred from AIDAB to ACIAR; and, secondly, the Committee further recommends that the funding for the international agricultural research centres is to be additional to the increase in ACIAR core funding recommended earlier and that the level of international agricultural research centre core funding be increased to 1.5 per cent of total official development assistance over 5 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Under its terms of reference, the Committee was charged to examine the desirability or otherwise of the continued existence of the centre as a statutory authority after the expiration of 12 years of operations, the maximum length of existence specified in the current Act. The Committee was unanimous in its opinion that ACIAR should continue and that it should retain its statutory authority status within the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While sympathetic to ACIAR's wish to have the uncertainties of the sunset clause removed, there was a strongly held view on the Committee that the existence of a sunset clause had distinct advantages. Indeed, the Committee is of the view that greater use should be made of sunset clauses to review the performance of all statutory bodies. The role of sunset clauses for statutory authorities should be the subject of examination and the Committee recommends that the appropriate parliamentary committee inquire into the role of sunset clauses for statutory authorities. As other statutory authorities do not have sunset clauses, ACIAR argued that it could see no reason why it should be treated in a totally different way from any other statutory body created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a strong belief in the Committee that there was considerable benefit in retaining the sunset clause as it kept the organisation at a high level of performance with the achievement of excellent results. On equity grounds the Committee does not recommend the imposition of a further sunset clause on ACIAR. However, to ensure the continued strong performance of the organisation, the Committee does recommend that the new Act to continue ACIAR include a fundamental review every five years of ACIAR's terms of reference, including the continued existence of the organisation; it also recommends that the review of ACIAR be carried out by a parliamentary committee, as this will assist in achieving public awareness of the value of ACIAR's work, and that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade is the appropriate body to conduct such a review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mandate of the centre is closely defined, with functions such as training and extension programs precluded from its activities. The Committee has made four recommendations which are, in essence, an extension of ACIAR's charter. Time precludes my going into these in very much detail, but the Committee found the ACIAR inquiry to be a positive one because the centre did such a very good job. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I endorse the remarks of my colleague the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar), because there is little doubt that what he has said identifies so much of the worthwhile work that has been undertaken by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. I want to identify a number of particular matters of concern. Firstly, I do not think many of the members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade were aware of the work undertaken by ACIAR before we undertook this inquiry, and I do not think many other people were either. For that reason, recommendation 21 suggests that ACIAR consult with AIDAB on ways to increase public awareness of the importance of ACIAR's work and its achievements in solving major agricultural problems. Indeed, annexed to the report&mdash;and I commend this to all honourable members&mdash;is a list of some of the projects in which ACIAR has been involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The members of the Committee thought it was remarkable that so much economic benefit had flowed from the work of Australian scientists. One of the parallel benefits of this work is that not only has it extended into overseas countries, but there has certainly been a flow-on in a number of areas in Australia. For example, with regard to the storage and handling of tropical fruits, much of the work that has been undertaken at Queensland University has as much application to our own produce as it does to the produce of the South Pacific and South East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the work has involved quite extraordinary dedication. On page 86 of the report there is reference, for example, to the biological control of salvinia waterweed. This was a three-year project led by Dr Peter Room and Dr Wendy Forno from the CSIRO Division of Entomology. The extent to which the efforts by these two scientists and their assistants had brought enormous benefits to the community was quite remarkable. It related not only to the economic benefits to rice farmers and fishermen and their families and to hydro-electricity authorities, but it also had a health flow-on because of the reduced spread of disease by mosquitoes. The economic benefits have been assessed at a cost ratio of 32 : 1, which is a phenomenal figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have referred to the need for a greater understanding of the work of ACIAR. I now want to refer to the excellent work that is being undertaken by the Policy Advisory Council. Professor John Dillon of the University of New England has long been associated with the ACIAR group. When I heard the recommendations of the Policy Advisory Council, I confess that I was impressed by what was a remarkable combination of representatives from Australia and overseas. To have this combination of people recommending aid programs is unusual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recommendation 2, some adjustments are suggested to the constitution of that board, as indeed there is to the membership of the ACIAR Board of Management. However, essentially we think the work being undertaken by ACIAR is first-rate and deserves to be extended. As my colleague has said, one of the matters of concern was whether or not the sunset clause should be extended. In fact, we have recommended that it be removed and that a five-year review program be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other factor which I wanted to refer to was that, obviously, because of the benefits of this type of cooperative research it needs to be examined in relation to what can be done in other fields. Therefore, in recommendation 20, we suggested that the Government should examine the possibility of establishing an organisation along the same lines as ACIAR for the purpose of providing research and development assistance to regional countries in manufacturing systems, human resource development and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night I spent a few moments talking about AIDAB and aid programs in relation to the Asian Development Bank allocations in the Bill. It seems to me that the concept of ACIAR is one which we need to examine. It seems to bring direct benefits in that it links the academic community and the farmer or the practical requirements of government. I think it is a model which needs to be extended. I commend all those who have been involved with ACIAR. It is an outstanding program. I also commend the products of its work to honourable members. I am sure anyone who has an opportunity to see its work in practice will believe, as do the members of the Committee, that it has been a worthwhile investment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to strongly support the remarks made by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) and the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) because ACIAR, the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, is a particularly effective aid organisation. As background to my remarks, I draw honourable members' attention to a United Nations development program report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Human Development Report</EMPHASIS>, which has just been published. It has on its front cover a diagram in the shape of a champagne glass which shows the global distribution of income. At the top of the champagne glass, it shows that the top 20 per cent of global income earners receive 83 per cent of global income. The bottom 20 per cent receive 1.7 per cent. It is obviously essential for a relatively wealthy country such as Australia to do what it can to influence that distribution. One of the most important contributions that I have ever come across is the work by the ACIAR. It is particularly cost-effective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to quote one example. The right honourable member for New England quoted another example. I have had a little contact with a project that the centre was involved in, the control of newcastle disease amongst chickens. Newcastle disease is the world's worst viral disease in village chicken populations. We have a very mild variety of the disease in Australia and it occurred to a couple of researchers that they could use that mild viral strain to develop a heat resistant oral vaccine which could be used to stop the disease in Asia; and they did that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chickens are very important, obviously, as a source of protein and of cash in low income countries. Yet newcastle disease was wiping out large populations of chickens, sometimes annually. This strain developed in Australia has been used to stop the disease in one of the states of Malaysia. It has now been adapted for use in five other South East Asian countries. An independent assessment of the benefit of this research shows that, over the six countries in which the oral vaccine is now being used, the saving is about $150m. So for a cost to Australia of $3m&mdash;that is all the project cost&mdash;there has been a saving to those six lower income countries of about $150m, a benefit-cost ratio of 25 : 1. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a particularly good example of the cost-effectiveness of the funds that are spent through this agricultural research organisation. That is the reason why the Committee has recommended that funding for ACIAR be increased to 3 1/2 per cent of the aid budget by 1997. In fact, that is our most important recommendation. Obviously we have to constantly review the aid program to see which parts are most effective and which parts are less effective. Clearly this is one of the most effective parts; therefore the Committee has recommended that its funding be substantially increased. I hope that the Government will accept that recommendation, because this is one of the areas where Australia, being an agricultural country, can make the greatest contribution to developing countries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report presented by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Warehouse to Wharf</EMPHASIS> and was an inquiry into the efficiency of the interface between seaports and land transport. It was a wide-ranging examination of one of the real cost factors for Australian exporters and importers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987 the Inter-State Commission presented a report on the features of costs for exporters and importers and made the remark that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The costs of unreliability and uncertainty affect importers and exporters in financial terms at least as much as direct charges. The insidiousness of unreliability is that its impact is largely open ended and outside user control.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>The Inter-State Commission was saying that those who should be beneficiaries of an efficient system&mdash;the exporters and importers, the factories and farmers, and the retailers and wholesalers of Australia&mdash;are those who cannot control the process of movement of goods through the seaports and land transport systems. They are the ones who pay&mdash;and ultimately the Australian consumer pays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A myriad of reports have been presented on this area over the last 10 years. It is interesting that a committee of the Parliament has come to grips with all of the elements in land transport in relation to the export and import of goods. I pay tribute to the staff and to the Chairman of the Committee for the way in which the inquiry was conducted, and to those members of the Subcommittee who expressed a particular interest in this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding figures produced by the Bureau of Transport Economics on the cost of shore based shipping costs, it is interesting to note the movement of those costs over the last five or six years. In most areas there appears to have been a decrease in costs, although in some instances costs have increased. These costs are attributable to ports and their related charges, to stevedoring, customs brokers, transport to and from wharf, packing and unpacking, and transport to and from a depot when necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the scale used by the Bureau of Transport Economics, it is interesting to note that between 1985 and 1991 the cost of less-than-container loads declined from a figure of 2,392 to 1,972. It is a ratio, not a figure, and is a measure used as an economic measuring model. Despite that decline, there are areas in the system where costs have increased. Those areas where costs have increased include customs brokers and transport to and from wharf, the area examined by this Committee. Those costs have significantly increased while many other costs have tended to decline over the six-year period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one is to take seriously the statement of the Inter-State Commission, then Australians are paying multimillion dollars for the inefficiencies in the movement of goods between factories and farms and the wharf, or from the wharf into the shops. There is a complex arrangement and cross-matching of transport arrangements that the Committee examined and set out in tables in the report. These tables cover pages of the requirements and processes in the transport system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report shows that the responsibilities for people in the transport system are so complex that one becomes aware that the transport system and the movement of goods is an industry in itself, an industry which is not responsible to the users of that system and in which the users cannot control the prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has come forward with recommendations for the establishment of an interface efficiency council. It could, in fact, in my view, prove to be not as valuable as the Committee first thought it might be. This Committee report is a wonderful compromise, with the Australian Labor Party not wanting to go as fast in some areas as the coalition and the coalition forcing the pace with changes to workplace relationships and many other areas where we see a sense of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee worked very smoothly and came to the best agreement possible in the circumstances. There has been no dissenting report to this final report because people have agreed with the results and the recommendations. However, in some instances, what flows from this report on the part of the Government is a reluctance to move as fast as the Opposition would want things to move in this critical area where there is a need for absolute urgency if we are to remain competitive and to boost our export effectiveness and the return to Australian producers and manufacturers and where those who are importing need to retain a minimal cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of an efficiency council would look at things such as desirable changes in the system, the frustrations and inefficiencies that occur, the lack of coordination and the documentation problems. I have mentioned the myriad of processes in the import and export chain in the transport mode but when one comes to look at the documentation required for the movement of credit or cash it is hardly less complex, with a system of checking and cross-checking that is understandable but which is complex. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the interesting recommendations, and many submissions were received, was on the prospect of electronic data interchange and the need for Australia to establish a comprehensive process that could be accessed by all importers and exporters so that the information for ordering, times for arrival of ships and exact description of goods or cargo can be done quickly, can be done efficiently and can be done in such a way that all users&mdash;importers, exporters, customs agents and government departments&mdash;can access the information. The process appears to be moving slowly and it appears that in every sense there will be a commercial gain from the process. It is time that Australians understood that we are in a very competitive world and if Australia is going to succeed then the need to establish an efficient electronic data interchange as a matter of absolute priority cannot be overstressed. Australia must take a lead in this area if we are going to be successful in the drive to export efficiently and to have our imports come in at minimal costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report itself, as I have mentioned, is a compromise; many of the recommendations, in my view, are softer than they need be and there appears to be a lack of urgency about the report. I am not being critical of my colleagues or taking a partisan view; it is a personal point of view. I do not think that Australians at large understand how critical this area is for the future of our nation. The complexity of the transport processes in the export and import of goods is not understood; it has become an industry in itself. It is becoming an industry which is self-perpetuating and lacks real competition. There is a need to change the whole approach to this industry if we are going to be effective and competitive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak to the report of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Warehouse to Wharf</EMPHASIS>. No area is subject to such emotion as the Australian waterfront, and no area&mdash;except maybe the flag&mdash;suffers more by the distortion and ignorance of most of its critics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it is very convenient, either intentionally or unintentionally, to confuse the Australian waterfront with the Australian Waterside Workers Union. The waterside workers are only one link in a whole chain of operators on the waterfront. The Opposition can, in the unlikely event that it becomes the Government, put the troops on the waterfront. But unless those opposite are prepared to tackle all of the options, it will be an expensive, divisive gesture of futility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee and the Subcommittee of which I was a member tried to look at all aspects of the movement of containers and cargo through Australia's major ports. I believe that we have come up with a report containing recommendations that will, if accepted, correct many of the problems plaguing the interface between seaports and land transport. The thrust of the report is to generate a better understanding of the needs of all who are involved in the whole interface, including users of those services, and a better understanding of how we can make the system work more effectively for the benefit of the whole nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was therefore disappointing that on the release of our report, the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), put out a press release criticising the report in which he says that the report is a soft option report. It is clear that he does not understand the operations of the interface between the warehouse and the waterfront. It is also clear that he does not understand industrial relations on the waterfront. He did not make a submission to the inquiry. He did not appear before the Committee, which was open for him to do. He did not attend any Committee hearing as the Opposition spokesperson on shipping. He wanted to go on a union bashing exercise; but the Committee, over a period of 18 months, tried to dispel the `us versus them' adversarial theme. All the members of the Committee tried to develop in its place a spirit of cooperation, of getting people to understand the complexities of each other's tasks, responsibilities and needs, and of making the whole interface work better for the benefit of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee found that the waterfront has been a sorry saga of lost opportunities. Too many people have been prepared to put all the blame on the Waterside Workers Federation. This is a smokescreen behind which many of the most vocal critics hide their own inefficiencies and unwillingness to change; but change they must if Australia is to become competitive. Responsibility for the failure to act rests squarely on the shoulders of importers, exporters, transport chain participants and their respective industry organisation. The inquiry has revealed an appalling apathy, ignorance and inertia on the part of users of waterfront services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Participants along the chain have each operated within their own discrete worlds, without regard to the impact of their actions on the overall efficiency of the chain. Much of the evidence presented to the Committee had been heard before by either the Webber Committee on Shore Based Shipping Costs in 1984-86 or the Inter-State Commission from 1986-89. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One reason for the apathy could be the unpreparedness for, or unawareness of, the individual cost components of the services utilised. This arises from the lack of a direct commercial relationship between importers and exporters and the service providers. Alternatively, it may be that, despite all the rhetoric from some industry organisations, individual firms have not seen the waterfront costs as a priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry found a prevalent attitude among participants of blaming each other for the inefficiencies, expense and failing of interface services. It was a case of, `It was always someone else's fault'. It is clear that if participants in the chain from the warehouse to the wharf started talking to each other rather than about each other, Australia's trade effort would greatly benefit. The waterfront is not an `it', it is not a single entity; it is the sum of many players. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, as the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) said on its presentation and the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) said this morning, the report was a compromise. Some members wanted to go stronger on some recommendations; but they were discussed, and we came up with a unanimous report that was agreed on all sides. I thought that that was good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, when there were half a dozen people in the room, each having different points of view, each of us would have put greater emphasis on some area. For example, in my own case, I would have liked to see more credit go to the waterside workers who, despite what we hear in this place, have reformed their industry. But of course, willing as I always am to compromise, I did not want too much praise to go to the Waterside Workers Federation. Indeed, I was in agreement that, where a critical comment was deserved, it should be included in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The waterfront exemplifies one of our national shortcomings. Australians have always been loath to face up to responsibility. We always find it easier to blame others rather than to look at improving our own performance. As is known, the waterfront produces nothing. The waterfront reacts. It makes nothing at all. It does not build anything. But it does provide a service. People bring cargo to the waterfront by sea and take it away by land, or vice versa. The timetables are very much determined by those who use the waterfront, whether by sea or by land. That is not done by the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All aspects of our port system were comprehensively reviewed with the aim of achieving substantial improvements in efficiency and productivity. One area that I would like to stress is the importance of what is called the `paper chain' on the waterfront. This is one area where improvement could be made, and this may come with electronic data information flow. It has been estimated that some 40 million documents&mdash;imagine it&mdash;are generated annually in Australia, related to the transport of import and export cargo. Around 100 separate pieces of paper can be required in the import process alone. The reduction in paperwork, repetitive data processing and keeping tabs on cargo is estimated to produce savings of between 3 and 5 per cent of the value of our traded goods. This represents a saving of between $100m and $200m per annum, just by cutting out the paperwork. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comparing the current complexity of paperwork with the intricacies of our system for payment of cargo, the current reliance on the antiquated bill of lading and letter of credit systems is causing unnecessary delays at the sea and land transport interface. This was illustrated in evidence from the Committee's Western Australian hearing that ship borne cargo may arrive prior to the bill of lading. Steaming time from Singapore might be only four days, but it might be seven days before the documentation arrives. Cargo would not be able to be unloaded until the bill of lading arrived. This is clearly an unsatisfactory situation and urgent reform is needed in this area. Again, the increased use of electronic data interchange and electronic funds transfer will assist in simplifying and streamlining the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The spotlight must now turn to the interface between our ports and our land transport. I see this report acting as a catalyst to speed up the process of trade and ensure that it spreads along the whole of the transport chain. That is what we have got to do. They cannot be isolated, and the whole of the users of the waterfront have got to start talking to each other. They have got to start acting as a single entity. It is no good, any longer, each blaming the other. Each group has got to take responsibility for its own actions. If we are serious&mdash;and if they are serious&mdash;about bringing real and significant change and reform on the waterfront, it is up to them. We can set the guidelines, but it is up to them to act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to pay tribute to the Chairman, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) for the excellent work he did; to the Deputy Chairman, the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), and all the members of the Committee, who worked very hard; and especially to the staff, Chris Patterson and June Murphy, without whose diligence and assistance we would not have been able to bring down this report, which I think is one of the most important reports that will come before this Federal Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Warehouse to Wharf</EMPHASIS> is my first experience of a Federal parliamentary inquiry and, like the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), I must say I am particularly impressed with the operation of the Committee and I can only express admiration for the tremendous amount of work done by the Chairman, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris). I can also appreciate the efforts of the Committee staff and the officers of the Department of Transport and Communications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the terms of reference of the inquiry, that is, an examination of the interface between seaport and land transport, I think the report is a major contribution to waterfront reform. It is obvious, however, from the many inspections and public hearings that the Subcommittee made around Australia, that a great deal still remains to be done to improve the total transport chain from factory or farm to the point of sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report, and the many submissions, clearly show that, while labour reform has certainly been necessary and great improvements have in fact been made, the almost exclusive concentration on this aspect of the waterfront over the last decade has obscured not only the need to reform the whole transport chain, but also the wider factors which determine waterfront efficiency. I refer to the excessive number of container ports in Australia; the inherent difficulties of scheduling ship arrivals, given long distances; and the distorting effects of the pan-Australia freight rate. As well, there are the massive distortion of transport costs and the distortions of the relativities between road and rail, which after all not only determine the mode of transport but the infrastructure at the ports. Finally, of course, there is the  parochialism of States and the political factors that have been evident in port funding for many years, in the provision of infrastructure. In fact, the more you look at the whole situation, the more it is apparent that it really would not matter if every port was manned by just one wharf labourer and he was paid at Bangladesh wage levels&mdash;our ports in Australia would still be hopelessly inefficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Alice in Wonderland chain of industry participants between the importer and the exporter, at all container ports, is an almost impossible burden. The list includes the shipping companies, the stevedores, the container depots, the freight forwarders, the customs brokers, the banks, the road transport operators, the railways, the port authorities and the Federal regulatory agencies. Virtually none of these industry participants has any real incentive to improve the overall efficiency of the transport chain. In many cases, it is exactly the opposite. The incentive is for each participant to expand their area of activity and entrench themselves, and simply to pass on costs. The whole transport chain is collectively a sort of cost-plus system. Every operator has every reason to just obfuscate reasons for delay. Exporters and importers appear to have no control whatsoever, faced with the fragmentation of this transport chain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all in sharp contrast, of course, to our bulk handling ports, which are efficient by any standards. The coal port at Newcastle has a complete absence of any middlemen. The terminal control is by the importers and exporters, and you can see why it is such an efficient port. In contrast, all the major container ports are inherently inefficient with their plethora of middlemen and their historic locations on the edges of large urban areas, which create ever-increasing transport difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very fortunate in one sense that most of our exports are large bulk goods and our imports are in containers. Our balance of payments would be far worse if the reverse situation applied. It is a wonder that we have not been accused of using container ports as a form of import restriction. The only thing we could do more effectively in this regard would be to restrict the issue of import licences to an office at Chambers Pillar manned by my colleague, the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seriously, I think manufacturing and container exports have little hope unless industry addresses the problems and the directions set out in this report, and government comes to grips with the wider causes of port inefficiency. The pan-Australia freight rate is a major distorter of costs and infrastructure spending on ports. It is certain that without it we would have quite a different arrangement in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For years we have been constantly told of the unfavourable comparisons between Australian ports and Singapore and major European ports. But how could we ever hope to be as efficient as those ports when Singapore alone handles three times the total containers of all Australian ports? How can we ever compete with Singapore when our multiplicity of ports get the dregs of the world's shipping; when our stevedores have got to sort through a relative handful of containers to unload them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is little doubt that we could get a dramatic increase in efficiency with fewer container ports. From the evidence given to the Committee, it seems that the direction in which we should be heading is maybe two container ports at Fremantle and Brisbane. I think evidence has been given that, even with the distortion of transport costs, containers can arrive into the suburbs of Sydney from Fremantle quicker by rail than if they stay on the boat. We were given evidence of large importers who have withdrawn business from Port Botany. In the case of Nissan cars, the importers now have them delivered through the port of Brisbane. I think a similar situation will arise at Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an irony that so much funding has gone into abandoning what was the best port in Australia from a shipping point of view, that is, Sydney Harbour, to construct a much inferior and exposed Port Botany, which is often subject to weather delays. This decision, of course, was facilitated by the distortion in transport costs and the shift of containers from rail to road. Economic rationalists seem to have no trouble in relentlessly crushing people in the car or clothing manufacturing sectors but seem to regard road operators as untouchable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the intellectual dishonesty of the Opposition in this matter is appalling, not only in its refusal to address transport subsidies, but also in its policy even to increase them in its Fightback package. But I suppose the National Party would never support the GST unless such a bribe were being offered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The efficiency of our ports and the provision of infrastructure are fundamentally based on a transport system. While ever we build railways with loans, and roads with grants, and ignore external road costs, and refuse even to address the problem in any rational manner, we can never begin to approach port efficiency. The initiatives such as those contained in the One Nation package are also going to be largely wasted unless we address this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every inspection the Committee made, at Fremantle, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, showed enormous amounts of wasted infrastructure spending. We saw disused wharves, disused equipment and disused railway lines. Much of that, of course, was a result of the parochialism of State governments and their fantasies around election time. While the Committee, I think, acknowledges that State government is responsible for land transport and port operation, the significance of the ports to the national economy shows that we really do have to look at the matter in a much wider national perspective. I think all port authorities showed a narrow and mostly unrealistic view of their operations, and I could see no alternative to stronger Commonwealth control on State infrastructure spending and port development. Nothing, but nothing, can be achieved until the economic distortions between rail and road are removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this report will be a catalyst for reform in the ports themselves. As the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) said, `It is only a beginning'. It is a worthwhile beginning, but we have got to realise that it is only the tip of the iceberg. </PARA>

Of course, the support of the members of the full Committee was also of great assistance. The on-site inspections were well attended, as were all the meetings by honourable members and also the public hearings. The assistance also of the secretariat, Chris Paterson, Les Dunn and June Murphy, as well as that of the advisers, John Jenkins, Malcolm Aldons and Martin Cotton, was invaluable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that great inefficiencies are present in the way in which Australian ports operate. The Committee's efforts to gain information were often hampered by a hesitancy on the part of those giving evidence to see the bigger picture, the picture of the whole transport chain and its relevance to their own operation. There was also a tendency, where we went on on-site inspections, to show the Committee the sites rather than to divulge the real problems that exist. There was much conflicting evidence on which area had the inefficiencies and where those inefficiencies were present, and it was often usual for the Committee to be told that the fault lay in other parts of the chain, rather than the organisations seeing faults in their own operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sorts of problems that are apparent really are a symptom, a reflection, of the more deep-seated, traditional ways of doing business in the transport chain. It is still an industry that is based very much on a cost-plus mentality. The real costs and savings are not passed through the chain so that the efficiencies of importers and exporters are reflected in their own costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some examples of this. The mismatch of working hours exemplifies this sort of problem. Terminal operators say they are able to operate 24 hours a day but warehouses will accept or send out their containers in a very narrow few hours each day, even then perhaps on only a few days a week. Of course, warehouse operators are driven by their own costs. But their stance raises the costs and inefficiencies that are apparent at the terminal. A warehouse that may be prepared to accept deliveries outside normal hours has the potential of increasing the efficiency at the terminal. That warehouse would not, however, share in the cost savings that the terminal could then generate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost to terminal operators of the equipment needed on the wharf is great. Container handling equipment and other machinery on a wharf, if it is to be modern and state of the art, is very expensive. If that investment can be utilised for more hours of the day then there are efficiencies to be gained. There is no system of encouraging the transport operators and warehouses to increase their hours. In other words, warehouse and transport operators who were willing to increase the hours would be effectively subsidising those who were not. There should be a cost encouragement for them to do this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hours of operation create many problems. Those hours often coincide with peak traffic hours in cities and at times result in truck queues and a reduction of efficiency. The road transport part of the operation is often operating at the most inappropriate time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another instance of the whole chain not reflecting real costs is the traditional method of the pan-Australia charging for shipping of containers to Australia. Under this practice there is agreement between shippers that containers coming to Australian ports are charged the same regardless of which Australian port those containers are landed in. It is apparent that this cannot reflect the real costs of importers and exporters in handling those containers. This practice could result in the inability of individual ports to expand and take advantage of economies of scale. It could result in the retardation in the growth of our land based transport systems, particularly rail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Considering the great cost of equipment in equipping container terminals and looking at overseas examples, it may be that fewer major ports would develop if the pan-Australia charge were not there but those that would develop would, by handling greater quantities, operate more efficiently because of economies of scale and be more likely to be better equipped. If real shipping costs are reflected port to port it will encourage other methods of land based transport&mdash;rail, perhaps&mdash;to once again operate more efficiently. This, of course, would fit in nicely with plans for an improved single gauge railway from Brisbane to Perth and drive development of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The practice of allowing free storage days for import containers at terminals encourages delay in picking up containers, as costs do not need to be paid until they are picked up. The result is greater peaking and troughing at terminals, together with greater costs and inefficiencies for those terminals. At the other end, in exporting containers, latitude is afforded by terminal operators to exporters beyond cut-off times for delivery of containers to terminals. This, once again, increases the cost to terminals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In both these cases, whether the containers are going out or coming in, although the practices increase the costs those costs are not passed on to those people who take advantage of these practices. The conclusion is that those exporters who are complementing and adding to the efficient operation of the terminal are once again subsidising those who are reducing the efficiency and increasing the costs of the terminal. The charges made by terminal operators should reflect those costs so as to encourage and drive the industry towards efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those three examples really do reflect one of the major issues that the Committee found needed to be addressed, which is that there needs to be an attitudinal change by the whole chain of participants in the interface area. They need to examine their own efficiencies in relation to the whole, and they need to introduce charges that reflect the real costs involved in the transport of containers to individual importers and exporters.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With a policy of differential charging, in that way those participants can lead the improvements in the correct direction. It is worth looking at how these inefficiencies that seem so deep seated in this industry really came into being and how they have not been fixed to any great extent as yet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my view that to a large extent the manner in which Australian industry operated, especially in the postwar era, has a lot to do with the practices that now seem so wrong. Under the protection policies of those years, it was very easy to pass on costs. Real competition did not exist. The quality and prices of overseas products were not competing with Australian goods. Australian manufacturers supplying only the domestic market were able to pass on those costs without a problem and with no thought to the fact that many of those costs were brought about by inefficient transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the need of Australian industry is to become competitive in all ways with the best that the world can offer. An integral part of that ability to become efficient and competitive is transport. Australia can no longer afford to pay more than the real cost without the inefficiencies for the carriage of goods to and from Australia. There is a real need to improve our performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been marked improvements in productivity on our wharfs which have seen gains in efficiencies. Since 1988-89 the turnaround time for grain vessels at Australian ports has been halved. Terminal operators report significant reductions in manning levels, with many of those being attained through multiskilling and restructuring of the work force. The challenge now is very much about structuring business, about encouraging an atmosphere of real competition where end customers can see that the cost of transport can be driven by them and the choices they make. Those choices must be available to them. Those customers&mdash;and every other link in the chain&mdash;must see the costs much more transparently and must see that by changing their practices they can influence their own costs. As I said earlier, this can only be achieved when there is differential charging that reflects those real costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to attitude can be greatly assisted by a concerted effort at greater communication between all levels of participants in the chain. I note the recommendation of the Committee that interface efficiency councils be established to facilitate the efficient movement of cargo to and from ports, initially Sydney and Melbourne, and to formulate policy in relation to the port interface. It is my view that such a committee, properly put together and with the right aims, could do a great deal in creating the attitudinal changes that the Committee sees are so necessary and also it could encourage the acceleration and the coordination of effective electronic data interchange.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already tabled the paper. In its short life, the Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies has been active in a range of inquiries. It has already published two reports on the evolution of Australia as an information society and the policy implications that follow from it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now for something completely different: a survey of the implications of demographic change in Australia and, specifically, an analysis of what has been called the greying of Australia in the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Expectations of Life: Increasing the Options for the 21st Century</EMPHASIS>. In keeping with the Committee's name, the report takes a long term view of the issues, looking past the next election and past the turn of the century to population projections for the year 2030 and beyond. Later speakers will deal with specific aspects of the report and outline its main recommendations. I will consider its philosophical thrust and mention only its most important recommendation, which is essentially a plea to the Government, the media and society as a whole to change their attitude to the aged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike other committees, the Long Term Strategies Committee is able to determine its own terms of reference. We decided to inquire into and report on the factors that will be the central determinants, the changing expectations, of life into the twenty-first century, with reference to the elements that determine the variations in longevity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The elements include: occupation, gender, education, class, place of residence, ethnicity and race, consumption patterns, wealth and other factors; we also acknowledge the need to develop policies which recognise and encourage the redefining of `time-use value', that is, validating non-work experience, given that increasing longevity will coincide with declining labour input. In the face of the changing population structure, there is the need for maintenance of most productive use of human resources for the nation, the maintenance of individual quality of life into old age, developing policies for stimulating creative time use and developing policies to meet and anticipate changes in population structure in the areas of education, training and employment practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our most important recommendation is that the Commonwealth Government recognise, first, that the changing demographic structure of the population requires reassessment of the value on importance, both socially and economically, of life outside traditional work. The capacity of people to confer value, that is, value without a dollar equivalent, on their own labour time use, will be increasingly significant when expectation of far longer active life coincides with a likely reduction in the length of the paid work life, especially physical work; second, that the increasing absolute and relative numbers of the elderly in Australian society do not impose a burden on the economy or threaten the viability of the health and welfare system; and that such demographic changes raise questions about social practices and institutions that need to be solved in a rational and consensual manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The justification for these propositions, and particularly the second, is contained in the report, which also considers many of the other challenges posed by the shifting demographic contours of our community: health and medical treatment; fitness and recreation; education, culture and the arts; transport, housing and urban planning; employment and social welfare. I name only the most obvious, all of which are considered in detail in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One major challenge is the reallocation of resources as the proportions of young and old change. But the biggest challenge, one that cannot be met by legislation or funding, is how to change attitudes to ageing and the aged. If society sees the ageing population as a problem, to which solutions, even a final solution, must be found, it will be reflecting the negative attitudes towards the aged, so often found within the community, when none need exist. The challenge is to recognise the opportunities offered by the developing social structure and to devise policies to make use of the vast resources of energy, competence, wisdom and skill found, all too often neglected, within the aged community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like most industrial countries, Australia has experienced a considerable rise in life expectancy over the past century and is currently experiencing a significant rise in the proportion of those who remain vigorous well past the customary or even statutory retirement age. In Australia the rise in the proportion of older people, usually those defined as those over 60&mdash;the `chronologically gifted', as the neologism has it&mdash;is due partly to increased longevity and partly to the fact that the baby boom of the 1950s and 1960s was followed by a sharp fall in the birth rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important development is that, as life expectancy is increased, the age of retirement has tended to decrease. The result is that retirement, for the first time in human history, has become a definite and significant phase in most people's lives. People who retire today at 55 may look forward to at least another 20 years of active life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These facts are well-known. What is less well-known and often wilfully obscured in the more alarmist reports on the coming aged boom, is that these trends will not continue indefinitely. Demographers project that the rise in the number of old people should level off around the middle of next century and that the proportion of those over 60 should stabilise at not more than 25 per cent. Future social planning does not need to assume an ever increasing aged segment, only that such people will come to constitute about a quarter of the population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly there is the likelihood that full employment, as we experienced it from World War II until 1974, will not be seen again&mdash;or the term will need radical redefinition&mdash;because we have the phenomenon of a change in the labour force as a result of an increasing proportion of women, historically very high participation rates, but a loss of employment opportunities for many people who were traditionally in work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the trend to early retirement has slowed down because of the increasingly manifest desire of older employees to continue working. The main demand from older citizens these days is not for the chance to retire early, but for the right to continue working beyond the normal retirement age, a reversal of the demand by working people and their unions in the nineteenth and most of the twentieth century. Strangely, the predominant response to increased life expectancy and the substantial period of free time following the end of formal employment, the third age as it has often been called, has not been excitement and joy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of welcoming the opportunities and challenges offered by this new stage of life, we have heard, in the mainstream media at least, little but expressions of fear and alarm at the burden which the increasing numbers of the aged are supposed to be imposing on the rest of society. Most of the evidence examined during my Committee's inquiry was aimed directly against such negative views. The message we received was that if there is a problem with the ageing of the population, the problem is not the aged but the myths about and hostile attitudes towards them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Media alarmism about the greying of Australia&mdash;and even statements by government leaders&mdash;commonly recycles inaccurate or irrelevant figures and various journalistic cliches about Australia's demographic future. In particular, there is the fear that population ageing is a time bomb that threatens to blow the economy to pieces. Much of this fear is based on the strain that the aged population is expected to place on the age pension system. But close examination of the figures shows that while there is a need for careful planning and finely judged policies, there is no occasion for alarm. An important chapter in the Committee's report makes a critical analysis of this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that we as a community move away from adopting the heresy that all values have dollar equivalents&mdash;indeed, that value means money value; loss of income means loss of value and recognition; and that unpaid work may have no significance in validating human activity. That would be tragic. The Committee draws attention to the importance of volunteer work, in which large numbers of Australians are involved and on which many important community services are increasingly dependent. We also urge the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) to initiate a review of national health spending, to compare expenditure on preventative medicine, which is rather low, to that on curative&mdash;after disease&mdash;medicine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the Committee I express my thanks to the Secretary of the Committee and our faithful staff members Kelly Fitzsimmons and Tracy Cumberland. A special tribute is due to Dr Robert Darby, who, as Secretary from June 1991, worked with extraordinary dedication and intellectual penetration in mastering and collating the large amount of material submitted to the Committee. We are very much in his debt. As Chairman I want to thank my Deputy Chairman and other Committee members for their hard work and their contribution to the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee on Long Term Strategies, I would like to add my remarks to those made by the Chairman, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones). In November 1990 the Committee adopted its terms of reference and it was decided that the conduct of this particular inquiry should take place principally by means of research. It was decided on this occasion that a seminar would be held where a range of speakers would come and address the Committee on a range of relevant topics. I believe that this was quite a successful way of going about things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry received up to 60 separate submissions after advertising in newspapers at the beginning of the inquiry. While my colleague the honourable member for Lalor has discussed the more philosophical aspects of the inquiry I would like now to take a little of the House's time to address some of the recommendations of the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, together with the rest of the developed world, is undergoing significant demographic changes. It has experienced a rise in the proportion of elderly people in its population. While we still have, and will continue to have, a relatively young population in comparison with other industrialised countries, the trend is undoubtedly there, and it is one that the Government cannot afford to ignore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report has come up with some very specific recommendations, a good many of them aimed at changes in Commonwealth Government legislation. It has, for example, recommended that the Commonwealth Government introduce legislation along the lines of that covering sex, race and disability to make discrimination on the basis of age also unlawful. The words `racist' and `sexist' are now part of our daily vernacular&mdash;it probably will not be long before we add the word `ageist' to this list. It is a very appropriate term because, I believe, we are probably quite ageist in many of our attitudes or else we might ourselves be victims of ageist prejudices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps I should mention at this stage that, to use the words of my respected Chairman, the honourable member for Lalor, I have already reached the `chronologically gifted' age, and I suppose I am well and truly into the third age group. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3G4">Mr DOBIE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps the honourable member should read my speech. The health state, longevity and consequently life expectancy of our population have undergone unprecedented improvement over the course of the past two decades. Not only are our people living longer, they are leading active and constructive lives to a much greater degree than in previous generations. I can certainly agree with that. It is important that governments begin to take cognisance of this factor and this report is an important step in this direction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other specific recommendations in the report include the abolition of compulsory age rated retirement in the Australian Public Service and other Commonwealth employment areas. It is also recommended that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) look specifically at ways in which opportunities might be created for older people to participate in retraining or re-skilling and ensure that their access to and participation in the labour market are not diminished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should mention here that it is already coalition policy to see that those who wish to retire may retire, but those who do not should have the opportunity to stay on while they can contribute and be stimulated by their activities. This makes perfect sense when you consider that, with greater longevity in our community, there will be an increased number of individuals in the future whose period of retirement or post-employment will last as long as 20 years. This represents a savage waste of any nation's human resources if all this capacity, skill and experience were to be shut out of the economy through compulsory retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also deals with other aspects of the lives of the elderly in our society, as my colleague the honourable member for Lalor stated in his introduction to the report. Richer people, the better educated and those with intellectually or physically demanding interests have greater flexibility in dealing with the vagaries of everyday life. The report, in its recommendations, seeks to ensure that older people live valuable lives for as long as possible, and I say amen to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has dealt with the health and medical issues facing older Australians with some very specific recommendations to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services and the Commonwealth Government. It has also touched upon the issues of physical fitness for older Australians and, quite significantly, their role in education, culture and the arts. A person, no matter what age, does not stop learning, and in this context the report also makes specific recommendations to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also addresses the changing demographics of our nation in terms of housing and our urban environment. This is a significant factor, in that our cities have changed quite dramatically from relatively high density living to the monstrous suburbanisation of our living space. This has quite an effect on older people's lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time does not permit me to elaborate any further, so in my closing remarks I would like to once again thank my colleague the honourable member for Lalor for his exemplary chairmanship and the members of the Long Term Strategies Committee, the Committee secretary, Mr Ian Dundas, and the support staff, Mrs Margaret Swieringa, Ms Kelly Fitzsimmons and Miss Tracy Cumberland, and especially Dr Robert Darby, who joined the inquiry from June 1991 and who I understand was responsible for most of the writing and administrative groundwork in putting this particular inquiry together. I commend the report to all members of the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I and all the rest of us here, and probably most of the people up in the gallery, if we are lucky, will grow old. In fact, it is something we look forward to and yet, when one looks at the age situation in Australia, we need the recommendations of this report to be implemented; we really do. We need to end discrimination on the basis of age, and we need particularly to amend industrial relations legislation. We do need to abolish compulsory retirement in the Australian Public Service, for a start, and the New South Wales Government has given us a lead in this matter already. I just cannot understand how we as a society can automatically say that when you reach a certain age, you are finished, you are on the scrap heap, and all that accumulated knowledge and wisdom is no longer of any value. Of course, this is absolutely wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted that the Committee has brought down this report. I commend those of my colleagues who have been heavily involved with it and the secretariat and staff of the Committee. I believe it is one of the most significant reports this Parliament has seen for some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a point on growing old&mdash;if one is lucky&mdash;particularly as the Minister at the table, the Minister for Aboriginal and Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), is involved in the matter I am raising. It is that we are lucky if we happen not to be Aboriginals. This needs to be highlighted. Most people do not realise that in 1988 the life expectancy figure for you and me, Mr Deputy Speaker, was 73.1 years and for our wives, 79.5 years. But for Aboriginals born in the Northern Territory in 1985, the life expectancy for males is only 53 years&mdash;20 years less than for males in the rest of society&mdash;and for females only 63 years, compared with 79.5 years for other women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about discrimination on age, but these figures highlight an area where the expectations of life should be broadcast more. I make that point because while I believe&mdash;as the Minister at the table well knows&mdash;that we should provide for Australian people on the basis of need and not on the basis of race, I think the figures illustrate that Aboriginal people are greatly in need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also applaud the recommendation of the Committee that the Government should investigate phased retirement and make the employment of older people more flexible. The proposal for the modification of the age pension to encourage older people to re-enter the work force and use their skills and knowledge is highly commendable. The proposal is that they might retain a percentage of the pension depending on the number of hours worked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree most strongly with the recommendation that there should be increased local involvement in assessing Department of Social Security benefits, in order to encourage a maximum sense of community and to use local knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I totally endorse the proposition that we should acknowledge the work done voluntarily by people throughout our society. I know from the very many organisations in my electorate and elsewhere in Australia of the value to society&mdash;as the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) said, you cannot put a dollar value on it&mdash;of voluntary workers.

In November 1990, I presented a private member's Bill proposing similar amendments. In September last I re-presented this Bill, again proposing the same amendments, but no opportunity has been given by the Government for its fuller debate and acceptance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> For almost three years, on behalf of people with disabilities, parents and service providers, the coalition has been pressing the Government to accept the fact that the 1986 Act was not immutable, that change was needed and that a greater degree of certainty and compassion is required in the administration of the Act. It is intolerable that the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) has allowed so many people with disabilities and their carers to suffer the stress of not knowing whether services will continue after June 1992 and what guidelines of services will follow. As the architect of the Act, the former Senator Don Grimes, said as recently as February this year:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principles and objectives that were set out in the disability services legislation in 1986 are as clear and as sensible as can be found in most places. But I must remind those involved, as I used to at that time, that they are but standards and </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">guidelines to help in the development of programs to assist people to fill their developments in society. They are no more than that.</PARA>
<PARA>But the Government, the Minister and the bureaucracy have set their own agenda, creating uncertainty and risking the lifestyles of many disabled Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have continually urged the Government to amend the Act to provide more flexibility and more certainty to people with disabilities, their families and their service providers. The coalition proposed that guidelines be formulated and brought before Parliament for debate, and amendment if necessary, so that the criteria for funding of services would be clearly laid down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also proposes that the transition date, the period in which financial assistance for prescribed services and for upgrading prescribed services is payable, be extended to give existing services more time to adapt to the requirements of the Disability Services Act. The amendments also provide for security of contracts between the Government and service providers, and an appeals procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last November the Minister outlined his blueprint for action for disability services. He stated that he would amend the Disability Services Act. He told the ACROD conference that the transition date of 1992 would be removed but that he would require services&mdash;all types of services, including sheltered workshops, activity therapy centres and larger accommodation services&mdash;to meet certain standards by 1995 in order to continue to be eligible for funding. The Minister also stated that he would formulate and table section 5 guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I re-present this Bill to keep these matters before the House, to keep the Minister to his word and to keep him honest. I remind him that there are only two months left before the transition date expires. I now remind the Minister of his Government's commitment to social justice and to the family. Very little of that commitment is evident in his actions to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite clear acceptance of the role of the family members and the life of a person with disabilities in numerous circulars issued by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, in the Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement, in parliamentary Acts, in last year's Australian Health Ministers conference communique, and in the Office of Disability resource kit, a review of an accommodation service in New South Wales by the State branch of the Department has formally documented that handicapped people must, firstly, be encouraged to identify an advocate, non-family, of their own choice; secondly, not be able to be removed from the service by the request of a parent&mdash;a guardian is acceptable; thirdly, accept that a parent cannot give consent to the development of a plan for their advancement; and, fourthly, accept that only a guardian, again non-parent, can nominate change of physician. The list goes on with exclusions of any reference to the family. This is interesting after what we have just been told about the aged and the ageing of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is absolutely in conflict with stated pronouncements, with the Act, and is contrary to the interests of the handicapped who greatly need stability and non-conflict in their lives.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)expresses its support for the actions of the Government of France in suspending the testing of nuclear weapons in the South Pacific;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)calls on the French Government to convert the twelve month suspension of testing into a permanent cessation of all testing, development, production and deployment of nuclear weapons by France;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)calls on other Governments around the world to also cease all testing, development and production of nuclear weapons; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)requests the Australian Government to actively pursue international negotiations to achieve an immediate and permanent cessation of nuclear testing throughout the world.</PARA>
<PARA>The break up of the Soviet Union and the collapse of the Cold War provides the peoples of the world with an historic opportunity to fundamentally redirect their energies and incomes towards social and humanitarian programs. The international community now faces a clear choice: to choose between nuclear disarmament and the protection of the environment through new mechanisms of common security; or to continue with the nuclear arms race, with nuclear proliferation, the threat of nuclear weapons and their devastating impact, and a deepening of the environmental crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dramatic change in the security map of Europe and the world has resulted in much discussion about the future of nuclear weapons in the new Europe. The gains by the Greens in recent regional elections in France have caused the French Government to rethink its position on the issue of the nuclear deterrent and testing of weapons in the South Pacific. Like many others in this House, earlier this month I welcomed the French Government's decision to suspend further nuclear testing in the South Pacific in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of nuclear testing has been one of great and continuing interest to the people and governments of Australia. Australia's regional opposition to French testing has always been abundantly clear and has not wavered. The most obvious and concrete expression of that opposition is the Treaty of Rarotonga, which bans all testing from the area of the South Pacific zone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our opposition to French nuclear testing is over 20 years old. The Whitlam Government was very strong in its opposition to the French tests, and in fact exercised that opposition by taking France to the International Court of Justice. The Fraser Government was similarly inclined and very strongly opposed, and the Hawke and Keating governments have continued with this policy. Australia has been unflagging in its opposition. Each time a test takes place, the Government protests strongly to the French Government. We have also regularly raised the issue in the United Nations and in various forums within that body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is one of the strongest proponents of a nuclear test ban treaty in the international arena and has, over the years, been at the forefront of initiatives to hasten the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. Last year the annual resolution at the United Nations, which is jointly sponsored by Australia, New Zealand and Mexico, gained record support. Only two countries voted against the resolution for a comprehensive test ban treaty&mdash;the United States and France&mdash;while four abstained. This is a clear indication that the overwhelming majority of members of the United Nations agree with and support the constructive and pragmatic approach to the negotiation of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, which that resolution recommends to the Conference on Disarmament, which is the single multi-lateral disarmament negotiating forum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although we welcome the French Government's suspension of testing, we must be ever vigilant. We cannot sit back and think that we have won the issue. More than 10 years ago, in May of 1981, there were reports that the French Government was to suspend its nuclear testing program at Mururoa, pending a review of its nuclear weapons programs. The then Australian Foreign Minister, Tony Street, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He hoped the reported review by the French Government would lead to a complete cessation of nuclear testing in the South Pacific Region.</PARA>
<PARA>That was more than 10 years ago. Unfortunately, that cessation did not occur. We must act now to ensure that we maintain our pressure on the French Government so that it is not tempted to resume testing as it did in 1981. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">France is not the only nation still testing nuclear weapons&mdash;or until recently still testing. The United Kingdom, the United States and the People's Republic of China are all still testing nuclear weapons. The Australian Government is disappointed that the three countries eligible to sign the protocols of the Treaty of Rarotonga&mdash;the United States, the United Kingdom and France&mdash;have not yet signed the Treaty. Both France and the United States have most recently been urged to do so at prime ministerial and foreign ministerial level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are major health, environmental and other risks associated with the testing of nuclear weapons. Despite the fact that testing is underground, Greenpeace reports that there have been major leaks of radioactivity at the United States and British testing sites and at both sites in the former Soviet Union. In effect, each of these test sites is a nuclear waste dump which we are leaving to the future generations to clean up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Continued testing of nuclear weapons by the UK, US and China sends a disturbing signal to the world. Testing gives credence to the myth that the possession of nuclear weapons leads to a more secure world. The ending of the Cold War should have been the signal for the nuclear superpowers to move towards a more mature negotiating position for resolving conflicts. The continued testing of weapons and the implied threat of use of those weapons have no place in the present world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, nuclear weapons testing is used as an excuse for a number of other countries, such as India and Israel, to justify their own secretive programs. The haves continue the military expansion of the have-nots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The French have said that they see their moratorium as a small step towards disarmament. This step needs to be expanded upon and adopted by all other nuclear powers. It is clear testing causes environmental devastation, it kills people and it adds to global instability. France's nuclear test sites in the South Pacific are at the coral atolls of Mururoa and Fangataufu in French Polynesia. More than 40 atmospheric tests and 130 underground tests have been carried out there, under the guidance of the French Atomic Energy Commissariat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This testing has caused fracturing and fissuring of the atolls and there are fears that radioactivity is leaking into the marine environment. Continued testing on the damaged atolls further threatens the geology of the area and could lead to radioactivity from the more than 130 tests leaking into the Pacific Ocean. An independent health study of French Polynesia has never been undertaken and military health records of the personnel from the site have not been released. No follow-up program has been undertaken to monitor workers once they have left the site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent modelling study in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Marine Pollution Bulletin</EMPHASIS> has indicated that if major leakage of radioactivity occurred from Mururoa and Fangataufu, either through a single discharge or through constant release, the entire marine environment of French Polynesia would be contaminated. In a worst case scenario, the marine environment of most South Pacific countries would be contaminated; radiation levels above normal would be found as far away as north-west New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The environmental safety of testing programs is suspect. Action must be taken before further serious harm is done to the environment. The French Government should move to extend its moratorium past the end of this year and cease all further testing. France should also sign the 1963 partial test ban treaty banning atmospheric tests and begin negotiating an international and verifiable comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. France should sign and/or ratify without reservation all major international and regional treaties relating to nuclear testing and nuclear proliferation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The test sites at Mururoa and Fangataufu should be closed down and alternative strategies identified and implemented to develop the economy of French Polynesia. The rest of the world should expand on France's lead and end testing, end production and end deployment of nuclear weapons. Our leaders should seize this historic moment offered by the ending of the East-West tensions and commence a major demilitarisation of the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first thing I want to say in relation to this matter is that I congratulate the mover of the motion and particularly the mover of the amended motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one thing that I have found disconcerting and not amusing<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS> in my two years here. It seems that some people, and that includes the left wing of the Labor Party and the Greens and the Democrats, believe that they have exclusive rights to this concern for the future of the planet. Can I say to the House and to those who are listening that that is very far from the truth. From a personal point of view and from a party viewpoint can I say that we are desperately concerned about the future of this planet and we will be doing everything to ensure its survival by not only supporting such motions as this but also by undertaking our own advances in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) is himself a family man who has young children. I go home on those rare occasions when members of parliament actually have time to sit down with their families. I look at my two-year-old and my five-year-old and my six-year-old and I remain totally convinced that we have to work damn hard to ensure that they indeed have a future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just so that this is on the public record I would like to read a press release from my colleague, the shadow Minister for foreign affairs, Senator Robert Hill, which he put out following the French nuclear testing decision. It supports the second part of the motion of the honourable member in calling for a permanent cessation of the testing. This is the press release of 9 April in which he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . welcomed France's decision to suspend nuclear testing in the Pacific to the end of the year, but urged the French to permanently end testing in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`France's unexpected announcement should be welcomed. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed it was unexpected. I know that both Mr Gibson and I certainly did not expect it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.D.M. Dobie)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order!  The honourable member will refer to the member by his electorate. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XT4">Mr RONALDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The press release goes on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The Federal Opposition has consistently opposed France's use of the Pacific as a nuclear test site.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`We have questioned France's need for an `independent nuclear deterrent', believing that this policy has not helped to encourage an environment of global nuclear non-proliferation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`France's overnight decision follows concerted pressure over many years from governments&mdash;particularly those in the South Pacific&mdash;and international organisations justifiably concerned about the effects of French testing in the Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`But it also reflects the changing global security environment of the past few years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The end of the Cold War has forced states to reassess traditional security frameworks and question the need for weapons of mass destruction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The Opposition now hopes that France might follow the lead of the United States and the former Soviet Union in reducing the size of its nuclear force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`In the meantime, it is vital that France extends its 1992 suspension to a permanent end to nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA>So in relation to paragraphs one and two of the motion, we do very strongly support them. In relations to paragraphs three and four, I think there are two questions. We support the general thrust of those motions but our emphasis has always been on the reduction of nuclear arsenals which is now happening, and we are pleased to note especially the efforts of the US and Russia, but we would like to emphasise the reduction aspect over the test ban. What the coalition is saying is that while we also support a comprehensive nuclear test ban, we believe that it should be on two conditions. The first is that a proper verification regime should be in place. Over the last few years a lot of work has been done on developing verification regimes which could be adopted to suit a test ban situation. The second is that progress on a comprehensive test ban should be linked to advances in the reduction of strategic and conventional arms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is always very difficult to prioritise this question but I believe the reduction question should be given greater emphasis. There are a number of reasons for this. The first one is that so many countries have actually got past the testing and development stage that the weapons are both produced and are available. Therefore any ban on testing and development is potentially irrelevant. Indeed, the technology which built the early nuclear weapons is readily accessible and nuclear weapons these days can be built without testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many countries have deployed nuclear weapons. I am sorry the mover of the motion is not in the House because I question why deployment is referred to in No. 2 of the motion but not in No. 3, and I really cannot understand why that is the situation. I would have been far happier if words similar to those in paragraph 2 had been used in paragraph 3 to ensure that the deployment question was raised not only in relation to France, but also in relation to governments of other countries. I think that that paragraph should have read: `calls on other Governments around the world to also cease all testing, development, production and deployment of nuclear weapons' and that that addition would have greatly strengthened the motion itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at the reduction question rather than the testing question, there is no doubt that there are enormous arsenals of weapons of mass destruction. That should be of enormous concern to everyone in this House, as I am sure it is to everyone in the gallery, to everyone who is listening today, to the Australian community and indeed to the world community. The need for the world community to control the proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction is the number one issue that we have to face because it has the potential to impact not only on ourselves but, I believe of far greater importance, directly on our children and our grandchildren. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, 1968, has 140 signatures. Although it is useful it is still unable to control the development of nuclear weapons by those states with the determination and the technological sophistication to do so. It is fair to say, however, that it is the most widely adhered to of the arms control treaties, but there are a number of states which either possess nuclear weapons or have a suspected nuclear weapons capability and which have not acceded to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is extremely unfortunate that there was a lack of agreement on the final document of the fourth Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference held in September 1990. When that is reviewed in 1995 it will be an absolute necessity to resolve some areas in which the Treaty is inadequate, in particular its discriminatory treatment of nuclear weapons in a non-nuclear weapons state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the question of the testing is one, the reduction is the other. As I also said before, the capability is already there. Whilst I am pleased from an environmental point of view that the French have stopped testing, and while I am extremely anxious from an environmental point of view for the rest of the world to stop the testing, I believe that the ultimate threat to the Australian community and the world community is the matter of reduction rather than of testing. That has got to be the focus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also deeply concerned about the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons and about the need to control the proliferation of ballistic missile technology. Although negotiations on disarmament aiming towards a global banning of the manufacture, production, transfer, acquisition, stockpiling use of chemical weapons are ongoing, the reality is that years of accessibility of chemical materials, the established global chemical industry and the verification problems make it extremely difficult to achieve such a convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Undoubtedly, we have made enormous progress since the end of the Cold War&mdash;enormous progress&mdash;and I very much applaud the steps that have been taken towards that. But as the mover of the motion said, we have a damn long way to go, because this is, in my view, the question of this century and indeed the next century. We have got to aim for world peace. That has got to be the focus of the world community and I believe that the question of world peace, the reduction in nuclear arms, the reduction in those weapons of mass destruction, must even take precedence&mdash;I do not say this lightly&mdash;over the question of the global economy. That is our number one challenge. I support the motion; I support the mover of the motion; and I hope that the House will adopt it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a delight to speak in a debate where there is so much agreement between the Opposition and the Government. I was glad to hear the speech of the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) and I am pleased to support what he has said. I particularly applaud the initiative of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) in moving this motion. It is striking that, since it was first moved, the purpose of the motion has been achieved. After so many years, the 20 years or so that France has been testing nuclear weapons in the South Pacific, at last the French Government has agreed to cease testing. At this stage it is only a temporary cessation of testing, but of course one hopes that that will become a permanent cessation of testing as the global security environment improves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was striking, too, that this decision was announced by Prime Minister Beregovoy in the first speech he made after having been appointed Prime Minister. I have had some contact with Prime Minister Beregovoy and am impressed by him. I was delighted to see his appointment and particularly pleased that a decision of this level of importance and a principled decision of this kind<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS> was amongst the first things he announced. That may give a signal of the quality of his Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion is important because it not only calls on France to make its suspension of nuclear testing a permanent one but also calls on all governments to cease nuclear testing, and not only testing but development and production. As the honourable member for Ballarat mentioned, it should also emphasise deployment. It also calls on the Australian Government to pursue those goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Australian Government has been pursuing those goals for many years. We have in fact been one of the leading nations in the conference on disarmament in Geneva. Our initiatives have been important in the progress that has been made on chemical weapons. We have continuously urged the nuclear powers to cease their testing and I am sure the Government will continue to do that. Nuclear testing is damaging, because it allows perpetual technological improvement in the complexity of nuclear weapons and the damage that they can do. So stopping nuclear testing is a necessary condition for stopping the technological advances in the global arms race. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last couple of years, we have been through a dramatic and, to most people, unpredictable change in the global security environment. The Cold War is over; it is strikingly over. It was over before the internal collapse of the Soviet Union but that has made the end of the Cold War even more readily apparent. The result of that is that all nuclear powers, and many non-nuclear powers too, are cutting back on their military expenditure. That is an essential condition, in my view, to demonstrating the end to the military threat in most parts of the world. There are still regional threats, but the global strategic environment has enormously improved. With that improvement, it is important that we seize the opportunity to make the decisions that will be of permanent benefit to improving security. One of those decisions which are crying out to be made is the decision to stop further nuclear testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The country that is holding out against that most strongly, I regret to say, is the United States. The United States continues to say that it needs to maintain its nuclear testing in order to maintain the reliability and to improve the accuracy of its nuclear weapons. But when it is no longer threatened in the way that it was before, it would be quite possible for the US to responsibly have a suspension of nuclear testing in order to test the change that that would cause, to use that as a bargaining lever for the reductions in nuclear armaments that must happen from the Commonwealth of Independent States&mdash;to continue, in other words, the momentum for disarmament that is currently under way. So I hope that the French example will be an influence on the United States and that it too will agree to suspension of nuclear testing. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to add my voice to those of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) and the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) in the debate on this motion concerning the testing of nuclear weapons. I want to commend its mover for bringing it before the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Fraser has referred to the United States as the key to the problem of nuclear testing, and indeed it is. In the last resolution before the United Nations which New Zealand and Australia sponsored, there was a hold-out by three countries&mdash;the three main countries in the use of nuclear testing&mdash;and they were the United States, France and Britain. It was interesting that in the last vote Britain did abstain, having gone along with the United States and France in previous votes. In the last vote it was only the United States and France which stood out against the resolution that there be a stop to nuclear testing. France now has declared a one-year moratorium, which makes the United States the last remaining country supporting the continuation of the testing of nuclear arms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of reasons have been given by the United States for that and it is quite interesting that they vary according to who is giving the reasons. The United States has always claimed that it is for national security, that it needs this testing because of the deterrent effect of nuclear arms. Yet today, as at no time since the Second World War, we have this unique time, in the absence of the Cold War, when we could actually look at stopping nuclear testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> But the US has provided three other reasons why it wishes to continue testing and I will mention them briefly. The first is that it is impossible to verify a complete ban, and the honourable member for Ballarat made reference to that. However, the ability to check whether nuclear explosions are occurring has become much more sophisticated in the last 10 years and it is now possible to detect seismic disturbances. Previously there was always the danger of confusing them with an earthquake or some quarrying or explosions in mines. That is no longer the case. I believe that scientific reports say that nuclear explosions can now be detected. So much for the first reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason is the desire of the United States to develop the third generation of nuclear weapons. As honourable members would remember, the first generation was the fission bombs, followed by hydrogen bombs. The third generation now is the directed energy devices whereby X-ray lasers are used to focus the energy of a nuclear explosion into a beam of destruction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third reason is that the United States claims, as France has done in the past, that the nuclear stockpile needs to be tested for its safety. There is a feeling that over time there is a dangerous degradation of the pile and the devices themselves need to be exploded to see that they are continuing to be safe to stockpile. That is one of the most peculiar reasons I have ever heard for keeping a nuclear stockpile and testing it to make sure that it is safe. In fact, there is no reason why the elements of the nuclear stockpile cannot be take apart separately&mdash;not in a nuclear explosion&mdash;and the individual elements tested to see whether they have retained their safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the three major reasons the United States has given for not complying with the other countries that wish to have a complete ban. I have some quotes here but unfortunately I do not have time to read out all of them. However, I want to read out one which I find rather chilling. It is from Dr Lawrence Ferderber of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We're in the midst of a renaissance, a period of growth in the quality and sophistication of our work.</PARA>
<PARA>That was a comment on building up the nuclear arsenal in the United States. The Americans have been very clear that, despite what other countries have said, they are in no way going to stop their nuclear program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very briefly I want to go over some facts regarding the number of nuclear tests. There have been 1,818 tests since 1945: 921 by the US; 643 by the Soviet Union; 177 by France; 42 by the UK; 31 by China, and one by India. </PARA>

<PARA>In the short time that I have available I will not be able to go into detail on what I consider to be a very defective report by a review panel. That review panel was made up of Melbourne based people and it made no serious attempt to establish the environmental or social suitability of the site it ultimately recommended. This is not the first occasion on which I have moved a motion in this House for reference to the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts of the proposal to build chemical storages and other such things in the area just south of the Werribee sewerage farm at the Avalon airfield. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1981 the Victorian EPA announced that a site for an intractable wastes incinerator in a similar area only a few miles from the area mentioned in this announcement was quite safe and sound.

At that time, the House of Representatives Committee recommended against it and it did not go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the whole process is unsatisfactory. Every local government body in the Geelong area opposes it. The Corio Shire, which is the shire in which it is to be built, proposes to spend a very large amount, about $200,000, to seek to have the site changed, and that must be a serious consideration. I wrote to Mr Landy during the hearings and indicated that I believed that no site at Point Wilson should be selected unless there was proper public consultation and adequate environmental and other safety checks. Neither of those took place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the EES provisions of the Victorian Parliament, the site is not subject to query in the subsequent examination of the announced relocation. The EES proposal only deals with how the site can be made suitable and what is required for it to be suitable. If it were found that it was not suitable, it is not able to report on it. It is controlled by the Victorian Department for Planning and Environment, which is hardly the appropriate place for such an inquiry to take place as it has a vested interest before it starts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two clear situations where concerns exist. Firstly, the site is much closer, especially with prevailing winds, to the urban area of Geelong. It is across Corio Bay. Any spillages will not move out of the area because there is virtually no tidal flow. There will be something in the order of 100 transports a day travelling over 50 kilometres on a 100 kilometre per hour divided road to Melbourne. It is not taken into account in the report, but the Melbourne to Werribee section is incapable of carrying that increased traffic without a greatly increased risk. The report writes down the dangers of road transport, virtually dismissing them. The fact is that the day that the announcement was made a chemical accident on the Hume Highway blocked that highway for seven hours. We are going to have 200 times that potential on the Geelong road without any adequate alternative roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have an additional problem in that there are very important nature reserves immediately adjacent to the site. It is not good enough to say that we are going to look at what our World Heritage obligations are in the wetlands and the migratory birds treaties that we have signed, and that we are going to look at how we can make it safe. We should be looking at whether it is safe, whether those areas will be affected, and whether our treaty obligations can be complied with. I do not blame the people of Footscray for wanting to get rid of the thing. I think the people of Geelong do too. I do not think any of these things are ever going to be very safe. In fact, this week the people of Britain are complaining about Australian waste being shipped over there to be destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are that there has to be an adequate environmental and social impact study and there have to be proper studies into whether or not every motorist who drives between Geelong and Melbourne, and between Werribee and Melbourne in particular, is going to have his life placed at risk for a political decision which is not adequately considered and has not adequately been studied. I hope that the House will refer this. This is not altogether a Commonwealth issue, but the Commonwealth does have responsibilities in the area. I believe that, as in the case of the intractable waste incinerator in 1981, we should repeat that process.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) in this motion wants the matter of the proposed relocation of the Coode Island facility referred to the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts. However, since the August 1991 fire, the whole question of the location and storage of industrial chemicals has been the subject of wide ranging public debate in the inquiry. Since the 1991 fire, the matter has been investigated in great detail and many groups and individuals have had the opportunity to raise their concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these circumstances, any proposal which would subject the industry to a further investigation is quite unnecessary. It represents a huge cost which would be imposed on the chemical industry&mdash;an industry which has already spent a fortune on the State investigation. I therefore oppose any further investigation into the relocation of the Coode Island facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of important points to consider in this matter: first, the safety aspect, which must, of course, be paramount; secondly, the cost aspect, where it does not impinge on safety. I return to the question of safety. The industry operating at Coode Island has done so for the past 30 years, virtually without major incident until the August 1991 fire. It is, therefore, important to discuss the consequences of the recent fires in an appropriate context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the toxic smoke, the worst recorded injury was a broken finger, and pollution levels were about the same as those caused by the traffic on Geelong Road over two days. The industry, I believe, would prefer to stay at the Coode Island site. Moreover, I understand the metropolitan fire brigade favours the retention of the facility of the Coode Island site, and the honourable member is correct in his statement about the 50 vehicles using the Geelong Road per day and the dangers involved. I also understand that the Coode Island site has environmental advantages. The disadvantages are that Coode Island is relatively close to housing and relatively close to the Melbourne business district. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, it has to be a judgment on the safety and environmental aspects of Coode Island. The inquiry carried out in Victoria concluded that the facility should be relocated. On the information from the fire brigade and the chemical industry itself, the facility should stay where it is. Both the fire brigade and the industry itself surely know the dangers and hazards associated with storage facilities of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, there is no doubt that the chemical industry should remain at Coode Island. It is obviously the safest and, coincidentally, the most economical site available. But the potential for Point Wilson should not be ignored. It is an ideal location for industrial expansion and the development so badly needed in the broke State of Victoria. This development is absolutely essential if we are to downstream much of our raw materials and add value to our exports. Most chemical plants rely on a number of basic elements&mdash;the supply of raw materials, such as salt or LPG, which Australia has in abundance; ample supplies of fuel and power which, again, we have in abundance, and a favourable economic and industrial environment, which we certainly do not have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a favourable economic environment would include a number of factors, for example, the availability of a suitable location for a chemical plant and industrial expansion generally: in my view, the site at Point Wilson represents an excellent opportunity for this type of development. It needs a taxation system which offers realistic depreciation rates; chemical plants are very capital intensive. It needs the availability of investment finance at reasonable rates: our overdraft rates at 12 to 14 per cent do not look good alongside investment capital at 3 and 4 per cent available overseas. It requires a new deal on industrial relations, which includes the abolition of compulsory unionism, optional arbitration and enterprise bargaining. It requires a government which, to paraphrase a former President of the United States, Calvin Coolidge, believes that the business of Australia is business, and which, having established some basic rules of corporate behaviour, will get out of the way of business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that Australians are capable of building huge chemical plants and processing plants. Just look at what we have done in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion moved by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes). The central fallacy of the Coode Island review panel's report, inevitable given its term of reference, was to recommend concentration on a single remote location for the hazardous chemicals involved, thus maximising road usage, instead of recommending several locations close to the users. For example, there could have been a modified and reduced central facility for inner Melbourne at Coode Island, and a facility at Crib Point to service Dandenong, Clayton and other users in the eastern metropolitan area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I express some concern at the lack of balance in the report. From my perspective, two major issues had to be addressed in considering the relocation of the Coode Island chemical facility. The two issues were, first, containment and, second, distribution transportation. The report itself is 266 pages long, with 76 pages of appendices. The examinations of transport and distribution account for only 10 pages of the total document, less than 3 per cent of the total. Even appendix 6.3 confesses the inadequacy of the transport treatment. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of storing new hazardous materials (such as LPG or VCM) at the relocated terminal have not been considered . . . A full, detailed transport safety and risk study would take several months to perform. Although it will be required for final project approvals (probably within the ambit of a complete EIS), the duration and costs rule out conclusion of such a study within the scope of Task 2.4.&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this section on transport risk issues continues with a broad-based discussion of the comparative risk of transport by road, rail and pipeline&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A detailed study of transport risks would take several months, as illustrated by the recent ACDS report which took more than five years to prepare for just four dangerous materials.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is not a very comprehensive treatment. I declare my undying fealty to the Premier, I think she is doing an excellent job, but I express concern that in her news release of 7 April on the relocation of the Coode Island facility only one of 24 paragraphs refers to the question of transport. The paragraph says in full:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We wish to ensure that transport from the new facility will be safe and have committed funds for road upgrading in conjunction with the Federal Government in order to add a third lane to the Geelong Road.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is referred to in the immortal One Nation package. Further, in the Premier's statement, `Coode Island Review Panel', of 23 paragraphs, not one paragraph refers to the issue of transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned about that. Obviously the Coode Island review panel and the Victorian Government face a painful dilemma: the choice of a centralised facility with risk to an established densely populated area, or a distant facility, relatively remote from population, where risk is part of the lengthened transport links. If you take, for example, the distance between Coode Island and Footscray, where many of the users would be, and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>West Point Wilson and Footscray, it would be fair to estimate something like a tenfold increase in distance, and something like a tenfold increase in exposure to risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you go further, more or less in the direction of the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford) but more in the direction of my colleague the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), the distance from Coode Island to Dandenong would be of the order of 40 kilometres. The distance from West Point Wilson to Dandenong would be more of the order of 100 kilometres. So that is a matter of some concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion moved by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) is mild in its language but appropriate. A parliamentary committee ought to look at the relocation of Coode Island facilities as a matter of urgency. I agree with the honourable member for Dunkley that the matter should not be allowed to drag on. There are important issues involved. But from the perspective of the west, and I speak as the member for Lalor, there is the concern that for too long the west has been seen as the area where a facility is dumped that no one else wants&mdash;historically sewerage, later intractable waste and then medical incineration. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion of the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) that the proposals for the relocation of the Coode Island chemical facilities be referred to the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts. It is a very important issue for all Victorians and it is appropriate that it be considered by Federal Parliament. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Honourable members will be aware that on 7 April 1992 the Victorian Government announced that it would implement the recommendations of the Coode Island review panel for a new storage facility and that the Government had accepted the panel's recommendation that the new site be located at West Point Wilson on the western shores of Port Phillip Bay. The recommendation of West Point Wilson as the new site was one of 57 in the Coode Island review panel's sixth and final report. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendation of the Coode Island review panel&mdash;the Landy review panel as it is commonly known&mdash;that Coode Island be shut down and that another site be developed has been welcomed by both the Victorian Labor Government and the coalition Opposition. As far back as 19 October 1990, with the release of its Coode Island closure strategy, the Victorian Opposition drew attention to the massive environmental threat posed by the Coode Island chemical facility. The fires which occurred at Coode Island on 21 and 22 August 1991 were testament to the Victorian Opposition's warnings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 10 December 1991, the Victorian coalition parties attacked the Kirner Government for senselessly delaying the inevitable decision to progressively close Coode Island. The shadow Minister for Conservation and Environment, the honourable Mark Birrell, called on the State Government to stop wasting time and to work with industry and the EPA to identify and facilitate the use of alternative, safe chemical storage sites. Four months later, the Landy review panel released its report and West Point Wilson is the recommended new site at a cost of $200m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fully understand that the honourable member for Corio would be very concerned about the proposal to locate the new site within the boundaries of his electorate. However, the reality is that an exhaustive investigation has already occurred. The review panel was established by the honourable member's State Labor colleagues, and the recommendations of the panel have now been accepted by the Kirner Government. There is not time for further delay. Coode Island remains a significant risk to the safety of workers at the site and nearby residents; there is no time for further referral. The time for action is now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Coode Island facility has proved to be an environmental and health time bomb for Victorians. Stating the obvious, we cannot contemplate a repeat of the disaster which occurred at Coode Island on 21 and 22 August 1991. An alternative site must be found and in full operation as soon as possible. To that end, we welcome the recommendations of the Landy review panel for a new facility to commence in 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the benefit of honourable members who may not be fully aware of the final recommendations of the Landy review panel, I will briefly summarise them. The panel recommended that a new bulk liquid port facility be built at West Point Wilson on the western shores of Port Phillip Bay, about 50 kilometres south-west of Melbourne and 15 kilometres north-east of Geelong. The report said that the site at West Point Wilson, which is about five kilometres from the nearest housing, offered substantial buffer zones, of up to two kilometres, which would guarantee protection for the community; a long-term viable future for the chemical industry; the possible relocation of bulk hazardous chemicals currently imported through Geelong and Williamstown, and increased safety in the transport of hazardous chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The site was also chosen because of the need to take a long term view of up to 50 years and the main alternative, the upgrading of Coode Island, would continue to be a subject of controversy and review as the city developed. I also note that the review panel recommended that an environmental effects statement be conducted for the proposed facility in conjunction with the Commonwealth and that a consultative committee, representing key interest groups, guide the statement's preparation. I stated earlier that I fully appreciate the sentiments behind the motion. However, the time for review and investigation has passed. The time for action is now. </PARA>

<PARA>I have pleasure in supporting this motion, although in doing so I want to say that it is rather sad that we have to continue with a motion like this in this House because of the dreadful circumstances of human rights in Burma. In fact, since this motion was last debated on 27 February, no evidence has arisen that indicates that the Burmese State Law and Order Restoration Council, the SLORC, has ceased its extreme violations of human rights. The scale of abuse is far worse than the violations by China in Tiananmen Square. Amnesty International, in various reports, has described Burma as the worst offender of human rights abuses in the region. A recent international report described Burma as `a prison without bars'. There are also 2,000 political prisoners behind bars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The release of 11 political prisoners yesterday, which takes the total to 38 who have been released, is insignificant when one thinks of the remaining 1,072 political prisoners at least. It is well known that these prisoners are kept in inhuman conditions, and now the UN Human Rights Commission is investigating brutal mistreatment of political prisoners. Australia must ensure that pressure is maintained on Burma until the National League for Democracy, which has a democratically attained mandate to govern, is allowed to do so. The token gestures of the SLORC in recent days should not be perceived as evidence of real change. The release of some political prisoners is a mere token. A total of 38 have been released out of the 2,000 that have been detained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner, Aung San Suu Kyi, remains in detention, and, while the military regime announced some reforms, it has not agreed that she will be released. The announcement that Aung San Suu Kyi can meet briefly with her family must be placed in the context of her being the leader of the National League for Democracy, which has won a democratic election and which has not been allowed to govern. These people think that they are being generous in allowing the family of the leader of the party that won the election to see her for the first time for quite some time. I agree with Senator Evans, who said on 26 March that Aung San Suu Kyi's expulsion from Burma, rather than her release, would not be acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Political, economic and ethnic refugees continue to leave Burma at a greater rate than ever before. Thousands are leaving through every possible means&mdash;through the Bangladesh border and the Thai border. Even China has agreed `out of humanitarian considerations' to accord temporary settlement to refugees. Japan has granted for the first time refugee status to Burmese anti-Government activists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A group of Asian lawyers have released a report on the conditions within the refugee camps. Men and women have been captured and used as porters for the Burmese Army; they serve as human mine detectors. The Thai-Burma border camps have grown even larger and the conditions are disgusting. I saw similar camps during my visit to the Thai-Kampuchea border and have seen the suffering that occurs in these camps. Australia's role in moves towards a peaceful resolution in Cambodia has shown that Australia is important in the region and must therefore speak out on the human rights abuses in Burma. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the military government's firm maintenance of power, it is now coming under increasing international pressure and Australia has a vital role to play in maintaining that pressure.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The European Parliament has passed a motion to call for sanctions and to recommend that the UN Security Council investigate abuses of human rights in Burma. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 10 April, the European Parliament suggested multilateral trade sanctions on Burma and the delaying of aid programs. Australia has an important role to play to support, reinforce and extend these suggestions from Europe within this region. There is evidence that much of the foreign aid in the past has gone to strengthening the Burmese Army rather than where it was intended, that is, to the Burmese people. This is an important region to Australia and Burma provides a potential source of regional instability if these matters are not dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In early 1988, there was an escalation of protest and civilian rioting which was brutally quelled by the Burmese police under the instruction of the SLORC. The strength of these attacks was said to be far greater than anything we have seen in our region. The repression of the pro-democracy movement in Burma was justified on the grounds that it was maintaining law and order. There was no threat to law and order; there was only a threat to the entrenched and privileged position of the armed forces and those who rely on the armed forces for the maintenance and continuity of that position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the run-up to the election of 27 May 1990, there was clear evidence that the SLORC used military pressure to influence election results and control potential insurgencies. Nevertheless, the election was won by Aung San Suu Kyi and her party and everyone expected that the military would do the right thing. The SLORC did not want to call the election, but was forced by international pressure to do so; it then attempted to intimidate people during the election. Having resoundingly lost the election, one would have thought that it might have given up and realised that the Burmese people did not want it. Instead, what happened? It imprisoned the leader of the democratic forces, Aung San Suu Kyi, and continued with its brutal regime. That is the situation that we have been facing. It is clear that unless the international community isolates Burma and makes it perfectly clear to the ruling clique in Burma that it will not accept this sort of behaviour, progress will not be reached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about time that all of the countries of the region took seriously this very unstable situation in Burma which is creating tensions in the whole region and the suffering of all of those Burmese people that have clearly expressed a desire for democracy and for an alternative government. It is about time that we acted much more firmly in relation to the Burmese situation. I support this motion. </PARA>

It is clear that the human rights abuses in Burma have been well documented and are reminiscent of the atrocities committed by the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia. Amnesty International has documented the horrific abuses of human rights, including rape, pillage, torture and murder. Early this year Amnesty International identified more than 1,500 political prisoners of conscience and 600 people arrested for carrying out anti-government activities in the first seven months of 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to a January 1992 Amnesty report, over 100 people have been sentenced to death in Burma since July 1989 by military tribunals and civilian courts. Amazingly, although the courts continue to hand down these death sentences, the Burmese Government&mdash;ironically known as the State Law and Order Restoration Committee or SLORC&mdash;refuses to admit to the killings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The SLORC seized military control of Burma in 1988 after pro-democracy demonstrations led to the resignation of the authoritarian military ruler, Ne Win, who came to power in 1962. The SLORC has subsequently undertaken a major crackdown on Burmese citizens who expressed a desire for democracy and has continued to repress critics and opponents of the military regime. Despite these obvious uprisings against the ruling military junta, the SLORC continues to refuse a transfer of power to the National League for Democracy party which was democratically elected in 1990, the leader of which is the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and detainee Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. The award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Aung San Suu Kyi highlighted to the world the plight of the people of Burma and the gross violations of human rights and political freedoms which have occurred in that country. Of the 392 members of parliament elected in 1990, 111 have been gaoled or have fled the country. The rest are too terrified to speak out against the SLORC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, these facts are nothing new. What represents a radical and significant change in the matters concerning the human rights situation in Burma is the change in policy of the international community regarding Burma, one which in my view and I am sure the view of many of my colleagues should have happened a lot sooner. Until recently the response of the international community on the whole to the countrywide repression and persecution of minorities in Burma has been ad hoc and ineffectual. The events that have occurred in the last few days and weeks surely represent the most significant signs from the international community that the oppressive tactics by the SLORC will no longer be tolerated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since this motion was moved in February of this year the essence of its decree remains legitimate. The human rights abuses in Burma are indefensible and we must do all we can to see that a stop is put to them. However, as a country that has little to do with the Burmese Government, we can only urge our international counterparts to adopt a similar position to our condemnation of human rights abuses in Burma. This is becoming a trend. No longer is the international community prepared to take a blinkered view of events in Burma; it is speaking out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Human rights abuses in Burma continue. United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's decision to send the Under Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, Jan Eliasson, to Burma in early April is a sure sign that the United Nations is prepared to become actively involved in putting an end to these violations and supporting a peaceful transition to democracy in Burma. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the first time, ASEAN countries, who were previously prepared to overlook human rights violations in Burma, are taking a stand. Each of the six nations making up ASEAN&mdash;Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and Singapore&mdash;have publicly called on the Burmese Government to exercise restraint. Pakistan has urged Burma to allow tens of thousands of its Muslim citizens from the state of Arakan fleeing to Bangladesh to return home. Up to 210,000 Arakanese Muslims, known as Rohingyas, have entered Bangladesh in the last four months, pleading sanctuary from the raping, killing, looting and burning which the Burmese Government has been party to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until recently, the SLORC claimed that most of the people who fled to Bangladesh were not Burmese citizens, although their ancestors lived in the isolated Burmese western province of Arakan for centuries. In March of this year the 46-nation Organisation of Islamic Conference denounced the Burmese Government for the persecution and repression that have been conducted against the local Arakanese Muslim community. </PARA>
<PARA>The United Nations Human Rights Commission made an unprecedented unanimous ruling in censuring the SLORC for serious human rights violations and sent a special rapporteur to investigate these circumstances. The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has admitted that the movement of refugees into neighbouring countries was reaching dramatic proportions, with between 5,000 and 7,000 people fleeing Burma daily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This month, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on human rights violations in the persecution of minorities in Burma. The resolution proposed that the European Parliament call on its members of the United Nations Security Council&mdash;namely, France and the United Kingdom&mdash;to propose an embargo on arms deliveries to Burma and possibly trade sanctions against that country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These significant changes in stance by the international community occurred as a result of the sustained campaign against human rights abuses, of which campaign Australia has been one of the most ardent supporters. Significant catalysts for this more hard line approach include the SLORC's systematic campaign to force Muslims in Arakan to flee to neighbouring countries, the sacking of 150 Rangoon university teachers as a result of their suspect political loyalties, and the castigating of students, politicians and monks who had political views other than that of the military junta. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The SLORC has attempted to justify its military oppression as necessary to maintaining control over ethnic insurgencies. However, these groups in recent years have posed little threat to the country's heavily populated urban centres. No longer can the SLORC stand by this argument. The increasing refugee exodus to neighbouring countries, brought on by military oppression and social and economic problems, has led to a well-recognised international problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been the problem of narcotics trafficking, in which the SLORC has been directly involved. The flow of heroin from Burma to the neighbouring countries, as well as to North America, has led to catastrophic results. Drug addiction is on the rise in Burma and surrounding countries. So is AIDS, which is directly linked to drug addiction. Burma and Thailand have the highest incidence of HIV infection in Asia, and AIDS has spread from Burma to India and China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finances from the sale of huge logging concessions to foreign firms, in particular to those in Thailand, have been used to buy military equipment which has been used against the citizens of Burma. The wanton destruction of rainforest areas due to logging could have long term ecological effects for the region. Ultimately it is the people of Burma who are suffering and will continue to suffer under the rule of the SLORC. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> However, only last weekend, in clear recognition of the international community's demands, we heard news of the Burmese Government's decision to allow Aung San Suu Kyi to see her husband, British academic Michael Aris, and their two sons. Being under house arrest in Rangoon since July 1989, she has not been able to see her family for more than two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only yesterday, Burma's military junta signalled the release of 11 political prisoners. This brings the number of political prisoners released to 38 since last week. The turning point in this recognition of the repression conducted by the Burmese Government is the succession of General Than Shwe to the position of Prime Minister that occurred only last week. Last Friday, the SLORC pledged to free all political prisoners, except those who posed a threat to national security. It also agreed to take back many of the 210,000 Muslim refugees who have sought political asylum in Bangladesh. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the SLORC has said that it will take back all refugees who had valid national registration or other documents to support their identity, the fact is that the Burmese army seized citizenship papers of many refugees leaving the country, leaving them with no proof of residency or citizenship. The Government has also allegedly called off the military offensive against the Karen rebels on Burma's eastern border. However, last Tuesday night it was reported that Burmese Government forces shelled Karen rebel positions, despite its statement that the attacks had been suspended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the latest measures by the Burmese Government are a step in the right direction, it remains to be seen whether they are, in fact, a change in policy or are merely designed to appease international opinion. It is now more crucial than ever that the international community and Australia maintain their pressure on Burma to end the fighting and repression and begin a dialogue for the formation of a new democratic government. Action must be taken as soon as possible to ensure that the people of Burma have their rights and freedoms restored to them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join with the previous speaker, the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), in supporting the motion which was put forward by the Opposition Whip, the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson). In doing that I have to say that those of us who are concerned about human rights and the promotion of multiparty democracies around the world can be glad that we live in a time when that concept is spreading to an increasing number of countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the crucial moment was the development of a free trade union movement in Poland. It was the first of the Eastern bloc countries to do so. It ultimately resulted in a clamp down and a revival of multiparty democracy in not only Poland but also other countries in eastern Europe. I think that played a crucial role in multiparty democracy spreading to the Soviet Union. The collapse of communist totalitarianism in the Soviet Union has now meant that multiparty democracy is starting to emerge in places such as Africa and other parts of the world where it is long overdue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our part of the world sometimes it is more difficult to see multiparty democracy growing and developing with the speed and strength that many of us would like to see. In Burma, as the honourable member for Moore and the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) pointed out, there is one crucial fact: the party led by Aung San Suu Kyi won over 80 per cent of the seats in the national assembly in May 1990. On that basis alone she should form a government, her party should form a government and they should rule in Burma. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As previous speakers have pointed out that, of course, was not something that appealed to the military dictatorship that has run Burma for many years. Its actions have been condemned not only by members of this Parliament but also by the United Nations General Assembly. The Human Rights Commission has expressed concern about violations in Burma. The European Parliament, as mentioned by the honourable member for Moore, has carried resolutions calling for sanctions to be imposed. Members of ASEAN have taken the extraordinary step of suggesting that action needs to be considered to ensure that these human rights violations do not continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an unusual step for ASEAN. In the past ASEAN has been reluctant to get involved in the internal affairs of neighbouring countries. The fact that countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore are raising human rights issues is a progressive step and something which I hope will develop in other ways in years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Australia, our Government, through our Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), I think with the support of the Opposition parties, has applied an arms embargo to sales of military equipment to Burma. We have made it clear that there will be no resumption of development assistance to Burma while these human rights violations continue. Australia has provided more than a quarter of a million dollars to clothe and feed some of the refugees that are now living in the camps in Bangladesh. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two countries which I think have the greatest contribution to make in improving human rights in Burma right now are Japan and China. Japan is the biggest aid donor to Burma. I think Japan can play a very constructive role in protecting the human rights of the people of Burma. China is the largest arms supplier to Burma. I believe it could take a very strong step in improving its human rights record by applying an arms embargo to sales to Burma until the current dictatorship in Burma hands over to the Government which was freely elected in May 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I obtained a few examples of human rights violations in Burma. Given that time is short, I will not go into them this afternoon, other than to say that it is very clear that prisoners of conscience have in some cases been tortured and raped in Burma. There have been examples quoted where prisoners have been used as minesweepers to walk ahead of soldiers to clear mine areas in the military incursions that have taken place. There have also been allegations that former prostitutes who have HIV have been put to death. For these and other reasons, I support the motion before the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to be able to support the motion moved by the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), which in part condemns the State Law and Order Restoration Council's disregard of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Burma. Previous speakers&mdash;today and on the two previous occasions on which this debate has taken place&mdash;have outlined at length the history of the present situation. However, the debate today is all the more timely because of recent developments in Burma; they have been alluded to this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fitting that we should debate this issue. Although for many people Burma is a little known country, our histories have been intertwined and we have cause to be interested in Burma's future. The security and stability of our region, which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) tells us is where our future lies, is of concern to us. Incidentally, the Prime Minister may be correct in that observation, but the way he has gone about making that particular point has angered and disgusted many Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this broad context we reflect also that Burma was the focus of attention in the events leading up to the fall of Singapore in February 1942. The Prime Minister's contribution in respect of that particular issue also went down like a lead balloon. His deliberate and malicious misinterpretation of the history of that time offended many British and Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time the Australian and British governments jointly decided that the priority was to ensure the security of Malaya. This was considered to be in the best interests of the defence of Australia, India and Burma. Ultimately, at the end of the war or shortly after, Burma became independent. But back in the early 1940s it was the focus of a major dispute between the then Australian Prime Minister, John Curtin, and the British Prime Minister, Churchill. Churchill's attempt to divert the Australian convoy which was en route from the Middle East to Burma led to a dramatic change in the relationship between Australia and Britain. The historic `Australia looks to America' call was made by Curtin at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Burma gained independence in 1947. In 1962 a coup led to the repressive rule of the military under General Ne Win. That military rule continues despite the 1990 election, which clearly indicated that people wanted a return to a civilian democracy as a form of government rather than a military government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should rightly condemn the actions of the supreme State Law and Order Restoration Council. Other speakers have outlined the extent of the atrocities which have been committed against the people of Burma, and I do not wish to dwell on those. However, while we are discussing human rights abuses in Burma, it seems appropriate that we should be reminded that there remains on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> the motion of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) which also highlights the actions of the Indonesian Government in East Timor. Debate on this motion has been conspicuously quiet in recent weeks. I ought to say in fairness that the honourable member tells me that he is to have further discussions with the Prime Minister on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a contrast here, but I do not believe that we can continue to overlook the fact that six Australians and perhaps as many as 200,000 East Timorese have been murdered by Indonesian forces in East Timor. This is not a game of one-upmanship in terms of which regimes are the most repressive in the world. It is a great pity that we have regimes such as these in any parts of the world. So I do not intend to contrast the situation in Burma with that in Indonesia. But we should not overlook or excuse the actions of the Indonesian military in East Timor any more than we want in this debate this morning to overlook or diminish the horrific activities of the military regime which continues to exist in Burma.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Every nation who joined forces in the Gulf just over a year ago in the name of a new world order should now employ the strongest non-combat measures open to them to cleanse the human rights blot which is Burma today. Every leader, every military strategist and every citizen who believed that the taking up of arms was justified by the atrocities being perpetrated in oil rich Kuwait should now support tough trade sanctions to combat the prolonged and methodical torturous killing of the men, women and children of Karen in one of the world's poorest nations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I join today honourable members on both sides of the House in strong support of the motion before the House. With them, I stand in sympathy with the victims of the Burmese atrocities and in outrage that these atrocities are continuing in our world, our region. I join also with those who call on the severing of Australian trade links with the perpetrators of these atrocities, should the ruling junta's concessions to international outrage prove inadequate&mdash;not that I believe that an entirely negative stand should be adopted in the face of the first, though minimal, evidence that the military junta is sensitive to the world's condemnation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Observer nations would do well to pause and to watch, but they should also make it clear that they have no intention of allowing the momentum of their campaign for full lifting of the unacceptable yoke of the Karen people to lapse. In this context, I agree with Senator Evans's judgment: while in recent weeks he has been reconsidering the question of economic sanctions to strengthen those measures that Australia has already taken, he thinks it appropriate to put any further diplomatic action on hold until it becomes clear whether the junta's actions are a watershed or simply cosmetic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the accusation of the All Burma Students Democratic Front that the oppressors are merely trying to divert international attention from Burma's affairs and to deceive the people accurately represents a wider concern that tactics such as those used in the past by a South African government striving to shield its atrocities from the eye of the world are being employed in Burma. There is reason for this concern. International pressure must be maintained; in this context, I agree that China and Japan have major roles to play. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a proud record as a defender of the victims of human rights abuse, an honest broker in discussions and strategies towards non-combat solutions, often in conjunction with the United Nations in places such as Namibia, South Africa and Cambodia. Our desire to intervene where we can do so effectively to release those in bondage, often in poorer nations, must go unquestioned. But we must not fall into the ego trap of prematurely bringing out our biggest guns&mdash;and in Burma, in a non-combat sense, these must be strong trade sanctions and participation in a comprehensive UN endorsed arms embargo against Burma&mdash;in order to prove our credentials as defenders of the oppressed; to do so would be to prolong the agony of those very people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For now we must wait, giving the junta the opportunity to build on the minimal concessions to human rights which it has made, but we must not wait too long. For the people of Karen, the wait for relief has already been far too long. It is 3 1/2 years since SLORC seized power. Human rights abuses were recorded then. But, since the election of 1990, in particular, the persecution of the people has grown beyond human endurance, reflecting Adolf Hitler's crime against the Jewish people during World War II. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is the case in oppression and war, women are doubly the losers. There has been broad reporting of the atrocities endured by the Karen people. Nicholas Cumming-Bruce's commentary in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 16 February 1992 encapsulates the human face of military oppression. In referring to the infamous press-ganging of civilians by the military in Burma, he gave an eyewitness report of a farmer, aged 65, who was reduced to `a beaten, half-starved beast of burden', conscious of the fate of the so-called porters who are worked to exhaustion on the front line as beasts of burden who, when they collapse from hunger and sickness, are killed by the soldiers or are left to die.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to place on record my disappointment and annoyance at the current campaign to change Australia's national flag. This campaign is being conducted by a vocal minority and there is little sympathy for this campaign amongst the vast majority of ordinary Australians. I am not surprised that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has now called for a new flag. This gives him yet another opportunity to divert attention from the appalling state of the Australian economy and his Government's continuing mismanagement of national affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was shocked, however, that the Prime Minister would have the audacity and temerity to denigrate his national flag whilst on foreign soil. Never before have I been so embarrassed by or ashamed of the actions of an Australian Prime Minister. One can be certain that the Prime Minister's predecessor, Bob Hawke, would never have humiliated or insulted his own nation in such a manner. I agree totally with Professor Geoffrey Blainey, who earlier this week wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister, Mr Keating, has failed in that simplest test of leadership&mdash;loyalty to the nation he leads. Nothing was more degrading than his rejection of the Australian flag while officially representing Australia on Indonesian soil. He marks himself as unfit to lead when he positively uses his position as national leader to deride the national flag.</PARA>
<PARA>This Prime Minister is determined to destroy our history and our heritage. He has a manic desire to rewrite Australia's history without any reference to the facts. We earlier witnessed his attack on Australia's traditional ties with Great Britain and the monarchy and his bizarre interpretation of Australian-British relations during World War II. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, as a nation, we must be saddled with this Prime Minister's hatred for our flag simply because it has the Union Jack in the upper left-hand corner. Since assuming the role of Prime Minister, he has embarked on a most amazing attack on Australia's Anglo-Celtic traditions and heritage. I can see no reason why the Prime Minister's utterings should not be labelled as anti-British racism. The Labor Party should be ashamed that it elected this man to the high office of Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The campaign for a new flag has been largely led by a Sydney based organisation calling itself Ausflag Ltd. In late 1991, this organisation wrote to all Federal members of parliament arguing the case for changing Australia's flag and I wish to take this opportunity to place on record my response. The letter, dated 5 November 1991, is addressed to the Executive Director of Ausflag, Mr Harold Scruby, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Scruby</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter dated 10 October, 1991, regarding AUSFLAG'S campaign to change Australia's national flag.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have carefully read your letter and I remain far from convinced that there is a need to change our flag. I do not understand your statement `it is vital in these times that Australia has its own flag`. Australia does have its own flag and I believe that it is supported by the vast majority of Australians. The fact that Europe will have a new flag in 1992 is irrelevant to the present argument in Australia and I dispute your claim that the European flag will be superior in status to the British, French and German flags. I would not wish to be the person to have to tell an Englishman, a Frenchman or a German that his flag has been lowered in status.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your statement that a change of flag requires only an Act of Parliament and not a change to the Constitution is most interesting. Certainly, Federal Parliament has the power to enact legislation to change the flag but there is certainly an argument that the question should be placed before the Australian people by way of referendum. This is the policy of the Coalition. The national flag should only be changed with majority support from all Australians and not by the whim of politicians. Your organisation should not be attempting to take the short route&mdash;the issue is too important.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The comparison with Canada's change of flag is not legitimate. It is well known that Canada's history is very different to Australia's and this fact is referred to by the Canadian Consul in his letter to you dated 21 April, 1986. You make no mention of this argument in your letter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To assert that there is doubt whether Australia is still a colony of Great Britain is ludicrous. Who has these doubts? Who believes that Australia is not a sovereign independent nation with our own identity? Your letter contains some very bold statements but very few facts to support them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your claim that Australia's flag is confusing to the rest of the world is without evidence. It is similar in design only to the national flag of New Zealand&mdash;if this worries the New Zealanders then let them change their flag. The claim that our flag promotes Great Britain is laughable&mdash;do the flags of the Republic of South Africa and the State of Hawaii (both include the Union Jack) promote Great Britain as well? I challenge you to take a close look at the range of national flags and you will quickly see that many are similar. The Netherlands flag could be confused with the French flag, the Soviet Union flag resembles the flag of the People's Republic of China, the flag of Belgium has the same colours as the flag of Germany, the flags of Indonesia and Monaco are identical and both are similar to the Polish flag. Italy's flag is easily confused with Hungary's and Ethiopia and Bolivia have identical national flags. These are but a few examples. The similarities between the Australian flag and the New Zealand flag are far less than the examples just offered and yet your organisation uses this `similarity' to promote the case for a new flag.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your final assertion that change is inevitable is quite wrong. The Coalition, along with the overwhelming majority of Australians, supports the retention of the current flag. Your organisation's ambition to impose a change of flag upon the Australian people will not be realised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, I am annoyed at your use of Banjo Patterson's poem `Our Own Flag'. This poem was written in 1900, one year before Federation and BEFORE the current Australian flag was chosen from a competition attracting nearly 33,000 entries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a time when Australia is faced with enormous economic hurdles and the consequent economic and social hardships, I believe that your energies and the energy of your organisation could be better channelled.</PARA>
<PARA>That concludes my letter to Ausflag but, for the benefit of the Prime Minister, I will repeat the message contained in the final paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a time when Australia is faced with enormous economic hurdles and the consequent economic and social hardships, I believe that your energies and the energy of your organisation could be better channelled.</PARA>
<PARA>I am only one of three members of the current Australian Parliament who have served in war under the current Australian flag. Last Saturday, Anzac Day, Australians in every city and town across Australia displayed their affection and support for the national flag. Despite the claims of the Prime Minister, Australian service men and women have fought for this country under the current flag in two world wars, the Korean war, the Vietnam war and, most recently, the Gulf war in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one sees such expressions of support for the flag, and when one remembers the sacrifices made by Australian service men and women throughout this century, how could one seriously contemplate such an important change to such an integral part of our history and heritage? What is more, if we change now we establish a very dangerous precedent. Any future Prime Minister who is faced with serious domestic problems may attempt to reopen the flag debate and we will never settle the issue. We will be the only nation in the world which embroils itself in a constant debate about its national symbols. The Prime Minister has already embarrassed this country in the international arena by denigrating his own national flag, and that must never be allowed to happen again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I wish to place on record my total contempt for the hypocrisy of the Labor Party on the issue of the Australian flag. The Labor Party's symbol, used in all Federal and State elections for the past decade, has boldly and conveniently included the current flag. The Labor Party has held election rally after election rally with the Australian flag emblazoned across the stage. What a pack of hypocrites. My message to the Prime Minister is simple: leave our flag and heritage alone and direct your attention to the crucial economic and social issues facing Australia in 1992. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

It has played a commendable historic role in improving the quality of life of people. Regardless of where they live in this nation&mdash;whether they live in Dirranbandi, in the outback, in Bourke, or in the capital cities&mdash;Australia Post has been there providing a communications system. It has been a vital means of personal communication. It has been an excellent vehicle for the delivery and dissemination of information, and that has been taken up by all sorts of publishing organisations over the decades. Australia Post has been an equaliser in the provision of services to non-metropolitan Australians. It does not matter where one lives; services have been equalised so that those in country areas can gain just as much as others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, like many others, have applauded the role that Australia Post has played in providing a community oriented service. It years ago cast aside the idea of user pays. It has always had a national interest test and has been willing to cross-subsidise the cost of delivering a product in country areas by offsetting the profits that have been made in the larger metropolitan areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This history goes back to 1984 when Australia Post was given the right to bring about its own changes; it was given that independence. It was allowed to take on what one might call a corporate mentality. It could set its own charges except in two areas: standard letters and registered publications. A role is supposed to be played by the Prices Surveillance Authority in those two categories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last couple of years we have seen major changes. There has been a targeting for greater efficiency, higher productivity, reduction of costs, and improvement in the quality and variety of postal products and, at the same time, the maximisation of profits. There is no doubt that Australia Post has achieved the last target because it reached $144.1m in profit in 1990-91. I do not blame it for that; I welcome the fact that it has made this profit but it ought not to be maximising profit to the detriment of people generally. Profit should not be maximised at the expense of quality of service to all Australians. It should not be at the expense of Australia Post's community service obligation. It should not be at the expense of Australian jobs and the publishing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now seeing a major change in impact on those areas. We note the changes that have taken place, firstly, in the registered post area and, secondly, in the new system of print post. They are the issues I want to target. I have major concerns that relate to delivery times, the closure of post offices, and the postal charges for standard letters, but I want to stress the issues of print post and registered post. Those other matters will be taken up by a special committee of Government members next Monday when we meet with senior Australia Post officers in this Parliament. I am going to restrict comments for the moment to the areas where the real changes have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes have come about because Australia Post says that it has lost something like $20m in print post. I suspect that that is creative accounting. I think the time has come for us to look at the figures that Australia Post has used because over the last 18 months it has massively increased its mailing charges for most magazines. Some of these increases have been as high as 223 per cent. To post a magazine or publication weighing up to 500 grams, one now has to pay $1.52; originally it was only 47c. Previously the profits made on the cost of delivering a standard letter or a magazine in the city areas offset the costs of country delivery; that is no longer so. The system has been changed. There are two categories of weight: from 125 grams to 250 grams, then from 250 grams to 500 grams. Then there are geographical categories&mdash;posted from within the same city as the destination, from a city in one State to a city or metropolitan area in another State, such as from Sydney to Brisbane, from a city to the country, or from a country area to a country area&mdash;and it is the country people who are suffering massively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August 1990, if a letter was posted and delivered within the same city, the cost was 47c. That has been increased to 87c, an increase of 85 per cent. In country areas it originally cost 47c&mdash;which was the same as for cities&mdash;but today it costs $1.52, a 223 per cent increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Australia Post has abandoned its service obligation to the community. Motivated by the cash register, it has denied its historic obligation and responsibility to be the provider of a communications service to all Australians, irrespective of where they live and who they might be. Whilst the country and provincial consumers are being forced to pay extra, there is a major effect not only on the consumers but also on the publishers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some 12,000 publications across this nation&mdash;there is some argument about whether it is 10,000 or 12,000&mdash;produced by about 1,000 publishers. They employ tens of thousands of people as photographers, journalists, printers, clerical staff. Those jobs are now in jeopardy because Australia Post has changed the rules. It has cast aside its community obligations. It has thrown off the obligation and responsibility that it had to country people. It is now attacking jobs in this country, attacking small business and attacking consumers. It is not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ones affected are the churches, charitable groups, sporting groups, recreational and cultural organisations&mdash;the community bodies and societies. There are tens of thousands of these across the nation, all of whom have depended on Australia Post to communicate with their members outside of meeting times. There have been so many items, so many units of material, posted through Australia Post and that process is now under threat not only because of cost but also because of a new rule that, unless one has more than 500 articles to post, one has to pay the ordinary rate. The 47c has been increased to $1.52. If one has only 496 articles to post, one now pays $2.65. Imagine what this will do to the cycling clubs, tennis clubs, coin clubs and other recreational groups across this nation. They will simply not be able to afford that. It will mean a major breakdown in that freedom of information, that distribution of information that is so important to quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another rule: if the cover price of a magazine is over $5, it cannot even come within the print post rules. What has the cover price to do with the costs incurred by Australia Post in delivering a magazine? I would suggest that it has nothing to do with it. The cover price relates to the quality of that magazine; it ought not to have anything to do with the cost of delivery by Australia Post. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is that these rules, which will be in force by 1994&mdash;they started on all new magazines from January this year&mdash;are going to affect the sorts of groups I have talked about; the religious groups that have periodicals, the community groups and their reports, the Country Women's Association, the trade unions, the welfare groups and the benevolent organisations. These rules are going to restrict them from communicating with their membership. They are going to deter country people from subscribing to magazines&mdash;and they depend on magazines on such subjects as fishing, cycling, home gardening, hobbies, and high-tech electronics. They depend on those 10,000 to 12,000 publications for information. They are going to wipe out at least 1,000 small businesses and cause massive losses in jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes are going to mean a shift in the producers of publications for this country. Previously, the offshore publishers were not able to get at this special registered post exemption. They were not able to send their magazines at 47c. They had to pay the ordinary rate. Now they can go in there, with a low cost of production, and be equal when it comes to delivery price. They can compete against and wipe out a lot of Australian magazine publishers and get their magazines off the shelves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we ought to do something about it. It is going to have an enormous impact on those people who live outside the metropolitan areas. We need to postpone these changes. Whilst we have given Australia Post some statutory freedom, this Parliament ought to have a say in this matter. It ought to say, `No. No. No' to these changes. It ought to say it is not good enough, when we have an inflation rate of zero per cent, to have increases in Australia Post's prices of five and 10 times&mdash;that is setting aside the special example where some items have gone up by 223 per cent in just two years. I believe the whole issue ought to be the subject of a special study by the Prices Surveillance Authority and also by the Federal Consumer Affairs Bureau. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I wish to bring to the attention of this House a subject which should concern us all, yet it is a subject that many feel uncomfortable with and choose to ignore. I am speaking about domestic violence. Contrary to popular belief, and most women's fears, women are at greater risk of personal harm and danger at home than they are in the street. In Australia today, family violence accounts for the largest category of homicides. To put a precise figure on the level of domestic violence in Australia is difficult because many cases are unreported, and many of the agencies which deal with victims of violence do not keep records of contact, while the police statistics reflect only the extent of family violence which is actually reported. However, it is accurate to say that domestic violence is widespread and increasing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report by the New South Wales Domestic Violence Committee released in July 1991 estimated that more than 100,000 women in New South Wales alone are victims of domestic violence. That is one in every 10 women in that State. Those statistics are only an indication of the level of domestic violence in our society&mdash;a level which is alarmingly high. Demand for services at Melbourne's five sexual assault crisis centres has doubled over the past year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales study estimated that domestic violence costs the community about $1.5 billion each year, resulting from income that victims must forgo while recovering from assaults, employers' loss through absenteeism and costs carried by the Federal and State governments. That estimate, however, does not include the cost borne by the community for death, serious injury and disabilities caused by domestic violence&mdash;which in one case was over $1m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Violence against women is not solely physical. It often involves threats to harm children, denying social contact with friends and verbal abuse which, while not visible or easily measured, can be just as devastating as physical or sexual abuse. There is no doubt that the psychological effects of violence are devastating. Repeated acts of violence erode a woman's self-esteem and her sense of having any rights or choices. The humiliation and submission, which are at the root of all domestic violence, often leave the woman feeling worthless and helpless, and often reduced to a state of complete despair from which escape is viewed as impossible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Women experience enormous difficulties in leaving a violent relationship; so much so, that most in fact do not leave. For many women the fear of their partners if they leave, and the lack of police protection, means that they are pressured to stay with their violent partner. In fact, the fear of future violence often becomes the batterer's most powerful weapon to be used against his victim. A woman's fear of her partner is well justified. Homicide studies indicate that threatening to leave or actually leaving an abusive partner is the most dangerous time for victims of domestic violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other factors which prevent women escaping from such violent relationships are concern for their children and having no money, no transport, no housing, no social support and no employment. Many women view escape from violence as a step towards poverty and homelessness for themselves and their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent case in South Australia, where a jury acquitted a woman of murdering her de facto husband after hearing details of the violence she had endured for years at his hand, has established not only a legal precedent, but also a social precedent as the difficulties that battered women face in leaving a relationship become more widely understood. However, there is still a long way to go. The problems that victims of domestic violence face are often exacerbated for women from non-English speaking backgrounds, Aboriginal women and rural women. Language barriers, lack of appropriate services, lack of information about services, religious and cultural constraints and a lack of understanding on the part of those providing support services all work together to make it exceedingly difficult for migrant and Aboriginal women to escape from a violent relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A study by Lyla Coorey of why rural women do not leave a violent relationship revealed that the structures created by isolation and distance, the employment situation and the financial arrangements between couples make it more difficult for women on the land to leave a violent relationship than for women who live in town. The 1988 Federal Government report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Life has never been easy</EMPHASIS> found that those women who live in rural Australia have been deprived of equal access to the education, training and social support freely available to their city counterparts. In some cases this was compensated for by the closer support networks that exist in country communities. However, when it comes to dealing with domestic violence, the country network often fails, with the issue being largely ignored by the community. Lyla Coorey's study found that the attitude in the community towards domestic violence was unsympathetic, as revealed in the community's reluctance to get involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only the women who suffer from living in a violent partnership, but their children as well. The causes of domestic violence are far more complex than the commonly purported simplistic causes of alcohol consumption, stress, emotional trauma, conflict or provocation by the victim. Such explanations merely serve as excuses which are used to justify the man's violent behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now understood that violence against women is a product of a set of traditions, habits or beliefs, which permit some men to assume dominance and control over women and to assume the right to use violence as a means of exercising that dominance and control. Mr Allen Fugler&mdash;a clinical forensic psychologist who gave evidence at the recent trial in South Australia I previously mentioned&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Men who terrorise and beat women are riddled with insecurities and use aggression to try to control a partner whom they believe has more personal skills than they do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Victims of domestic violence are vulnerable and look to the Government, our judicial system, our police and our society to provide them with support and assistance. In most cases, the Government, the police, the judiciary and society fail to adequately assist and support battered women. The New South Wales Domestic Violence Committee report found that many women do not have access to accurate and confidential information about their rights. This is perpetuated by the fact that police and legal responses to domestic violence are frequently characterised by inconsistency and inaction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Arrests in this area are rare, despite the fact that domestic violence is a criminal offence. A report on domestic violence by the Australian Institute of Criminology found that police remained reluctant to become involved with what they saw as a private, family matter, and as such were slow to take up their power to arrest offenders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Domestic violence is not a private matter. It is a community matter which must be addressed by governments and individuals alike. However, except for a number of token efforts in this area, the issue is being largely ignored and hidden. An indication of this is that a major report on the status of women which was tabled in this House just this morning does not contain one recommendation regarding domestic violence. The solution to the problem of domestic violence lies not just with helping victims get out of violent relationships, but with changing society's attitudes towards the treatment of women, changing the attitudes of the police force and a realisation that domestic violence is a crime which is punishable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot begin my grievance today without first congratulating the honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey) on a very timely and excellent speech. More and more of us have to raise the issue of domestic violence publicly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My grievance is about the popular misconception that job losses are an inevitable result of environmental protection policies. This is something about which I feel very deeply indeed and on which I hope to speak many times in this place and in other places. The attitude that in the public I am talking about is typified by the increasingly common bumper sticker one see which reads, `Greenies cost jobs'. Too often, the debate about the environment is seen as a juxtaposition between the two, ignoring the fact that, in meeting environmental standards and developing cleaner, energy efficient industries and production processes, significant job growth will occur. Not only do greenies not cost jobs; greenies can create jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have often spoken on the issue of uranium mining, and when I have opposed uranium mining I have been accused of preventing job creation in Australia. Of course, it has always been very easy to demonstrate how few jobs are created in that particular form of mining. But I will go further now and say that the area of energy generation is an excellent illustration of the way in which clean technologies will not only help us meet essential environmental standards but will also create significantly more jobs than conventional methods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary reason for this is that clean energy technologies are not only more cost effective but, of course, more labour intensive. For example, the generation of 1,000 gigawatt hours of electricity per year in a coal-fired power plant requires an estimated 116 workers. In a solar-thermal facility, to create the same amount of electricity requires 248 workers, while a wind farm needs 542 workers&mdash;or shall we put it another way and say that it provides 542 jobs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members may feel that wind farms are a pretty fantastic proposition and that I am indeed tilting at windmills&mdash;as I am often accused of doing&mdash;but I draw honourable members' attention to the Danish experience. Using a temporary subsidy, and I stress that it was temporary, the Danish Government created 3,000 jobs in wind farm manufacturing. That subsidy was repaid threefold in reduced dole payments and increased income tax. By the year 2000, Denmark will have 10 per cent of its electricity supplied by wind. In answer to those who worry about labour costs, I suggest that they keep in mind that those costs are offset by the much lower levels of investment and capital needed in these industries and that investment in capital can then be redirected to more productive areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is well placed to repeat the Danish success. The Western Australian, Victorian, Tasmanian and South Australian coastlines have great potential and the Danish figure of 10 per cent could be achieved here by 2005. This would create 8,000 direct and permanent jobs, which is equal to the entire work force employed by the pulp and paper industry, with thousands of additional jobs in the manufacturing phase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia could also gain enormous employment benefit from developing and exporting solar power generated electricity. Australia already leads the world in solar research and development, with several solar manufacturers already exporting a significant proportion of their production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The international demand for photovoltaic systems is increasing by 25 to 35 per cent annually. Again, we are world leaders in this technology. This market could be ours. A CSIRO study further found that the establishment of a solar power generation industry would create many manufacturing jobs in Australia, as the production of solar-thermal and photovoltaics routes is well within the capabilities of Australian industry. Conventional coal and gas power stations, however, require engineering development beyond these capabilities and that, of course, necessitates imports. A massive export market with a potential for widespread job creation is slipping through our fingers. A familiar story indeed!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The markets, both international and internal, that are being created by environmental policies should not be underestimated. According to the Worldwatch Institute, millions of jobs will be created in energy conservation, recycling and pollution control. In the United States, for example, there are twice as many people employed in the recycling of aluminium as there are in the actual primary production of it. Recycling may already be a bigger employer than coalmining. And the investment by North American companies in pollution control was estimated to have created 166,000 jobs in 1985 in the US alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a global scale, the market for environmental products and services by the year 2000 is expected to be between $US300 billion and $US400 billion. Just think of the employment generation that could involve. Yet the Australian Trade Commission estimates that our share of that market will be 0.1 per cent. We must target government assistance to develop local products which can get a bite of what will be a very jobs-rich cherry. In many cases, Australia has the technology and the potential in the area of environmental products and services just as it has in solar power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the field of waste minimisation and toxic waste control, which has created so many jobs in the United States, Australia has produced a number of initiatives. These include Sirofloc, which is used in sewage treatment; the CSIRO plasma furnace; membrane technology for liquid waste treatment; and waste recycling and destruction technologies being developed by Neutralite and CSIRO-Siddons Ramsett. I mention also Memtec, the magnificent Australian company which is involved in the purification of water. It announced yesterday that it is now recognised as the world leader in the area. Let us hope that we keep Memtec in Australia and let us hope that we can use its wonderful work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Outside of manufacturing and construction, there are many other areas in which our environment could be preserved while offering employment possibilities. A major one is tourism, particularly eco-tourism. Tourism is the largest industry in the world, achieving a growth rate of 8 per cent. Opening Tourism House in Canberra on 29 April this year, the Minister for Tourism (Mr Griffiths) praised the role of tourism saying, `Tourism is now recognised as a key industry, a "fair dinkum" industry and a strong contributor to the national economy'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eco-tourism is growing at an even more impressive rate&mdash;a massive 30 per cent per annum. It has the potential to be an even greater contributor. Australia, with its famous natural wonders, could become a major eco-tourist destination. Some areas have already shown how beneficial it can be. The Resource Assessment Commission detailed how protected rainforests in the New England region attract 200,000 visitors a year, providing the community with $1.7m a year and supporting 58 full time jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A familiar cry is that meeting international requirements in areas such as the cutting of greenhouse gas emissions will cost jobs when exactly the opposite is true. A recent study in Victoria showed that using clean and efficient energy to achieve a 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2005 will lead to the creation of 17,300 jobs by that date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of public transport and the upgrading of rail systems would undoubtedly be of environmental benefit due to a reduction in CO(2) emissions. One can imagine the number of jobs that would be provided, both in the creation of infrastructure and in permanent jobs such as those for drivers and conductors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other side of the coin, the job growth of many traditional industries is vastly overrated. When one considers the claims by those proposing the pulp and paper mill in Tasmania, one would think that they were offering the answer to Australia's employment problem. Yet those mills using conventional kraft chlorine bleaching processes are capital intensive, computer automated operations. The number of jobs will significantly decrease very quickly in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While employment in conventional pulp and paper mills can only decrease, the 8,000 workers in wind farms that I referred to earlier could account for only 10 per cent of our electricity needs. Honourable members can see the potential. I do not have the time to go into the many other areas in which jobs are created, but I hope that I have given honourable members reason to think that it is not a question of jobs versus the environment. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Our pensioners and our self-funded retirees are ignored and forced to count their pennies. Our families cannot get affordable child-care. Scores of young people are turned away from university and TAFE.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people are the hardest hit by the recession. But in a sense, we are all victims&mdash;victims of a Labor Government which is more concerned with preserving its own power than improving the economy. Labor mates have grown comfy in Canberra, assigned themselves all sorts of perks and closeted themselves from the suffering that is the real Labor legacy&mdash;the real 100th birthday gift from the Labor Party to all Australians&mdash;namely, the worst recession in 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The human costs in the inner west of the cruel, cold-blooded economics of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his mates cannot be measured. The Prime Minister cannot measure the tragedy of a family that splits up because dad cannot cope with the pressures of being out of work for months. The Prime Minister cannot put a meter on the shattered dreams of a bright young person cheated of an education because of Federal Labor Government quotas. The Prime Minister cannot count up the frustration of a talented young mum who cannot work because child-care is beyond her means. The Prime Minister cannot make a statistic of the pain of the aged pensioner who is forced to wait for months or years on a public hospital waiting list for a hip replacement or cataract surgery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, I challenge the Prime Minister and his colleagues to get out from behind their Canberra desks, put down their computer print-outs and calculators and come to the inner west to see the real suffering that the Labor policies have inflicted upon a real community in a real world. If a Labor Prime Minister came to the inner west he would realise the total failure of Labor in the inner west where one in three young people is out of work. The Prime Minister would see that Labor has done nothing to create jobs in the midst of Australia's worst recession in 60 years. Or perhaps the Prime Minister could blow the cobwebs off his deputy and send him along to our community. After all, the inner west has been unfairly subjected to untold health system blunders by the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hospital funding in New South Wales is down by hundreds of millions of dollars. The Minister has rejected, without even a moment's consideration, my proposal for a new high-tech hospital for the inner west and consigned our residents to outdated health services. In addition, the Minister's bureaucrats will not allow Homebush West to have its own pharmacy; they are content to have senior citizens walk across desolate industrial yards for their scripts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that politicians must listen to ordinary people and come up with commonsense solutions for unemployment and the huge taxes every Australian is forced to pay. As every community group meeting tells me, we must cut the taxes of people in the inner west and give them an opportunity to save and to spend. More saving and investing means more jobs. Fightback gets rid of seven separate taxes and takes a huge chunk out of personal income tax.

They also do a great job in looking after their community. They should be warmly commended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me also mention Reverend Bill Crews and his team at the Ashfield Uniting Church. This has become one of the great centres for caring for the homeless, in particular the homeless youth, in our community. It is the largest centre of its type in the inner west. It has a number of programs that keep kids away from the drug culture, that give them some chance of a start in life. Without them, a lot of kids in our community would be even worse than they are now. I thank God for their care, involvement and hard work. Let me take this opportunity to welcome the Reverend Mautofu Fuimaono-Samuelu to our community. He is a recently inducted minister at that church.

This is a group which in many ways has been neglected by the Government. I am delighted to say that in Fightback they will get many benefits which will indicate the true concern that we, on this side of the House, have for their benefits and welfare&mdash;not least of these is the improved health system which they will get under a coalition government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today is Holocaust Remembrance Day. Those members of parliament who have visited Israel will know that the Holocaust museum, Yad Vashem, commemorates the terrible events surrounding the Jewish Holocaust. There is also a museum in the Jewish Centre of my electorate that commemorates those horrific events. On this day names of Holocaust victims will be read out. That will take place at the Forrest Plaza in Perth today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is appropriate that we do not lose our sense of perspective and vigilance in relation to the sufferings of the Jewish community. I also note that there is clearly now a campaign by the Australian League of Rights to deny the circumstances of the Holocaust. Unfortunately, I see that this is also being linked with the movement towards the view about one world government&mdash;this new order&mdash;which I find very unfortunate because at the base one cannot deny the suffering of the Jewish people. Some people now begin to see the world in terms of Jewish conspiracies and also try to deny some historical facts that surround the horrible experience of the Jews under the Nazis during World War II. As I note, the Australian League of Rights is again moving in the Australian community. I find that very unfortunate because at the base its members are, among many things, anti-semitic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also gives me the opportunity to mention that the sheikh of the Lakemba Mosque in Sydney, Sheikh Imam Hilaly, did make some remarks in the past that were seen by the Jewish community as anti-Jewish, anti-Zionist and racist. I will not go to the full text because it is not the purpose of this speech to raise the heat on the issue, but rather to say that I believe the time has arisen when it would be appropriate for Imam Hilaly to seek a reconciliation with the Jewish people through the form of an apology for the remarks that are in that speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do so because it is interesting to note that on 30 March of this year was the 500th anniversary of the edict of Isabella and Ferdinand of Spain that expelled the Jewish people from Spain. On the 500th anniversary, the King and Queen of Spain for the first time attended a synagogue. That was clearly an exercise in reconciliation. I believe that we in Australia would benefit from an exercise in reconciliation between the Jewish people and Imam Hilaly. I believe the Imam Hilaly will at one stage wish to attain Australian citizenship. I would have thought that Australian citizenship should be based upon a recognition that one ought not to be a racist. I hope and feel that he would want to disown the remarks that he made in 1988. But I do have to say on behalf of the Jewish community that I believe an apology for those remarks would be very helpful for healing relations between the Jewish community and the members of the Imam's community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move now to another matter, the question of television rights.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was much better under Channel 10 and certainly much better under Channel 2. I thank my colleagues for their remarks. Why should it be that a television station can acquire the rights to a sporting event and then not properly exercise those rights. We find that it is terrible in country areas. We had this trouble in the past when people were actually denied access to the Melbourne Cup coverage. In the old days when the ABC had some money, it used to provide the coverage of those sporting events and so we found that people in country as well as metropolitan areas got coverage. We find that those rights are now being purchased, but not exercised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members may remember a time when they could stay at home and watch on television world title fights involving people such as Jeff Fenech. But no more, because now, if we choose to watch such fights, we have to take our families to somewhere like the Burswood Casino in Perth to watch a fight of that nature or to watch some other major event. I believe that we ought to make it a condition of sporting rights that when those rights are acquired, if they are not exercised they are forfeited and that those rights ought to be made available at a residual price to another television network so that the public at large can still be able to enjoy the benefits of that sporting coverage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I make this speech is because we are now on the verge of looking at pay television. If the same thing happened with pay television and a channel acquired the rights and decided that it would show, for example, the New South Wales Rugby League Grand Final or the State of Origin games or the AFL grand final at some late hour of the night, the public at large would have no recourse and there would be very little opportunity to exact a market penalty. I believe that we need to write in provisions that where those rights are not exercised, those rights are forfeited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Perth, there was a very considerable coverage of rugby league by Channel 10&mdash;and certainly Channel 2 continues to provide an excellent coverage&mdash;but now it has virtually disappeared off the television screen. The industry is suffering because the rights being held by Channel 9 are not being properly exercised. Frankly, when I have raised this issue its responses have been quite inadequate. I believe that ought to be the position we take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to raise another issue that I previously raised in this place and that is this program on Channel 10 called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Studs</EMPHASIS>. It is simply a salacious, cheap exploitation of women. It ought not to be on television. It is a disgraceful program. I do not say that because I am particularly morally offended by it; I just find it is cheap. The fact that it comes from the United States means it has absolutely no redeeming quality because there is no employment generated for Australians even so. But it is just a cheap, salacious exploitation of women and it is on at prime time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it were buried away like some of the other grubby pieces of television late at night, I would not feel so concerned. But at prime time I believe it to be a cheap, salacious exploitation of women. I say to Channel 10, `It is time that you took it off the air. If this is what your financial difficulties have created, then we really have to wonder where Channel 10 is headed'. The Australian public is not served by a program that is so degrading of women. It is time for this to be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to one other matter that is on the horizon; that is, the likelihood of some Chinese refugees coming to Australia. We are informed that there is a boatload of people heading towards the north-west coast of Western Australia. The current predicament with the Cambodian refugees causes me great concern. It has been a lawyers' field day. The Australian community is impatient with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian community believes, as members in this Parliament believe, that there are opportunities for people to come to Australia through the orderly process. There are cases of genuine refugee hardship in which the Australian community&mdash;and this is a bipartisan matter&mdash;says, `You, as members of Parliament, should have a refugee program'. But to have people engaging in what is now a process of exploiting the Australian system&mdash;and the legal aid system&mdash;is unacceptable. When I heard the latest news item, my first response was, `I wonder who the lawyers are going to be to represent these people when they land in Australia?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One does not want to be inhumane about the issue, but I want to say, on behalf of the Australian community, that it is unacceptable that we have a process which is so longwinded and allows people to take advantage of what turns out to be our hospitality in the name of refugees, when there would be many other refugees around the world with very genuine cases to put before us. We need to be much more vigilant about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that we should be simply open armed in being prepared to accept these people into Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. This table highlights how detrimental these costs are. If one compares an Australian wool carpet manufacturer with a New Zealand wool carpet manufacturer, the table shows that, on just about every indicator one can look at&mdash;whether it be annual leave, public holidays, sick leave, rostered days off, annual leave loading of 17 1/2 per cent, shift premiums, long service leave, payroll tax, workers compensation, productivity superannuation and so on&mdash;New Zealand has a lower figure, or a zero figure. For example, New Zealand does not have payroll tax. The wage on-costs in Australia for a wool carpet manufacturer are 51.5 per cent; in New Zealand, the figure is 13.6 per cent. In other words, New Zealand wool carpet manufacturers are working at an advantage over us of 300 or 400 per cent on their wage on-costs. That translates into costs to the employer of about $4,500 per employee per year. How can we compete against that?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The upshot of all of this is that it raises the cost of living within Australia, which means ultimately a lower standard of living for us all. It makes Australia uncompetitive with the rest of world. Other countries can, in effect, produce their goods cheaper than us and undercut us. For example, in China textile factories pay wages of $1,000 to $1,500 a year. Employees are prepared to work 12 hours a day, six days a week in some cases. If they can get their machinery to a half decent level&mdash;because productivity is what it is all about&mdash;they can undercut us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am alarmed to hear that the textile side of Pacific Dunlop Ltd is thinking of moving to China. Unfortunately, the Government seems oblivious to this. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was overseas tugging his forelock in Indonesia recently.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compare a First World country such as New Zealand with Australia. There is a firm in New Zealand called Feltex, which is owned by BTR Nylex. In many cases, its employees are working three shifts a day seven days a week, compared with our employees, who are working one shift a day five days a week. Feltex is now substantially undercutting Australian firms. On top of that, we have a $A1 to $NZ1.40 exchange rate to compete with, as well as the wage on-costs differences which I have already highlighted, that makes it very difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the CER agreement between Australia and New Zealand, which I strongly support, there is not a 32.5 per cent tariff on carpets.

The contract to lay 70,000 square metres of carpet in this Parliament back in 1985-86 was worth $4.8m and involved the use of 150,000 kilograms of wool. Apart from Australian made carpet for the Prime Minister's suite and a couple of other token areas, Feltex New Zealand was successful in getting that contract, and Australian producers and firms were denied the opportunity to supply our very own Parliament with Australia's number one product.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is all from Tasmania, as the honourable member says. Australia has carpet manufacturers such as Invicta, Godfrey Hirst, United Carpet Mills, Minster, Homfray Hycraft, Victoria Carpet Co., Brintons and Pacific Textiles. I will highlight one of the tufted carpet manufacturers, the Victoria Carpet Company. Ninety-five per cent of Australian carpet manufactured is tufted carpet. It is low in labour cost. The Victoria Carpet Co. uses about 100,000 kilograms of wool a month. It sources its wool product from Albany in Western Australia, Geelong and New Zealand&mdash;New Zealand wool is becoming more competitive. Wool spinning is very labour intensive. With these on-cost advantages that I was talking about earlier, New Zealand is starting to undercut the Australian mills and that is a great shame indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growers are also affected. We have 30,000 woolgrowers in Australia who produce crossbred type wool from 25 to 40 microns, who produce wool suitable for interior textile design in carpets, bedding products, doonas, bats, upholstery, fabrics, curtains and so on. Each grower has an average size clip of only 17 bales compared with the merino grower's 110 bales, but it is, nevertheless, a significant industry. If that wool is sold in Australia for use in Australia it helps put a floor in the market in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the three minutes that are left I want to talk very briefly about the benefits of the zero inflation rate that was announced yesterday. That is really quite a remarkable achievement at a time when the whole world has an inflation problem. It is remarkable that Australia's position has moved to the point where in the first three months of this year there was no average movement in prices at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are great benefits from that zero inflation rate. The most obvious is that people have a greater sense of security. One of the goals of the Government's economic policy is stable prices. People want the security of knowing when they go to shops or when they buy petrol or whatever that they will have a predictable price to pay. Zero inflation does not mean that every price is stable; it just means that on average there has been no upward or downward movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is of benefit in creating a sense of security. Perhaps more importantly than that, it is of great benefit to us as we try to build up our exports. Prices in most of the rest of the world are rising, sometimes quite strongly. If we can keep our inflation rate stable then the price of our exports will not be going up and that means that we will have a greater capacity to export effectively. In other words, Australia's economy becomes a more competitive economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are good reasons why prices are stable. The principal reason is not that there is a recession but that for the last seven or eight years there has been an extraordinary level of wage restraint. The prices and incomes policy, the Accord, has been effective in restraining wages in an unprecedented way in Australia. That has gradually fed through into prices, so that prices too are now stable. It is also partly due to the fact that the economy is recessed and therefore the demand is not as high for commodities. There is no doubt that the principal influence has been the restraint on wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another benefit is that this allows the Government greater scope for expansionary policies in the Budget. It is essential that, at a time of high unemployment, fiscal policy be as expansionary as possible. With stable prices there is greater scope for stimulatory policies which will lead on to faster growth of employment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If indexation on British 1990 estimates were paid, an additional #141m or over $330m would be coming into this country. Not only would this have a positive effect on the balance of payments; it would also have a marked effect on Budget revenue and expenditure. There would be reductions in Australian income support, payments made and also the benefits from higher income tax receipts. It is obvious that Britain is not only ripping off its former residents; it is also ripping off the people of Australia. At least half of that $330m would have gone into the public purse. </PARA>

Who does the honourable member for Hinkler imagine pays for the diesel that is used by all the trains that are used to cart the crane to the factory, that is consumed by the factory, or pays the payroll tax incurred by the mill workers?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did notice the comments of the Leader of the Opposition when he went to New Zealand to disparage his country. He has got himself into this habit of constantly attacking this country both here and abroad, denigrating it, running it down, pretending it does not have the strengths that it does, and not being prepared to recognise the great strengths which have been emerging, and will continue to emerge, from the hard work of Australian working men and women who recognise the challenge which Australia faces in becoming competitive and who have decided to work cooperatively to try to achieve a greater level of competitiveness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do they hear from the Leader of the Opposition? They hear this constant, nagging, narking criticism and abuse from him as he goes around the country and as he visits other countries in the world. This was particularly the case when he went to New Zealand the other day. The Minister for Social Security referred to another of his observations, which I will get to in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all of these criticisms the Leader of the Opposition simply ignores the normal standards of analysis and the normal standards of arithmetic accuracy. This is becoming a constant theme and a constant shortcoming of the Leader of the Opposition, despite his much flaunted education and his much flaunted claim of competency in these things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recall, of course, the observation made by the now Minister for Trade and Overseas Development when he referred to a speech by the Leader of the Opposition in Brisbane last year, in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the Treasury's own index of competitiveness today we are 15 per cent less competitive than we were in 1982-83 when the Hawke Government came to office.</PARA>
<PARA>As the then Treasurer pointed out to the Leader of the Opposition, to his eternal embarrassment and shame, a reduction in the index of competitiveness is, of course, an increase in the competitive position of Australia. A fall in that index denotes an improvement in competitiveness. What happened was, of course, that the Leader of the Opposition simply got the graph upside down; he was incapable of the normal standards of analysis and arithmetic accuracy which one would expect from anyone who makes such searingly critical comments about Australia and Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other day the Minister for Social Security pointed out another observation of the Leader of the Opposition when he was in New Zealand and when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . over 80 cents in every taxpayer's dollar goes to social security and welfare in Australia. That is, 80 cents of what you pay in tax goes to look after somebody else's family before you look after your own.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Social Security pointed out the absurdity of that particular proposition, to which the Leader of the Opposition put out an immediate riposte. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Dr Blewett was numerate he would understand that outlays on social security and welfare totalled $30 1/2 billion in 1990-91. In that same year net PAYE revenue was $37.6 billion. The former as a percentage of the latter is 81 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>And he goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is that the best Dr Blewett can manage?</PARA>
<PARA>This is an astonishing piece of fiscal analysis on the part of the Leader of the Opposition, because he assumes that the only funds going into social security and welfare are those which come from PAYE taxpayers&mdash;nothing from fuel tax, nothing from company tax and nothing from any of the other revenues which come into the Federal Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is even more absurd than that when you apply a bit of Fightback analysis to this arithmetic. On page 14 of Fightback it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will reduce PAYE tax by $13 billion in two phases.</PARA>
<PARA>And:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we will reduce expenditure in social security by $228m.</PARA>
<PARA>So let us apply a bit of Hewson arithmetic to this new equation. First of all, under Fightback we have social security and welfare outlays of $30 billion and net PAYE revenue of $24,000m. So what does this mean? It does not mean that we are spending 80c in the dollar on social security and welfare; we are spending $1.23 out of every dollar on social security and welfare!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this is the way in which the Leader of the Opposition intends to reduce the dependence of individuals on the welfare sector, by in fact increasing, on his own arithmetic absurdity, the amount coming from PAYE from 80c in the dollar to 123c in the dollar as a result of that. Of course, it is no wonder&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accord mark VI held wages at around 6 per cent in that boom when wage increases on offer were of the order of 12 to 15 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say this, Mr Speaker: the important thing about this announcement is that it reflects the active consultation with the industry. That is the important difference between our approach and the Opposition's in terms of addressing industry development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The details of the announcements go to both assistance and market development. It is proposed that there be a moratorium for a further 12 months on any reduction in market support. That is particularly to assist the situation in Victoria and Tasmania, which have been hard hit. There will be a phase-down in market support to the year 2000 in equal instalments, taking the market support equivalent protection from 22 per cent above export parity to 10 per cent above export parity. I should point out that this 10 per cent above export parity is the equivalent of and is consistent with the tariff target of 5 per cent for manufacturing industry. Importantly, it is a figure that has been achieved with the agreement of the industry. It is not a figure that was advocated by the IC, which the Opposition was locked into. Underwriting has been abolished, but the cheese tariff quota remains. The comfort clause has been abolished and there will be a further review and reorientation of structures to give this industry a more effective market development orientation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I want to give praise to the industry with whom I have negotiated this package of reforms. The ADIC represents both producers as well as processors and therefore is an important body because it involves more than just the grower end of the market. It had to negotiate this in difficult circumstances. Not only did the ADIC have an IC report which it could not live with&mdash;members of the coalition could because they were committed to introducing it&mdash;but also it had to cope with the disciplines associated with our position in the GATT and a constituency that was arguing for the retention of the status quo. But against that background, I challenged it to come forward with a forward looking strategy that would secure the industry and make it grow. The ADIC has responded. I sat down with it and we negotiated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the outcome does demonstrate what can be achieved through consultation&mdash;against the background, perhaps, of an IC report but where the outcome is reached in consultation with the industry. It is the same commitment I have made earlier this week in this House in relation to the sugar industry, and it is one behind which this Government firmly stands. But the point that also needs to be underscored is that this outcome for the industry could not have been achieved by the coalition, because it is locked into Fightback which proposes the elimination of tariffs and the adoption of the IC report. There is no flexibility in the Opposition's position at all, and that is why the National Party, in particular, has found itself in such great difficulties within its own constituency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We hear a lot of mock concern from the National Party in this House about a constituency which it claims to be concerned about. The other day a press release from the Deputy Leader of the National Party said he was worried about the time that was being taken to settle the dairy industry package because it would not allow time for debate here. The reality is that the real debate takes place with industry, not with you mob in this place, because so far as the industry is concerned&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>That is a great margin and great leadership. I conclude by simply making this point: there is a stark difference to our approach to sensible industry development for key industries in this country to grow in the future. It is one that involves consultation; it will have regard to the economic rigour, but it will have sensible regard. It will not be driven by the ideological fervour that the Opposition has been locked into&mdash;the National Party in particular now reluctantly realising that it has been locked into it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Corio referred to job losses in Geelong caused by the relocation offshore of some TCF factories. Labour costs in some Asian countries are much lower than they are in Australia. We would not be competitive, in labour terms, whatever level of protection was provided. In the restructuring process it is important that TCF firms focus on areas or sectors in which we can compete&mdash;sectors in which fashion, market responsiveness and design, for example, can give us a competitive edge. In Geelong there are future opportunities, for example, for manufacturers of carpet using Australian raw materials and focusing on export as well as on domestic markets.</PARA>

The phase-down in tariff protection announced in March last year will end with tariffs for TCF ranging from 10 to 25 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;and the bottom of the harbour schemes, if you like. It took some belated action on the part of the honourable member for Bennelong and a consistent attempt by this Government to try to bring back and restore the integrity of the taxation system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth reminding ourselves that, as we endeavoured to improve the integrity of the taxation system, almost every measure was opposed by those opposite. They opposed our early attempts, which were mostly successful, to close off those tax avoidance opportunities; they opposed the introduction of the fringe benefits tax; they opposed the introduction of the capital gains tax; and only very reluctantly and belatedly did they support the introduction of the tax file number system in order to provide for greater integrity in the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now these people, who not only oversaw the damage done to the taxation system but then resisted our attempts to restore its integrity, are now pretending to be the champions of the elimination of the black economy. Indeed, they even claim in their proposals that there will be a net benefit to revenue of some hundreds of millions of dollars. They have squirmed and complained when the Taxation Office has said that that is a fallacious claim and that that amount of money should not be included in the arithmetic&mdash;in any event their inaccurate arithmetic&mdash;of their particular proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is it that the Tax Office and the Treasury have said that this is a fallacious claim?  It is because there is a wealth of expert advice to suggest that the GST can do nothing to deal with the alleged problem that the Opposition is trying to deal with. As Professor Head said last year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In basic structural terms the GST simply fails to address the black economy issue. The same tax-evading tradesmen who fall outside the income tax net would likewise evade GST.</PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, the IMF, which has been a prime advocate of GSTs and VATs in its pronouncements, said this in 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In general terms neither the RST (Retail Sales Tax) nor the VAT can tax the unofficial or black economy.</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition's own documents include a paper from the Victorian Employers Federation which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both systems (a Retail Sales Tax and a Value-Added Tax) miss the cash, underground or black economy. Both the RST and VAT are subject to some tax evasion and avoidance.</PARA>
<PARA>What we would actually see as a result of this great money laundering scheme which the Opposition proposes to introduce&mdash;this $40 billion switch in relation to revenue&mdash;is a massive distraction for the Australian Taxation Office. It would be distracted from its legitimate task of systematically closing off those remaining opportunities which might exist in the tax system. Indeed, in Mrs Thatcher's own experience, during the period when she was introducing a value added tax the black economy&mdash;</PARA>

During that period, of course, the extent of black economy operations actually increased in Britain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not leave the matter there, because even in the Fightback document Opposition members record the international experience of the black economy in a number of economies around the world. In this very revealing document where they try to portray some relationship between the existence of a value added tax and the size of the black economy, we actually find that in the two economies where the black economy is allegedly least or smallest&mdash;that is, in Switzerland and the United States&mdash;there is no VAT, yet in Belgium, where there is a value added tax, we find the largest black economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So even on the basis of the Opposition's own documentation the Victorian Employers Federation says that a GST cannot eliminate the black economy, and in terms of the Opposition's international comparisons, it has not been done. This is just another example of the fallacious and deceptive claims which are being portrayed by the Leader of the Opposition and his ilk as they go around and try to deceive the people of Australia. It is no wonder that there is a perception abroad that not only is this man dull and boring, but also he cannot be believed and cannot be understood.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Resources. It concerns the automotive LPG industry. What is the attitude of the Government to the use of LPG as an alternative fuel for vehicles, and what are the prospects for industry growth?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2149" SPEAKER="Griffiths The Hon A.G." NAMEID="0H4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="MARIBYRNONG" MINISTERIAL="TOURISM; RESOURCES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0H4">Mr GRIFFITHS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the last decade the Government has consistently supported the use of LPG as an alternative transport fuel by ensuring that LPG was not subject to product excise. This has meant that LPG has sold for about half the price of petrol and has therefore been an attractive alternative fuel for motorists in this country. As a result of this approach, the industry has grown by 15 per cent a year over the last decade, so that it now accounts for over 4 per cent of vehicle fuel needs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Well over 100,000 Australians use LPG in their vehicles and there are over 1,200 outlets for LPG supply. There are, of course, many hundreds of small businesses prospering by converting vehicles to use LPG. Accordingly, a thriving industry has been created under Labor, using wholly locally produced product and, in the process, replacing the need to import some $130m worth of oil every year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, of course, it probably goes without saying that there are considerable environmental benefits from the use of LPG, particularly in our major urban centres, as a consequence of reduced emissions of greenhouse gases. This consistent and long term approach, which, I might say, included the very successful deregulation of LPG last year, stands in stark contrast to the Opposition's approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would think that, in terms of the goods and services tax package, the Opposition's policy had not been thought through, because what will pertain in the unlikely event of these policies being implemented is that the relative differential between LPG and petrol will be abolished.</PARA>

If the Leader of the Opposition has sufficient regard for the former shadow Minister for trade, and now shadow Minister for the defence of the realm, the honourable member for Mayo, he must have some regard for his judgment. What is the honourable member for Mayo's view about this policy? When asked on radio in Adelaide recently whether the industry would be snuffed out by the GST, the honourable member for Mayo said, `That would be right'. He also said, `Anyone converting to LPG under the Opposition would be "crazy"'. In terms of the problems that would be created, he went on to say, just to top it off&mdash;and I must say that I checked the transcript because even I did not believe a shadow Minister would have responded in this way&mdash;`We haven't made up our minds how to do it'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summation, there will be a clear and adverse impact on the LPG industry, particularly the converting component of it.

The Opposition has encouraged a policy that is conceded by one of its now senior front bench members to be a `crazy' policy.</PARA>

The New South Wales Government's version of privatisation is not based on not for profit organisations and their takeover control of public hospitals; rather it involves the control or handing over of control to private groups accountable to investors and not to patients.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thirdly, that there is quality of access to health services. The honourable member for Lowe would have a particular interest because, as those with a political memory around this House will recall, prior to the last election the then Health Minister of New South Wales, Mr Collins, visited Port Macquarie and promised a public hospital at a cost of an estimated $80m. Subsequently, he was replaced by a different Minister and that Minister has effectively replaced that commitment from an $80m public hospital to a private hospital.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Lowe, in terms of his electorate, is currently campaigning for, and circulating a petition to construct, a high technology public hospital in an area which is already heavily overburdened. The implication is quite clearly that the honourable member for Lowe has in mind that, if there should be such a hospital, it would involve private capital for profit and the closure of public beds in that electorate. In terms of what we are speaking about, the honourable member for Lowe has a very keen interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very doubtful that transferring public hospitals to the private sector involves any benefit in relation to the principles that I have referred to. What is obvious is that private operators base decisions on the profit motive and there is no control over service quality or the necessity of treatment. The bottom line of profits is hardly the basis on which health decisions should be made. Experience elsewhere shows that high-tech specialist services in these circumstances flourish at the expense of services such as maternity and casualty, which are far less profitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public access can be assured only by giving private proprietors very generous deals. The New South Wales Government deal in Port Macquarie is a testament to this. Although New South Wales will not release full details of the deal, it is clear that it will cost taxpayers at least 10 per cent more than any other public hospital service in New South Wales. I remind honourable members that the cost of a public hospital bed in New South Wales is substantially higher than that in any other State. These beds, subsidised effectively by the public sector, will turn out to be the most expensive beds in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One ought not to have any illusions about the course of privatisation. It is essentially about the subsidisation of private profits. It means less accountability in terms of public money. It means a poorer quality service. It means, for those who are sick or potentially ill, insecurity where currently there is security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the honourable member for Phillip for her question. I understand the concern, particularly in rural areas in New South Wales, and I indicate in terms of this Government's approach that we certainly will not be subsidising private profits in terms of health services. We are about client services and accountability. The honourable member for Lowe says that I am obsessed with costs. What he is concerned about is pork-barrelling in his own electorate where, ultimately, taxpayers would pay for private services.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, my question to you relates to the length of answers given by Ministers at Question Time. You will be aware that during the period of the Fraser Government the average number of questions asked per day exceeded 16 and the average length of answers given was approximately three minutes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 31 March I asked you, Mr Speaker, in response to your repeated assertion that you do not have the power under the Standing Orders to require Ministers to limit the length of their answers to questions, whether Mr A.R. Browning, when Clerk of the House, advised you that the Speaker has unlimited power if the Standing Orders and the practices of the House as to the power of the Speaker at Question Time were silent. On that occasion you undertook to look at whether Mr Browning did advise you along those lines. I wonder whether you are now in a position to give advice to the House in regard to that matter.</PARA>

But I must say that I do not think the honourable member for Hume would suggest that it would be a sensible precedent for the Speaker to start opening his files of correspondence from members or from officials. I might say to the honourable member for Hume that in the House the Clerks can offer advice, but the House is the final arbiter of these things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On two occasions in recent years honourable members have put forward propositions that we should limit the time of answers. The honourable member for Dawson did, as did the former honourable member for Oxley, Mr Hayden. On both occasions, under separate governments, the House did not debate or deal with those two propositions. I also recall that there is a report from the Standing Committee on Procedure, which also suggests a mechanism for Question Time which has also not been dealt with by the House. The only advice the Speaker can draw from the opinions of the House is that it does not wish to have those limitations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both I and my predecessors have frequently said&mdash;it does not matter how often the honourable member for Hume gets up to try to coerce me differently&mdash;that, unless the House makes some other determination, the Speaker is not really in a position to be able to put time limits on Ministers' answers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A significant component of any nation's science and technology base is its system of major national research facilities. Australia currently has six such research facilities, including the Australian Telescope, the Oceanographic Research Vessel <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Franklin</EMPHASIS>, and the Australian Animal Health Laboratory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Major advances in science and technology increasingly depend on research workers having access to the type of complex and expensive equipment contained in these facilities. However, their high cost in terms of both establishment and maintenance is often beyond the resources of individual institutions. In response to a request from the then Prime Minister, ASTEC investigated this issue and produced what is a very important report. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Major National Research Facilities: A National Program</EMPHASIS> recommends that a program of major national research facilities be established. This would provide for the consideration of new major research facilities proposals, phasing-out of facilities that no longer satisfy national needs and priorities, and access to major research facilities overseas where such access is an appropriate alternative to the creation of an Australia-based facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of its report, ASTEC established assessment criteria to enable proposals for funding to be judged in terms of their benefits to science and technology and to the nation. Using the Council's criteria, the report lists some 15 likely candidates for major facilities over the next five to 10 years. Among these proposed facilities is an upgrade of the Australia Telescope, a new marine geoscience research vessel, a mining materials research facility and a tropical marine research network. The ASTEC report notes that a further process of rigorous evaluation will be necessary before any decision can be made to proceed with any of these. I must emphasise this point. Any hasty decisions on new facilities would be inimical to the spirit of the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, honourable members will note that one of the facilities recommended for further investigation is a new hi-flux research reactor to replace the existing reactor at Lucas Heights. No decision will be taken on the establishment of such a facility without an inquiry process consistent with the decision of last year's ALP National Conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Major National Research Facilities: A National Program</EMPHASIS> is in many ways a landmark report. It recognises that major national research facilities are too important for decisions to be made on an ad hoc basis. It recognises that Australia's future need for national research facilities must be planned as an integral part of our national research and technology priority setting process. ASTEC has produced a valuable report which will enable us to establish procedures for assessing the relative benefits to Australia of proposals for major national research facilities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition raises this matter today out of very genuine concern about the fact that almost through the entire period since our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) assumed that office he has run one diversionary tactic after another in order to divert attention from the very real pain and hardship that are being suffered and will continue to be suffered under his policies as a result of the recession that he inflicted on this country and his inability to develop an effective policy response to what is the deepest recession in Australia in 60 years. This has particularly come to light in recent days as major government decisions go by and opportunities are lost, as in relation to resource security, to actually get genuine development in the form of a pulp mill in northern Tasmania; or, as was in the news today, the major closures of three plants by the Edgell-Birds Eye group, which is going to result in the loss of hundreds of jobs, both full and part time jobs, again, as we see from the announcements of that company, due to the failure of his Government to put in place the appropriate policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that flabbergast most Australians, the one thing that they probably find harder to understand at the present time than almost anything else, is why Australia imports food when it is wealthy in terms of its agricultural capabilities and its range of agricultural products. That is the most amazing thing to most Australians when they go to the shelves in the shops and stores. It is not just in the canned goods area but right across the board. More recently we have seen it in terms of items as basic as tomatoes. They cannot understand why these items are dumped into this country to the detriment of our industry. It is a tragedy in particular, I believe, because if we had to pick an industry which really has enormous potential in Australia and can really get up and go and contribute hundreds and thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of exports and so on, it is the food processing industry. The average Australian has considerable trouble not only understanding why the Prime Minister runs around belting the Brits, manhandling the Queen, attacking the flag, distorting our history and so on, but also understanding why he cannot put in place a basic set of policies which would allow us to become a major exporter in processed food, as we should, of course, in view of the capability that is there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is most instructive, if we look, for example, at the work of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce and its estimate that the processed food deficit could reach as high as $2 billion through the period to the year 2002 under the sorts of policies that this Government is following. There could be further significant losses in investment as businesses are moved offshore and markets are lost offshore and we could end up with a $2 billion deficit by the year 2002 under the sorts of policies that this Government is pursuing. Yet, if we were to put our house in order, if we were to make the policy changes that are identified in Fightback, we could see that industry boom and we could have a $4.5 billion surplus in processed food by the year 2002. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the choice is, under this Government, a deficit, on its numbers, of about $2 billion, or a surplus of approximately $4.5 billion if we take the potential that is there just in the Asia-Pacific region to develop an effective food processing industry. It is interesting to note that the growth rate of processed food consumption in Asia has averaged 22.2 per cent in nominal terms and 18 per cent in real terms. There has been an 18 per cent growth in real terms in the consumption of food in Asia in the last four years. On that basis, the market for Australia&mdash;which is presently $20 billion&mdash;could go to $150 billion in the period to the year 2002. That is a 700- or 800-percentage point increase in the size of that market, if the right policies are put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian exports of highly processed foods grew at only 7 1/2 per cent in nominal terms over the past decade, compared with over 13 per cent growth in manufactured exports across the board. If between now and the year 2002 we could achieve that 18 per cent growth that we have seen in the Asian area in recent years&mdash;if we could just match the growth in demand&mdash;an industry that under this Government's policies will go into deficit by $2 billion could contribute a $2 1/2 billion surplus as a result of its development. That is the tragedy surrounding the people at Edgell in Cowra and the other places where those plants are closing. They cannot understand how their plant has to shrink in an industry with phenomenal potential. The answer is very simple: this Government cannot deliver&mdash;it will not even contemplate delivering&mdash;the reforms that are necessary to give that industry a fair chance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought some of the material that was released by Pacific Dunlop, which is responsible for the Edgell group, was particularly instructive. The Boston Consulting Group, which has done a careful study of the competitive problems of the Australian food processing industry, has presented some pretty alarming details of just how uncompetitive that industry, with all its potential, has become under this Government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look, for example, at the cost of raw materials&mdash;that is, the price into the factory&mdash;in the food processing industry. For potatoes, costs in Australia are 100 per cent higher than those in the United States. For tomatoes and green peas, our costs are 65 per cent higher than those in New Zealand. For sweet corn, they are 50 per cent higher than those in the United States and New Zealand. That is just on the input costs. We can see the tremendous advantage of a goods and services tax in its being able to reduce the input costs of a major industry such as the food processing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other major cost disadvantages in Australia have been identified at the manufacturing stage of the food processing industry: obsolete technology, inadequate product development, plant commonly operating at only 30 per cent of capacity, a poor industrial record, outdated work practices, and shift penalties that make more than one or two shifts totally uneconomic. This study provides some very detailed information on some of those disadvantages, such as the cost of Saturday and Sunday work. The loadings paid for additional work in Australia are unbelievable compared with the loadings that are paid in the same industry in other parts of the world. We can see the tremendous benefits of our labour market reform policy for genuine enterprise bargaining to eliminate those labour market cost disadvantages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Packaging is another element of cost. In the food processing industry in Australia, a can costs 40 per cent more than it does in Europe. In Australia, board costs&mdash;that is, packaging, or cardboard, costs&mdash;are 44 per cent higher than they are in the United States. There are massive cost disadvantages as we package the product and try to get it out to market. Then we have domestic transportation costs. For example, grain transport costs in Australia&mdash;that is, internal transport costs&mdash;are double those in the United States and the United Kingdom for the same distance. We can see the tremendous cost advantages that would flow to domestic transport and the food processing industry from the abolition of petrol tax under the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To take our goods offshore, international freight costs are involved. In the food processing industry, for example, shipping costs to Tokyo from Sydney are 22 per cent higher than those over a comparable distance to Tokyo from the United States. From Tasmania they are 68 per cent higher. Why? It is because we have this process of cabotage on the waterfront. We have to put the goods on an overmanned, cost-inefficient domestic ship to bring them from Tasmania to Sydney and then transfer them to an international ship. We are paying away all the cost advantages that we ought to have in an industry such as the food processing industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at ship turnaround times in Australian ports, it takes three times as long to turn a ship around than it does in Osaka, as an example in relation to the food processing industry. Container dwell times&mdash;that is, the time a container sits on the waterfront&mdash;are 20 times longer in Melbourne than in Singapore. The Government talks about waterfront reform. In comparison, look at the advantages that would flow out of the Fightback package for shipping and waterfront reform in terms of baseline cost advantages to this particular industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study also looks at government regulations, and the cost impacts of those, which are identified. It also looks at other things such as the differences in health standards and inefficient anti-dumping procedures, all of which are very important. But the bottom line conclusion is also very important:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tariffs on imported goods are not the solution. They will not help overcome the competitive problems identified here.</PARA>
<PARA>Here is an industry that has enormous potential. The food processing industry is an industry that a lot of people have focused on as having phenomenal potential. All those elements of cost are the result of either failed government policies, government taxes and charges or government intervention in this country that is stopping that industry from reaching its potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who have just lost their jobs up in Cowra and other parts of Australia as those plants have been closed down have absolutely no idea why the Prime Minister wanders all over the place denigrating their flag instead of looking after their jobs and dealing with those basic cost disadvantages. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was most instructive when one of the Asian leaders, Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore&mdash;someone who has no visible hang-ups, unlike our Prime Minister when he travels internationally, and who is very sure of his position and his country's position in the world&mdash;visited Australia in March last year. He did an interview with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper and the article on this interview states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But he believes there are certain industries where Australia has a natural advantage because of access to raw materials which would be viable if our industries became competitive.</PARA>
<PARA>He gives one particular example:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Your food processing industries are another area of comparative advantage. If you want to go in for it in a big way, you should not just export frozen meat, but processed foodstuffs like TV dinners and lunches ready for the microwave, and made to Asian tastes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Outside leaders can come and spend a few hours in Australia and readily identify&mdash;knowing their own experience internationally&mdash;the tremendous potential that exists for our food processing industry in their area. As Lee Kuan Yew is wont to do, he goes on and boasts:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`All these things are possible . . . Of all places, Singapore is doing this. Our companies prepare Chinese, Malay and Indian cuisine either canned or frozen.</PARA>
<PARA>They are hitting the market. They are filling the gap that we have lost but for which we have got all the potential. If one goes to Singapore, which is only about 20 miles long, one sees that there is not a lot of agricultural product there and that one would be struggling to find much that one could turn into a food processing industry as a base. Here we are, with the natural advantage of agriculture, the tremendous need in this nation to develop value adding activities so that we can actually start to pay our way in the world, reduce our international debt and create the million jobs that have been lost under this Government&mdash;and Singapore is taking our market away from us without any of those natural advantages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is that?  It is because Singapore goes out and deals with the problem. If it has a major problem in shipping costs, it builds not just a port but the most cost-effective port in the world. That is really what Fightback offers the Australian people. It offers in each of the areas that are identified in this document from Boston Consulting, and a range of others, a genuine basis on which an Australian industry such as food processing can become genuinely internationally competitive. There is no other way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One hears all this nonsense that we have heard in recent days about the tariff debate and how we have to have tariffs to grow up, to make the grade and all that sort of thing. I was also interested in another comment of Lee Kuan Yew:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"There is no other choice. It is the only way forward. The idea that Australians can hide behind a protective barrier, build up industrial muscle and compete against the world is an illusion", he says,</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. Let me give one indication of the cost on food inputs. Every one percentage change in the inflation rate costs each farmer approximately $1,200. Across agriculture as a whole&mdash;and we are, after all, talking about the food sector&mdash;one percentage increase in inflation costs that sector $200m. Surely that was a germane issue to put before the House in terms of the Leader of the Opposition's contribution? As I say, the sin of omission has the potential, if not the actual impact, of misleading people. But we would not want that, would we?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is accepted that the total impact of the GST on our international competitiveness will add in the order of 5 per cent to our inflation rate. We should remember that one percentage increase in inflation costs each farmer $1,200. When we multiply that by five, the result is $6,000 per farmer. For the total agricultural sector, if we multiply $200m by five, we are talking about big bickies. What has that got to do with competitiveness?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition talked about the waterfront. I will not go into great detail on the waterfront as I have addressed that issue here on other occasions. Let me give one example: in a press statement issued on 4 November the Australian Wheat Board described the improvements evidenced on the waterfront in this country as `spectacular'. Surely that is an organisation which can be accepted by members of this chamber as an independent arbiter or umpire, or as a commentator which does not have the tag of partisan political comment attached to its observations. The Australian Wheat Board was referring to turnaround times, and that is what the Leader of the Opposition adverted to in his comments. In quoting them as `spectacular', the Australian Wheat Board noted that since 1988-89 the time taken to turn grain vessels around at Australian ports had dropped from an average of 4.52 days to 2.4 days&mdash;almost a 50 per cent reduction. Importantly, that represents some $10m of savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go on and make further comments about that, but I will make just one observation. In terms of the Opposition policy for the waterfront, again the Opposition is on public record as indicating that it would call in the Army to resolve industrial relations disputes on the waterfront. For goodness sake! In the 1990s we are talking in this country about a fixed bayonet approach to industrial relations. That is going to get those opposite a long way indeed. Then of course the shadow Minister for industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) talked about a `big bang' theory of industrial relations. Before the next election people in Australia will have the opportunity of reflecting upon precisely what that terminology implies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What it implies of course is that the award protection system in this country will overnight be abolished. The theory is quite clear: strip away from everyone&mdash;the workers in this building, in factories, in the Public Service, in the shops, on the waterfront, in the aviation sector, in the hospitality industry&mdash;the legal award coverage that they have had in this country, in effect, since Federation. It is then `catch as catch can'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is being proposed by the Opposition under the heading of industrial relations reform is to so turn around the power relationships between employees and employers as to effectively strip away any protection that employees have. A week or so ago I was in New Zealand, perchance on the same day as the Leader of the Opposition visited New Zealand. The situation in New Zealand is instructive I think for anyone in this country. I spoke to a young man who I happened to pick up, believe it or not, hitchhiking. I asked him what industry he worked in, he told me, I asked him how long he had worked in it, he said, `About six months'. I asked, `Are you covered by a trade union?'. He said, `No. It is a bit risky. I would be sacked on the spot'. I said, `What terms and conditions of employment do you enjoy?'. He said, `I am not sure. I signed a piece of paper. I am not sure what was on it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I tested him on this, he indicated to me the totally illogical position, from his view, of not signing the document, because in the absence of that no job would be offered. He had no protection. But the interesting thing about him was that he said he would stay in that employment for only as long as it took to find better alternative employment. That indicates the sort of approach that we are going to have from the Opposition. It is not the approach from the Government. It never will be because, in this Government's approach, we have something that is very important, that is, respect for employees. We do not take what Doug Anthony, a former National Party Leader, has described as a very pig-headed&mdash;he does not use the term `pig-headed', but he talked about&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Moore for his interjection. In relation to the other matter that was raised by the Leader of the Opposition, that is, the resource security legislation, this is not an academic matter. We are not here talking about the possibility of there being some sort of significant reform for an industry and consequent employment opportunities arising out of that; we are talking about a policy jurisdiction where Australia suffers the disadvantage of some 10 per cent of our trade deficit being in timber and paper products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a difficult policy jurisdiction, in large measure because the Federal Government's constitutional writ does not necessarily run that far. But the Federal Government, by the process of exhaustive consultation with the States, with industry, with unions, within the Government itself and more latterly&mdash;I might say unsuccessfully&mdash;with the Opposition, has sought not to embrace the particular views put by any particular lobby or interest group but to strike an appropriate balance in the public interest. So the Government has developed legislation to address the issue of forest conservation and development. In so doing, it has committed itself to that important part of our economy. It has committed itself to ensuring that investment takes place and that jobs are created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we have here from the Leader of the Opposition, who waxed lyrical about the need for reform, the need for job creation, the need to provide opportunities to Australians to be world competitive? What is the man who only a few weeks ago said, `I am yet to get up to speed on this issue', that is, the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer), who only a few short weeks ago did not understand the issues, doing? He is being very firm; he has indicated that in the Senate his National Party and Liberal Party colleagues will block the legislation proposed by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, in a democracy&mdash;and I think it was Churchill who said, `A democracy is the worst system in the world except all the others'&mdash;people are, of course, entitled to their view. The difference in this issue is that a large part of the Opposition Caucus believes that this legislation should be passed, and at this point there are no substantive differences between the Government and the Opposition. There are differences&mdash;of course there are differences&mdash;and there is nothing unusual in that in this chamber, in the other place, or in relation to a whole spectrum of policy issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the difference between the Government and the Opposition in relation to this matter? Essentially, the Opposition requires a change in the name and not the content of the Bill; that is, it requires a change from Forest Conservation and Development Bill to Forest Conservation and Major Projects Bill. As Shakespeare would have it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What's in a name? that which we call a rose</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By any other name would smell as sweet.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me to be an extraordinary position that we have now reached, where the Opposition will apparently vote against this legislation in the Senate as a response to the Government not being prepared at this point to change the title of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be a sin of omission on my part were I not also to say that there are differences in terms of the Opposition's desire to see the Government embrace, in a written instrument to itself, undertakings relating to the ongoing monitoring of the legislation and, in the event of the legislation being found wanting, indicating a preparedness to review within a reasonable time frame any shortcomings in the legislation. As a mirror image of that policy position, I might say the same thing in relation to enhanced inter-governmental agreement processes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) made much of what he claimed were the improvements in productivity on the waterfront, and he quoted the Wheat Board. What he did not say was that there have been reductions in the manning levels on the waterfront for the loading of wheat, but all those people, who were not made redundant as they should have been so that there could have been some reduction in cost in total on the waterfront, were moved over to the general labour pool on the waterfront and have just added to the costs of everybody else on the waterfront. Today we have the situation on the waterfront where there is more surplus labour than ever before and no reductions in costs in general.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) spelt out the situation very clearly on this matter of public importance:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's failure to save jobs by delivering genuine cost-cutting reform and effective resource security.</PARA>
<PARA>He quoted from Boston Consulting and even from the Government's own DITAC in relation to Australia's inability to capitalise on the tremendous opportunities for us with processed food and value adding, particularly in the Asian area, if we can only get our act together. He cited all of the problems we face, and I will cite a couple more because my electorate has 16 major food processing factories. With our goods and services tax, contrary to what the Minister has said, every farmer who supplies those food processing factories will on average be $8,000 a year better off in savings because of the abolition of payroll tax, fuel tax and sales tax. Also, the Minister might have learned when he was in New Zealand that another plus of the GST is that it will remove an export tax. That is helping New Zealand farmers and exporters generally against ours. This export tax adds close to $2 billion at the present time. When talking to some of the processing people recently, it was interesting to learn that the abolition of payroll tax alone will save them many millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case of SPC, with its 30 per cent productivity lift, which is only half of what it could have achieved had it been allowed to do what it wanted to do but was restricted by this Government from doing, shows what can be done. But SPC is one of the very few food processing factories in Australia that works on weekends. For most of them the added costs of those shifts would mean that they would lose money. If a product goes into a cannery, or whatever factory it is, at an equal price in Victoria, or in Australia, it comes out between 20 and 40 per cent more expensive because of those points made by the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about abattoirs? It is 2 1/2 times more expensive to process a steer in most parts of Australia than in the United States&mdash;and three times more expensive in Victoria, if one can actually find somebody to process it. It is interesting that an Australian meat tripartite overseas mission recently reported back&mdash;and this was the Government's own mission, full of good unionists and public servants&mdash;that in the three countries it went to, the United States, Germany and Denmark, every abattoir it visited had an enterprise agreement. There were no strikes. Every one had double shifts&mdash;there are only four abattoirs in Australia which have double shifts&mdash;and they all had higher production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there is the Edgell situation with tomatoes. The Leader of the Opposition made the point that, according to Edgell's own statement, the closing down of Cowra and Bairnsdale had nothing to do with tariffs but a lot to do with those higher costs and lousy dumping and countervailing policies against unfair, subsidised imports. That tomato case took two years, and in that time up to 40 per cent of the market was lost. It took four months from the application to a provisional duty&mdash;we will do it in under half that time&mdash;and almost five months for final duty. That is the sort of area where we have positive policies to assist. </PARA>

It does not provide major project legislation, on the one hand, for pulp mills, et cetera, and it is not a broad Bill with genuine resource security to pick up those 1,200 sawmills around Australia with all of the smaller investments that they want to make.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can work through all of the debate that has gone on for some months on this very important legislation. There is $5 billion to $7 billion of investment at stake and thousands of jobs in regional Australia with the saw mills and where the pulp mills will be. There is, as the Minister said, 10 per cent of the trade deficit with regard to the wood and paper products that now come in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government could not do one thing or the other, so what happened? I give credit to NAFI and to Dr Bain, who&mdash;even though it meant they would not achieve the legislation that all of their timber mill members wanted&mdash;agreed to a proposal which basically turned the Bill into a major projects Bill. That is what that heading was for. In the legislation, 10.1 becomes project specific&mdash;that is, a particular project is named by the Minister. So we were really prepared to turn what should have been a Bill for all forestry industry in Australia into a project specific Bill by that application. That would have meant that the industry would not have got what it deserved to get, but it had faith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister did not mention this, but I think it was an oversight: the other point was, of course, the fact that there were to be discussions and negotiations through the national forest strategy to get something to provide, on a regional or industry basis around Australia, genuine resource security for all the others in the industry in Australia. That, certainly, is what we will do in government. We will provide genuine resource security so that there is this investment and so that there are these jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister knows, I know and the industry knows that there was an agreement and that it had four elements. The Minister mentioned three of them and I picked up the other one. I say to the Minister that we were prepared, in spite of our reservations about the weaknesses of the Bill, to go along with it in the Senate so that any major projects&mdash;whether in northern Tasmania, Victoria or Western Australia&mdash;could get under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the dying stages of the debate in the Senate, we still say that all the Government has to do is honour the agreement that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories sabotaged from Kuala Lumpur through the means of the Prime Minister because of the deal that was made to get him elected as leader, and to hell with what it has meant to the jobs and investment around Australia and the efforts of this Minister. If the Government honours that agreement, that legislation will be passed. If the Government cannot get the Act right in the food processing industry, we can at least start to make progress with the forestry industry in this country. </PARA>

If the Opposition and the Democrats work together in the Senate today to defeat our legislation, in effect, they will be voting against balanced development in this country and, in the Opposition's case, it will be throwing out the baby with the bath water. In effect, they will be voting against future prosperity for Australia and Australians, especially in northern Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it clear that this legislation now being debated in the Senate represents only one, but a key, element of a package that has previously been debated in this House. The legislation will be complemented by enhanced intergovernment agreements for forest industry developments which cannot now meet the eligibility criteria under the legislation. The package represents a major reform by any measure which will create long term jobs for the people of Australia. I would have thought that investment and job creation would be a priority for the Opposition, as it is for us. But I seem to be wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objectives of that legislation being debated and the complementary enhanced intergovernment agreements are to provide security and certainty to both the forest industry and its community; to provide security and certainty to industry so that it can make significant long term investments with confidence and so that the governments of the future will not prevent or obstruct the investment's productive outcomes; and to provide security and certainty to the community so that all of its interests, whether they be for values that are environmental, cultural, heritage, social or economic&mdash;both for the current and future generations&mdash;are adequately and comprehensively safeguarded.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the proportion of young people remaining to the end of secondary school has virtually doubled in a decade, and student numbers at our universities have risen by over 50 per cent, this is not the case for TAFE. While student demand for TAFE and training has continued to increase strongly there has not been the growth experienced in the other sectors. The budgetary priorities of State governments, which have responsibility in this area, together with labour market conditions have limited training opportunities in the TAFE sector. Discussions between the States and the Commonwealth on the funding issues raised by the Finn report are still in progress but this funding initiative, when taken together with other funding initiatives announced in the Prime Minister's One Nation statement, will contribute markedly towards setting funding for vocational education and training on a proper basis. </PARA>

<PARA>The training guarantee scheme was established by legislation introduced into this House on 18 May 1990, and it came into effect on 1 July 1990. It requires employers to spend a minimum amount on training, broadly defined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme was introduced as part of the Government's policy over the last several years to develop the appropriate environment in which Australian industry can become more competitive internationally. A fundamental step in this process is the development of a highly skilled work force which can adapt quickly to major changes in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme is an additional mechanism to stimulate industry's commitment to training. It aims to increase the skills of the work force by expanding employer investment in training and distributing more equitably the training effort among employers. We must prepare for an inevitable increase in demand for skilled people, as the economic recovery strengthens, by ensuring that our commitment to training in this country is maintained and increased. The training guarantee provides an important underpinning to achieving the necessary skilled work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill amends the principal Act to give effect to a recommendation made in the report, the Finn report, of the Australian Education Council Review Committee entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Young People's Participation in Post-Compulsory Education and Training</EMPHASIS>. It also makes some minor technical amendments and a clarification. The Finn report was commissioned by Australia's Ministers for education and training to report on the future development of post-compulsory education and training in Australia. The report has provided new directions for the vocational education of young people whilst recognising the increasing convergence of vocational and general education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In line with one of the Finn report recommendations, the Bill provides for work experience and practice for students and teachers to be included in an eligible training program of an employer. This further provision in the training guarantee will provide a strong incentive for employers to provide work experience and practice opportunities. Work experience  and  practice are key  ingredients to  education  and  training.  This  prepares young people for entry into the work force and strengthens the competencies of teachers in helping students meet industry requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill targets full time students at or above the level of year 10 or its equivalent who are under 21 years of age. This is consistent with the Finn report's emphasis on young people. Provision is made for students undertaking courses in schools and education and training institutions including institutions which are registered under a State or Territory law. In some cases these may be a private sector institution.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The student must be full time in order to avoid inappropriate use of the provisions, such as employers releasing their employees for part time study and being able to claim their employee costs as eligible expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to teachers, provision is made for teachers in schools and institutions of the kind applying to students. Unlike full time teachers, part time teachers generally will be already gaining some work experience, or at least have the opportunity to gain such experience. Accordingly, the provision applies to full time teachers only. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also specifies that there is an agreement between the teacher and the training institution, and the training institution and the provider of work experience, which includes the terms and conditions under which the teacher may undertake work experience. This is to ensure that only genuine and formal work experience arrangements apply to full time teachers. This is consistent with the aim of encouraging teachers to acquire industry experience and knowledge so they can pass this on to students when they return to the teaching institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill inserts a provision that goods and services are to be provided within 13 months from the time the expenditure is incurred. This gives added force to the intent of the legislation that expenditure is not an end in itself and that the actual provision of training is the central purpose of such expenditure. However, the Bill makes provision for the Commissioner of Taxation to extend the time limit, should he decide it is appropriate to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Bill also inserts provisions for an employer to use a standard cost per kilometre for expenditure incurred on prescribed vehicle travel to enable an employee or other person to attend an eligible training program. A regulation will be tabled as  soon  as  possible  to  give  effect  to  this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, this Bill introduces some new aspects to the training guarantee in response to the Finn report. It also makes amendments to current provisions to assist employers and facilitate the administration of the training guarantee.

<PARA>This Bill makes technical amendments to the Aviation Fuel Revenues (Special Appropriation) Act to enable reductions to be made to the avgas excise and customs duty rate while preserving the Civil Aviation Authority's revenue entitlement under the Act. The purpose of the amendments is to permit the phasing out of the collection of that proportion of avgas duty that is directly attributed to the Department of Transport and Communication's aerodrome cost recovery program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August 1990 the Government announced its intention to transfer the remaining Commonwealth-owned aerodromes to full local ownership and to encourage aerodrome owners who are receiving funding under the aerodrome local ownership plan (ALOP) to accept full financial responsibility for their aerodromes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the number of aerodromes financially supported by the Government is reduced there is a corresponding reduction in government outlays. The Government has given a commitment to the aviation industry to pass on savings through the progressive reduction of the rate of excise and customs duty on avgas. This Bill will enable this commitment to be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current rate of duty on avgas is 27.480c/litre of which 3.010c is attributable to aerodrome cost recovery purposes. The balance of the duty is attributable to cost recovering aviation functions carried out by the Civil Aviation Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill enables the 3.010c to be phased out while retaining the existing level of revenue entitlements that the Civil Aviation Authority has under the present Act. At the same time the amendments enable the Civil Aviation Authority with the agreement of the Minister to vary the amount of revenue it receives for cost recovery purposes from the duty. This preserves the intent of the arrangements under the present Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will allow immediate amendment of the customs and excise tariffs to provide a one cent reduction in the avgas duty. A further one cent reduction in the avgas duty will take place when the combined number of Commonwealth aerodromes and ALOP aerodromes is reduced to 100. The final component of duty attributable to the aerodrome cost recovery program is scheduled to be removed in June 1993 when the aerodrome transfer and withdrawal process is anticipated to be completed. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill proposes amendments to the Commonwealth Employees Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, the CERC Act, and the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991, the OH&amp;S Act. It also proposes technical, drafting and consequential amendments to other Acts. The provisions of the Bill are explained in the explanatory memorandum. I propose therefore to confine my comments to the major amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main focus of the Bill is to continue the reform of Commonwealth employees' compensation arrangements in line with the recommendations of the Brown review of the Comcare program. In this, it fulfils an undertaking given by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) that this would be done in the present sittings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth employees&mdash;the Commission&mdash;which operated as Comcare, was established under the CERC Act. Its purpose was effectively to manage the Commonwealth public sector workers' compensation system. The Commission's role in the prevention of workplace injury and disease through improved occupational health and safety practices and the rehabilitation of injured workers was emphasised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1990 Mr Ron Brown, a management consultant, was commissioned to carry out a comprehensive review of the Comcare program. The Brown review involved consideration of the effectiveness of the Comcare scheme and recommendation of policy and legislative changes needed to better achieve the Government's objectives. The review acknowledged the success of improvements in workers compensation arrangements and policy achieved by the Commission since its establishment under this Government. Nevertheless, it targeted additional areas where effectiveness could be enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1991, the first step in implementing the Brown review's recommendations was taken. The Commission was restructured as a regulatory body distinct from Comcare and with a separate chairperson. It is responsible for regulatory functions associated with the CERC Act and the OH&amp;S Act. This includes determining compensation premiums. Comcare was restructured as a service delivery body, headed by its chief executive officer. It is responsible for commercial administrative and service functions under the legislation, including providing support to the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill deals with two important measures designed to implement other important recommendations of the Brown review. The Bill covers the licensing of Commonwealth authorities to perform certain functions under the CERC Act in respect of their own employees under the supervision of the Commission; and improvements in relation to Comcare's financial arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the proposed regime for the licensing of Commonwealth authorities. In the CERC Act in 1988 provision was made for both Australia Post and Telecom to become self-administrators of the Commonwealth workers compensation scheme. This was for a two-year trial period. Under these arrangements the two organisations were responsible for all aspects of the administration of the CERC Act for their employees. The Brown review recommended that these self-administration arrangements should end and be replaced with a system of licences for self-insurance and in-house claims management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for the implementation of that recommendation. It does so in a way that is consistent with preserving flexibility and increasing efficiency in the operation of the Commonwealth's employee compensation arrangements. But, at the same time, it will ensure that the licensed authorities operate under an appropriate system of regulation by the Commission. That system of regulation will, among other things, ensure consistency of practice between Comcare and the licensed authorities. Commonwealth authorities will be able to apply to the Commission for licences under the Act. The Commission will have the power to grant or refuse applications, based on their consideration against criteria set out in the legislation. An application fee will need to be paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new arrangements will allow the Commission to issue three classes of licence. A class 1 licence will allow an authority to operate as a self-insurer. The licence will transfer to the licensed authority all or part of Comcare's obligation to compensate its employees.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A class 2 licence will allow an authority to determine its own claims. The licence will transfer to the licensed authority, wholly or in part, Comcare's function of determining its employees' claims under the CERC Act. A class 3 licence will allow an authority to self-insure and determine the claims of its employees. </PARA>
<PARA>Licences are to be subject to a system of conditions set out in the CERC Act, as well as other conditions imposed on a case-by-case basis by the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal statutory conditions are to be requirements that licensed authorities comply with the CERC Act and pay their annual licence fees. The conditions able to be set by the Commission will include conditions limiting the maximum liability for which a licensed authority may self-insure, or in respect of which it may make a determination. If a limit is imposed by way of a condition then, once exceeded, liability to make payments or to determine a claim, or both, will revert to Comcare, depending on the class of licence. Another possible condition to which a self-insurance licence may be made subject is a requirement that the licensed authority obtain specified bank or other guarantees or other specified securities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government recognises that consistency, equality and independence of decision-making are of paramount importance in these processes, particularly at the review stage. Accordingly, the Commission will be able to impose a condition on a licence that the reconsideration of claims determined by a class 2 or class 3 licence holder be carried out by Comcare or another authority. To ensure consistency and equality of decision making, licence holders will be obliged to comply with guidelines issued by the Commission. In addition, the Commission will be able to give a direction to a licensed authority, either generally or in respect of a particular matter or class of matters. Licensed authorities are to be required by the CERC Act to comply with such directions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is anticipated that, exercising its powers, the Commission will set performance standards to be achieved and maintained by license holders. Because a licensed authority will be bound as a condition of its licence to comply with the Act, a failure to comply with guidelines or directions of the Commission will involve a breach of that condition. The Commission will be able to suspend a class 2 or class 3 licence or revoke a licence of any class for breach of any condition. It will also be able to direct a licensed authority to comply with conditions of the licence. The provisions of the Bill also detail the effects of a suspension or revocation. Under the Bill's provisions, the current self-administering authorities&mdash;Australia Post and Telecom&mdash;will hold class 3 licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second group of amendments proposed by the Bill, linked to the implementation of the Brown review, concerns the financial arrangements under the CERC Act. Comcare will be allowed to enter into arrangements under which it will provide and charge fees for agreed services related to the performance by Comcare of its functions under the CERC Act. Also included are provisions under which Comcare will collect premiums under the CERC Act on behalf of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill aims at simplifying the operation of the CERC Act by including a special or standing appropriation. There will be payable to Comcare the moneys necessary to meet undischarged liabilities for claims under the previous compensation arrangements. In addition, Comcare will also be paid amounts equal to the administrative costs attributable to these claims. There will also be payable to Comcare the moneys necessary to discharge its liabilities for claims under the CERC Act and to cover administrative costs associated with those claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amounts available to Comcare under this second head are limited to the amounts of premiums it has collected together with notional interest on such of those premiums as have not from time to time been paid out, less previous payments. The Minister for Finance may determine the opening balances for the special appropriations and the rate of notional interest to be applied to the balance from time to time in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 5 of this Bill provides for the introduction of recovery of the costs of administration of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991. These proposals have two aspects: fees for certain services and general contributions. The Commission will be able to enter into arrangements with departments and authorities under which it will provide and charge for agreed services. Comcare is to be given a similar power under the CERC Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission will also be able to estimate contributions that are to be payable by all departments and authorities covered by the OH&amp;S Act. In this way, each department and authority will contribute to the cost of administering the Act based on its own occupational health and safety record and having regard to other specified matters. This will provide departments and authorities with a financial incentive to improve occupational health and safety programs, and will assist in ensuring a safe and healthy working environment for Commonwealth employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A two-stage process of review of estimated contribution will be available. Estimates will be reviewed first by the Commission and then, if the Department or authority concerned wishes it, by the Minister. Departments and authorities will be required to provide relevant information and to pay interest on late payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill represents an important stage in the successful implementation of changes to the workers compensation system based on the recent Brown review of the Comcare program. The Bill represents substantial progress in the Government's continuing reform of the Commonwealth employees compensation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments proposed in the Bill are not expected to have a significant financial impact. The costs of licensing and of regulation of licensed authorities under the CERC Act are to be recovered from those authorities through application and annual fees. The standing or special appropriations proposed to be inserted in the CERC Act will take the place of annual appropriations and are limited in their scope. The cost recovery arrangements proposed for the OH&amp;S Act may result in some savings in annual appropriations to the extent that costs are recovered from non-Budget dependent agencies. Costs or savings in respect of Budget dependent agencies are dependent upon the annual Budget process and cannot be quantified. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>These Bills form an important part of the Government's coal industry reform package. They provide for the amendment and, ultimately, the repeal of the States Grants (Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave) Act 1949 which, together with complementary State legislation, establishes the present scheme for the funding of long service leave in the black coalmining industry in New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current scheme is funded by way of an excise on coal production levied at 20c per tonne. Under the proposed arrangements, long service leave will be funded by a levy on payroll. The new scheme has been agreed to by the relevant States and all elements in the industry affected have been consulted in relation to the proposed reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 2 December 1991, the Government announced a range of initiatives in relation to the coal industry. These were announced in the Government's coal industry policy statement jointly issued by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean). The statement presents the most far-reaching changes to coal industry policy since the immediate post-war period. Reform of the industry's long service leave arrangements is part of those initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy statement followed a review of long service leave funding undertaken by Mr L. J. Willett, then chairperson of the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust, and was delivered to the Minister for Industrial Relations in November 1990. The report recommended changes to the present funding scheme. It also proposed that the scheme should be fully funded so as to facilitate the portability of long service leave in the industry and to ensure the preservation of benefits in the event of companies going out of business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government agrees with the general thrust of Mr Willett's report and believes that responsibility for administering the fund should be returned to the industry.  It recognises, however, that in the short run this may impose significant cost burdens on sections of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Existing arrangements have operated on a `pay as you go' basis, and a substantial unfunded liability for long service leave has accrued.  Moreover, large scale, highly productive producers&mdash;largely represented by the Queensland Mining Council&mdash;raised concerns that they presently cross-subsidise the operations of more labour-intensive mines, predominantly the underground coalmining industry in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In commenting on the Willett report's recommendations, industry parties and State governments agreed that outstanding liabilities and future accruals should be funded on a more equitable and rational basis related to employment costs. The Government believes that the new arrangements safeguard the public interest in maintaining a viable coalmining industry whilst representing an appropriate balance between the principles of efficiency and equity and the interests of the disparate parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bills terminate the present excise funding arrangement and implement a new industry managed, fully funded scheme. With the co-operation of the States, it is envisaged that the new funding arrangements will become fully operational from 1 January 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal features of the scheme are as follows: there is to be a single national scheme under Commonwealth legislation, and its management is to be the responsibility of a board of directors made up of employer and union representatives. The legislation will establish a Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Corporation. The Corporation will be wholly self-financing and will have two functions. The first will be to manage the coalmining industry long service leave trust fund for the purpose of reimbursing participating companies for long service leave taken by coalminers and other eligible employees. The second will be to collect levies from companies for the purpose of funding long service leave and meeting the costs of the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Corporation will be constituted by a board of six directors whom the Minister for Industrial Relations will appoint and who will hold office on a part time basis. The Minister will appoint two of the directors to represent the companies engaged in black coalmining in New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania, and one director to represent companies engaged in black coalmining in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister will appoint one director to represent the United Mine Workers Division of the Construction, Forestry and Mining Employees Union, and one director to represent: the Electrical Trades Union of Australia; the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association of Australia; and the Metals and Engineering Workers Union. Another director is to represent: the Australian Collieries Staff Association; the Colliery Officials Association of New South Wales; and the New South Wales Mine Managers Association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first instance, the Minister will appoint one of the directors to be chairperson of the board and another to be deputy chairperson. Subsequent appointments of chairperson and deputy chairperson will be made by the board. The directors' remuneration will be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Corporation will have all powers necessary to carry out the functions I have described. It will have the power to enter into contracts, including contracts with other organisations to collect levies, manage funds and make payments in relation to long service leave on behalf of the Corporation. It will have the power to invest moneys so as to maximise the return on funds in the interests of contributors, to borrow moneys subject to ministerial approval, and to employ staff and engage consultants under terms and conditions determined by the board. The scheme is to be independently reviewed at regular intervals and once it is fully funded responsibility for its operation will be devolved to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Assets and liabilities of the existing fund are to be transferred to the new scheme and the legislation provides that the rate of levy is to be prescribed by the Minister acting on the advice of the board. The levy is to be collected from participating companies only, with the formula for reimbursement set to reflect national minimum industry standards in respect of long service leave. Claims for reimbursement may be made in relation to all award based entitlements payable during long service leave, including production related bonuses. Where such payments are made arising out of an obligation under a recognised enterprise or workplace agreement reimbursement may also be claimed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For constitutional reasons it has not been possible to cover certain non-award based entitlements payable in certain States or by individual firms by tailoring the rate of levy to the circumstances in each participating State. There is nothing, however, in the scheme to prevent firms paying higher long service leave benefits where they see fit. In such cases they will not be able to claim reimbursement from the fund for payments in excess of normal entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is envisaged that the scheme is to be fully funded over a period of 10 years, including the unfunded liability for leave accrued prior to 1 January 1993. Presently, it is estimated the initial levy will be in the vicinity of 6 per cent of payroll. The actual rate of levy will be precisely determined by an actuarial review conducted under the auspices of the Corporation. As I have already indicated, there are compelling reasons for continuing government involvement through a statutory corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, the new arrangements will substantially increase long service leave funding costs for many companies, especially by reason of the requirement to fully fund accrued liabilities. The formation of a statutory corporation, rather than a private company, has enabled company income tax deductibility of contributions to the fund. The rates of payroll levy that are required to finance ongoing accruals of long service leave and to fund the accrued liability will impose significantly increased cost burdens on the industry. These rates of levy will, for some companies, equate to a cost of about 60c or 70c per tonne compared with the present 20c per tonne. The burden will fall most heavily on relatively labour-intensive mines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of the potential cost impact of the new arrangements on sections of the industry, particularly the requirement to achieve full funding, it is appropriate that the tax treatment of levy contributions to the new scheme should be as favourable as the tax treatment of payments under the current excise funding arrangements. As excise payments are deductible for company income tax purposes it is anticipated that there will be no additional cost to revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision of tax deductibility for levy contributions also recognises that, unlike most other employers, coal companies are being compelled to contribute to a long service leave fund. Other employers who make provision for their long service leave liabilities in the normal way retain the funds so provided as internal working capital. Deductibility of contributions will help offset the cost of replacing that working capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the new long service leave scheme removes the inefficiencies and inequities associated with the present arrangements, and its full funding will ensure the portability and preservation of benefits. It is an important complementary component of the Government's coal industry policy reforms, which are designed to respond to changed circumstances and help secure the industry's future into the next century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, continuing Commonwealth involvement provides a guarantee of continuity and for a smooth transition to the privately funded scheme or schemes with a minimum of industrial friction.

<PARA>The purpose of the Coal Industry Amendment Bill is to reform the functions and activities of the Joint Coal Board. This reform measure is part of a package of major policy reform measures for the coal sector announced by this Government on 2 December 1991. The aims of the reform package are to promote growth, employment and investment in the industry through the removal of unnecessary impediments to growth and change. The other reform measures to be considered by Parliament are:</PARA>
<PARA>.a new industry-based coal research and development arrangement;</PARA>
<PARA>.a new national scheme for coalminers' long service leave; and</PARA>
<PARA>.abolition of the coal export duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will give effect to the Government's decision to refocus the functions and activities of the board.

The New South Wales Government will be introducing its parallel Bill to the State Parliament in the current parliamentary session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time that it was established, the board was given extensive powers over industry development, mining, employment, and marketing to ensure adequate coal supplies in the postwar reconstruction era. Many of these powers have long since been unnecessary and unused. The New South Wales coal industry has undergone extensive changes since 1947, moving from a domestic oriented industry to a premier coal exporter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October 1990, the Commonwealth and New South Wales governments engaged Mr Bryan Kelman to undertake an independent review of the powers, functions and activities of the Board. Based on Mr Kelman's review and subsequent consultations with industry parties and the Construction, Forestry and Mining Employees Union, both the Commonwealth and New South Wales governments agreed that the board's functions and activities would be rationalised and refocused to concentrate on those areas where it has a demonstrated record of performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to refocus the board's powers and role in the industry will remove unnecessary duplication of functions between the board and the State department responsible for mining matters. The Bill provides for the board to continue its powers, functions and activities in the following areas:</PARA>
<PARA>.administration of the coal industry workers compensation scheme;</PARA>
<PARA>.provision of coalminers occupational health and rehabilitation services, including the provision of preventive medical services, monitoring workers' health and investigating related health matters;</PARA>
<PARA>.promotion of the welfare of current and former workers in the industry, their families and communities in the coalmining areas;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of the Bill is to remove unnecessary duplication of functions between the board and the State, and to bring to an end the board's powers, functions and activities in a number of areas, namely:</PARA>
<PARA>.control over the rate of development of the coal industry in New South Wales, particularly attempts to match supply and demand; and</PARA>
<PARA>.coal resource utilisation, mining, marketing and management issues within the State. </PARA>
<PARA>Future board membership will formalise the current arrangement, which is an independent chairperson, a union representative and a company representative. However, the terms of appointment will be changed. The Act provides for a maximum term of appointment of seven years on a full time basis for all board members. The Bill will amend this to a maximum of three years on either a full time or part time basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it stands now, policy direction to the board can only be issued from the Prime Minister in agreement with the Premier of New South Wales.

Provisions have been made in the Bill to improve the board's standards of accountability in line with contemporary practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1992-93, the board will become largely self-funding for its continuing operations. The workers compensation insurance, health, and welfare activities will be funded from existing resources accumulated by the board and from future premium and other income. The other functions will be operated on a cost recovery basis. In 1991-92, the Commonwealth share for the board's operations is $2.463m. This includes funding for the Coal Industry Tribunal of $570,000 which has previously been provided through the board. Funding for the Coal Industry Tribunal will continue. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to transfer responsibility for coal research and development in Australia from a Commonwealth Government run system to an industry funded and managed scheme. This new arrangement was announced by the Government on 2 December 1991 as part of a major package of institutional reform in the coal industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal Commonwealth Government mechanism for directing and coordinating energy research and development has been the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council (NERDDC). Coal research has been funded through NERDDC by the Coal Research Trust Account, which was established by the Coal Research Assistance Act 1977. Current funding arrangements for the Coal Research Trust Account is through the collection of a 5c per tonne excise on black coal production by the Excise Tariff Act 1921. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new coal research and development (R&amp;D) arrangements had their origins following a review of all Commonwealth funded research arrangements within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy conducted in 1989. The aim of the review was to define improvements which could be made to ensure that research programs continued to produce results that are relevant to industry requirements. A statutory research and development corporation model was chosen and has been adopted in most cases; however, the coal industry opted to administer its own research and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a number of disadvantages associated with the existing Government imposed arrangements:</PARA>
<PARA>. the levy rate has tended to be regarded by some firms as a ceiling on research and development investments, rather than a minimum guaranteed level;</PARA>
<PARA>. opportunities for firm-specific competitive advantage which might otherwise have been pursued through research and development have been obscured;</PARA>
<PARA>. some firms have expressed a feeling of disenfranchisement from their R&amp;D; and</PARA>
<PARA>. management's responsibility for each firm's R&amp;D has been implicitly transferred to external authorities, making R&amp;D less relevant in day-to-day business decisions. </PARA>
<PARA>Agreement has been reached with the coal industry, through the Australian Coal Association, to transfer responsibility for coal research and development from NERDDC and the Coal Research Trust Account to a new Coal Research Council to be run by the Australian Coal Association through the incorporated company Australian Coal Research Ltd.

<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to repeal the Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Act 1975 and to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921 which will put in place the reform measures for the coal sector announced by this Government on 2 December 1991. One of the reform measures announced by the Government is the abolition of the coal export duty. The duty was originally introduced in the early 1970s as a tax on windfall profits. Over the years the duty was modified and, at present, coal which remains dutiable is high quality coking coal mined from depths no greater than 60 metres in open-cut mines which were in production before 30 June 1980. In practice, the duty affects six open-cut mines in Queensland operated by BHP Australia Coal Ltd. This Government acknowledges that the duty is an anomaly in the current coal industry tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has therefore agreed to repeal the coal export duty in return for BHP's commitment to invest $248m in new capital expenditure, enhanced research and development and additional coal mine rehabilitation activities over the next five years. The program of commitments by BHP will have significant efficiency gains, improve regional employment opportunities and provide environmental benefits for Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commitments will also add to the competitiveness of export operations of Australian coal at a time when Australia needs to explore all avenues of improved export performance. This Government's decision to abolish the duty as part of a package of micro-economic reform for the Australian coal industry underpins the facilitating role this Government is prepared to play in working with industry to overcome sectoral impediments and promote industry development. This Bill also amends the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to give effect to the Government's decision to reform the coal research and development arrangements and coalminers' long service leave arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth excise of 5c per tonne on coal produced which currently funds the Coal Research Trust Account to the value of around $8m, will be suspended. The remaining Commonwealth excise of 20c per tonne on coal produced, which currently funds coalminers' long service leave will continue until a new payroll levy based scheme comes into effect. </PARA>

Legislation providing for the establishment of an industry-based coal research and development arrangement and a new national scheme for coalminers long service leave have been introduced into the House of Representatives today as part of the Government's coal industry policy reform package.

<PARA>The Bill amends several of the provisions of the current rural adjustment scheme, RAS, which was introduced in January 1989 following an extensive review. At the time of setting up this revised scheme it was envisaged that it would operate in a more flexible and innovative way to address more adequately the changing structural adjustment forces acting in the Australian agricultural sector and to more closely match the requirements for assistance of individual farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first years of the revised scheme, the rural economy was generally buoyant but towards the end of 1990 it had become apparent that the sector was experiencing the beginning of a severe downturn and that a number of farmers were facing financial difficulties as a result of depressed commodity prices. This was to be the first real test of the adequacy of the scheme. In Queensland and northern New South Wales the severe drought in 1991 exacerbated the difficulties being faced by farmers in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My Department undertook assessments in April and October 1991 to determine whether the assistance measures available under the scheme were adequate to meet the pressures placed on individual farming families. It became apparent as a result of these assessments that additional measures would need to be introduced to assist farmers with long term prospects, but in financial difficulties, as a result of the downturn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resultant changes to the scheme augmented the existing measures which would assist in maintaining the basis for an internationally competitive rural base. Funding was progressively increased from $62.45m in 1990-91 to $193.91m for 1991-92 and at present some 10,000 farmers are receiving RAS assistance. These variations, in conjunction with other initiatives, such as the modification of hardship provisions under the Social Security Act, have provided a safety net for those farmers facing severe financial difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is provision under the agreement to amend the terms and provisions available under the scheme provided that the concurrence is sought from State and Territory Ministers. This provision has been particularly useful as it has allowed access to the assistance without delay. The first two amendments have been made by agreement between the Commonwealth and the States and the Northern Territory. It is now appropriate to bring these amendments before the Commonwealth Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third amendment being introduced at this time is to formally extend the scheme to the Australian Capital Territory, ACT. Following self-government, the Territory has assumed responsibility for program delivery. There has been very little demand for assistance under the scheme by the Territory's farmers as there are only 230 farmers in the ACT, of which approximately 25 per cent would be assessed as being bona fide farmers under the criteria laid out in the agreement. Under the current arrangements, New South Wales has been acting as an agent for the administration of the scheme where there has been a need for assistance for ACT farmers. While there has been little demand to date, it is only equitable that those few genuine farmers in the ACT should also have access to the RAS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first initiative to be introduced was the new measure available under part A of the scheme entitled `Debt Restructuring with Interest Subsidies' or DRIS. Farmers, who have long term prospects in farming, but due to various reasons, including low incomes, are not able to obtain further finance from their creditors, may be eligible for an interest subsidy on their existing debts. This measure was designed to improve farmers' cash flows. This provision has been applied with other measures available under the RAS, such as the support to obtain carry-on finance to meet the individual needs of farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the economic statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in February 1992, additional funds were provided which will assist some farmers to plant broadacre and sugar crops in the 1992 winter and 1992-93 summer crop planting seasons. The crop planting scheme is designed to support the provision of working capital for crop plantings and raise confidence in the broadacre industries. For this purpose broadacre crops have been defined as cereals, coarse grains, oilseeds, peanuts and grain legumes. Needy producers in the sugar industry are also included. These industries are in need of working capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Assistance for crop planting has been available since March 1992 under part B of the scheme. Support is in the form of a 75 per cent interest subsidy on their commercial crop planting loans. Under the terms and provisions that have been agreed with the States, to be eligible for assistance, the farm enterprise should be profitable in the long term, but unable to obtain sufficient commercial carry-on finance to undertake normal cropping programs. Assistance will be limited to a maximum $10,000 subsidy and can be used for normal crop planting expenses such as wages, seed, fertiliser, fuel and repairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the development of a national drought policy, the provision of relief for farmers affected by dry seasonal conditions is provided under part B of the scheme. This component supports farmers in financial difficulties through causes beyond their control, to obtain carry-on finance through the provision of interest subsidies on commercial borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part B assistance was activated in 1991 primarily because of the severe financial hardship being suffered by many farmers as a result of the low commodity prices, but this situation was compounded in Queensland and northern New South Wales by the severe drought conditions in the latter part of the year. Under the arrangements for the current scheme, funding for part B has been shared equally by the Commonwealth and the States. In recognition of the difficulty of some States to provide matching funds, the Commonwealth agreed in October 1991 to alter the funding contribution. Under the revised funding arrangements for part B, the Commonwealth will provide two dollars for each dollar provided by the States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme has, in general, withstood the considerable pressures exerted by the downturn and drought. The new measures have contributed significantly to the effectiveness of the scheme. They have complemented the measures already available under the scheme as well as a number of other Commonwealth and State programs that have also been under similar pressure to support the rural sector through this crisis. Evidence suggests that 1991-92 will prove to be the lowest point of the adverse conditions in the sector and that 1992-93 will see a recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme is currently being evaluated in line with Government policy of regularly reviewing the effectiveness of its programs. I will be reporting on the outcome of the review to the next meeting of the Agricultural Council of Australian and New Zealand at the end of July. The evaluation may recommend the need to further modify the scheme in order to meet the primary objective of ensuring structural adjustment in the industry. The manner in which the scheme has coped through the downturn will be closely scrutinised, in particular its effectiveness in assisting to modify the effects of future downturns  in farming  in  Australia.

If members take the opportunity to go through the report and get some idea of the evidence which this Committee received, they will understand why the Committee took so long in gathering evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a monumental attempt by this Committee to consult as widely as possible and to gain evidence as widely as possible on the Committee's terms of reference. Essentially, the Committee was asked to conduct a stock take on the position of Australian women in the 1990s. That meant gaining evidence from all walks of life: from many individuals; governments, both State and Federal; business; voluntary organisations; many academics; universities and community groups. At the final cut-off date for consideration of the evidence, the Committee had received some 634 written submissions. Given that a standard inquiry might expect to receive from 60 to 100 submissions, one can see that this did attract a lot of interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over and above that, the Committee held public hearings in each of the Australian capitals and in some of the major regional centres and heard from a further 181 witnesses at these public hearings. We received over 170 further exhibits of previously published material. To involve the women of Australia plus other interested groups and government departments, in one case with the Royal Australian Institute of Public Administration, in another the Australian Sports Commission, in another the Department of Employment, Education and Training and in another the Office of the Status of Women, we co-hosted four seminars which in themselves attracted over 1,000 participants. I think that gives the House some idea as to the amount of evidence this Committee has received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall refer to some of the statistics which led the Committee to reach its conclusion and make its recommendations. Some of this evidence is quite startling and bears repeating. For instance, women's wages in Australia currently on average are only 87 per cent of average male wages and women make up only 13 per cent of government representatives in Australia. Since the inception of the Australian honours system in 1975 women have received only 24 per cent of all awards and most of them have been in the lower orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Olympic competitions between 1948 and 1988 women have won 42 per cent of the medals which have been won by Australians, and this is despite the fact that they have made up only 19 per cent of all team members and have been able to compete in only 22 per cent of events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than half of the women in the paid work force in Australia earn less than $21,000 per year, while two-thirds of men have incomes greater than this figure. Australia's senior business managers, public servants and professionals are five to 10 times more likely to be men than women. I think that gives the House some indication that, if there is a myth abroad or a community perception that the battle has been won for Australian women&mdash;that is, that they do enjoy full opportunity and status for their contributions to Australian society&mdash;it is indeed a myth, and it is a myth which should be challenged. I think it is very successfully challenged by the very compelling evidence which this report details. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the pure factual data that this evidence provides, I think the House would be impressed by the quality of the evidence. In many instances, obviously a great deal of effort and time has gone into the writing of submissions for this inquiry. A great deal of commitment, of true passion, and unfortunately in many cases a degree of disillusionment, concerning the position of Australian women has been shown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is easy enough, I suppose, to go through the exercise, to collect this data and to portray a picture of contemporary Australian women. Where the exercise becomes far more difficult is in deciding why it is that this has occurred, why it is that this inequality persists and what can be done to overcome it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to that challenge the Committee has put together some 79 recommendations. They are very broad ranging  in their coverage and, I am pleased to say, in the vast majority of cases they have been agreed by all members of the Committee. There is a dissenting report on some recommendations, particularly those dealing with the operation of the Sex Discrimination Act and the affirmative action legislation and no doubt my colleagues will point to those particular points of disagreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to concentrate on the matters of agreement, which form the vast majority of the Committee's recommendations. I think we found that there is no one answer; I do not think we expected to find one answer. There certainly is no one answer or solution to the problems and the difficulties that we have identified. Sure, there have been very big changes in the role of Australian women, most obviously in terms of their participation in paid work. That has altered quite dramatically, even over the last two decades. More than 50 per cent of Australian women are now in paid employment, and if one pays regard to the number of women under the age of 15 or 16 and the number of women over the age of 60, one will find that women of working age, women of pre-retirement age, constitute a very large proportion of Australian women in paid work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite that change, there has been very little change in the role of Australian men. Women still continue to bear the brunt of responsibilities in the home and are the primary care givers; they carry the responsibilities for the maintenance of families and for extended family ties. They continue to play their traditional role. While this is a matter of choice and not to be attacked by any means, one can point to the fact that whilst women continue to carry this double burden, the range of opportunities available to them, and their ability to participate in other aspects of society, can be greatly hampered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has focused on the position of women in paid employment. There are a number of recommendations which deal with the industrial system. We have also focused on recognition for unpaid work. That is an important part of this report, and I think it is time that this Parliament gave some close consideration to the recognition of unpaid and voluntary work. It is essential for the well-being of our community that this work not be taken for granted, as has so often been the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is discussion on the position of Australian women in sport and leisure, and there are recommendations which flow from there; a brief preview of the position in training and education; and also mention of women with special needs&mdash;Aboriginal women, women from non-English speaking backgrounds, women with disabilities and women who live in remote and rural communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will say no more about the report, but I would like to pay some tributes and give some thanks for the work that has gone into it. Firstly, I mention the staff of the Committee. A legion of staff has been involved in this report over the two years, but I will pay special tribute to the Committee Secretary, Kathy Townsend, who has put in enormous effort, through her own personal commitment, to the report. The previous Committee Secretary, Jon Stanhope, who was instrumental in gaining terms of reference and had a deep personal commitment to the inquiry, should be acknowledged. The other staff members who contributed their valuable time are Grant Harrison, Donna Christophers, Louise Carney, Ann Hazelton, Lorraine Ball, Sue Moreton and Margaret McCormack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also had considerable help from people outside our staff and I would like to pay particular tribute to Dr Marion Sawer, who helped enormously in the preparation of some of the discussion papers and in making sure that the reports were accurate and on line. Also, Libby Darlinson contributed heavily to the discussion paper on the issue of women in sport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I wish to thank my colleagues on the Committee. This inquiry went for a bit longer than two years. Throughout its great length it was conducted in a very good bipartisan spirit, and I very much welcome the cooperation which was forthcoming from my colleagues. I mention in particular the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), the honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey) and the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford), who were probably involved in most of the seminars, most of the public hearings and in the sub-committee deliberations. I thank my colleagues for their support and assistance in this invaluable work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to thank the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), for his introductory remarks. There is much in what he said with which I would wish to identify myself. In fact, as he said, the report has proved to be largely bipartisan but in some areas there are differences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In examining this subject, the Committee endeavoured to gain evidence and submissions from over half of the Australian population. As the Chairman said, there were over 600 submissions to the Committee and, as with all inquiries of this type and even with such a large number of submissions, one cannot be completely sure that one has covered the whole ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, as could be expected, much evidence came from those employed in the area of equal opportunity or affirmative action agencies. Regrettably, the sifting of evidence is most difficult when we are confronted by those who, for many reasons, feel that our society has let them down or been unfair. Many statements were subjective or even bitter; many of the complaints of discrimination or perceived unfair treatment could apply equally to men or women. The terms of reference, however, prevented us from looking at it in a broad sense, and maybe I felt at times that a broad look at unfair treatment of people by our society could have produced more substantial recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objective of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 is, in part, to alter attitudes in regard to women by making certain practices unlawful. Discrimination and harassment are the cornerstones of the Act. The title of the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half Way to Equal</EMPHASIS>, implies that the Committee may have considered that Australian women are half equal to men. I reject that assumption and I believe that the majority of the Committee, if it had given proper attention to the title, would reject that also. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equality of opportunity for men and women is an important ideal for Australians. Many steps have been taken over the past century to implement this ideal; yet in some areas it remains unfulfilled. Many issues were examined by the Committee and, in the great majority of recommendations, as the Chairman has said, there was agreement amongst the members. However, there was disagreement in a number of the most significant areas. The final draft of the report was considered by only four members of the Government and five members of the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the hasty processes of final consideration were most detrimental to reaching balanced conclusions and to making recommendations which are of lasting value to women in Australia. In my view, the processes adopted in the closing stages of the inquiry could be viewed as being detrimental to the advancement of Australian women. In some ways, in fact, this is a minority report, as only four members of the Government and five members of the Opposition were present at the last meeting. Whilst the Committee investigated many areas, of particular note are the findings with regard to unpaid voluntary, part time and casual work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The huge contribution of women who are, as it was termed in the inquiry, `the administrators and managers of home affairs and future generations' has been largely ignored by feminist action groups. The activities of these women in our society have never been evaluated. It is time for those who extend care, support and assistance to their fellows to be recognised. For far too long&mdash;and this has often been encouraged by government funding&mdash;women in the unpaid work force have felt discriminated against compared with women who are in the paid work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this desperate economic climate, the impact of women being forced out of their area of unpaid work into the paid work force can impose severe strains on the well-being of our community. Community organisations and homes, and employers of casual and part time workers, all suffer because women are forced, in many instances against their wishes, into full time paid work. The preferences of women to make their maximum contribution to our society is overlooked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bureau of Statistics survey, which covered a large number of women, indicated that only 4 per cent of women prefer to work in full time paid work whilst their children are of school age and that 69 per cent prefer not to work at all whilst the children are of that age. In fact, of all the women who work, only 17.8 per cent are in full time paid jobs. But that number is increasing. In many instances, their decisions are not those of preference. Discrimination against women in unpaid work was, for me, one of most significant features of the inquiry. Organisations such as the Australian Family Association should be complimented for their thoughtful and factual contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come now to the dissenting report which was written by me and my colleagues the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), the honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey), the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) and the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). The conclusion that we reached was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Equality of opportunity and status for all Australians, including women, remains our objective. However, this objective will not be achieved by opinion, wishful thinking, preconceived notions of women's wishes, inadequate analysis of developments, or insufficient attention to the consequences of proposals. While the conduct of this inquiry has afforded a review of women in Australian society it remains incomplete and inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA>The main features of the dissenting report relates to the recommendations to change the Sex Discrimination Act and to some recommendations relating to the workplace. In our view, a series of recommendations to change the Act would lead to a significant codification and legalisation of the processes currently being used to resolve matters of discrimination and harassment. It was proffered by Government members that part of the grounds for unlawful acts would encompass the removal of the test of an action being not reasonable. In its place, it is proposed in the report to substitute as the definition the course of action which is the least discriminating in the circumstances. It sounds to be a play on words. Two examples easily demonstrate the need to retain the reasonable approach; for instance, a male counsellor on breastfeeding may not be acceptable to some women or a male pool attendant may not be acceptable to Islamic women. The least discriminatory course of action can, in these instances, completely cut across the intention of the recommendations. So we have dissented to that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this recommendation is linked with the recommendation that determination by the Human Rights Commission should become an enforceable order of the Federal Court in the absence of an appeal, this proposal will ensure that only those with legal representation will be courageous enough to go to the Commission. Nothing could be more daunting to anyone&mdash;let alone someone who may have been subject to demeaning discrimination&mdash;than to face the cross-examination or minute discovery of every aspect of a case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have rejected that course of action in favour of the current conciliation process. This process has produced settlement in 95 to 97 per cent of the cases. No thought seems to have been given to the women who have experienced discrimination or harassment nor to the high level of success that the conciliatory model achieves. The Opposition members have also completely rejected the recommendation that educational institutions established for religious purposes should now be subject to the provisions of the Act. This concept is an old one for socialists. Most of the world has decided where the boundaries to religious freedom lie. Here we see the ancient wish to interfere with the employment practices of non-government schools brought under the control of the State. Nothing could be a greater anathema to the freedom loving Australians. They have rejected these policies time and again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the existing grounds of sex and marital status, we support the extension of discrimination within the Act to apply to those with family responsibilities and to the prospect of pregnancy. The report contains so much material relating to women in sport, education and the opportunities for girls and young women to expand their horizons in career prospects. So much of value has been done, but so much more could have been done if we had been a little more determined and timely in the closing stages of the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At times during this inquiry, I must confess that I felt a deep sympathy for the many women who exhibited hurt and bitterness over the way in which life had dealt with them. One could not help feeling sad for the scarred and discouraged lives. I hope that Australian men and the institutions which serve our society will understand the implications for them. Regrettably, families suffer when economic and social pressures place excessive strain on the members of families. Women so often carry an inordinate share of the pressure. Commitment, care and unselfishness so often underlie the answer to resolving the problems that have been raised. Those attributes cannot be attained by legislation, but only by changes in personal attitudes, good role models and education. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the very few minutes that I have left here today, I would firstly like to commend the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), and other members of the Committee, for the effort that has been put into this inquiry over the last two years, which resulted in the Chairman tabling this report here today. I would also like to acknowledge the work of the secretariat, in particular in the latter stages of the inquiry and in the compilation of the report, of Ms Kathy Townsend and all of her staff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Chairman and the previous speaker, the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), have said, this report makes 79 recommendations covering women at work in both the paid and unpaid work force; women with special requirements, such as those who live in rural areas; women from non-English backgrounds; Aboriginal women; women in sport; women in our education and training systems; and recognition of women, to name just a few. To produce a report of this magnitude and in the time frame available to us is an indication of the degree of cooperation and goodwill among members of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While supporting the majority of recommendations, as the Chairman has mentioned, the Opposition has included a dissenting report. We believe, and have grave concern, that some of the recommendations proposed could actually have the result of discriminating against women. In particular, I refer, though briefly because of time constraints, to recommendation 67 that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission determinations be registrable in the Federal Court of Australia and that, in the absence of an appeal, they automatically become an enforceable order of the court. We believe this is moving away from the conciliation and educative model of the Commission, would work against women and would be very expensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a comfortable process now for women to come forward to make a complaint of being sexually discriminated against. If that process were to move towards a more litigious system, we believe that could deter women from accessing the complaint process. Although there was some conflicting evidence disputing the claim by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission that 97 per cent of cases are successfully conciliated or not proceeded with, there was overwhelming evidence pointing not only to the effectiveness of the conciliation model in settling complaints but also to the fact that the conciliation method, rather than an adversarial approach, is more likely to achieve more lasting results, especially in an employment context where parties, of necessity, have to maintain an ongoing relationship. We believe that the only people who will be advantaged by this recommendation will be the lawyers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of concern for us relates to the recommendations expanding affirmative action to include small business and the voluntary sector. We do not believe that this Committee can, or should, make such recommendations when it did not take comprehensive evidence on these subjects. In supporting that the Affirmative Action Agency be resourced to undertake qualitative assessment of reports received, we believe that it would be more appropriate to research these areas thoroughly and to evaluate the impact of such recommendations before recommending any action. The inquiry and evidence that this report is based on did not provide the necessary information on which to make such recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in the brief time available, I highlight some of the areas in this report that we believe have long needed attention and, hopefully, as a result of this report will receive the attention they deserve. The first of these is the superb work done by women as volunteers. The fabric of our society would be threadbare without it, but it is often undervalued and unrecognised. In reality, voluntary work makes a very significant contribution to the economic and social life of the nation, and many rural communities in particular would cease to function without it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For these reasons we believe it is important to undertake a study to determine the nature and extent of voluntary work as well as to gather information concerning those who give their time and labour voluntarily and the skills that women gain from voluntary work in organisation, management and communication. These could be recognised as appropriate training skills in the paid work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would particularly like to draw the attention of the House to a group of women who are frequently overlooked and omitted from studies: rural women. I am very pleased to see that they were not overlooked in this study. Almost 2 1/2 million women live outside urban areas. While the percentage of farms has been decreasing, the number of women who are farmers in their own right or who manage farms has been increasing. Rural women frequently have workloads equivalent to two or three full time jobs, but are often described as not having a job. Many describe their occupation as home duties when there is clear evidence that they undertake an enormous range of voluntary community work and often describe farm work, which can range from driving the tractor, dipping sheep or doing the books, as home duties. The most recent estimate of the contribution that rural women make to the national economy was the 1986 estimate by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Farmer</EMPHASIS> magazine of $6m annually. Hopefully, the recommendations contained in this report, in particular a revision of the agricultural census, will remedy this situation and will achieve for rural women the recognition they deserve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to mention our strong support for the recommendations relating to superannuation, specifically those provisions relating to the interrupted work patterns of women in the paid work force and investigating the possibility of accessing a proportion of superannuation savings towards the purchase of accommodation. I must add that, while this report makes these recommendations, the coalition's Fightback program has already led the way and adopted these measures as policy. In fact, the Fightback program goes further for women, particularly for women at home in the unpaid work force, by allowing spouses and partners to make superannuation contributions on their behalf. That is positive recognition of the value of women's work in the unpaid work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For women in both the paid and unpaid work force child-care is a critical issue, particularly for women and children with disabilities. We particularly want to commend the Committee for recommending the elimination of duplication between all three levels of government and for recommending that the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services needs to reassess its fee relief structure. We believe that there should be no discrimination between women in the paid work force and those at home in the unpaid work force. Any two-tiered approach to fee relief for child-care would make women in the unpaid work force second-class citizens&mdash;and we will never support that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate that we support the majority of the recommendations in this report, apart from the main areas that both my colleague and I have mentioned. However, we would add that, in spite of the diversity of public opinion sought, it is disappointing that there are not more recommendations for older women, as they are an increasing percentage of our population, and that there is no recommendation concerning women involved in domestic violence. Although domestic violence has been increasing at an alarming rate, it is continually ignored by all levels of government, the judiciary, the police and society at large. There is nothing more debilitating, nothing that reduces a woman's self-esteem more and nothing that reduces her choices more, than being the victim of domestic violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, it is our hope that the recommendations contained in this report do not become entangled in political theory and ideology, but are able to be translated into fair and practical measures that will benefit not only the highly educated and articulate women but the lives of all women. </PARA>

In line with this tradition, last October the Defence Subcommittee inspected the joint defence facilities at Nurrungar and Pine Gap and several defence establishments in the Northern Territory. The decision by the Defence Subcommittee to visit northern Australia reflects the recent focus of defence planners on the north. In August last year the Subcommittee conducted the first phase of its inspections of northern defence establishments when it visited north Queensland and the Torres Strait. This report describes the second phase of the Subcommittee's inspections in the north.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This visit coincided with the final stages of the Subcommittee's inquiry into the Australian Defence Force reserves. The inquiry benefited from the opportunity given to the Subcommittee to inspect the Reserve force called Norforce, which is one of three regional force surveillance units located in northern Australia. Norforce was raised on 1 July 1981 to provide a tactical ground surveillance capability in the Top End. It is on 28 days notice to move for operations. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The visit to the Northern Territory provided opportunities for the Subcommittee to inspect RAAF bases Tindal and Darwin. We were briefed on the respective roles of these two bases. Some concern was expressed to the Subcommittee that some projects had been delayed as a result of uncertainty about the future of RAAF Base Darwin in the light of the role ascribed to Tindal. The view was put to the Subcommittee that RAAF Base Darwin can only be defended from Darwin and that this cannot be done effectively from Tindal. The Subcommittee was made aware that some concerns are held, firstly, about the impact of civilianisation in the particular situation of the Darwin base in a cyclone and, secondly, about the impact of defence regional support review on operational readiness at Darwin. </PARA>

While members appreciated the opportunity to see facilities at first hand, it should be noted that the Subcommittee received an unclassified briefing. The Subcommittee was very concerned to find that publicly available printed knowledge of the joint facilities exceeded the information which was made available to the Subcommittee during the briefing. Indeed, the Subcommittee noted that information appearing on the congressional record of the United States is not made officially available to Australian members of parliament. </PARA>

The Subcommittee observed, however, that the change in the position of the Government of Australia representative was not reflected in the relationship which exists between the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and the media with respect to public disclosure of information. Information which is publicly available in Australia does not parallel that which is publicly available in the United States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, the Subcommittee is appreciative of the efforts made by all concerned in the arrangements for the inspections and for the opportunities provided for informal discussions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I wish to make a few observations about the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report on the Visit of the Defence Sub-Committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to Nurrungar-Woomera and Northern Territory, October 1991</EMPHASIS>, to which the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) has just referred. I will start by commenting on the matter to which he referred in respect of the joint facilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found it a little embarrassing, as one who is fully briefed on the joint facilities&mdash;as is my colleague the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock)&mdash;in that my colleagues were advised so little about the nature of the activities of the facilities. I find it even more embarrassing that those who are members of the United States Congress are given a far more comprehensive briefing than is available to any member of the Australian Parliament&mdash;other than those who are in the small category of the Ministry and, as I understand it, a few in the Opposition. There may be a few others but, if there are, I am not aware of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say three things about this. Firstly, it is totally unacceptable, in a joint facility, for a greater measure of disclosure to be available to the American partner and its parliamentary representatives than to the Australian partner. It is no use explaining that the United States Congress has a different responsibility. As far as the Australian people are concerned, we are in a direct line&mdash;having been elected to represent them&mdash;to the same measure as the members of the United States Congress represent the American people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the United States has a different constitutional structure, it should not be in the transcripts of congressional committees that we read of the nature and activities of those joint facilities. Indeed, it has been remarkable that over the years men such as Professor Ball have been able to produce and publish in Australia almost all of the information they had on the facilities using the congressional record. It is something which I believe the Government needs to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that it is important for people to understand that in this post-Cold War era the nature and character of the obligations of those joint facilities are changing. It is even more important that there is within the Australian Parliament&mdash;certainly for the Defence Subcommittee, for a select number of other people, and certainly for those who are representatives of the Senate and the House of Representatives&mdash;an opportunity to receive some briefings on the changed direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point that worries me equally is that we are told that there is to be a greater measure of Australian involvement. That means that this Parliament has a greater obligation as to the funds which are directed there. As this report comments, it is surprising that the financial contribution at the moment goes to the Alice Springs area. For example, we have referred to the fact that about 20 per cent of the input of the whole Pine Gap facility goes into the Alice Springs area. That represents $28.5m in salaries, local contracting at a value of $17m, local purchasing of supplies in the region of $7m, rentals at $42.2m, and donations amounting to $250,000. All of us who have been to Alice Springs understand this. It even has one of the best baseball diamonds in Australia, and it is all because of the American involvement. But let us be realistic; if the Government wishes to change the nature of the Australian involvement, it is even more critical that we should be briefed on the subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is important that we pay tribute to the work being undertaken by Norforce. All those northern surveillance, reconnaissance and patrol units&mdash;the 51st Far North Queensland Rifles, the Pilbara regiment and Norforce are three&mdash;operate in a magnificent way with the local people. I have now been fortunate to see each of them in action on a number of occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work they do needs to be commended. They virtually have the same role in war as they have in peace, and I am told that much of the work they do has as much relevance to civilian requirements and surveillance as it does to military requirements in time of war. We have worries about boat people landing in the north, and it should be said that in many ways Norforce and its parallel units are very much the eyes and ears of the people of the north. The observations they make of the activities of people in the region are of enormous value. They are very fine elements of the Australian Defence Force and I would like to pay particular tribute to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, of course, other aspects of the report which I would like to mention but cannot address now. However I should comment&mdash;and the honourable member for Kooyong is in the House&mdash;that the decision the coalition Government took concerning the establishment of the main RAAF base at Tindal is one of which I remain inordinately proud. More than anything else that decision gave momentum to the further development of the RAAF's presence in northern Australia. It has enabled a base squadron to operate from there and to ensure that the other bare bases that operate in Western Australia, the Northern Territory and in future in the northern tip of Cape York are going to be able to provide the air cover that is very much a complementary part of the defence assessment that is commonly accepted by both sides of this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night when the adjournment motion was moved I was part heard on the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Amendment Bill 1992 and the Opposition's response to it. I had indicated that we were not opposing the Bill, but that we had three concerns. We had one particular and deep concern about proposed section 8A. I was indicating the depth of our concern and detailing many of the authorities behind the factors that I was raising. I was saying that, given the net cast by the provisions of the principal Act in terms of offences relating to dealings with drugs is extremely wide, it is wholly inappropriate, as the Gibbs committee recognised, for the requisite mental element of such offences as are covered by this Bill to be anything less than recklessness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give an example, provision is made for an offence of manufacturing, transporting or distributing any substance, equipment or material with the knowledge that such articles may be used for a purpose relating to a dealing in drugs. If the test in proposed section 8A were adopted, that is without qualification, innocent persons could be prosecuted in circumstances where they had no actual knowledge that, first, the article in question was within their control and, second, the relevant article was to be used for such an illegal purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a result would be contrary to the position taken by the High Court in the 1985 decision of He Kaw Teh v. the Queen. In that case it was held that, for the purposes of a prosecution under the Customs Act, it must be established that the defendant knew of the existence of the prohibited imports in whatever receptacle he was carrying them. In contrast, if proposed section 8A became law&mdash;and again I emphasise if it became law without qualification&mdash;the prosecution would need to prove only that the defendant ought to have known of the existence of the prohibited imports. I cannot overemphasise the importance of the fundamental principle that criminal intent can never be imputed; it must always be established firmly and unequivocally by the prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are the factors behind the concern that we have in relation to proposed section 8A. I said last night that we support the Bill, that we support strong measures against drugs. The Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Amendment Bill is the sort of measure that ought be supported, notwithstanding our concerns. I emphasise the depth of our concern regarding the question of presumptions and assumptions of knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for the sake of the record that our concerns be noted and that the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) or his representative&mdash;I see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney General (Mr Duncan) is here&mdash;address the matters that I raised last night in summing up the debate. In passing measures designed to deter and properly punish criminal activity, the Parliament must never lose sight of the ultimate objective&mdash;the preservation of individual liberty. Any proposed legislation which may weaken the safeguards for ensuring that every individual receives a fair and proper trial in accordance with the traditions of our common law must be subjected to the most vigorous scrutiny. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On February 14 1989 Australia signed the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. The purpose of the United Nations convention is to encourage and develop international cooperation in a wide range of measures designed to stamp out the illicit drug trade. The European Economic Community and about 55 countries have ratified the convention. However, before Australia can ratify the convention it must ensure that its laws and administrative practices are established so as to give effect to its obligations under the convention. This Bill is designed to fill the so-called gaps in State and Territory legislation and thereby satisfy the various obligations under the drug trafficking convention until appropriate State and Territory legislation has been put into effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that there has been international pressure on Australia to ratify the convention as soon as possible. I know the Federal Government is keen to ratify the convention. It should also be said that if Australia is to encourage other countries to accept the convention, particularly in Latin America, Asia and the Pacific, it would be in a more persuasive position if it had ratified the drug trafficking convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, ratification of the convention is one of the recommendations of the financial action task force on money laundering. Australia is a strong supporter of the financial action task force. Indeed, the new Chairman of the National Crime Authority, Mr Tom Sherman, is to become chairman of the task force during 1992-93. The financial action task force will meet in Australia in September this year under his chairmanship. In addition, Australia is currently the subject of a financial action task force evaluation as to what progress Australia has made in implementing the recommendations of the task force&mdash;and one of those, as I said earlier, was ratification of the convention. A task force team was recently in Australia to examine these matters. The task force will consider the team's report on Australia's progress on this issue on 14 May. It need hardly be said that Australia could be subject to valid criticism if Australia does not ratify the drug trafficking convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obligations prescribed by the convention which come within Commonwealth legislative responsibility are met by existing legislation, such as the Customs Act 1901, the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 and the Extradition Act 1988. As a consequence of article 4 of the convention, which deals with jurisdiction, new Commonwealth legislation was necessary. The Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act 1990 gives effect to the extraterritorial jurisdiction prescribed in article 4. The States and Territories have responsibility for certain other obligations. Therefore, in order to preserve existing State-Territory and Commonwealth relations, and the State-Territory and Commonwealth balance of responsibilities in the drugs area, the Commonwealth has sought cooperation in enacting legislation to meet mandatory convention obligations. This contributes to preserving existing arrangements with respect to enforcement agencies such as drug squads, courts and prisons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three jurisdictions&mdash;Tasmania, Western Australia and the Northern Territory&mdash;are in the process of enacting legislation to meet the requirements of the convention. These areas of legislation include issues such as money laundering and the confiscation of the proceeds of crime. Nevertheless, the exigencies of the situation require this Bill to be passed as soon as possible if ratification of the convention by Australia is to become effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill does not create any drug offences but defines various offences called `serious State drug offences' involving `dealing in drugs'. These are serious offences which are identified by the convention and which are also State-Territory offences. The phrase `dealing in drugs' is defined in clause 4, within the terms of the convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill contains three new proposed sections, namely, 15A, 15B and 15C, which will make it a Commonwealth offence to launder money or other property known to be acquired or otherwise obtained from one of these `serious State drug offences'. These proposed new Commonwealth offences created in the sections are based on the drug trafficking convention and indeed follow its terminology closely, having regard to article 3. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Upon conviction of these offences, the provisions of the Commonwealth Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 will apply with respect to `tainted property'. This will ensure that those jurisdictions that do not yet have appropriate legislation with respect to the confiscation of proceeds of crime will now be able to rely upon the provisions of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides for a new section 22. This will enable regulations to be made limiting the offence provisions relating to money laundering to States and Territories which are not prescribed. These prescribed jurisdictions are those where there is legislation making it an offence to launder money. This means that the legislation will apply only to those jurisdictions which have not enacted money laundering provisions. In view of the limited amount of time, I will close my remarks by complimenting the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) on what was a very informative and learned speech. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;In closing the debate on the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Amendment Bill, I want to thank all honourable members who have taken part, particularly the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock). I thought his contribution was sensitive and positive. Whilst I did not quite agree with some of the conclusions he made, I know that he made them with the best intention&mdash;that being, of course, that we get the best piece of legislation out of and through the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Kooyong dealt with a number of issues in his contribution, particularly last evening, and I want to deal with those as he raised them. Firstly, there is the issue of Commonwealth-State responsibilities. The first point I want to make is that it was not the objective of this Bill to alter State, Territory and Commonwealth relations and balance of responsibilities in the drug area. The purpose of the Bill is to make the minimum necessary changes to the law that will enable Australia to ratify the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances without further delay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill is, therefore, intended to apply only in those States and Territories which have not yet enacted legislation to make it an offence to launder money or property which is derived from drug trafficking. Of course, the provisions of the Bill will not apply in those States and Territories which have enacted money laundering legislation and, where it does apply, the Bill will cease to apply once jurisdictions have enacted legislation on money laundering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consultations with the States and the Northern Territory took place in December 1985, informing them of the proposals for negotiating a new drug convention. Those consultations have continued since February 1989, when Australia signed the new convention. That was more than three years ago and, although all States and Territories have expressed their willingness to enact appropriate legislation, some have not yet done so. All States have been consulted about the legislation before the House and, with one exception, there is no objection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a State or Territory wishes to do so&mdash;and we are speaking here of only three jurisdictions affected&mdash;the timetable would operate in this way: Australia's instrument of ratification will not be lodged until after the Bill now before the House is enacted; entry into force of the convention for Australia will not occur until 90 days from that lodgment. On the assumption that this Bill would pass both Houses during May, that leaves until some time in September at the earliest before supporting legislation would need to commence. If States and Territories can enact and bring into force their legislation by that date, I see no need for the Commonwealth legislation to become operative in relation to them at all. However, I do believe that we still need to press on with this Bill to cover the possibility that one or more jurisdictions will not have met the mandatory convention obligations in full by that date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, it is neither the purpose nor the practical effect of the Bill to change the present balance of responsibilities between the States and Territories and the Commonwealth in the drugs area. I would simply repeat that all States have expressed their willingness to pass this legislation, but for various reasons three jurisdictions have not yet come into line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to turn to the issue of the threshold of 12 months. The 12-month threshold is necessary in the definition of `serious State drug offence' in order to catch all the relevant `drug offences' under State and Territory legislation  and to bring them within the terms of the convention. An alternative approach would have been to ensure that all relevant drug offences were punishable by whatever higher penalty might be thought appropriate to attract the laundering offence, but that would involve an unnecessary change to existing penalty levels. So it was thought that the best way to do it was with a 12-month threshold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to turn to the issue of knowledge and purpose which was raised by the honourable member for Kooyong. This is an important issue which he has raised and one which I do not think can be rushed in our dealing with it. These words are used in the offence provisions of the Bill in sections 15A, 15B and 15C, which provide, for example:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any person who, knowing that any property was derived from a serious State drug offence. . . converts that property to his or her own use. . . for the purpose of. . . concealing or disguising that the property was derived from the offence. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Those words are also used in the principal Act, for example in section 9:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person who has in his or her possession, in Australia, any substance. . . knowing that the substance, equipment or materials are being used or are to be used in, or for, a dealing in drugs. . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the mental element does not alter the present common law. I will return to that in a moment. This legislation is intended to give effect to certain provisions of an international convention. It is being enacted under the external affairs power and, to avoid any doubts about it being within its power, should follow the language of the convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph (3), dealing with the elements of the specified offences, is an integral part of article 3 of the convention, which describes the conduct that is to be made the subject of the required offences. The inclusion of the language of paragraph (3) in the law creating the offences removes any argument that the statute, by describing the offences without reference to the particular wording of paragraph (3), intended to exclude the method of proof referred to in paragraph (3). The safest course in creating offences set out in the treaty is to follow the language of the treaty as fully as may be convenient. The Australian statute can be expected to be scrutinised in the course of the United Nations review of all national laws enacted to give effect to the convention and required by its article to be supplied to the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inclusion of proposed section 8A shows that, subject to Australian law, we have given effect to that provision of the convention that says that knowledge, intent or purpose in drug offences set out in the convention can be inferred from objective factual circumstances. It is clear that this provision has effect within the relevant principles of Australian criminal law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the suggestion that the offence provisions, as drafted within proposed section 8A, offend against existing principles of criminal liability by introducing an objective test instead of requiring actual knowledge or intent. This simply is not so. The court must be satisfied as to actual knowledge or intent on the part of the defendant. Under existing law, such knowledge or intention may be inferred from proven objective circumstances. This was made clear in the case of Pereira v. the Director of Public Prosecutions, to which the honourable member for Kooyong referred last evening. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I entirely accept the considerations to be observed in making use of such evidence that were set out by the High Court in Pereira's case. I think there were three qualifications. I have no doubt that a court, in construing the proposed subsection 8A(1), would apply the test as set out in Pereira's case&mdash;that is, by using the words set out in the proposed subsection 8A(1), the law as stated in Pereira's case would then apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With reference to the fault elements, which were analysed by the Committee for the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law, chaired by Sir Harry Gibbs, in relation to the various mens rea possibilities the Committee recommended the use of the concepts of knowingly, intentionally, recklessly and negligently. Each of those mental states is quite different from the others. We do not need to discuss when one or the other of them is appropriate. The provisions of the Bill before the House are directed to instances in which the fault elements are knowledge, intention or purpose. It deals with the method of proof and does not alter the existing law as to how those elements are to be proven. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Construction Industry Reform and Development Bill 1992 is to establish the Construction Industry Development Council and the Construction Industry Development Agency as part of the Government's so-called construction industry reform strategy. The Council is intended to be an industry forum and to advise the Government on its so-called strategy. The agency which will be incorporated and have its own chief executive officer is to implement the strategy but the agency will have only a limited life, ceasing to exist on 30 June 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the Council and the agency are part of an extravagant Government initiative called the building industry reform strategy, which the Government says is integral to its program of micro-economic reform. This highly structured tripartite exercise was announced by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) in September 1990. It has involved several departments and Ministers, has generated a steady stream of documentation, committees and committee reports, draft codes, in-principle agreements, et cetera, and has been replete with seminars and prime ministerial launches. Twenty months later, the exercise has cost several million dollars and is expected to cost an additional $11m during the next three years. To date all it has generated is talk of reform and the creation of a bureaucracy to achieve it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition opposes this legislation and its intrusive mechanisms. It is clear that the Government is pre-empting the Gyles Royal Commission into Productivity in the Building Industry in New South Wales which may bring down recommendations which will make this legislation totally unnecessary. Moreover, the transfer of $1.5m worth of surplus funds from the Construction Employees Redundancy Trust to the Construction Industry Development Agency created by this Bill is of questionable legality. Certainly the Commissioner in the New South Wales inquiry, Mr Gyles, has been reported as saying that the transfer involved a very serious legal question as to whether or not it was an appropriate procedure. </PARA>

One estimate is that full unionisation of medium density housing construction in Sydney will produce a cost of $1,100 per square metre compared with $600 per square metre for the non-unionised home building industry. The Housing Industry Association was reported today as stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Building companies which operate in unionised medium-density housing estimate that labour productivity is 40% below sub-contract labour in non-unionised housing sites. If labour costs were to increase by 40% on housing sites because of productivity losses the cost of an average $100,000 home would increase by $16,000. Some case studies show that extra costs of 35% are not uncommon where a housing site is unionised.</PARA>
<PARA>In the State of Victoria today a bricklayer will charge around 38c to lay one face brick for a house&mdash;remember that, 38c. If that same bricklayer were to lay the same brick for a factory, a school or a church he would receive around 73c for the same work. This massive difference of almost 100 per cent is that the major construction industry is unionised with prices controlled by cartels and with legislated and legalised restrictive work practices enhanced by the `no ticket, no start' rule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, the housing sector is dominated by small builders using independent subcontractors in a competitive environment. The royal commission in New South Wales commissioned a survey which revealed that building workers themselves wanted their trade unions to have less influence and inflict less interference. The workers viewed the building unions as a major impediment to labour reform and the smooth running of building sites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might prove helpful to honourable members for me to briefly review some of the statements made by the Minister in his second reading speech which he incorporated in the Senate on 19 December 1991. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill represents an important part of the Government's construction industry reform strategy.</PARA>
<PARA>On 3 December 1991 the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, in a speech launching the Government's industry reform strategy, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The construction industry reform strategy marks the beginning of a cooperative effort to solve some of the most intractable, I repeat intractable, issues in this vital industry and to nurture its considerable strengths. Costs for major projects are estimated to be up to 20 per cent higher than those of our major competitors.</PARA>
<PARA>That was from our ex-Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true in every sense of the word that Australia's major construction industry requires reform. A more inefficient, intractable, contrived and controlled industry would be difficult to find. Industrial relations mechanisms are archaic and the inefficiencies following from archaic and historical work practices are literally beyond belief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will leave for others to describe construction industry rorts, failings and inefficiencies with respect to the industry in New South Wales and Queensland. I will concentrate on my home State of Victoria. In a very real sense, I came to this Parliament out of frustration over my inability to help to effect reform in the construction industry in Victoria from within that industry. It was my spectacular lack of success in dealing with entrenched interests in the club that led to my candidacy for the seat of La Trobe at the election which was held on 24 March 1990. Anyone who read my maiden speech in this place would have no doubt that that was so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reform is the basis of this Bill. I confirm that the major construction industry in Australia is in desperate need of reform. We have no competition in an external sense for construction of major buildings. We cannot build 50-storey skyscrapers in downtown Melbourne and ship them to Hong Kong. Inefficiencies in our major construction industry cost the taxpayer in increased costs of construction for public works projects which run on into increased borrowings and costs to fund government Budget deficits. It is the Australian community, our society, which pays for construction industry rorts and malpractice through decreased standards of living for each and every one of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we need a hospital or a school, there is no competition for the publicly owned hospital or for the publicly owned school in a real sense, so that cost inefficiencies and capital acquisition never face the searing heat of real competition. The Australian building and construction industry is a giant cartel supported and controlled by the industrial relations club. Giant vested interests will support this Bill and build the worst and most expensive of practices into a national code of conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister in his second reading speech said that the purpose of the Bill was to establish the Construction Industry Development Agency and the Construction Industry Development Council. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The in-principle agreement commits the parties to improve the performance of the industry to world-class practice and standards. It identifies specific areas where improved efficiency and productivity can be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA>The agency, the Council and the in-principle agreement commit the `club'&mdash;that is, major building contractors; building owners and managers; the major unions, being largely today the BWIU; the industry associations; State industrial relations departments; the Federal Industrial Relations Department; and, ultimately the grandaddy of them all, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;to say nice things about each other and come to an agreement to further centralise wages and conditions of employment in Australia's construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reform in terms of this exercise will undoubtedly mean the adoption of a national code of conduct for the industry which will pick the best, or the worst&mdash;depending on how one views the issues of the points&mdash;of the various State codes of conduct for building and construction. The current code of conduct in Victoria for the Department for Planning and Housing requires building contractors and all their subcontractors to adhere to the awards, to adhere to the national wage case, to prohibit all-in payments and to make certain that the Victorian Building Industry Agreement, which requires `no ticket, no start', is incorporated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so far as the reform strategy addresses building regulations, we on this side of the House have no quarrel with the established groups. But we have a great deal of difficulty in accepting and approving the `club' having any involvement in the reform of building industry industrial relations or practice. In order to implement the Government's plan for reform, a highly structured so-called tripartite organisation has been established which basically involves the making of another bureaucracy made up from a number of significant players in the industry. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date, the parties have agreed on a great number of motherhood-type statements, but all with the central design and purpose of producing uniformity throughout the industry under the banner of centralised agreement and control. The Iron Curtain may well have fallen in Germany, but we are now in the process of re-erecting that curtain around our island continent of Australia in so far as building construction is concerned. The in-principle agreement commits all parties to achieving specific objectives. It specifies performance standards for contractors, but not for employees. It agrees on commonality and uniformity&mdash;one would assume at the lowest common denominator. On the use of public works to enforce the in-principle agreement it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry parties note the express acknowledgment by Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers of the need to use the purchasing power of government as a vehicle for implementation of the reform process.</PARA>
<PARA>In case anyone in this place is in any doubt as to the meaning of that statement, let me simply put to the House that it is the intent of the agreement to use publicly funded capital works projects to reduce the number of building contractors, reduce the number of employer organisations in the industry and achieve uniformity, undoubtedly at the expense of productivity, and a reduction in the number of projects we will be able to construct for the number of dollars we have available to spend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that no-one intends to ask the small or medium sized building contractors how they would apply their innovative solutions to building construction to achieve improved productivity and lower costs. These innovative small and medium sized companies will be not be asked their views of what constitutes a restrictive work practice, or how to eliminate it. This Bill is a recipe for disaster in terms of construction cost efficiency. One need only look at the very marked difference in cost efficiency between the largely subcontract oriented housing building sector and major construction to be immediately convinced of the error of continuing down the path of centralised regulation and control. This Bill is an ACTU Bill. It is a `club' Bill. It is not a user's Bill. It is not a taxpayer's Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government speakers in this debate will undoubtedly raise the charge of scaremongering with respect to those who claim that this Bill may provide a pathway for the BWIU to infiltrate the housing industry. The fact is that the Bill establishes a mechanism for regulation which will give the unions their desired foothold. I refer honourable members to Victoria where home building contractors, faced with a totally unionised roof tiling trade sector, switched to steel deck roofs, only to find that the regulatory authorities then decreed that only a licensed plumber with a union ticket would be able to fix a metal tray deck roof&mdash;compulsory union membership ipso facto. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second leg of the Minister's efforts to destroy subcontracting will be contained in amendments to the Industrial Relations Act yet to be proclaimed which will allow the AIRC to meddle in contracts of employment or engagement with respect to contractors or subcontractors. The Minister's third mechanism will be amendments to section 45D of The Trade Practices Act, to water down sanctions against unions and allow them to take militant industrial action to force employers to hire employees, rather than contractors, and extend compulsory union membership into the housing sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian Building Industry Agreement is a model industry code of practice established by major contractors and major unions, and without competitive pressure. High holding costs associated with major construction and the fragmented nature of the industry have allowed the unions to pressure employers with demands which, under competitive situations, they might well have rejected. It is these demands which have resulted in inefficient and sometimes unconscionable work practices already entrenched in the industry which will be further set in concrete and cast in place should this Parliament support this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian Building Industry Agreement says in clause 6.4 that financial union membership is regulated by the agreement. A fundamental breach is where an employer&mdash;an employer only&mdash;is alleged to be in fundamental breach of the terms and conditions of the agreement, and the employees affected by that alleged breach may decline to work as directed in the area affected by the alleged breach. There is absolutely nothing about an employee's breach of contract. </PARA>

It shall determine whether an employer has committed a fundamental breach of the terms and conditions of the agreement, the terms of resolution of the dispute, and entitlements to payment where employees have declined to work as directed because of such a breach.

<PARA>All of the impetus of control and performance is upon the employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 14 is entitled `Superannuation/Long Service Leave'. Clause 14.1 states:</PARA>

<PARA>Clause 22.2 states:</PARA>

<PARA>And so it goes on. Mr Paul White, senior director of Concrete Constructions, in an address to the Construction 1992 seminar in Sydney last November, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian builders are poor performers because construction is the only industry in which behaviour of companies is not governed by customer's needs. For the construction industry, profit is not the difference between the sale price of a product and its cost but the bit that is added onto the cost&mdash;a very different thing, and not at all considerate of industry clients.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of performance our industry has, over time, created an expectation of delays of 10-40 per cent where only the amount of delay is discussed. The industry has come to accept low productivity where only 1 day in 2 is expected to be worked after we account for holidays, rostered days off, sick leave, weekends and wet weather.</PARA>
<PARA>In order to implement an agreement for a 38-hour week in Victoria, employers were forced to concede a rostered day off once every four weeks on a specified day, closing down all construction sites just so union organisers can make sure that employees take their rostered day off. It is an unbelievable nonsense that in 1992 an industry would shut down for 13 days a year for the convenience of a handful of union organisers. That cost is of benefit to no-one, with the exception of a few union officials. It is instructive that the in-principle agreement lists restrictive practices which should be addressed in order to improve industry efficiency and productivity, but nowhere is the issue of that restrictive work practice, a variable rostered day off&mdash;which would reduce construction costs, shorten construction time, increase the number of employees in the industry&mdash;even mentioned, much less addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that reform of archaic work practices in the construction industry would proceed apace were voluntary union membership to apply. The ability of employers and employees to strike their own agreement on wages and conditions of employment would, undoubtedly, rid the industry of the two drops of rain on a cigarette paper syndrome, of uniform rostered days off, of triple time for Sundays, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now refer to voluntary membership of association. Voluntary union membership is a concept which the ACTU, the union bureaucracy and Labor members opposite in this place time and time again maintain is practice in Australia.

<PARA>Clearly compulsory union membership&mdash;no ticket, no start&mdash;is alive and well in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reform envisaged by this Bill or resulting from this Bill will have many negative aspects which I will reiterate as follows: first, the big stick approach will allow the Federal Government to force State governments and contractors to toe the line on codes of practice and, under threat of not being accepted, to tender for government financed projects. Second, this Bill will assist the ACTU to rid industry of individual contractors and sub-contractors&mdash;a major Kelty initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Third, the Bill will entrench the worst and most expensive work practices and benefits to be found anywhere in Australia in the industry today. Fourth, implementation of the Bill will establish a new bureaucracy&mdash;a big brother over building and construction.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seventh, the Bill will extend the BWIU reach into housing construction, putting at risk current efficiency, productivity and high quality at an affordable price. Eighth, the Bill enhances the rhetoric of reform rather than substance which could obtain by deregulation, not by further control. Ninth, the codes of practice established by the parties to the in-principle agreement enabled by this Bill will lock out innovation rather than encourage new competitive practice.

That is where the attitude on the other side of this House, which is nurtured in the H. R. Nicholls Society, comes from. As I have said, the only pleasing thing about these debates that will go on over the next 12 months is that they clearly distinguish between the philosophical background and the philosophical belief that those on the Opposition side of the House have and that those on our side of House have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to work and safety, the previous speaker complained about two drops on a cigarette paper. Let me tell him this: if there is one drop on a cigarette paper, it is enough to walk off steel scaffolding. Work and safety is the same in the coal industry. My great grandfather was stuck down a mine at seven years of age, and I am damn sure that I am not going to go see my grandchildren treated in the same way as he was treated. The only reason that did not happen and the only reason that it cannot happen is because of a trade union movement and a government that is not prepared to sell out the working men and women of this country. That is what this is all about. It is incredible that while this Bill is about reforming and restructuring construction the Opposition is so driven by this inherent belief in destroying the union movement that it is opposing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is so incredible that the yuppies in the H. R. Nicholls Society are dominating the philosophy of those on the other side of the House. Let me tell Opposition members this when it comes to Fightback and let me tell them this when it comes to their philosophy: we are coming to get them from Cooktown to the steps of the Melbourne Club and the baggage of Fightback will be spread all over the landscape from Cooktown to the steps of the Melbourne Club, just like the German war machine was spread from the beaches of Normandy to Berlin. I tell Opposition members that the people of this country are not prepared to accept the philosophical driven, dry ideas from their side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the amount of effort that has been put into this Bill, I would like to compliment the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) and also the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) who have shown a lot of innovation and a lot of vision in this regard. There is no doubt that there has been a need to improve the construction industry. That is what this Bill is all about. But it is not about improving it by taking away health and safety; it is not about improving it by taking away holiday leave loading and penalty rates; it is not about doing those sorts of things that will deprive workers in the industry of conditions. It is about achieving it by working together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one really wants to look at the so-called free enterprise, bright, new, dry vision of construction, one can see it in Hong Kong where they work on bamboo scaffolds. One can see it in Singapore. But that is not what we accept in Australia as the standards that we would like to have. While it is philosophically opposed by those on the other side of the House to have unionised labour in this country, it is incredible that I have never heard anyone on that side of the House wanting to break up the lawyers club and wanting to break up the AMA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was said by the previous speaker that the customers' needs are not necessarily met by having unionised workers. Let me tell Opposition members that it may not be the case that all the customers' needs are necessarily met by the club that runs the health system in this country; by that I mean the pathologists in the AMA. But I have never heard anyone on the other side of the House kick them in the shins. I have never heard anyone on the other side of the House kick the lawyers or the judges or anyone else who is on a high wage. But it is very easy to kick someone who wears a blue singlet, a pair of work boots and a pair of shorts. It is very easy to kick someone who does not have a degree and who lives in a leafy suburb. It is only those people on this side of the House who believe in organised labour, the union movement and that everyone deserves a fair go who will defend the very conditions that it has taken one hundred years to implement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to union labour, I fully agree and support the proposal that if anyone wants to work in this country, he has a moral responsibility to have a union ticket. The Opposition is prepared to sit back and accept the conditions that are gained through the money that union members pay and advocate through the Industrial Commission and anyone who does not buy a union ticket is having a free ride. To the two honourable members on the other side of the House who would disagree I would like to tell a story that was told to me by an 85 year-old man two years ago. He said to me, `I used to cut cane on your property when your grandfather was alive'. He said, `I never had to buy a union ticket in my life because he bought it for me and gave it to me when I walked through the gate'. The only reason he did it was that he knew what it was like to try get a job when he was 11 years of age. The jobs in those days were taken up by Kanakas or South Sea Islanders who were slaves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the information of the honourable member for La Trobe&mdash;I am sure that he does not need it&mdash;the sugar industry in Queensland was just as it existed in the old days in Virginia, Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina. That did not change because we waved a wand. It changed because young people of that age, my family included, formed a union, called the sugar workers union, that chucked out the third rate aristocrats from England that ran the plantation system in the sugar industry in Queensland, instituted award conditions, got rid of Kanaka labour and actually paid people a decent rate of pay. The Opposition's philosophy is about breaking down the very conditions that have brought people in the last one hundred years to where we are today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument is that because things have been tough it is not the time to pay award wages and now is the time to dud people with the same argument that was used in 1890. Philosophy on the other side of the House has never changed. When we talk about work practices, why workers do not work longer and why workers should get holiday pay, I would like some of the honourable members on the other side of the House to go to the golf clubs and the bowls club on Wednesday afternoons to have a look at some of the efficient business people that are duding themselves by having that extra round of golf and having a game of bowls instead of being at the coalface in their own factories. These are the  blokes that want to spend 250 grand on a Mercedes instead of putting that money back into machinery in their factories, which will make them more competitive. Those people who are doing that are leading the edge for this country. Those who want to bludge, wear an extra better yuppie suit and play an extra game of bowls are the blokes that are going broke and want to bludge by taking away the wage structure of the workers of this country. We are opposed to it. I support this Bill. If the Opposition had any commonsense, it would chuck away Fightback and it would change its attitude on industrial relations. It is the very thing that is going to cut its throat at the very next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Construction Industry Reform and Development Bill is one of the clearest examples of the differences between Australia's two main political parties. The Labor Government and the coalition are poles apart in many respects. In recent times most attention has focused on the differences in our economic policies, between the Government's so-called One Nation statement and the coalition's comprehensive Fightback package of reforms. On the one hand, we have the Government promising a fistful of dollars, without knowing where the money is coming from;  on the other, we have Fightback, a package which is fully funded and a responsible strategy for combating the nation's structural and economic weaknesses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, however, one policy area of massive importance that has largely been overlooked recently, and that is industrial relations. This is despite the fact that every single Australian is affected, either directly or indirectly, by what happens on the industrial relations front. Whether it is a demarcation dispute which results in power blackouts, a national wage case which results in flow-on wage increases, a dispute that results in travellers being held up for hours on end at airports, or a dispute on the wharves that will hold up containers, we are all affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industrial relations is of paramount importance. Bad industrial relations often causes undue hardship for members of the community. It adds to the cost of everyday goods and services and it often results in fewer jobs. Good industrial relations means better productivity, a more competitive economy, higher standards of living and more jobs. I am an advocate of tax reform as a means of bolstering our economic stocks. I support reductions in government spending, along with other reforms, such as privatisation, deregulation and contracting out of public services, to generate greater efficiencies and improved competitiveness. I have no doubt whatsoever that if these matters had been addressed during the 1980s, Australia would have been well placed, well positioned, to avoid the recession and to emerge as a leader in world markets.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These vital reforms are needed to straighten out our system of industrial relations. It is my belief that their importance is equal to, if not greater than, that of any other single area of economic reform. The construction industry must rank as a major priority in such reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), in his speech on the Bill, acknowledges the need for reform in the construction industry. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is an industry that we have sought to reform over the period of our government.</PARA>
<PARA>This says two things:  firstly, it is an admission that there are serious problems in the industry&mdash;although that is no secret to anyone;  secondly, it is an open admission of the Government's failure to reform the construction industry, despite having had nine years in office to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before Government members start bleating about deregistration of the BLF, let me openly acknowledge this measure, which, I might add, was commenced by a previous government. However, deregistering one militant union without stemming other union oriented problems is hardly what I would call large scale reform.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But at least the Minister recognises the need for change in the construction industry. He also recognises the industry's importance within the overall economic framework. After all, we are talking about an industry with an annual expenditure exceeding $40 billion and generating over 60 per cent of Australia's gross fixed capital expenditure. Clearly if an industry of this magnitude is operating efficiently, as the Minister seems to accept, any improvements in efficiency must result in significant gains for the Australian economy and the Australian work force. The question is how best to go about achieving this task of reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It disappoints me that the Bill is the best the Government could come up with after nine years in office. Unfortunately, the Bill is totally inadequate. It is even counterproductive in some areas. In particular, it caters for only the big players in the construction industry, particularly the Building Workers Industrial Union. This fits with the Government's move towards bigger and more powerful unions with broader industrial coverage. The new mega-union, known as the Construction, Forestry and Mining Employees Union, already covers a massive 96,000 members and is tipped to expand much further, possibly to a membership as large as 200,000 within the next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new union is an amalgamation of the BWIU, the timber workers and allied industries union and the Mineworkers Federation. As such, it is a collection of unions which historically have had very different interests. Furthermore, consideration has been given to two other unions which may join the new mega-union. One of them, the Plasterers Federation, has obvious ties with the construction industry;  but the other, the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association, has far broader interests. Eventually the CFMEU, as it will become known, will possibly cover about 300,000 members. I have to question how a union of that size and that scope can possibly look after the interests of individual members working in a variety of trades in a range of enterprises and in vastly different locations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, what a union of that size can do is perfectly obvious, especially to those employers, subcontractors and employees who have fallen foul of the BWIU in the past. I do not pretend that the BWIU is in the same league as the BLF when it comes to industrial anarchy;  however, anyone who has dealings with the various unions involved in the construction industry knows that the BWIU tactics used on site have often little to do with traditional workplace issues. Nowadays it is rare for a major construction project to be completed anywhere near on schedule or for the wages and conditions applicable at the outset of the project to be the same as those applying at the end of the project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is even rarer that a subcontractor or a company employee can so much as enter a major construction project without first joining at least one union. Even self-employed tradesmen who carry out subcontract work on the larger sites are forced to be union members, despite the fact that they may be technically ineligible to join the particular union involved. I am aware of cases where self-employed contractors have been forced to join three unions to avoid union harassment on site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Big union muscle pays big dividends as well. For example, evidence to the Industry Commission last year revealed wages being paid to some crane drivers of up to $160,000 a year, with their dogmen earning up to $100,000. It has been estimated that overall restrictive work practices, overregulation and inefficient regulatory procedures in the construction industry cost about $1 billion every year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will do little, if anything, to help resolve these problems. It is no wonder that the New South Wales Government has refused to participate in the Federal Government's grandstanding on this issue. It has the sense to wait until the Gyles Royal Commission into Productivity in the Building Industry in New South Wales has completed its investigations and made its own recommendations. I have to ask why the Federal Government could not be a little patient. After all, the Construction Industry Reform Agency, created by this legislation, will no doubt be going over the areas already canvassed by the royal commission. On its own, this duplication clearly is totally unwarranted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us consider further that already we have had 22 separate inquiries into the industry over the past 15 years. It is abundantly clear that the Government should hold its horses and wait until the Gyles Royal Commission has finished its work before taking this legislation any further. But no, the Government has chosen instead to pre-empt the findings of the royal commission by pushing ahead with this Bill. Indeed, it has even gone one step further by making the necessary appointments to the Construction Industry Reform Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The former Prime Minister announced in December that Mr Paul White, Group Construction Director of Concrete Constructions Group, had been appointed as chairman of the board. Most of the other board members are equally highly placed, being the executive directors or equivalent from Kinhill Engineers, Fletcher Construction Group, AMP Property Investments, Thiess Contractors, Hooker Cochram, the ACTU and the Building Workers Industrial Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, this Bill is a fait accompli, and the Government is asking us simply to rubber-stamp its legislation. This is a blatant abuse of the Parliament and demonstrates the Government's arrogance in taking action now and then seeking legislative authority later. However, there is another important reason why the Government should await the royal commission's findings, and that concerns the BWIU's decision to allocate $1.5m to the new Construction Industry Reform Agency. There might be nothing wrong with that in itself;  but the fact that the union raided the construction employees redundancy trust to do this raises some serious questions about the legality of such action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trust was established specifically to meet redundancy payments to construction workers and I am pleased that the Gyles Royal Commission undertook to examine the matter in some detail. Already, Commissioner Roger Gyles has said that the actions of the BWIU in this regard seem to be:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a most extraordinary step for a body such as this to take and, indeed, says much about the industry and the integrity of those involved in it.</PARA>
<PARA>What will this Bill do to improve these matters? After all, the Minister has said that this is not an industrial relations exercise, it is an industry exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the functions of the Construction Industry Reform Agency are spelled out in only very general terms in this Bill. More detail is contained in the working party report and it seems that the legislation is meant to have far-reaching implications. Not only would the Agency involve itself in industrial relations matters, but also it could involve itself in broader issues such as overall industry efficiency and managerial competence in accordance with the in-principle agreement signed by the major industry groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, I do not believe that a bureaucratic body such as this, which is heavily influenced by a major organisation renowned for fostering inefficiency in the industry, can possibly achieve the goal of greater industry competitiveness. The coalition's outlook is far more realistic than this, and I will discuss this point later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, if there is one thing I can say in the Government's favour, it is that our loony friends in the Senate, the Australian Democrats, seem to think this Bill is nothing short of a magic potion and have suggested that more emphasis should be given to environmental considerations. Referring to such matters as energy efficient design practices, self-monitoring heating, and waste disposal practices, a Democrat spokesman said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are the sorts of issues which the Australian Democrats believe can be profitably pursued within the Construction Industry Development Council forum.</PARA>
<PARA>All I can say is that proponents of this legislation are either totally naive and do not understand the complexities of the workplace, where it might take several weeks to resolve a simple demarcation dispute; or they see this whole area as a political springboard enabling them to pursue their own ambitions. I am sure the BWIU holds the latter view. I suspect its idea of building industry reform is to pursue issues such as strike pay, higher employer-funded superannuation and even more in the way of redundancy payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Government will say that this legislation has broad support but, as I said earlier, that is not the case because not all of the States are behind it. Furthermore, I sympathise with those business groups which feel obliged to support this approach openly through fear of what would happen to their position in the industry otherwise. Contrary to what members on the other side will say&mdash;and have said&mdash;the coalition is not anti-union, and my comments today regarding union militancy are not a reflection on the whole union movement. Although the Minister has said that we are in favour of eliminating the trade union movement from the construction industry, the truth is very different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We certainly do recognise the valuable role which a properly democratic union movement can fulfil. However, we are not blind to the realities of industry relations in Australia today. The truth is that the existing system has failed dismally. Indeed, it is interesting that the Bill which is before us today deals only with the construction industry which, on the Minister's own admission, is fraught with problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compared with the commercial construction industry, the home building trades are in a very different situation. Australia's housing industry, for example, is considered to be a world leader in terms of competitiveness and efficiency. The relatively low cost of home construction in Australia is the main reason why housing prices have not risen more in recent years. An indication of the degree of efficiency in our housing industry is the fact that costs have increased by far less than the prevailing rate of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the five years to last December, the increase in house prices relative to inflation was as follows: Sydney house prices increased by 12.3 per cent and inflation over that period rose by 35.9 per cent; Melbourne house prices rose by 10.8 per cent, inflation by 35.5 per cent; Brisbane house prices went up 12.1 per cent, and inflation, 33 per cent; Adelaide, 6.9 per cent, and inflation, 34.4 per cent; Perth, 12.1 per cent, and inflation, 33.2 per cent; and Canberra, 6.4 per cent, and inflation, 32 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is it that the big construction sites are plagued with problems whereas the cottage industry operates so well? The first clue is that most employees in the cottage building industries are not union members. Of the 376,000 industry employees last recorded by the Bureau of Statistics, 205,300&mdash;or 54.6 per cent&mdash;were not union members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the construction industry has been almost totally unionised by the union movement's closed shop tactics, so it follows that employees in the building industry generally do not belong to unions. Indeed, from my experience this is certainly the case. Furthermore, the home building industry is also the bastion of the self-employed contractor who subcontracts his services and, more often than not, organises his own labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the House that this is the key to the whole matter and explains why we have an efficient housing industry whereas&mdash;as even the Minister concedes&mdash;the construction industry is in need of sweeping reforms. The housing industry illustrates the sort of decentralised and deregulated workplace which the coalition advocates as part of our industry relations policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By and large, Australian subcontractors work extremely efficiently. If one drives through any new suburb on any morning, one will see bricklayers, carpenters and electricians working efficiently on jobs to complete those contracts on time. If one drives past any major construction site, one will not see anywhere near the same level of activity. This is why the housing industry is pleased to have nothing to do with the Government's new legislation. It is also why it is totally opposed to the Minister's objective to include independent subcontractors in the centralised industrial relations system. Forcing subcontractors into the industrial relations system would spell disaster as it strikes at the very core of the Australian housing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just recently, the Housing Industry Association highlighted the additional costs arising from regulating the housing industry. The HIA maintains that home prices would increase by between 15 and 35 per cent, adding thousands of dollars to the price of every new home. Dr Ron Silverberg, national director of the HIA, went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Housing subcontractors have abandoned the security of a company job and industrial awards for the satisfaction of relying on their own ability to succeed. Their earnings depend on establishing a reputation for quality and reliability. Subbies don't get paid for delays, rostered-days-off or wet weather so there is a strong incentive to get on with the job.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition will not stand by and let this subcontract system be systematically destroyed in this way. Indeed, the reasons behind our support for the existing subcontract system are essentially the reasons why we cannot support this Bill before the House today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of creating a bureaucracy and feeding it millions of dollars of taxpayer and industry funds in a futile effort to reform the industry, the coalition believes in letting the industry reform itself. All that is needed is the right industrial relations framework. Abolishing compulsory unionism will not be easy, but it is essential if we are to rid the construction industry of the inefficiencies of union closed shop tactics. Combined with genuine secret ballots, we will see an end to those hurried on-site meetings where no-one dares to challenge the shop steward's authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In turn, subcontractors will play a more important role in the construction industry, bringing with them the same work practices which have helped make our housing industry so efficient by world standards. Subcontractors know that greater productivity means greater rewards and the coalition's enterprise agreements policy will extend the same incentives to employees in the industry. Employees will be able to enter into voluntary agreements with their employers, whether on their own or with union assistance, so that they can share in the spoils of a leaner, more efficient industry. If they choose not to do this, they will still have the security of the award system behind them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will not solve anything. In fact, it has already created a serious legal situation which is set to reinforce some of the worst aspects of unionism. This is the sort of legislation that we have come to expect from this Government which takes its orders from Swanston Street. On the other hand, there is no reason why aspects of the housing industry should not be embraced by the construction industry so that the industry, and those working in it, will be better off. All it takes is the industrial relations framework proposed by the coalition in its Fightback policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Construction Industry Reform and Development Bill which is before the House. This Bill essentially presents the framework for a new organisational tripartite structure to be erected in the construction industry so that it may pursue its tasks more efficiently and more cooperatively with the different sectors involved. This is very important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The construction industry in Australia is one of the largest sectors of industry. It runs at about 10 per cent of our GDP, something over $40 billion, subject to the state of the cycle. It employs about 7 per cent of the work force, or over half a million employees, and it lays down more than half our fixed capital expenditure. In other words, it is the major industry which lays down the infrastructure of sectors of our economy, particularly those which we hope in the 1990s will provide some of the basis for a rectification of our balance of payments imbalance which we found in the late 1980s. I refer particularly to mining; transportation, which services all industry; tourism, one of the fastest growing industrial sectors of the 1980s, and we hope it will repeat its performance into the 1990s; and the services sector, which is also going to require buildings from which to operate and which, I hope, we will be able to utilise to export services, particularly into the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Laying down this infrastructure is going to be very important for our national economy during the next decade. So while it is true that the construction industry has concentrated in the past on central business district construction&mdash;and this was particularly true in the 1980s, and notably in my seat of Adelaide where the skyline of the central business district was reconstructed&mdash;and CBDs throughout our country have at the present time surplus office space, that is not a situation that is going to last forever. It is also not a situation that means the construction industry is not important because, as I have just outlined, it has other roles to play into the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we need to look at the construction industry as a backbone for the economic development of the 1990s, laying down the modern infrastructure and the fixed capital of our economy. This was outlined and projected in the One Nation statement that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) gave in February. In that One Nation statement he laid down some direct infrastructure programs, particularly those related to the transport system of this country&mdash;rail, road and air&mdash;which the construction industry will undertake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister also projected growth in service sectors and in tourism. Some taxation rearrangements were made to encourage the development of a tourism infrastructure, such that we can see the construction industry blossoming in different directions in the 1990s. This makes it very important that we undertake right now a micro-economic reform agenda in that sector which will provide a suitable vehicle for producing this infrastructure development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We face a choice between two ways of doing this. One is to go back to the old kind of construction industry that we had in this country that developed during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s when the central business districts of our cities were constructed; that is, one of militant, damaging and inefficient conflict between management and labour. The other way is construct a new form of construction industry in which there is a cooperative, tripartite drive by the public sector, organised labour and management for a more efficient construction method for the infrastructure that this country desperately needs to lay down over the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, I submit to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the two sides of this House are offering alternative proposals as to how to lay down the basis for our construction industry which will construct that vital infrastructure during the coming decade. The passage of this Bill will ensure that we go in one direction. Its rejection would ensure that we take a few steps down the ultimate path into the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This construction industry reform strategy, as presently outlined in the Bill, was launched in the Great Hall by the then Prime Minister on 3 December last year. He noted then that our national costs for major projects were 20 per cent higher than our international competitors, our export performance among OECD countries was among the lowest, and our research and development expenditure in that sector was a mere $13m a year, which is an almost unrecognisable percentage of total turnover. He added, quite rightly, that our regulatory structure in the construction industry, springing as it does from an overlapping maze of rules by the various geographically dispersed and three-tiered stages of government, was a maze. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The then Prime Minister also announced that an in-principle reform and development agreement had been reached between peak employer, peak employee, and many State and Federal governments to conclude a code of practice in the industry which would incorporate a rating system for company performances, an industry development agenda to lift exports, research and development and quality practices, and a labour market reform process to lift flexibility, safety standards for workers, training standards for all those employed in the industry and the introduction of more flexible award restructuring. This agreement in principle would also seek to simplify and standardise the regulations that have been laid down by the various and multiple layers of government in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this end, the then Prime Minister announced that a comprehensive system of consultation in the industry would be set up. This Bill is the legislative form of that system of consultation. Notably, it would involve a Construction Industry Development Council, chaired by the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs and the Minister for Industrial Relations, and a Construction Industry Development Agency with a chief executive officer to implement the strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened to two speeches against this process from the Opposition. I would just like to point out to people who may be listening to this debate or who may read it later&mdash;and, of course, to your good self, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;that people from the private sector who got behind this process were the top people in their field. One of the people, Mr Paul White, was quoted by the honourable member who led for the Opposition in this debate, the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles). Mr White was Group Construction Director of the Concrete Construction Group and has now become the Chief Executive Officer of the agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who have been nominated by private companies, by the union movement, by the responsible unions of the ACTU, together with officers from Commonwealth departments and the States, to serve on the Council represent those people who know the industry from the inside, who are aware of the problems that it faces and who have agreed in principle to a general reform process in which they will try to cooperate. I notice that one Council member is Mr Malcolm Kinnaird from the Kinhill group. He is a highly respected Adelaide developer with an export record which, in itself, demonstrates the capacity of this man and his thinking. The companies he represents go into the Asia-Pacific region to gain competitive contracts in one of the most competitive construction markets in the world. These people have come on board with this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other members are very eminent, skilled and highly experienced people from the industry, the unions and various government departments, all of whom need to cooperate in the development of a more efficient, less trammelled and more cooperative construction industry. I do not intend to list them because the time available does not permit it. I should point out, however, that the construction industry reform strategy, which has been published by the Commonwealth Government Printer, lists the people involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We started this process against a background in the construction industry which, as I have already said, leaves much to be desired on all sides. It was an industry that developed quickly during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s when the structure of our present central business districts was laid down. The industry had a number of features. One was a management performance that was below that required by contemporary standards when the overall Australian economy was exposing itself to international competition much more severely. It had an extremely poor industrial relations record, caused in part by the extreme fragmentation of union organisation in the industry and the willingness of some of these fragmented unions to be extremely militant, against a background where labour in the industry, that is workers in the industry, had every ground to feel that they had been excluded from the boom of the fifties, sixties and seventies in terms of regular and safe employment, regular training, and access to the safety standards which became the norm elsewhere in our economy. This was such that they became, as was the expression, bloody-minded enough to introduce and sustain work practices which precluded the introduction of world best production methods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against the background of that industry it was hardly surprising that management would react with great frustration and would resort to old practices of, in turn, being vindictive towards their employees. As old projects closed down they were reluctant to hire the more militant of the workers on new projects. So there was continuing conflict between labour and capital that precluded the introduction of proper safety standards, training standards, remuneration and superannuation on the one side and regular and most productive practices of construction on the other. These mutual antagonisms grew and developed, until they had reached the peak in the 1970s and were inherited by this Government. Dealing with them then becomes the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The in-principle agreement which was thrashed out last December was signed by most State governments, the peak employer bodies and the involved unions, with an agreement to the broad reform process that covered improvement in industry performance, management practice and working conditions for employees. There is something for everybody in that agreement, including the Australian economy as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the details of this agreement are to be found in another publication by the Commonwealth Government which sets out the terms. I will not read them here, as they are far too lengthy, but they do get down to details which matter to workers in this industry, such as what happens when the weather is inclement and how is it judged. Is it enough to say two spots of rain on a cigarette paper? Or is there some better way to go? The agreement looks at the provision of toilets. When do we need adequate toilet facilities? When do we have to scrimp and scrape in order to improve efficiency? How flexible do we have to be on this issue? Who is responsible for the issuing of protective clothing, and under what circumstances and when is it adequate? What happens if a shop steward is dismissed? Do we lay down tools? How is that dealt with? All these things are vital day-to-day issues in the industry which, if not dealt with cooperatively, can hinder the introduction of efficient work practices, and have done for over a generation, thereby leaving a legacy which all of us, certainly on this side of the House, seek to eradicate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This reform strategy cannot be imposed by this or any other government on this industry. We cannot impose a requirement that the parties cooperate with one another, as we would prefer that they do, and we cannot impose a demand that they compete ferociously all the time, as the Opposition cares to suggest. Reform has to grow out of industrial practice within the industry. We do not believe that, by setting up this agency and this council, we as a government will resolve the problem. We believe that we may be able to establish a framework within which the industry itself can cooperate to produce an outcome desirable for overall Australian economy's purpose of laying down a new capital infrastructure during the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has set up the Construction Industry Development Agency and the Construction Industry Development Council to get the process under way. There is a terminal point to the agency, which will be disbanded in mid-1995, by which time we ardently hope that this process of cooperation and the introduction of work practices comparable with the best in the world will have been finished. We believe that the coincidence of these reforms with the One Nation strategy, which kicks off, stimulates and exists alongside the upturn in the business cycle, will produce a laying down of a new bout of capital investment. This reform is appearing at the same time as that upturn in the business cycle occurs as a natural process of the eight-year cyclical movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by speculating as to why the Opposition has been so strongly opposed to what is a natural development in the industry of cooperating to seek greater productivity, one that has been encouraged by this Government and is in accord with the desires of both Labor and management within the industry. A number of objections have been raised. One is that the legislation does not cover the housing industry. It is suggested that the housing industry is a much better example, as in it productivity is higher and prices are lower. I believe that, on the one side, it is not possible to make those comparisons very easily, and I do not want to produce them here. I want to say, however, that anyone familiar with either the housing industry or the construction industry, just by driving past building sites, would quickly become aware that the housing industry is not based on large firms, large workplaces, large agglomerations of labour and capital working together over lengthy periods, during which they need to cooperate and eventually are in competition with the international market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposition advanced by the Opposition is that the essential differences between those two industries are between a unionised sector and a non-unionised sector. Whatever conclusions those opposite draw from that, I would ask them to note that the big difference between the construction sector and the housing sector is not whether the labour is unionised in one and not in the other, but centres on the whole scale and size of the operations and the technology and the technological innovation that is involved. Those two industries are vastly different from those points of view, and they are the differences that are most important in looking at these industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any case, the unions that occasioned the kind of disruption to the construction industry which the Opposition says does not occur in the cottage housing industry were chiefly those associated with the Builders Labourers Federation. I am sure that those opposite would be pleased to recognise that it was this Government that deregistered the Builders Labourers Federation for its involvement in disruptive activities in the construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second objection that the Opposition has made is that the legislation was announced publicly in the Great Hall before it was announced in Parliament, thereby in some way usurping the Parliament's prerogative. I think that is a little unfair. The agreement was reached between the three most important parties in the industry and is about to be given legislative effect if it is accepted by this and the other House. In the other House the Australian Democrats have given their assent, so I presume it will eventually receive the assent of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, it is claimed that we require the findings of the Gyles Royal Commission in New South Wales before we can act. As the previous speaker pointed out, there have been 22 separate inquiries into the industry in the last 15 years. If we were to wait for the twenty-third, I am sure those opposite would be on our backs saying that we were again squibbing on micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I note that in one of the debates in the other place someone pointed out that entering construction sites around Australia is basically like stepping into a communist nation, such as Cuba or an eastern European country. This is grossly unfair. Australian workers are merely seeking to protect their rights of safety and regulation within their industrial framework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much more important, I believe, is that underpinning the criticism of this agreement is the attack on the industrial relations club launched by the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), who spoke first for the Opposition in this debate. The target is not the cooperative agreement that we are about to undertake within the construction industry, but a more radical policy which the Opposition is contemplating with respect to the industry relations system in general and which is reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> this morning. In it an article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Opposition Leader, Dr Hewson, is driving a push within coalition ranks for a significant toughening of industrial relations policy which could commit a Hewson government to abolishing compulsory arbitration.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say that he was impressed with the New Zealand model, having just visited New Zealand. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key reforms . . . diluted the legal recognition of unions as the bargaining agents for workers, cancelled . . . industrial awards . . . and allowed employers and employees to negotiate new . . . contracts . . . </PARA>
<PARA>If we are to develop an industry which is cooperative, which seeks to use the world's best construction standards, which seeks to do a good job in laying down the new capital infrastructure that this country is going to require in the next decade, we do not want to return to a situation of extreme conflict that characterised this industry when the unions were under assault. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have moderate, temperate unions, looking to establish an ongoing industrial framework in which their members can have regular jobs, regular payment, regular superannuation and be safe at work, and where the employers recognise that going back to the conflict model would be inappropriate. This is what we are seeking to establish. We regard the Opposition's proposals as being contrary to the interests of the construction industry and seeking, ultimately, to snuff out the recovery phase of capital infrastructure development which this country is just entering into. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The visible and stated purpose of the Construction Industry Reform and Development Bill is to establish the Construction Industry Development Council and the Construction Industry Development Agency as a part of the Government's so-called construction industry reform strategy. That strategy is plainly devoted to the Government's program of micro-economic reform. I must acknowledge at the outset that nobody would argue with the need for that economic reform, in principle. Nonetheless, the Opposition takes a view that the mechanism being put before us will not prove adequate, appropriate, effective or, in the end, workable in achieving the stated objectives. Therefore, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley), acknowledged, we will be opposing this move.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the legislation will not achieve the stated objectives is, in our view, largely related to what might be called the unstated or not so visible objectives of the strategy which, regrettably, appear to have more to do with entrenching and enhancing union influence&mdash;which itself is a very major part of the problem&mdash;despite the observations made by the previous speaker, in Australia's construction industry. For him to pretend there is no relevant comparison between the performance of the building sector, the housing and cottage industries and the heavy commercial and industrial construction sectors, on the basis of one being unionised and one not being unionised, is to my way of thinking a nonsense. That comparison cannot be avoided and the need to draw conclusions from it can no longer be ignored either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with that extension of union influence and control, which is likely to carry over into the housing industry by virtue of the hidden agenda in this strategy, must not be overlooked or ignored. We must not pretend it is not real. The reality is that as a result of that we are likely to see a detrimental effect on the efficiency and economy of the home and cottage industries in this country. For those reasons alone, the Bill ought to be opposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody doubts the importance of the building and construction industry in this country, although I suspect that few people really understand how its efficiency impacts on our economic performance, probably because they are not aware of its impact on our export performance and on our traded goods sectors. I will illustrate that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sector, as a whole, represents somewhere between 10 and 12 per cent of gross domestic product in Australia&mdash;in dollar terms, somewhere between $40 billion and $50 billion per year. It is obviously a very substantial industry, which employs more than 500,000 people. The housing and cottage sector of it clearly rates amongst the most highly efficient industries in this country, and probably anywhere in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Largely untouched by excessive labour rigidities, restrictive work practices and idiotic demarcation disputes, it is to a great extent the domain of subcontractors who work largely without regard for the dictates of union officials, apparently with very good results in everything from economic and financial terms to efficiency and, of course, safety. They do so, to a great degree, irrespective of whether or not their employees are members of a union. The Troubleshooter brawl in Victoria, for example, had little or nothing to do with union membership, as such, but it appears that it did have a lot to do with the fact that subcontractors and those who work with them are difficult to organise and control. To a great extent, that is what this debate is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also seems that there are people in the labour movement who are keen to ensure that people are not made acquainted with the fact that if they can do better by entering freely into a workplace contract and can receive a higher degree of remuneration&mdash;and other things, such as job satisfaction&mdash;the efforts of union officials in the industrial relations club may begin to look a little irrelevant. Employees may want out of the centralised system, which is the option we fully intend to give them. Unfortunately, it appears that the labour movement, in its many varieties, is keen to do what it can to avoid letting ordinary working Australians either see the options or, having seen them, pursue them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this push to limit the role of subcontractors and almost certainly increase, by stealth, the degree of union coverage of and interference in the building industry, there will be losers, and they will not simply be home buyers and home purchasers. The introduction of restrictive construction industry type work practices, to the degree that it is allowed to take place, will increase the cost of housing, just as on the flip side of the coin the denial of the possibility of introducing these work patterns, these innovative ways of approaching construction and engineering problems in the commercial sector of the building industry, deprives it of the benefits of the efficiencies that apply currently in the housing and cottage industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extension of the regulations governing the building industries has been referred to here tonight. Their extension would appear to be part and parcel of the reform strategy before us tonight. It would also appear that those regulations may be part of a vehicle for the extension of union coverage and the imposition of what might be regarded as desirable work practices by those unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, the Housing Industry Association has estimated that simply the adoption of the Building Regulation Review Task Force's recommendations will add somewhere between $2,000 and $4,000 to the cost of the average Australian home or cottage. The effect of higher home prices presents a range of potentially detrimental effects. For one thing, Australians will drive themselves deeper into debt to buy a home. The great Australian dream will not be forsaken; it will just soak up more of our precious national savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Walsh pointed out some years ago, that trait in this nation is doing considerable damage. We are devoting too much of our scarce national capital to our housing. I think he observed that our obsession with the double garage and en suite is doing a great deal of damage in that regard. Furthermore, it will exacerbate the distortions already apparent in investment patterns in this country. Too much money is being directed towards the non-traded goods sector and not enough towards the export and import replacement tradeable goods sectors. On the other hand, a cynic might observe that the process will enhance our drift towards what one wit recently termed our future status as the best-housed Third World country in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to our need to boost the traded goods sector, and investment in it, which is a very important part of this debate. It centres on the inefficiency and high cost of our construction sector. This is one of the major factors in the decline in capital investment in this country. Additional costs arising from those inefficiencies are added onto building owners' and users' costs and their cost structures. This saps our competitiveness and soaks up resources which would otherwise be available for productive use. Worse, as a result it has the potential to very seriously impact on our export performance&mdash;I suggest that it already has&mdash;with all that that implies in our present parlous trade imbalance situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently had a series of discussions concerning the meat industry. This industry is one of our major export trade performers. It is of immensely important economic significance&mdash;and potentially immensely more&mdash;in terms of our trade performance, yet investment in that industry has dried to a trickle. It is estimated that the industry pays out something like $250m a year in statutory government charges, of which over half goes to AQIS, which is in itself a story of industrial relations inefficiencies, and industry dues, such as AMLC and meat research dues. The interesting thing is that that $250m is probably more money than the industry has invested in capital works and new infrastructure in the last 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One major Australian meatworks, against the appalling backdrop of not being able to retain earnings out of its cash flow as a result of these government imposts and other cost imposts, needs to undertake major rebuilding of its plant over the next few years if it is to retain its various export licences. Here is the rub: the ballpark figure for the rebuilding of the essential part of the plant is around $30m on current indications. On the Government's own figures, it would appear that is about $6m or 20 per cent more than it ought to be. That is not just $6m or so more than it ought to be in terms of domestic costs, it is $6m or more than a comparable meatworks abroad might have to find to get this new infrastructure up to and running. That money may well be the difference between a decision to invest and a decision not to invest. We are talking about 500 jobs; we are talking about a multiplier effect right throughout the community; and we are talking about the loss of yet another export contributor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The seriousness of these sorts of problems for our export sector must not be underestimated. Given the parlous state of our balance of trade and the alarming decline in capital investment in this country, one would have thought that there might have been urgent and effective attention paid to this matter. Despite earlier comments, there has not been too much urgency in this debate so far; in fact, the Bill before us has been something like 18 months in its gestation period. It has already cost several million dollars and has generated plenty of reports, plenty of meetings and plenty of in-principle agreements; yet out in the field it has not achieved anything yet. The first tangible outcome of it is the Bill before us tonight and, as I have said, there is, unfortunately, not likely to be a great deal of effectiveness either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the Government having created a statutory authority to continue the process of consultation between industry, governments and unions&mdash;a consultative process which has already been taking place anyway&mdash;not everyone seems to be convinced that much will happen or that this statutory authority will bring about much change. As I understand it, at least one reluctant participant in the process has indicated that the authority is very concerned and very sceptical about the whole strategy tackling the central issue which, in its view, is the extraordinarily difficult industrial relations problem that applies in the construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only catalyst for urgency so far seems to have been the desire to have the process in train before the Gyles Royal Commission into Productivity in the Building Industry in New South Wales hands down its report. I understand that is due in the next couple of weeks. The New South Wales Government has in fact refused to pre-empt the findings of the Gyles Royal Commission which may well recommend a totally different approach to the one before us tonight. For that reason, the New South Wales Government has refused to participate.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It points to the codes of conduct which have existed within the industry since 1986 and which arose out of concerns to ensure that there was adequate reinforcing of the deregistration of the BLF&mdash;the Federal, Victorian and New South Wales governments all participated&mdash;as well as claims that those measures have been largely ineffective. In addition, the Commission has had to consider the legality of an extraordinary transfer of $1.5m from the Construction Employees Redundancy Trust, CERT, to the Construction Industry Development Agency created by the Bill before us tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CERT was set up as a charitable trust to receive weekly contributions of $40 per employee from employers to meet redundancy payments to building workers. Not surprisingly, this rather unusual transaction has raised a few eyebrows, not least amongst them Mr Gyles himself. He is quoted as saying that this:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`. . . that the Commonwealth Government would have accepted this commitment as being a commitment on behalf of the industry when, in reality, all it is, is the distribution of income contributed in the main by sub-contractors and small building contractors, purportedly to deal with the redundancy of their workers and to pay the award provisions, and so on'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`It is quite beyond me how any bona fide examination of the issues could have justified this payment,' Mr Gyles said.</PARA>
<PARA>That was not all the Gyles Commission uncovered. The sorts of rorts and rip-offs which make people gasp and say it has got to stop are evidenced aplenty in the media coverage of the Gyles Commission and its activities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> last August wrote a story of a daily litany of criminal, inefficient and idiotic practices. The same article referred to a study which showed that Australian construction costs were between 20 and 50 per cent higher than those abroad in similar countries, and that working days lost were up to 40 times higher than in comparable developed nations. We hear stories, for example, of the numbers of days lost to wet weather in CBDs around Australia being two, three and four times what they are in places such as London, which obviously raises some very serious issues.

In many cases a number of us, in the course of our work in our electorates, come across instances where proprietors or management of firms have indulged, in one way or another, in the expenditure of companies' moneys or resources on projects that did not go to the benefit of employees, union members, but went to the benefit of executives. </PARA>

In the private sector there is no method by which shareholders, or people who feel aggrieved at how company money is used, can take their case to a similar examination. One day we will have that kind of process in this country, not the farce of annual general meetings, where the shareholders can go along and say, `The executives and the board misused the assets of this company and I, the shareholder with my 1,500 shares from my superannuation, demand that justice be done'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He could have mentioned George Herscu. There is a range of people he could have mentioned. This is not just relating to the peanuts in some of these cases that involve construction work. Let us look at what happens with the high-fliers, the entrepreneurs of the last decade. Now we are talking about money. But enough of that. One of the problems with those practices in that industry at times of a heated economy is that costs can be passed on so readily. If someone is at the end of the line and he is getting his 15 per cent on cost overruns or extras, why would he seek to reduce those extras?  Why would he be opposed to that?  If someone were supervising or monitoring the contract, I know what he would be doing. He would be sitting there and getting his 15 per cent, or his commission, on the tendered price or the contracted price, plus provision for extras. He would say, `Mr Proprietor, these are matters beyond our control. I have looked at them and examined them and I cannot see any way that you can avoid payment. My commission goes on as well'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is really an incentive in the system to encourage overruns. Some of these practices have been so easily done. But this country cannot afford those kinds of practice. There is a demonstrable inequity in those kinds of events. The great bulk of people in the trade union movement are Australian working men and women who give their best to see that this country grows and improves, and that there is a fairer society and a better standard of living. When people are able to rip off the system&mdash;whether they are executives or employees&mdash;they do it at the cost of their fellow Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member, like his colleagues earlier in the debate and like his colleagues in the Senate, said, `Look, why don't we wait until the Gyles Royal Commission comes down with a report?'. The honourable member cannot have it both ways; earlier in his remarks he said, `Why has it taken the Government so long?  This is an urgent matter. It needs to be resolved. Why has the Government taken more than 18 months to bring this legislation in here?'. But he concludes by saying, `We really ought to wait until the Gyles Royal Commission report comes down, and the New South Wales Government works out what it wants to do'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategy we are enacting and passing through this House this evening is one that has been developed on a comprehensive basis aimed at reform and development of the industry, a major national industry. It has been developed over more than 18 months, and developed with the cooperation of key industry and union parties together with other governments. There is an urgency for reform processes to be implemented now, and particularly to support that $2.3 billion worth of infrastructure expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This country demands the best value we can get for that expenditure. This economy needs it. Therefore in these circumstances there is an urgency. There is no more time to wait. We cannot have it both ways. In any event, the strategy can take into account measures arising from the New South Wales royal commission that would supplement the wide range of proposals contained in this strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest also that, given the current paralytic state of the New South Wales Government, and given the performance of that Government in respect of former Minister Metherell, are we really saying that that is a model that we want to wait on and watch?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members opposite had a great deal to say earlier in the debate about unions. We are talking about fellow Australians, because unionists are fellow Australians; they are not some kind of alien beings; they are not some kind of strange or less than normal Australians. They are decent, honourable Australians trying to rear their families and trying to help to build this country. Sure there are exceptions, but for every exception those opposite can find in a trade unionist I will find one in an executive. Tally them up and I will show where we will find the biggest cost to this country. It will not be on the side of the individual unionist. We are working through a system of improving industrial relations, our skills, our reliability and our efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier I sat listening to the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) and I thought, `Subcontractors are really God's gift to any country. They are so good. Why doesn't the whole nation function as subcontractors?'. In the course of our inquiry into the efficiency and performance of the road industry, the submission of the New South Wales Road and Traffic Authority&mdash;which is a public document&mdash;had this to say about subcontractors on really major road building projects:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More recently, the Special Conditions of Contract have been modified to improve protection for all sub-contractors on RTA projects. The need for this protection arose from two recent examples on a Federally funded project where the RTA had made payments to its contractor and the main contractors had paid their sub-contractors. However, those sub-contractors had defaulted in their payment of further sub-contractors whom they had employed on the work.</PARA>
<PARA>Who in this chamber has not read reports of subcontractors welshing on their suppliers or welshing on other subcontractors, and then bobbing up under another name a few months later and doing it all over again and, with a bit of luck, bobbing up again under another company name and doing it all over once more. They are not trade unionists. They are not crooked union officials. They are businessmen out there earning a living and being entrepreneurial. So there is not right on one side or the other. There are defects and deficiencies on both sides. After a long period of consultation this legislation is about the process that this Government has pursued in industrial relations. It is a process of consultation. If we sit all those involved around a table and put the facts on the table, I believe there is sufficient commitment from most Australians in this country for them to find the right and best solution. </PARA>

Do not let us forget the background to all of this; it is not mythology. Those opposite should read our history. Do they think they can blackguard those people and get the best economic results in this country by blackguarding them and saying, `Abolish all unions. Get rid of them.'? That is what they are really saying. It is the New Zealand disaster model&mdash;get rid of unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) retires and is looking for a job because he wants to earn some income, he will go along to the manager of a middle sized company with about 10 or a dozen employees and say, `I am the former member for Lyne. I am a very good employee. I think I am worth, at best, $458 per week. Mr employer, you should employ me'. We know that sort of thing is not going to happen. We know that on a one to one basis employees have no bargaining power except when they have the skill which is in very short supply. Then they will exact the best price they can; they would be fools if they did not. If there is no other labour available they will again exact the best price they can because that is all they have to offer&mdash;only their labour and their skill. But the vast bulk of people will be just one of a number of people, particularly in a period of high unemployment, who are outside the gate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My friend the honourable member for Lyne well remembers what happened in the late 1930s outside the gates of BHP in Newcastle&mdash;he has read about it and he has talked to his constituents about it and they have told him about it&mdash;when people tramped from one end of the State to the other to stand like fools outside the gates waiting because they might be noticed. Have those opposite forgotten what happened down on the waterfront? Why are we suffering today the difficulties we have had to go through in reforming the waterfront? It is because of the bitter memories of people who desperately needed work and to be employed so they could feed their families and rear their families.

But it is not one industry; it is many industries of differing sizes, differing products, differing awards, differing arrangements and differing locations.

I find it so repugnant to hear the comment coming from the other side of the House that there can be an arrangement one to one and to get rid of unions, as the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) says so often and says so plausibly, `We will talk about this'. How would they propose to do this for a three-week job stacking bricks or for a brick layers assistant? Sometimes it rains; sometimes it does not. Sometimes it is boggy underfoot; sometimes it is not. Are those opposite serious? Have they thought through what they are saying? They need to go out and have a look at the multiplicity of and variation in conditions and see how impossible are the proposals they are putting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We live in a period where we have had nil inflation in the last quarter. We have the lowest interest rates in a period approaching 20 years. We have had a 10 per cent reduction in real unit labour costs. We have had a 60 per cent reduction in the rate of industrial disputation&mdash;the number of working days lost per 1,000 employees. The unfortunate element we have is a higher level of unemployment than any of us want, particularly those of us on this side of the chamber. On the other side of the chamber, for the proposal that they want to work, they have to have a higher level of unemployment&mdash;the New Zealand model. It has a figure of 17 per cent registered unemployed and we can add what we like to the unregistered figure. The proposals of those opposite means that an employer can grind down an employee. That is what one to one means. There has to be a high level of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this side of the House, in those circumstances I have described, there is an opportunity for this economy to lift off. It is lifting off, and this economy will bounce back stronger and better than it has ever been before. It will come out of the recession with more than a 10 per cent reduction in real unit labour costs. Are those opposite saying that they do not want it? Or would they rather it not be there? Would they rather have a higher rate of inflation? Sure! Earlier I heard the honourable member for Gwydir saying that the costs that relate to cottage building could be reduced if it could be more efficient. He did not mention that under the goods and services tax of the Opposition the cost of an average new home will go up by $2,856&mdash;this is as a result of the imposition of a goods and services tax.

It is not on that basis. It is on site agreements between unions and companies. All of those projects came in within time, on schedule and within budget.

I have described this in my comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to conclude on these points: the tragedy of all of this is that we have got people sitting opposite&mdash;the conservative parties&mdash;who after so many years in government have learnt nothing. Really, what they are saying to people of this country is this, `We want to get trade unions out of the picture. We want to get awards out of the picture. Effectively, we want to disadvantage people who are powerless, who have little industrial power and turn the clock back to the nineteenth century where it all started at the end of the Industrial Revolution'. That was the reason for unions and industrial organisations beginning. The reasons for awards being established were all the abuses and the exploitation of people back in that century. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my remarks tonight I want to demonstrate the extent of that failure. I want to say to the honourable member for Shortland who has just spoken that the industrial relations debate is not about fault&mdash;it is not about whether employees or employers are at fault. We are talking about the fact that this Government is at fault. This debate is about the performance or, more correctly, the non-performance of this Government in industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the honourable member's defence of the role of trade unions, if we are to talk about that here, is hollow.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member talked about New Zealand, and I suppose we will hear quite a lot about New Zealand in the months ahead. Members of the Government may slowly become embarrassed when they become aware that New Zealand, being 10 years ahead of us in the process of reform, is beginning to see results. I do not suppose they want to know that, but it is. It is seeing very substantial productivity gains from the reforms that the Labour Party, to its credit, started in that country a number of years back. Those reforms have been continued by the present National Party Government in New Zealand. The result will be a more competitive economy in New Zealand with more jobs and prosperity. New Zealand will very quickly leave us behind unless we catch up. But we will not catch up under this Government because it is absolutely bound to an ideology that is outdated and irrelevant to the situation in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has this Government given us? What has this industrial relations system that we are labouring under now given us? It has given us huge debts, simply because it has enabled that to occur, and of course it has given us huge unemployment. Behind all of this we still have a plethora of deplorable work practices. The record of union abuses is a mile long. We really must move on. To use the words that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) used some time back, the caravan has moved on. The Labor Party, in an industrial relations sense, has been left way behind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A building industry reform strategy&mdash;and that is what we are talking about in this Bill&mdash;is to be thrust upon us after years of abuses, rorts, violence and intimidation in that industry which have cost the Australian economy incalculable millions, if not billions, of dollars. Even now there is considerable suspicion about this so-called reform agenda with which we have been presented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is doubt in the minds of honourable members on this side that this is really reform at all. We suspect, like many of the other reforms in the industrial relations area that have been presented to us by this Government, that it is simply a Claytons reform like most, if not all, of the reforms this Government has talked about. The Government has been very big on rhetoric but very short indeed on results in reform in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But our concerns go further than even doubt about whether we are talking about real reform here tonight. The Government's proposed reforms of the construction industry are of very doubtful value to the industry as a whole. It is a strategy to adopt and to entrench the BWIU agenda and to turn undesirable State practices and standards into national standards by extending the union's reach into the cottage sector of the building and construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of this, quite clearly&mdash;and, I suspect, quite intentionally&mdash;is to lock out small specialist contractors such as skilled tradesmen and professionals, because the Government is all about big unions and centralisation of power which, of course, eliminates the small person in this industry. We on this side believe that is the real intention, and that is why we are opposed to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Government's vocabulary this is reform, but it is designed to further entrench practices which are not really reforms at all but measures to further look after union mates. Is that not what industrial relations is all about from the Government's point of view? Ultimately it boils down to looking after union mates and, wherever possible, to increasing their powers and, coincidentally, to enabling and condoning abuses of those powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that when we look at this legislation we find that several small industry organisations have refused to be involved in the process. Quite clearly others have been pressured or coerced into doing so. Some of my colleagues on this side of the House tonight have indicated how many times there have been clear instances of coercion, intimidation and pressure applied to employers and employer organisations. The real intention here, the real agenda with this legislation&mdash;as is the case with most of the Government's legislation and so-called workplace reform&mdash;is to entrench compulsory unionism. This is the only way in which the power of the union can be maintained and union bureaucrats can hold down their cushy jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without `no ticket, no shop', probably no-one would join. Why would they join? At least under the sort of system we are talking about, where we will outlaw compulsory unionism, outlaw the closed shop, the unions will have to perform. They will have to be out there selling their services. We see a place for trade unionism within the system that we propose. We have no real problem with that. But what we do say is that workers will have a choice about whether they will or will not join. That choice has not been given to them in many industries in this country. They will choose to join a union where that union can demonstrate to its workers, to the people in an industry or in an enterprise, that it can deliver a service. That is fair, equitable and, to my mind, what the good old Australian fair go is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that union membership in the private sector in particular has fallen to historically low levels, to somewhere about 30 per cent only of the private sector work force, and I think it would be considerably lower except for the fact that a small number of industries still have effective entrenched compulsory unionism. That is to be deplored. Incidentally, when we look at those industries&mdash;the motor vehicle industry in particular&mdash;we see that they are the ones that are heavily protected. That is where the argument about protection in recent times really comes home because we see that it is behind those high barriers that unions have absolutely thrived. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am prepared to admit to the honourable member for Shortland, at least in respect of some of those industries, that management has acquiesced, often under pressure or intimidation, but behind those barriers unions have thrived. Coincidentally, many of those industries are the ones where we have effective compulsory unionism. Both of those things need to go: the protection and the compulsory unionism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately the history of trade unionism in this country is littered with cases of abuse of power. As I have already said tonight, I do not want to get into the argument of whether it is the fault of employers or employees. The real debate ultimately boils down to the performance of this Government. Nevertheless, it must be a great embarrassment to this Government and, indeed, to the Labor Party that there have been so many cases of huge abuses of union power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about the building and construction industry tonight. We only have to think back to the Builders Labourers Federation. That is an embarrassment. The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) is embarrassed. We talk about the BLF! What a terrific case history in the way that a union contributes to the workplace and to work practices. We look at the history of the BLF which was for so long a prominent player in the construction industry. The BLF has the distinction of being the only trade union which has been deregistered twice under the Federal industrial relations system. It exhibited consistently reprehensible conduct. There is reason to suspect that the BWIU, which is a party to the arrangements that we are talking about tonight, is not too far removed at all from the BLF. Some of the personalities are there; some of the same faces are there; and some of the same practices are there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's record on workplace reform could be described only as woeful. Australia has been a consistent economic under-performer for years, but particularly in the years since 1983. Productivity performance in this country has been poor by international standards. In terms of productivity growth on a per annum basis, we have lagged well behind the seven major industrial countries. The fact is that the Government, even if it had the will to move apace with real reform, is completely hamstrung by its relations with the union movement. The accord, on which almost all of its economic strategy is apparently based and upon which it claims great success, actually is very much to blame for the problems. The accord process has put the industrial relations power fairly and squarely in the hands of ACTU. The accord is at the heart of our structural problems and our macro-economic difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A unique relationship exists between the ALP and the union movement. Many unions are affiliated with the ALP. Unions contribute a percentage of union dues from their members to the ALP. Another thing that we want to outlaw is this mechanism by which employers collect&mdash;which may be by force or intimidation&mdash;union dues from their employees. The obnoxious thing about that is that many of the members of those unions do not even vote for the ALP. We are talking mainly about the union bureaucrats, but the average worker that I meet these days wants to get rid of the ALP; yet if they belong to unions, some of their union dues are actually finding their way into ALP funds. I think that is completely obnoxious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They say, `He who pays the piper calls the tune'. That exactly sums up the relationship between the ALP and the union movement, and we only have to watch them in action. When Mr Kelty says, `Jump', Mr Keating's response is `How high?'. That is the relationship between the union movement and the ALP. The union movement calls the tune. The ACTU, incidentally, is rewarded consistently by the Government. It is represented on over 50 government boards and advisory committees including, of all things, the Reserve Bank. If there was ever a case of putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank, that is it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the trade union movement, the ACTU, got into business itself, it consistently went broke. It tried to get into the department store business and went down the tubes. Then it got into the service station business and it went broke. So it is pretty good at going broke itself. It has had a fair hand in many other businesses going broke as well where its practices have become entrenched. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Government will not countenance freer industrial relations between employers and their employees, which would lead to sensible work practices and increase productivity. This is because of the relationship between the union movement and the Labor Party; it is a relationship which leads to the abuses that we have been talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pacific Dunlop Ltd has been in the news in recent days. Some evidence that it has provided is actually very interesting. It shows us that 284 employees from a Pacific Dunlop subsidiary, Edgell and Birds Eye Foods, have lost their jobs because of the Keating-Kelty connection and because the Government will not allow them to get on with running their businesses. Martin Ferguson recently claimed that the ACTU was `in partnership with the ALP in government'. Trade unions are granted exemptions from paying tax and that confers all sorts of privileges on them. Over $30m has been provided in the form of grants to the union movement by the Hawke Government in the 1983 to 1989-90 period. In return, the union movement donates to the ALP. It is a very cosy arrangement, I am sure.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it really boils down to this in my view: the ALP cannot be trusted with reform of the workplace. That nexus that exists between the ALP and the union movement is so close and so cosy that it cannot deliver. It is completely hamstrung in respect of the delivery of reform. What we are talking about in this particular legislation is not reform. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member will get his go in a minute, and I will listen with interest to what he has to say. This is an excuse for reform. We, on this side of the House, are not fooled because we have seen too much evidence of the Government's approach to reform. It is painfully slow; it is inadequate; and, as I say, it is dominated by the Keating-Kelty connection. That is ultimately what it is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Brisbane is here, so let me finish with a few gems for him to think about. It is to do with our own State of Queensland. The activities of the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association actually make the BLF look a bit respectable. It was no wonder that the Goss Government in Queensland could not get its hands quickly enough on Martin Cooke and shut him up. It wanted to close down the Cooke inquiry. It could not close it down quickly enough. When we look at activities of the FEDFA, as revealed in the Cooke inquiry, we find that $2m of FEDFA funds passed through 15 secret bank accounts held by ALP Vice-President, Ken Goodhew, and others. Ninety-four thousand dollars of this money was illegally transferred out of secret bank accounts to the ALP. Rank and file union members, it transpires, were being ripped off by the union bureaucrats. Their union dues were being used for the personal comforts and interestingly, as the Cooke inquiry found out, the sexual gratification of union bosses. This is quite incredible stuff. As I say, this makes Norm Gallagher look pretty good. Norm was not such a bad fellow at all when one puts him up against Ken Goodhew. Ken Goodhew then had the audacity to use $52,000 of union funds to buy himself a unit on the Gold Coast. He lived in my electorate for a while, but I am sure that he did not vote for me in any case. He certainly did not have permission to use that money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition opposes this Bill because it, like all of the other workplace and industrial reforms that we have been presented with by this Government, is a con; it is Claytons reform. We challenge the Government to get serious about reform in the workplace; we will. We have a plan to make Australia competitive, to change the industrial relations system and the unions. Whilst they will have a role in it, they will not dominate. The Keating-Kelty connection will disappear out the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>door. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. At a recent State council meeting of the RSL, a number of resolutions were adopted. I believe that several are worthy of consideration by this House. The first relates to the question of free travel for the veterans of World War II. Some years ago the Victorian Government decided to give free travel to veterans of the Great War when they reached the age of 80 years. This travel concession was well received throughout the veterans community and widely supported in the general community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my belief that this concession should also be extended to our World War II veterans when they reach the age of 80 years. With the exception of conscripts to the Pacific theatre of war from January 1943 onwards, all members of the Australian Imperial Force have been volunteers. Indeed, as anyone who has visited the Australian War Memorial would know, the commitment of the Australian people to their country in both the Great War and the 1939-45 war, to say the least, was overwhelming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One need only read Michael McKernan's excellent work on Australia's participation in the Second World War to realise the extent to which citizens from all walks of life and  backgrounds contributed to the war effort. In fact, the title <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">All In!</EMPHASIS> encapsulates Australia's response to that war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the RSL National Congress raised the issue of damage to the nation's war memorials and shrines of remembrance. It is, indeed, a sorry state of affairs that citizens might deliberately damage these memorials, many of which were paid for in the 1920s from the savings of ordinary Australians. I believe that the present penalties are not adequate to cope with these very sad crimes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the RSL has suggested that schools should include Australia's involvement in war in the teaching of history. I fully support the RSL in its excellent recommendation. All young Australians have the right to know the achievements of their forebears. They have the right to know that the freedoms and privileges that they enjoy have been hard fought for, and often at great personal cost. Indeed, they should know, as the oppressed people of eastern Europe have known for decades, that democracy and democratic institutions are fundamental to freedom and a decent way of life. They should never be taken for granted. All young Australians have the right to know that the cemeteries of Gallipoli, the Western Front, Singapore, the Burma railway and New Guinea remain as a tribute to the sacrifices of the thousands of Australians who fought for a better world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is incredible that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has suddenly discovered that Australia has a military history and that Australians fought off the Japanese in the Pacific war. Perhaps he would support the proposition that I have just outlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At an Anzac Day ceremony last Saturday at Seaford in my electorate one speaker made what I believe were very telling comparisons between our wartime commitment and the current economic situation. In conflict, thousands of the nation's young men and women sacrificed their lives for something they believed in. They knew there was a great cause to fight for. They were prepared to defend their country and to fight for the freedoms in which they believed, and for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, in the 1990s we are sacrificing the future of 30 per cent of our young men and women for a failed political philosophy.

Their future looks pretty bleak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The speaker at this Anzac Day ceremony suggested that we should conduct a war against the scourge of unemployment, against the lack of opportunity, against the vested interests of the individuals in the industrial relations club which has made full employment in Australia illegal. He did not realise that the campaign should start in this chamber, with both sides working out a solution to this self-imposed conflict. It would mean the scaling down of Canberra, of its institutions, of its excesses, and the resources directed to worthwhile and genuine long term employment opportunities. It would mean the abolition of the IR club and its grotesque disemployment of the nation's youth over the last 20 years. It would mean freedom of association, the deregulation of the labour market and the creation of genuine opportunities for our young people. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tomorrow, 1 May, is May Day. This day had its origins in the industrial cities of nineteenth century America. In 1884 a conference of United States and Canadian trade unions set 1 May 1886 as the day on which to commence strike action in pursuit of their goal for an eight-hour working day. At that time many workers were working as many as 15 or 18 hours a day, from sunrise to sunset&mdash;a bit like present day Australian politicians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, by comparison, we already had the eight-hour working day. This right had been won as early as 1855 by the Operative Stonemasons Society in Sydney and soon afterwards by similar building trade unions in Melbourne and Sydney. The right was not easily won. It came as a result of strike action and processions, followed by negotiation. Indeed, I might add that in the entire history of industrial relations only very rarely have important rights been won by workers through negotiation, where that negotiation was not first proceeded by some demonstration of worker strength and unity of purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members might be interested in the words of the slogan used by the stonemasons in their struggle for the eight-hour day:  eight hours to work, eight hours to play, eight hours to sleep and eight bob a day. This slogan became the basis of the American trade unionists' call for a just working day when they took up the fight towards the end of the nineteenth century. The main centre of the North American struggle was the industrial city of Chicago. Here, too, the struggle was not easily won. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that first industrial workers day, May Day, in 1886, 25,000 workers took to the streets of that city. Employers and government were alarmed and called out the police. On 3 May the police attacked a meeting of striking workers outside the McCormick reaper works. Six workers were killed and many wounded. The following day another four workers and seven policemen were killed in Chicago's Haymarket Square. Eventually four labour leaders were arrested, tried and hanged. They became the union's martyred dead and symbols of the struggle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The custom of holding workers demonstrations and celebrations on May Day quickly spread from America to Europe and Australia. May Day was first celebrated by Australian workers at Barcaldine in Queensland in 1891. The early 1890s were years of struggle between unions, which were determined to hang on to their hard won rights, and many employers, who spoke openly of their determination to crush the unions or else replace them with tame ones&mdash;similar to some of the words we have heard in this chamber tonight!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1891 the focus of this conflict shifted to Queensland. In Queensland the squatters were preparing to break the shearers union by bringing in non-union labour from the south. The Queensland Government sent out police and armed troops. The shearers were arrested and gaoled. At the same time in Brisbane, mindful that shearers were marching in the face of the troopers gun, Henry Lawson was writing <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Freedom on the Wallaby</EMPHASIS>, with his famous lines:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So we must fly a rebel flag</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As others did before us</PARA>
<PARA>It is a pity that we did not hear a little more about the rebel flag instead of seeing some of the flags that are cluttering this place. Sadly, the shearers' struggle was lost on that occasion and their leaders were gaoled. But the struggle for unionism and better working conditions has continued. Today the battle that Australian shearers have is with the scab labour from New Zealand. Today Australian workers face many of the same problems as those faced by the shearers of nineteenth century Queensland. There are many persons&mdash;employers and organisations, not the least being many of those sitting on the Opposition benches&mdash;that would seek to cripple the union movement and to replace unionists with scab labour. It may be dressed up in other words, but that is what it is: scab labour. We only had to listen to the speech delivered not 20 minutes ago by the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) to find proof of what I am saying. That is what those opposite are proposing&mdash;scab labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the way ahead. This is a recipe for industrial and social disaster. There is another way to go. This way is based on greater union and worker participation in industry. Industrial relations today must be viewed within the context of today's world. The ways of the New Right and those opposite are the ways of the last century. It is time they were forsaken forever. Tomorrow night I will attend the Toast to May Day in my electorate and on Saturday I will proudly march through the streets of Wollongong with my union colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude by sounding a note of warning to those antiquarians who refuse to move out of the nineteenth century and learn their lessons from history. What the workers of the world are celebrating tomorrow and on each and every May Day is their strength, their unity of purpose and their firm resolve to struggle in the face of persecution and adversity. Time and again they have proved that they can be pushed just so far and no further. They will march tomorrow to celebrate just that&mdash;and long may they do so. </PARA>

In all items of physiological assessment, Donna has been measured in the top three. At the final camp which was held this month she came first in the individual time trial, had the second highest measure of oxygen consumption and, perhaps most importantly, managed to reach heights of achievement that had not been previously attained by female cyclists at the Australian Institute of Sport in Adelaide. </PARA>

On one occasion Donna finished ahead of three of the four who are presently to go to Europe for the final trials. The other race saw Donna beat one of the four others home. The selectors have stated to Donna that the camps in Adelaide were not the only measure of the cyclists' ability. Yet a minute from the AIS states clearly that the camps were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to be conducted at the AIS in Adelaide for the purpose of identifying three females to represent Australia at the Barcelona Olympic Games.</PARA>
<PARA>Has subjective opinion proved more important? The selectors did not attend the training camps or the races of the road squad. How much in taxpayers' funds has been effectively wasted in this charade?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Martin Whitely, the executive director of the Australian Cycling Federation, has stated to Donna that the selectors have predicted that the Olympic road race will be a bunch finish and the four girls have been selected on that criterion.

It is interesting to note that the honourable member for McPherson criticised the Labor Party and the union movement on the basis of their being involved in business.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the performance of the Liberals in Queensland&mdash;the Liberals to whom the honourable member for McPherson belongs&mdash;we will see that for 26 out of 32 years they were part of the coalition Government in Queensland, a government wracked by corruption and incompetence.

I would like to point out the fallacy of the statement that 30 per cent of the young people in this country are unemployed. That is not true; the figure is 10 per cent. The majority of young people aged between 15 and 19 years are engaged in study at secondary institutions, tertiary institutions or at TAFE.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is in contrast to the Opposition, which makes the claim about the scrap heap. It is the Labor Party that is putting that money up front; it is the Labor Government that intends to ensure that universal health cover is maintained; it is the Labor Government that is prepared to ensure that adequate wages are maintained through award conditions; and it is the Labor Government that is defending the very institutions that give young people an opportunity.

It is ironical that it is the National Party that is prepared to dud our farmers, farmers who cannot sell our produce because of the corruptive trade practices of the British and the Europeans.

I want to make a few brief remarks tonight about the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>, which I happened to be watching earlier in the evening. It related to the resource security legislation. There was a performance by the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths). I do not doubt that he has had a very difficult time with this piece of legislation. I know that he has had extensive negotiations with colleagues from my own State of Tasmania and, indeed, with my colleagues the shadow Minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) and the shadow Minister for sustainable development and the environment, the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney). He has also had extensive negotiations with the industry&mdash;the National Forests Industries Association, the Tasmanian Forest Industry Group and the Forest Industries Association of Tasmania, FIAT.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amazing thing that has happened with regard to this piece of legislation is that it now appears that, in the face of a possible negotiated settlement which would have allowed this piece of legislation to pass, it may now not pass. But interestingly tonight, the Minister, when pressed particularly strongly by the interviewer, Mr Lyneham, appeared to back away and said that there would be the opportunity early next week for the situation to be salvaged. I would have hoped that would be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the point of view of a Tasmanian watching this issue over the last four or five months&mdash;I think it is nearly six months now&mdash;I have to express extreme disappointment with one of my Tasmanian colleagues the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), because he has had the long time view that this legislation ought not to be amended to accommodate industry needs. We have got to the position in this place in the last couple of days where the views of industry had been accepted by the Government and there was to be a change of the Bill, a change in the title, to make it project specific. That would have meant that we may well have seen the legislation pass in the Senate to the benefit of all Australians. We would have seen the potential of a billion dollar investment in a pulp mill, adding value to that primary resource, meeting all those requirements and all the rhetoric that so many people in this place carry on with. All of a sudden, when the Minister went to the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) with his negotiated settlement with industry and the Opposition, he was told, as it was revealed tonight in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>, that he had to go and talk to the left wing of the Labor Party and to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and get their concurrence to the changes that he was proposing. I have to say that the Opposition had given substantial ground in this matter, as had the industry, because we primarily want to get that mill up; we need that mill in this country. When the Minister for Resources went along with his negotiated in good faith agreement, he could not secure the support of the left wing or the Minister and he came back and said tonight on television that it would appear that the matter cannot proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing is that the Prime Minister has been sitting on his hands and has not said anything about this. He went into the prime ministership with the obvious support of some in the Left: perhaps he had the support of the honourable member for Denison, I do not know; perhaps he had the support of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, I do not know. But I have to say that this issue and this decision by the ALP over the last 24 hours have a smack of acute politics about them rather than any broader assessment of what is good public policy and what is good for job creation and industry development in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say tonight that I am ashamed that my Tasmanian colleague has not stood up for the development of industry in his State. I think he has sold out his State. I am dismayed, as are so many thinking people within both industry and finance right around this country, that the Government has got itself in this position. According to the Minister tonight, there is still time. There is still time. As I understand it, the Bill will be talked out tonight and there will be an opportunity on Monday to salvage the situation. I appeal for a bit of commonsense. Let us put growth first, let us put jobs first. Let us have balanced forestry policies in this country, and let us not let left wing politics dominate an outcome which will be disastrous for all of us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to talk about the wool industry because it is Australia's greatest industry; it is the most decentralised industry. Before I do, I just want to refer to the comments of my colleague the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) who spoke earlier. I point out to him that Britain has offered Australia no sovereign threat for probably 40 years. It has no influence on our domestic policy or foreign policy and it seems rather late in the day to be tilting that particular windmill. I do not quite know why he went off on that tangent; I was quite enjoying his speech until it became inaccurate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of wool, the Australian Wool Corporation has called its annual general meeting and the shareholders, the woolgrowers of Australia, are going to attend. There is a peculiar arrangement here in the voting pattern. If motions are put forward by the Australian Wool Corporation, they require only a third of the eligible votes for them to be passed. However, motions coming from the floor, from woolgrowers, require a two-thirds majority. I am told that this form of democracy also applies in the AMLC. I am not particularly interested in the AMLC at this stage, but I am vitally interested in the wool industry because of its importance to Australia. I just do not see how this situation can be allowed to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was debating today with Mr Jackson on radio the fact that this is a whole new AWC, which is now working entirely in the interests of growers and has their interests at heart. They are fine words, but it seems to me that the rhetoric does not match the actions. The AWC seems to me to be going down the same road that the previous AWC went down. Indeed, there are many people who are common to both the old and the new AWC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One of the things that beset growers is the constant demand from these organisations that purport to speak on their behalf for extra money for promotion. That is something which needs to be analysed. If we look at the wool industry since 1970, we see that in 1970 there was 1,672,000 tonnes of wool sold. Sixteen years later, in 1986, there was 1,926,000 tonnes of wool sold&mdash;an increase of 15,302 tonnes per year. That is all. If we take the IWS figure of $100m, feed in the appropriate factors for inflation and what not, and attribute all the money spent to get those new sales, it works out that it was costing 14.84c a kilogram to get every extra kilogram of wool sold. These figures are very stark. If a person is paying three times as much to promote the sale of wool as he is getting for the wool he will simply go broke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be interesting to compare that with cotton. In that same year, 1970, 11,950,000 tonnes of cotton was sold. Sixteen years later 16,960,000 tonnes was sold&mdash;an increase of over five million tonnes. On less than 10 per cent of the wool budget, cotton is able to get that sort of improvement in end use. That works out at something like 0.08c a kilogram. On this basis, I would be very wary of giving anybody&mdash;the IWS or the Australian Wool Corporation&mdash;any more money for promotion. In my view, the present budget is more than enough. It is hard to cut back. I would simply maintain the status quo. I would not increase it at all. It is quite clear that the Wool Realisation Commission does not need vast amounts of growers' money. The wool would probably sell now out of the stockpile without any loss, but to cover the growers for incompetence and other measures I am prepared to concede them 2c. We could reduce that wool tax to 5 per cent. A 5 per cent wool tax would give the wool industry a chance. It seems  a  nonsense  to  me  to  tax  the wool</PARA>
<PARA>industry so heavily when it is on its knees, and to tax it as a precaution for something that may never happen when the real dilemma, the real problem with wool is now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The restructure of ADF pilot training, which is managed for the three services by the RAAF, involves:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a.the commercialisation of Basic Flying Training (BFT) for the Australian Army (ARA) and the Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF);</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ARA and PNGDF Basic Flying Training and RAN/RAAF Flight Screening will be carried out at a commercial facility in Tamworth, NSW.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tenders for the BFT/FSP were received from five companies. The details of those tenders are the commercial property of the tenderers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The successful tenderer was the British Aerospace Ansett Flying College Pty Ltd. This company tendered the lowest price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) No other flying schools are involved in the BFT/FSP contract; however, several flying schools in Canberra provide flying training to Private Pilot Licence standard for selected cadets at the Australian Defence Force Academy. Cadets who participate in this scheme are not required to undertake the FSP at Tamworth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) No Commonwealth subsidies were involved in the construction of the Tamworth facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The Tamworth facilities are owned by British Aerospace Ansett Flying College Pty Ltd, an equal joint venture partnership between British Aerospace (Australia) Holdings Pty Ltd and Ansett Transport Industries Pty Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The Directors of the College are Mr R. Somervaille, Mr I. Fraser, Mr J. Denny, Mr A. Krotly, Mr J. Bibo and Mr C.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) While a significant proportion of the college's business will come from overseas, the design of the facilities is directed at achieving excellence in flying training regardless of the source of the students. The facilities meet the requirements of the ADF in all respects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) A tender was received from a Coolangatta based flying school.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Department of Finance's Corporate Plan provides guidance on broad values and objectives and is expected to provide a framework for Departmental activity for several years. It was prepared through a series of activities involving a large number of Departmental officers and over a period of several months, including work during and outside ordinary office hours. It also involved a working party of varying membership and whose work on the Corporate Plan was incidental to their other duties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Program Evaluation Plan results from input by a variety of officers from each of the Department's programs and is organised and produced as one of many projects undertaken in the Resource Policies and Management Branch of the Department. The performance of the evaluation within the Plan depends largely on the nature of the work and its timing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Performance management in the Department is intrinsic to its overall operations and focuses on: detailed work plans that are prepared; work by internal and external audit; and a variety of staff appraisal mechanisms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are no officers in the Department whose full time or part time duties are solely related to the above. The activities are integrated in the broad variety of work conducted by all officers such that it is not possible to differentiate between the work done related to these activities and that required to meet the overall responsibilities of the Department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Consistent with the above, it is not possible to estimate the cost of salaries and other payments. No consultants have been engaged in relation to maintaining the activities referred to in (1).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) As mentioned above, the Corporate Plan consists of broad statements of values, objectives and intent and, as such, does not lend itself to the application of cost benefit techniques. Progress towards achievement of the Corporate Plan is addressed through ad-hoc meetings of a Corporate Plan Focus Group which, by drawing on activity and opinions obtained from throughout the Department, seeks to identify progress made. The minutes of this Group are provided to the Executive of the Department.</PARA>
