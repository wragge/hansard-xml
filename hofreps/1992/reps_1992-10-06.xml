</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1391" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Reserve Bank Act was crafted in 1959, over 30 years ago. Included in the functions of the board it states that it is the duty of the board, within the limits of its powers, to do the following things:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">best contribute to&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the stability of the currency . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) the maintenance of full employment . . . ; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>That was put there by a coalition government and has been supported by Labor governments&mdash;two of them over the period&mdash;and coalition governments in between. The bank has, of course, supported to the best of its ability the maintenance of those objectives. Now we find that the Federal Opposition is saying that it wants to remove the maintenance of full employment in Australia as an objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have just had a question about employment and unemployment and the implications for elections from a member of a coalition Opposition which is proposing that the objective of full employment be removed from the charter of Australia's central bank. I might say that these remarks come from the Leader of the Opposition, in which he made it quite clear. The question was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But if (full employment) is still in the charter you are still left with that dilemma for the Bank, aren't you?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A. That's right, so you take it out . . . I don't want you to conclude from that that means I've given up on unemployment. . .</PARA>
<PARA>It is just that he wants the Reserve Bank to give up on employment. Then it continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q. You talked about the 0&mdash;2 per cent inflation target. Are you going to write that into the Reserve Bank charter? What would be the government's position, for example, if the RBA decided that to pursue successfully that 0&mdash;2 per cent inflation target, it had to raise interest rates? Would you just allow the Reserve Bank to do that?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A. Yep.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Reserve Bank goes for its life. Then we have what I thought was the weakest part of all this&mdash;listen to this for gobbledegook:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q. So (the Bank) could say for example, with the GST: "The estimates are (that the once-off effect of inflation is) between 4 per cent and 6 per cent. This is, one, going to affect our target of 1&mdash;2 per cent and, two, we also think we might have to raise interest rates to just send the message home that we are not going to tolerate any flow through to the underlying inflation rate.</PARA>
<PARA>That is from home buyers, et cetera. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A. No. What we would say to them about the GST . . . I would write them a letter stating that we think that the one-off price effect should be accommodated&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>In other words the one-off jump in prices should be accommodated. He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and that we would be doing everything we can to make sure there are no second-round effects, through the Prices Surveillance Authority . . .</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Reserve Bank is asked to accommodate a price effect from a GST&mdash;in other words, while it has a zero to 2 per cent target, it adds to inflation&mdash;but then the Prices Surveillance Authority, which stands against everything the coalition believes in as an interventionist body, is to be dragooned into making sure that all those people out there who have actually claimed the higher prices are denied them. In other words, there is a presumption that they are doing something naughty&mdash;putting prices up&mdash;when the absolute straight impact of the GST is to add four to six percentage points to inflation. All of that comes at a time when the Reserve Bank Governor said very plainly the other day in a speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certainly opponents of those monetary and fiscal policy easings have no right to be in the vanguard of those now voicing concerns about unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>Who opposed the monetary easings and who opposes the fiscal easing? It is the Leader of the Opposition. That same person said in a piece in the early 1980s:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, I would suggest that a fully independent central bank would be inconsistent with our system of parliamentary democracy.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to conclude:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On balance I suggest that the Reserve Bank presently enjoys a reasonable and justifiable degree of independence of government both in law and practice.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a total rewrite of what the Leader of the Opposition had to write in a major article as part of a book in 1980-81&mdash;a total rewrite. Then he is up talking about unemployment and berating the Government on employment when he wants to say to the central bank of this country that it should take no heed of employment; that it should remove from the charter of just on 40 years standing the maintenance of full employment in Australia as an objective of the central bank, as an objective of this country's major monetary authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time the Leader of the Opposition wants to go on with this weak stuff about having the PSA drag down all the people who are putting the prices through.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is about the silliest thing that the Leader of the Opposition has proposed recently. It would simply make interest rates in this country higher. If people in the mortgage belt in Victoria think that they got some benefit, wait till they understand that six to seven percentage points will be coming out of their mortgage. Wait till they understand that six to seven percentage points will come out of the mortgages of those in the mortgage belt in Victoria when a GST is introduced, under the authority of a central bank which needs to take no account whatsoever of the employment consequences. That is a complete reversal of not only the Leader of the Opposition's own thoughtfully stated views in a book of 10 years ago but also coalition policy.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Superannuation has been a very important area of reform for the Government, in which we have not only simplified the treatment of superannuation when received by superannuants, but also extended eligibility for superannuation to a vast part of the population which was previously denied any, or in some cases very small amounts of, superannuation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year&mdash;I think it was late in June&mdash;I announced some major changes to the treatment of superannuation designed to simplify the taxation treatment of it and a number of other matters. In making those changes, we continued to make the distinction about that part of the service which was taxed on the pre-July 1983 arrangements and that which was accrued after July 1983. That is because it was in 1983 that we made a major change to the taxation treatment of lump sums. We decided to maintain that distinction between pre- and post-July 1983 because we did not want to upset people's retirement plans&mdash;especially those who were getting close to their actual retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have continued an arrangement whereby there is a different treatment&mdash;a 5 per cent taxation treatment&mdash;of that part of the lump sum accrued before July 1983 and a different treatment for that accrued after July 1983, with a certain portion of it being exempt from lump sum tax and then another part of the component being subject to a tax. At no point would  that  tax  be  higher than  16.25  per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the last couple of weeks there has been the publication of a document, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback! Superannuation Made Simple</EMPHASIS>, which purports to explain the Opposition's approach which it claims will be a vast simplification of superannuation. It also talks about the taxation of lump sums of superannuation. In a chapter entitled `Abolition of Lump Sum Taxes' this document goes on, first of all, to describe the current arrangements and then says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition will abolish the above regime by abolishing taxes on lump sum benefits accessed after preservation age.</PARA>
<PARA>It also goes on to say that people who receive entitlements up to $2m will be no worse off than they would have been under the existing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had an exercise undertaken about someone who I do not think would be all that unique in the Australian work force:  someone who was born in 1940, who has worked for the same employer since 1961 and who expects to retire on his fifty-fifth birthday, in July 1995. If the lump sum available to this worker were in the order of $340,000 the lump sum tax would be $12,400 but under the arrangements that the Opposition now describes that lump sum tax would be $68,000. That is, 5 1/2 times as much tax would be paid on that lump sum under the arrangements described in this document as would be the case under the existing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just remind you, Mr Speaker, of the sense in which this proposal is put to the people of Australia. It says the coalition is abolishing lump sums but it then goes on to say that people will not be worse off if their lump sum is less than $2m. Here again we have a total distortion of the language, where `abolition' does not have its ordinary meaning&mdash;that is, get rid of it. It means, first of all, retaining it; secondly, it means in many cases actually increasing the amount of tax paid in these circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, we have duplicity by the Opposition; it produces a document which is full of gross distortions and is another attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of the people of Australia. I would say to all those people in Australia, especially those who were entertaining the prospect of retiring before achieving the age of 60 and particularly those who are nearing the point at which they are about to retire, that they would do well to study this document and realise the way in which the coalition intends to punish them in their retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is another example of the Opposition's dislike of superannuation. It wants to retain it as something which is available to only a few people. It wants to deny superannuation to the great bulk of the people of Australia to whom we are trying to extend it as a means of improving their living standards in retirement.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The specific question I have been asked relates to the financial situation that Mr Kennett will face. Mr Kennett has said that a top priority of his Government will be to cut debt by $8 billion over eight years&mdash;a very substantial task. To that he will add $900m which will come from his non-acceptance of Mrs Kirner's Budget measure of cutting the Transport Accident Commission by $750m and increasing taxes by $120m. So the starting point deficit for Mr Kennett is not $1.36 billion, as forecast by the Kirner Government, but more like $2.2 billion. Mr Kennett will face a difficult task, and it will be all the more difficult with the $550m of estimated costs added in if there is a coalition victory in Canberra. In today's Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> there is a quite good analysis by Mr Colebatch of Mr Kennett's $550m dilemma. He said the coalition plans:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to strip about $2 billion a year off Canberra's $30 billion grants to the states. That would cut a Kennett Government's revenue by at least $550 million a year, a loss of $330 a year for each Victorian household.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that Mr Kennett:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . has ruled out either tax rises or applying the root-canal treatment to Government services. So what would it do when another $550 million is pulled from under its feet?</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fightback in fact offers no recurrent Budget savings. According to the officials' analysis, in the Commonwealth's own area, Fightback's tax cuts would greatly exceed its spending cuts; it would have to be ruthless with the states to break even . . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This implies that business can expect higher state taxes and charges to offset their lower federal taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>So we hear the coalition talking about payroll taxes, but it will cut $2 billion off the States. How will the States maintain their recurrent spending? Simply by again putting up their State taxes and charges on business. It will be a case of taking it away with one hand and reimposing it with the other. The article goes on to say, in relation to car makers:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly Victoria would be hit worse by the loss of car plants and clothing factories than any other state . . . For Jeff Kennett, duty to his state and duty to his party will increasingly come into conflict. He owes Victorians a clear statement of where his Government stands . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is, as we know, that there is $1 billion of funding for the $13 billion of tax cuts offered by the coalition&mdash;$1 billion. The rest of it will come from cuts in government spending. Of course the coalition cannot cut public debt interest, it will seek not to cut other non-discretionary areas of the Budget, but it will cut the discretionary areas. One of those is payments to the States. It has indicated it will take $550m off the States, right at a time when Mr Kennett is saying he will not accept Mrs Kirner's prescriptions in her Budget for one-off payments from the Transport Accident Commission and from discretionary increases in tax proposed in the former Government's budget. So there is a $550m impost coming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us see whether Mr Kennett accepts the coalition view that we are better off without car plants, that we are better off without tariffs, that we are better off without $800m being invested in Toyota, and that we are better off without investment in a Ford Falcon replacement at Ford. Let us see where he stands on these issues, or whether he sees the TCF as being decimated with zero tariffs when we see now a major reconstruction of TCF industries as instanced by the opening of Pacific Dunlop's Holeproof factory last week in Victoria and, three weeks before that, my opening of the Smith Family's non-woven cloth manufacturing plant in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When all those things go and we see the attack on the zero tariff on clothing, textiles and footwear and on the motor vehicle industry, will Mr Kennett then be so enamoured of the so-called Fightback proposals or particularly when recurrent spending is to be cut by $550m? If that happens under a coalition government it can only mean that schools, urban transportation and police and the discretionary policy will be cut to pieces under a Kennett Government, under duress from a coalition government which will take $2 billion in recurrent funding off the States and hit the industries upon which Victoria relies. I am afraid that Mr Kennett has a lot of soul-searching to do, and he might find that the sense and balance of the Federal Labor Government's policies have a lot more in common with his interests than with the interests of Dr Hewson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Dr Hewson wrote to the Catholics this week, he said that the Pope would back the GST. He has now invoked the Pope.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point is often made that Australia pays some $200m to pensioners who live overseas. What is often forgotten is that people in Australia receive some $600m from pension claims that they make on their countries of origin. So it is always important to remember, when considering the provisions we make for looking after Australians who decide to return to their country of origin, that we are very much a nation of beneficiaries from the interchange of pension payments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the Government's view that, if people qualify for an Australian age pension, they will receive that pension regardless of where they live. This means that they can get a full age pension if they have had 25 years of residence in Australia and, if they then decide that they want to return to their country of origin, we will respect that and make that payment as a recognition of their commitment and what they have given to this country. We have reciprocal agreements with some 11 other countries&mdash;that is, Canada, Italy, Britain, Spain, Malta, Ireland, New Zealand, Portugal, Cyprus, Austria and the Netherlands&mdash;to protect and hopefully improve these entitlements. We are negotiating with Germany, the United States, Finland and two or three other countries where we have had some preliminary work done. These agreements are reciprocal and require both governments to make those payments to which their residents are entitled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, 160,000 Australians benefit from that $600m payment of overseas pensions into this country. It is a major source of income for many pensioners in this country. Indeed, the average payment to those 160,000 people is almost $4,000 a year, which is over $70 a week. This is income tested in the usual way; that is, it reduces the Australian pension by 50c in the dollar above a free area of $43 per week. So everyone is better off. The pensioners receiving the pension from overseas are better off than they would otherwise be. The Australian taxpayers are better off than they would otherwise be. Of course, we have foreign exchange as a result of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has no intention of devaluing these payments in any way, but it is clear that those payments from overseas will be devalued by the GST in the usual way. In this country we are now all familiar with the 10 per cent extra on food, the 11 per cent extra on clothing and the 11 per cent extra on electricity. But the important point here is that there is no compensation whatsoever in the Fightback program as it stands at the moment for that $600m paid from overseas. There is no compensation for the overseas component of the pension.</PARA>

The housing sector has been performing extremely well in recent times and there is the possibility that the expectations of the industry may be exceeded this year.

In these circumstances I find it astonishing that members of the Opposition are still contemplating new ways of imposing taxes on housing. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document they propose to tax, at 15 per cent, all of the inputs into housing, which would increase on average the cost of a house by something like $3,000&mdash;a $3,000 extra impost on the cost of buying or building a house as a result of taxing the inputs on housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we know, the Opposition has run into some difficulty over this particular matter and now, believe it or not, it is contemplating the idea of introducing a special tax of 3 per cent on the full value of a house when a new home buyer completes it. It says that this would also cost $3,000 per house. Of course, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> authors, ever conscious of the consequences of their policy, state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While this increase is not insignificant, it needs to be seen in its proper context. For example the increase would most probably be financed by a larger mortgage.</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition wants to place a higher mortgage on the backs of home buyers in Australia. It does not stop there because, as a result of the policies which the Opposition intends to pursue, interest rates would go up. The Prime Minister has already made reference to that today. Jeff Schubert from Business Economics produced a document just a few days ago in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would expect short-term interest rates to be at least one per cent higher under Hewson&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>than under Keating&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">by the end of 1993, and perhaps two per cent. By mid-1994, just prior to the introduction of the GST, this difference could be as much as three per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a 3 per cent increase in interest rates flowing into mortgage rates before we even have the impact of the GST being visited upon home buyers. Where mortgage repayments have come down in recent times by as much as, say, $350 a month, under the policies being pursued by the Opposition, those repayments would increase by as much as $220 a month as a result of the increase in interest which the Opposition intends to pursue, without taking into account the extra taxation which it intends to extract from home purchasers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We really have to wonder where the Opposition thinks it is going, and where it thinks there is going to be support for these kinds of policies in a country where home ownership has already been given a high value, and at a time when home purchasing&mdash;the building industry itself&mdash;is playing its part in bringing on the recovery in Australia. It is just this part which has been singled out by the Opposition for special treatment in the form of making housing less affordable by the imposition of higher interest rates and, believe it or not, a special tax on housing.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government announced in this year's Budget a comprehensive program of reform of the student income support system. The first point that the Government made&mdash;the key, central element in that reform&mdash;was the reaffirmation and the strengthening of the Austudy grants system. In the lead-up to the decisions announced by the Government, it would be true to say that a degree of concern was expressed by student groups, many of which were under the misapprehension that it was the Government's intention to do away with the Austudy grants scheme. In fact, what we have done is make a number of substantive improvements to that scheme as well as entrench in legislation the regular indexation of the maximum Austudy grant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of two key improvements to the Austudy grants scheme that students have been seeking for some time is the liberalisation of the personal incomes test. That was done. The amount that students can earn over and above their Austudy grant without affecting their Austudy entitlement is now up to $6,000 a year, which is a significant increase on last year's figure and represents virtually a doubling over the space of two or three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another key element that students have been seeking is a reduction in the age at which students are deemed to be independent of their parents. At the moment it is 25 years. I think that has been far too high for some time. Clearly, it has needed to be brought down, and as part of the package of reforms we have announced that we will be bringing that age of independence down from 25 years to 22 over the space of three years. As I said, we are also legislating for the regular indexation of Austudy grants in accordance with the consumer price index. These are major, substantive improvements to the Austudy grants scheme and go a long way to addressing the concerns that students have had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also implemented a new element in student income support, the so-called Austudy supplement. That is a supplementary and purely voluntary loans arrangement whereby students can choose to forgo part of their Austudy grant in order to receive double the amount that they forgo in the form of a highly concessional loan arrangement. That loan arrangement will be structured in such a way that students will not need to start repaying until five years after they incur the debt, and then, if and when their income rises above average weekly earnings, they will repay via a modest surcharge on top of their income tax, starting at 2 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we put all these things together we end up with a strengthened and enhanced Austudy grants scheme, a considerable improvement on the existing grants scheme. Students will now be able to access significantly increased amounts of money while they are studying. That will enable many students to take on a higher workload than would otherwise have been possible. It will enable many students to avoid the need to seek part time work, to focus explicitly on their studies and to accelerate their progress through their degrees. In other words, the changes are unambiguously, clearly and substantially beneficial to the students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting that, notwithstanding the controversy that surrounded some of these proposals earlier in the year, once the details were announced in the Budget context and once the students were informed of the specific provisions of what we are proposing for Austudy, the reaction from students has been, I believe, overwhelmingly positive. The Department of Employment, Education and Training has operated a hot line service since the changes were announced. The proportion of protest calls to that hot line service has been about 0.3 per cent; in other words, fairly negligible. I have received a number of letters from students who have said that these changed arrangements and the increased income potential and increased flexibility will greatly enhance their capacity to complete their studies in the minimum time. It is a major improvement. Quite frankly, if students are concerned about threats to their capacity to receive a reasonable income while studying, they might turn their attentions to the Opposition's policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if one takes at face value that the Opposition will compensate for the GST, that makes no compensation whatsoever for any expenditure over and above Austudy. The great bulk of students do have additional sources of income; they can earn extra income. Of course, with the Austudy supplement they will be eligible to receive significant additional income over and above Austudy. There will be no compensation for students for that part of their income that exceeds the Austudy allowance. It will only compensate them for the effect on the Austudy grant itself. So students will be distinctly worse off. They will face significantly higher costs on things such as textbooks. Notwithstanding what the honourable member for Goldstein has to say, there is no doubt that students will have to pay considerably more for textbooks than under the existing scheme. That is just one example of an area where students will find their financial positions significantly eroded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the Government's announced changes to Austudy have been extremely well received. We are in the process of setting in place various measures to give effect to that scheme, including seeking and evaluating tenders from financial institutions to run the Austudy supplement. I believe the scheme will represent a major and significant improvement in the capacity of students to complete their studies in a timely fashion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is so much evidence that I have here of the beneficial way in which this charter has worked that I am not quite sure which is the most appropriate bit to refer to. Of course, in the first instance, we have the Leader of the Opposition himself saying how well the charter had worked as far as he was concerned. Of course, it is the case that this charter has worked well, with the Reserve Bank having an eye both to price stability and to its broader obligations to ensure that there is full employment, or at least the achievement of a greater level of social welfare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the greatest inflation warriors that Australia has had on the Reserve Bank was, of course, Deputy Governor Phillips. In April of this year, at about the time of his retirement, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been comfortable with the present charter which requires the Bank to use its powers so as best to contribute to stability of the currency, full employment and the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia&mdash;or, to be more precise, I have been comfortable with my interpretation of that charter.</PARA>
<PARA>We see that the current Governor of the Reserve Bank has indicated that, if the change as indicated by the Leader of the Opposition were to be made, and had that change been made earlier, he suspects that the recession would have been deeper and would have lasted longer because the bank would have been so determined to pursue that single-minded objective which the Opposition would impose on the Reserve Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Opposition is really saying in this regard is that it could not care less about employment and it could not care less about the employment consequences of the pursuit, single-mindedly, of low inflation, which is in contrast to what we are saying&mdash;and indeed what Liberal governments previously have said, that is, when Liberal governments used to have some idea of what social equity meant and used to have some idea of what it meant to extend welfare throughout the community a bit more generally. But what we have is this zealotry on the part of the current Opposition, determined to insist that the Reserve Bank have just one obligation, which is to pursue price stability and therefore low inflation without regard to the social consequences of that and without regard to the employment consequences of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the current Governor says is that, even if it did pursue that, the extra gains it would make on inflation would be minimal and the social devastation it would create would be massive. Yet that is the kind of obligation which the Opposition wants to impose on the Reserve Bank&mdash;one of single-mindedly pursuing price stability and to hell with the consequences on ordinary working men and women, or in their case non-working men and women, throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only do those opposite not care about that but also they now intend to make an article of faith, one which is legislated in the Parliament, which would take out the obligation of the Reserve Bank in the context of giving it greater independence. Therefore, they would not even be able to influence the way in which that charter was given effect to. They would impose, through a statutory change, that legal requirement on the Reserve Bank to ignore the employment consequences of pursuing low inflation. This is an abrogation of governmental responsibility to cater for the welfare of the Australian people. That should be your highest obligation&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Three days ago in the State of Victoria 10 years of Labor government ended. In the largest swing since the Second World War, Labor was thrown mercilessly out of office. Washed away in the torrent were half the members of the Labor Party in Victoria. On verdict day the Labor Party in Victoria was adjudged guilty&mdash;it was guilty and was washed away in a torrent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Labor Party is not just a Victorian operation; the Labor Party is a national organisation. When we talk about the guilty party we are not talking just about Joan Kirner, the Victorian parliamentary members or about the half of the Cabinet which lost positions; we are talking about a party organisation which, not only in Victoria but also federally, has inflicted massive damage on Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The defeat of Labor in Victoria will be a prelude to the defeat of Labor federally, just as the victory of Labor in Victoria in 1982 was a prelude to the victory of Labor in Canberra in 1983. It was not just a question of punishing Mrs Kirner, the Cabinet or the Party because it was not just a guilty Premier, guilty Ministers or a guilty number of parliamentarians&mdash;it was a guilty party. The whole Party, both in Victoria and federally, bears heavy responsibility for the damage that has been inflicted upon Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the March 1990 election&mdash;when this Government was elected some 2 1/2 years ago&mdash;the number of people out of work has increased by 430,000. Four hundred and thirty thousand more people have been put out of work and are unable to find jobs compared with 2 1/2 years ago. That means that about 480 people per day have lost jobs because of this Labor Government. In this House there are 148 members. That means that every day three times as many people as there are members in this House have lost their jobs since the Australian electorate was unfortunate enough to have Labor elected in March 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One does not have to ask questions about who is responsible for this; one does not have to ask, `Was it drought?'; one does not have to look at rainfall charts; and one does not have to look at the international trading situation. The prime culprit, the one who is responsible, stuck his hand up and said, `It was me. This was the recession we had to have. I knew there had to be a recession and I brought it on. This is my recession; this is my maniacal policy that has put 430,000 people out of work since March 1990'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some honourable members will remember that in 1986 Paul Keating attacked George Campbell at the ALP National Conference because of the metal workers wage break-out in 1981-82. He said, `George, you and the metal workers union have 100,000 dead men hanging on your necks'. I want to tell this Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that he has one million dead men hanging on his neck. I do not generally advise George Campbell, but I say to him that I would not take anything from this Prime Minister. George may have had his thousands but this Prime Minister has killed his tens of thousands. George Campbell pales into insignificance beside this Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when we have one million people unemployed in this country, can anybody in this House give me a reason why we tax jobs?  Is there any reason that anybody can think of, that any honourable member can think of, that any member of the Government can think of, as to why we have payroll tax in this country?  With one million people out of work, why is it that we are taxing jobs?  Back in 1977 Paul Keating said that he had a proposal which would reduce payroll tax and take at least 150,000 to 200,000 people off the dole queue. If we abolish payroll tax tomorrow we could probably create 200,000 jobs on the Prime Minister's own figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do we not abolish it?  Why will those opposite not stand up and say, as the coalition has said, `We will do something for people who are out of work. We will abolish payroll tax. We will do something about creating jobs in this country'. I can tell honourable members one thing:  those one million people, whom the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), who is at the table, has put out of work, are desperately looking for an opportunity to put him out of work. They are also desperately looking for an opportunity to put Paul Keating out of work. </PARA>

I looked at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Poles Apart</EMPHASIS> document trying to find an answer to why the Government will not abolish payroll tax. In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Poles Apart</EMPHASIS> it says that payroll tax is actually a good thing because it is a weight or a kind of handicap on large business which helps small business. So, if the payroll tax is on the large business, the small business is being helped so much. I suppose that it is part of the Government's policy to try to help large business become small business because if one puts enough weights on large businesses one will drive them into small business. In the Government's view payroll tax is something to help small business. It is helping small business all right! It is helping large businesses become smaller businesses and small business is going out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since March 1990, 32,000 people in Australia have become bankrupt; that is, 35 people a day have gone bankrupt. Our previous record in 1990-91 was broken in the last year by the 1991-92 figures which were 30 per cent higher. The peak bankruptcy rate under Labor is 2 1/2 times the peak bankruptcy rate in the 1981-82 downturn; that is 2 1/2 times the rate that it was in 1981-82. Joan Kirner made her contribution to economic hardship in Victoria. But it was not just Joan Kirner alone:  both she and the Victorian public know that she was a victim of Keating's policies, as much as the one million Australians who are out of work and as much as the 32,000 who have gone bankrupt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Victorian Labor was routed back to its heartland in Victoria, that should not be taken as a great success. It was basically a Brisbane Line strategy. What Labor did was to send everybody back to the Yarra. It took everybody out of the marginal seats to try to hold its Labor heartland. Why does Labor have to hold its Labor heartland?  It is because Labor knows it is an illegitimate party. Its whole rationale and its whole PR has been, `We stand for people who work. We want to look after people who work'. When Labor has put one million people out of jobs it has become an illegitimate party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members opposite were desperately concerned that they would not be able to hold the heartland and if they did not hold the heartland where would they go?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They tried every tactic that they will try in the Federal campaign. They ran the GST. Honourable members should not listen to a Prime Minister who says that that election had nothing to do with Federal issues. Those candidates were out there trying to run the GST. Even in my own electorate I had some mail from one of the candidates. He did rather well running the GST line; he had only an 8 per cent swing against him on his GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And they ran the old canards about industrial relations. We had the Victorian Minister for Labour out there saying to people, `Don't vote for the coalition; children will be down the coalmines tomorrow; there will be child labour in the factories; the world will end; there will be confrontation; wages will go down'. Do honourable members know what happened to that Minister for Labour? He lost his seat. He had a 10.9 per cent swing against him. That is how his campaign went. </PARA>

One cannot say to people, as those on the Government side do, `You have no right to negotiate wages and conditions with a single employer'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should look at the Gazal factory on the Gold Coast. That is what happened. There are people who want to save their jobs, but along comes their union and says, `No, you are not allowed to keep your jobs; we, the union, know better. You are not allowed to come to an agreement with your employer; that is against Labor Party policy. So in an effort to help the workers we, the union, will stop the deal'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members opposite cannot treat people as fools. They cannot say to them, `You have no right to choose your terms and conditions; you have no right, if you want to, to negotiate directly'. We say people ought to have that freedom. Just as they ought to have the freedom to have their wages and terms negotiated by a union on their behalf, they ought to have the freedom to do it individually. Down in Victoria all of the canards came out, all the claims were made, all the scare tactics were engaged in. What happened to Neil Pope?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are always hearing all the talk about this wonderful enterprise bargaining system from the Minister for Finance opposite, who will no doubt get up and talk about it.

Four per cent of wage and salary earners are covered by the enterprise bargaining which has been negotiated under this wonderful system. Unless it is really freed up we will never see those enterprise deals. Until we see those enterprise deals and give people some reward for effort, some freedom and some responsibility, we will not lift productivity in workplaces and until we lift productivity in workplaces and take the taxes off we will not see jobs.

Some of them came to life after they got that little rev up from the Secretary of the Labor Party. We know there is a cabal of Hawke supporters.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The speech we have just heard in this so-called matter of public importance discussion represents an attempt by the Opposition to convince itself that the results in Victoria represent something meaningful in terms of the next Federal election. I certainly would strongly refute that suggestion. In fact, on the results that we had on Saturday, we believe that we would hang onto all of our existing seats in Victoria and that at least a couple of seats which are held by the Opposition would seem to be highly vulnerable. So in terms of an assessment of the impact federally, by looking at the voting results, we would certainly reject the suggestion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would also reject the suggestion that the Federal Government is in some way responsible for the economic state of Victoria. Obviously the Federal Government has national economic responsibilities. There is an established federal economic environment, and that applies to the whole of the country. What has become very evident in recent years is the substantial difference in the level of prosperity and economic performance of the States as epitomised, I suppose, in the last couple of weeks by the election results in Queensland on the one hand and Victoria on the other, with Queensland performing economically very well and returning a Labor Government and Victoria clearly suffering considerable economic difficulties and throwing out a Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are these pronounced disparities, differences in the economic cycle, which perhaps make this recession rather more different from those that we have experienced in the past, even those of a similar degree of severity, such as the one which killed the Fraser Government.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government does not accept that the economic position in Victoria results from the policies pursued by the Federal Government. Clearly it had some impact, and clearly the recession affected the whole of Australia. In so far as that can be attributable to our policies, then clearly that had an impact in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I take this any further, I draw the attention of the House to something which is conveniently ignored by the Opposition every time it raises the economic debate, and that is the fact that recession is not an experience unique to this country; it is happening in many other countries. Anyone who has been listening to the news or watching it on television in recent times will have perceived that there are great economic troubles in the United States, which are putting the re-election prospects of President Bush in severe difficulty. There are problems throughout western Europe with the European exchange rate mechanism. Countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, Finland and New Zealand have all had severe economic troubles in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Reserve Bank, in its recent annual report, showed Australia's fall from the peak to the trough of about 2.4 per cent of GDP was substantially less than that of Finland, which had a drop of 8.9 per cent. The United Kingdom, which is pursuing Thatcherite policies which are very similar to those embraced by the Opposition, had a decline of 4.3 per cent of GDP from the peak to the trough. New Zealand, which is also pursuing similar policies, had a decline of 4.2 per cent. Canada, having just introduced a goods and services tax in the last year or so, had a decline of 3.7 per cent. Sweden had a decline of 2.9 per cent and the United States had a decline of 2.2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most countries have suffered at least a severe downturn, if not a recession. Even Germany has gone into recession and is finding it very difficult to get out of it. There are economic difficulties in this country and we are by no means unique in suffering from that experience over the last year or two. There are special factors over and above that in Victoria. That is demonstrated by the fact that the employment decline in Victoria was much more severe than that in the rest of Australia. The annual Reserve Bank <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>, dated July 1992, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employment in Victoria has fallen by 7 per cent from its peak, compared with a 2 per cent fall in the rest of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>There has been a 7 per cent fall from the peak employment level to the trough in Victoria and a 2 per cent fall for the rest of Australia. That is a very substantial difference. Why is there that difference? Is it because the manufacturing industry has a greater part of the economy in Victoria? The Reserve Bank says that that accounts for about one per cent at best of the additional fall in employment. The real factors relate to the fact that there was a boom and bust, particularly in the building industry, which had much stronger growth than the rest of Australia in the late 1980s and then a much bigger crash. This also occurred in the finance and property area and wholesale and retail sales. They are the three areas in which employment has fallen very substantially. They have fallen all around the country, but the degree of the decline is unique to Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the reason for that, in turn, has much to do with the decline of confidence in Victoria, which went far beyond that of other States because of the special Victorian factors. No other State lost a building society the way Victoria lost the Pyramid Building Society. Many people thought for a while that they had lost all their savings. No other State had the loss of a State bank, although clearly South Australia has had great difficulties with its State Bank. Those factors have had a special impact on the Victorian economy and the level of confidence. It certainly must account for a major part of the difference in the Victorian economy from the rest of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could also say that, in many respects, the State Government of Victoria was not responsible for the loss of those institutions. It was not running the Pyramid Building Society; it was being run by entrepreneurs who basically screwed up a financial institution. They ran it in a most inappropriate way for a building society by investing a large proportion of its funds in property rather than housing, and the collapse of the property boom left that institution absolutely unviable. That was not the fault of the Victorian Government; it was the fault of people who were running it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly the Government has to accept some responsibility for the State Bank. But, in effect, it was not running the State Bank or Tricontinental. In the age of deregulation, it gave the State Bank authority to run as a normal bank and not to be restricted in the way that it had been in the past. Given its head, the bank made investments which clearly were very unwise. They were investments made not by the Victorian Labor Government; they were investments made by the board of the State Bank and the board of Tricontinental, allowing lending policies to be pursued by that body, which were clearly very unwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the special Victorian factors are clear; they are well known. The Victorian people clearly said last Saturday that the Victorian Government has to bear responsibility for those special Victorian factors. They have made their decision about that. But it does not mean in any way that the Federal Government has to bear responsibility for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This argument from the honourable member for Higgins  about how we could be responsible for the operation of the Pyramid Building Society, which is not under the jurisdiction of the Reserve Bank, the Victorian State Bank or Tricontinental, is the most tenuous of all arguments. These are special Victorian factors, and the special Victorian factors have been addressed in the special Victorian election by the Victorian electors. They will have no impact on the Federal election. We are quite happy to be judged on the policies for which we are responsible, but we absolutely refute that we should be made to wear the responsibility for policies for which we are not responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to note that the outlook for Victoria is starting to improve. The latest ANZ job vacancy figures are quite encouraging, especially for Victoria. They show an almost 10 per cent increase over the last 12 months, so Victoria's economy does seem to be on the turn. Having gone most deeply into a recession, it is now becoming one of the first to come out. The whole Australian economy has been out of recession for about the last year, although it is obviously experiencing very low growth and still not too many additional jobs are being created. Clearly, the basis for recovery is now established and we can expect strong growth&mdash;or at least reasonable growth&mdash;from here on. If the Opposition's policies were to be put in place, that would not be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, if there were to be a change of government, Mr Kennett would find that Fightback is anything but a great joy for him. He is probably lucky that there will not be a change of government, but if there were to be, he would find that his financial assistance grants would be cut by 5 per cent, which would chop about $150m off his funds. He would have very much less money for public housing, because a Hewson Government would cut back on funds for that. The building better cities program would be abolished, so there would be no funds in that area. Hundreds of millions of dollars which are currently flowing to the Victorian State Government would not be flowing to it under a Hewson Government. The Victorian Government would be forced to cut services more or to increase taxes and charges. Increasing taxes and charges clearly would have an adverse effect on employment growth and economic growth in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Higgins asked why we have payroll tax in a recession when we do not have substantial job creation. His policy is absurd. It is to take away a payroll tax, which nationally costs about $6 billion, and impose a goods and services tax at a cost of about $27 billion. That $27 billion is a tax on value added. Value added is the difference between the cost of the materials that a company has to work on and the end product. It is the cost of the labour and the profits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A goods and services tax is a tax on labour. The Opposition says it would abolish payroll tax&mdash;if the States would let it, but it would have great trouble convincing the States that they should. It would have to bargain its way through it. The States certainly would demand much more than the Opposition is offering in order to get rid of payroll tax. Let us say the Opposition did get rid of payroll tax. It would then abolish a $6 billion tax on employment and put a $27 billion tax on value added, which is mostly employment. In other words, that would mean an additional tax on labour, three or four times what there is at present. The Opposition's great solution to resolving the unemployment problem in this country is to put a much bigger tax on labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any economist worth his salt will say that a tax on value added has no different economic impact from that of a tax on the labour input by way of a payroll tax. It is still a tax on employment. The honourable member for Higgins is sitting there laughing like some sort of idiot, but that is the fact&mdash;and he knows it. If he does not know it, he ought to know it. Those opposite are saying, `We are going to abolish these taxes on inputs, including the payroll tax, and on petrol and the wholesale sales tax and take $20 billion off inputs', but they will put a $27 billion tax on outputs. The net effect will be that there is more tax on business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have this nonsense about abolishing taxes on business. Those opposite are just taking them off inputs and putting them on outputs, but business still pays those taxes and passes them on to the Australian people. That will mean more costs and high inflation. On the Treasury's calculations this additional tax on employment as well as on profits will mean about 4.9 per cent additional inflation, not counting the road user charge. This is an absolutely looney policy, if those opposite are concerned to try to engender an economic recovery in this country. They promise to put a much bigger tax on employment, to make a big impact on inflation, to make 70 per cent of wage and salary earners worse off and to put bigger taxes on business, and yet they say they have the answer to our economic problems. What a lunatic solution; it is absolute lunacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing in the policies of those opposite which is going to get this economy moving. The substantial cutbacks in expenditure will reduce the prospects of economic recovery. There are massive holes in their funding which they continually ignore. They continue to ignore this $6 billion hole that we keep talking about, which is always there. What are they going to do about that? Will they impose more taxes to try to cover the $6 billion hole? Does that mean there will be even less chance of economic recovery? Of course it does. The whole package is an economic disaster and one which will certainly mean for the people of Australia, and the people of Victoria, that there will be far more economic misery under a Hewson Government than there has ever been under a Hawke or Keating Government. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Victorians do not care much for the practical results of Labor governments and what they have done in 10 years of hard labour in the State of Victoria. Victoria was once Australia's most dynamic State economy. Victorians, though, have given up on a political philosophy which puts institutions ahead of individuals, which is what the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three clear reasons why the Victorians rejected the 1980-style government by the Labor Party and its union mates and gave a massive mandate to the coalition: firstly, 10 years of economic mismanagement; secondly, a decade of veto authority by trade union leaders and the Trades Hall union bureaucracy; and, thirdly, a transfer of jobs from the private sector to our now bloated public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to economic mismanagement. There are certainly clear parallels that one can draw between the general incompetence of the grand old Labor Party in government in Victoria and the grand old Labor Party federally. We have federally in this nation $150 billion worth of debt. We have over one million registered unemployed, which is probably more like 1.8 million or 1.9 million people unemployed. By world standards we have very high net interest rates. I remind honourable members that this Prime Minister (Mr Keating) took our real interest rates to sky-rocket proportions and brought on the recession we `had to have', well in advance of any recession that the rest of the world is now experiencing. We have a depreciating dollar and we live with reduced credit ratings, both federally and in the State of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jeff Kennett and his team have a plan to revitalise Victoria to make it once again the jewel in the crown that is Australia.  The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and his team have a plan to revitalise our nation. The two plans are quite similar.  The Leader of the Opposition's plan is called Fightback. That is a pretty apt term, is it not?  That is what we, the people of this nation, need to do: we need to fight back against the incompetent Federal Labor Government.  Victorians sure fought back on Saturday.  Wasn't lovely? Those opposite are sitting here crawling now.  I  bet  they  are worried.  I  would be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have got Fightback; we have got an investment policy; we have an employment policy. Unions and government in partnership in the State of Victoria, and unions and government in partnership federally are a disaster for this country. The people know it and have woken up to that fact. A recent survey showed that 50 per cent of voters favour exclusion of trade unions from negotiations between employers and employees. You bet your life they do! Probably more than that would agree once they see the benefits of real enterprise bargaining, not this airy-fairy stuff we get now where we get a bit of cop on top of award wages and conditions and we write into the contract that, somewhere down the line, we will examine, analyse, consult&mdash;we will do all these things maybe some day&mdash;to reduce the nonsense that exists on the factory floors and work sites of many of our mines and industries around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifty per cent of union members believe that unions in this country are too powerful. That is an indictment, is it not? Labor ran the mother of all scare campaigns in Victoria on its analysis of so-called negative aspects of Phil Gude's industrial relations policy. That scare campaign failed. It certainly failed in my electorate. The centre of my electorate of La Trobe is the State seat of Monbulk. The member for Monbulk was the Minister for Labour and the Minister for School Education, Mr Neil Pope. He failed all right. He lost the seat of Monbulk to Steve McArthur with a swing of 11 per cent. We won polling booths that we have never won before. It was absolutely delightful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Neil Pope infuriated the small business owners in my electorate. We had them on the telephones in tens and hundreds. He tried to tell the community that Phil Gude's industrial relations policy amounted to exploitation. They rang and said, `Bob, I wouldn't do that. I could not do that to my people. What is he doing? He is damaging my reputation in the community. He is damaging us, damaging business'. That is what Labor governments are good at. They do not understand business; they do not understand commerce, but they sure as hell are good at damaging it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Neil Pope tried to run a very positive election campaign&mdash;he left the ALP logo off all his literature. Wasn't that cute? He denied thrice the ALP and his union connections, and he should have, too. We heard a rumour three days before the election that Neil Pope had hired a caravan for three months to go around Australia. Guess what he announced yesterday? He said, `I have got a caravan to go around Australia for three months'. It is delightful stuff&mdash;the unions and a failed government in partnership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Jeff Kennett and Phil Gude, people in the State of Victoria, and people federally under the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), will not get a partnership of trade unions and a government, because the Australian people are sick to death of it. They want real productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria that union partnership absolutely stifled action that was necessary by Joan Kirner's failed State Government because all of her Ministers were under constraint by their unions, compounded by their factions, and they would not let her take action which she knew was necessary. She knew the action had to be taken to free up enterprise in Australia. Our now failed Prime Minister, who came to that position having been a failed Treasurer, knows the action he needs to take, but Bill Kelty will not let him take that action. There is no way known that those opposite can do the kinds of things we want to do in Fightback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Finance believes in the GST. He believes in reducing income taxes. He believes in getting rid of payroll tax and fuel excise. He believes in all those things, just as we do. But Bill Kelty will not let him do that, and Ferguson will not let him either. There are many parallels that we can draw between a failed Labor Government in Victoria and a failed Federal Government in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell the House a bit about the demographics of the area of Labor's greatest loss and its slaughter. The population of the areas in the outer east of Melbourne that swung are not what are generally termed middle class or well-to-do; they are the workers of this nation who have been thrown on the scrap-heap by an uncaring Federal government and deserted by a failed State Labor government. Manufacturing industry forms the base of much of that area where the greatest swing took place. It was not fooled by the desperate scare campaign run by Neil Pope and his mates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Working men and women, both employees and small business people, are hurting desperately&mdash;and on Saturday they made it more than clear who was to blame. Our illustrious Prime Minister moved on Sunday to distance himself from the results, but I can tell him that he is part of that result. In the dying days of the Kirner Government he came to Victoria and paraded the supposed successes of Amecon as evidence of how his policies were working, but the people of Victoria were not fooled. They will not be fooled by his scare tactics and his Federal terror campaigns either. A number of State Labor candidates ran on the issue of GST in yet another attempt to frighten Victorians against voting for the coalition. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take a few minutes to enter this matter of public importance discussion. It is a very interesting one. We have had quite a deal of discussion about Victoria. Not much was said about Queensland. I must ask the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) whether the Liberal Party won enough seats in Queensland to be a registered party in the Parliament in Queensland. We have not heard the answer to that question yet. He cannot wander in here and say, `Hey, we have given a real kick in the backside to Labor in Victoria&mdash;isn't that terrific?&mdash;but we took a real crunch in Queensland. Isn't that terrific too?'. They are State elections and they are fought on State issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The interesting thing about this is that there is an assumption among honourable members opposite that the voters are not very sophisticated. But voters are very sophisticated. They understand the issues, and they understand the difference between State and Federal issues and the impacts of State and Federal policies. We have seen that with the quite disparate results from Queensland and Victoria. There is a sophistication. We saw it in the last Federal election, with quite different results in different States. The electorates do not have a very sophisticated way of showing it. When a voter goes into the ballot box, it is either yes or no. What we are looking at, particularly in Victoria&mdash;as we have focused on Victoria so strongly today&mdash;are the prospects for the next Federal election in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at whether or not a sophisticated voter who understands the issues very well will put a tick or a cross in the box. First of all, the voters will look at the issue of GST versus jobs. I may not be very sophisticated in my economic understanding, but no-one has ever convinced me that increasing the price of something will create more jobs. I would say that, if prices go up, demand will fall. Therefore, there will be less demand at the factory or wherever, and therefore there will be fewer jobs. Something seems a bit mixed up on the opposite side. Those opposite somehow feel that, if they add $26 billion to the price of the product to the consumer, that is somehow going to create more jobs. That is very interesting. I think a sophisticated voter will have a think about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The voters of Victoria might wonder whether they want zero tariffs in the car industry. That would mean that a Magna, a Holden, or a Falcon&mdash;cars that are 100 per cent manufactured in Australia&mdash;would all of a sudden be exposed to zero tariffs. They know the difference between a coalition that does not care whether there is a motor industry in Australia and a government which is absolutely committed to maintaining the car industry and maintaining its protection&mdash;all the workers in the textile industry included. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite should undertake a sophisticated analysis of the results in Victoria last week and ask themselves why in places such as Geelong, for all the coverage, all the presentation, all the doom and gloom there&mdash;even with the failed Pyramid Building Society which, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) pointed out today, was being run by the mates of those opposite&mdash;the swing against Labor was an average of 3 1/2 per cent. It is because the people in Geelong understand very well that one Ford factory is worth a hell of a lot of Pyramid building societies, and that message is going to wander around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do honourable members opposite think people in the western and northern suburbs of Melbourne&mdash;for all their anger with the State Labor Government&mdash;contained their swings to 2 to 3 per cent coming off the last 1988 State results? Let us get a little more sophisticated and look at the mortgage belt. The honourable member for La Trobe stood up and told us about the swings in his electorate. That is fine. What happened out in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne&mdash;always known as the mortgage belt&mdash;at the last Federal election? There was a big swing against Federal Labor. People were hurting because of high interest rates, hurting because of their mortgages. There was a big swing against Federal Labor and it lost about nine seats in that State. There are no more to lose out the honourable member's way. But let us have a look at these people. Where are they now?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) made the point during Question Time, in answer to one of the Opposition's inane questions, that those same people in that mortgage belt have had up to a $300 per month reduction in their mortgage repayments between the last Federal election in March 1990 and the next one next year. I suspect that we will be talking to those people, because those people now know that, if GST is added to their bank bill and to their GST mortgage interest rate, that $300 reduction in their mortgage payment will actually be going back on. The sophisticated voter will be dealing with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at the question of inflation. The very same people whose wages have increased in real terms in the last 18 months as inflation has fallen to levels of 2 per cent are having all of a sudden to look at a new analysis from the Opposition: where the GST is added, inflation is immediately increased by 4 to 6 per cent, and at the same time those opposite want to reduce their wages. They want to increase inflation. They want a tax on everything they buy, including food. The Catholic Social Welfare Committee has even come out and said that it is not only unfair but also amoral. Those opposite would not only put the tax on everything; they want to increase inflation and reduce wages. I think the sophisticated voters in Victoria will be able to work their way through this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We come to another interest group in Victoria&mdash;local government. I have a lot of dealings with local government. I have many councils in my electorate. I know what they think about the Opposition's road user charge, its road funding policies and their effect on rates. Let us have a look at local government.

At the moment they receive substantial grants from the Federal Government. They receive substantial amounts of road funds. What do they do? The obvious answer is: either not do the work, which is more jobs lost, or lift their rates. Ordinary people can well work out that cuts in funds to their councils from the Federal Government mean that either the roads get done or they do not, and it means that they will have to pay higher rates. They understand it. They are sophisticated enough to know that you cannot take it out with one hand and put it back with another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot believe that those opposite are out trying to sell this stuff that they go on with about payroll tax. We have worked out&mdash;and this has never been disputed by those opposite&mdash;that at the moment there are 70,000 to 90,000 companies that actually collect and pay wholesale sales tax to the Australian Taxation Office. Under the proposal of those opposite, every business that operates some kind of sales outlet, whether a pizza shop or a major distributor, will have to collect and hand in GST. We have worked out that in the vicinity of 1.2 million sales outlets will be dealing with GST. This is supposed to be making the economy more efficient! At present we have 70,000 collection points; under those opposite it would be 1.2 million. There is one aspect in Fightback that is a jobs plan; it is 20,000 jobs in the Tax Office to administer the paperwork in collecting the GST from all these businesses across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the voters are very sophisticated, for all that the Opposition wants to make of the outcome in Victoria. Of course the Victorian State Government was going to get a kick in the backside. I think Joan Kirner has done a tremendous job to retain the vote to the swing that it was. We have to take the lessons from that. The lesson for me in here is that the sophisticated voter is not going to be interested in those opposite at the next Federal election. In fact I have given one of my colleagues here three points in. He has said that I am in trouble, but I have at least a 3 per cent swing back, and I will have a bet with anyone around here on that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In considering the appropriations for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Finance, the Department of the Treasury and the Advance to the Minister for Finance, we should bear in mind some of the ways in which these departments have been used and abused by this Government. The Treasury is one example. The Treasury has entered into the public debate largely by virtue of the analysis that the Government insisted it perform on the coalition's Fightback package. Of course, it did so at the expense of taxpayers. That analysis now forms the basis of the Government's big lie that 70 per cent of households would be worse off under Fightback. It is a big lie and the Government knows it is a big lie because what the Treasury analysis of Fightback really showed was that all of the 140 community groups examined by Treasury would be better off under the coalition's proposals. That was the result of the Treasury's initial analysis before it went away to fiddle the figures and to give the Government the outcome that the Government insisted it get from Treasury.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process by which the Treasury then worked its way towards the result sought by the Government was a shabby political exercise that deserves to be recounted in full again and again. Although the Treasury found that Fightback would have a lower consumer price index impact than even the coalition had anticipated, Treasury then went on to cook up an entirely new CPI figure with which to carry out its distributional analysis by adding in the coalition's proposed increase of the excise on tobacco. But even with this wrongly inflated CPI figure the Treasury's subsequent distributional analysis showed that not one of the 140 community groups would be worse off under Fightback. This required the Treasury to analyse the impact of some of the coalition's expenditure proposals in an attempt to manufacture some groups of losers under Fightback. This was a partial analysis since the Treasury imputed, which is to say that it picked and chose from a range of expenditure proposals that it would take into account, despite its own admission on another occasion that a partial analysis of the Fightback package would be inadequate. So there we have the double and treble standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the fiddle, the Treasury could still come up with only two out of 140 community groups that might be worse off. These two groups amounted to a whopping 0.68 per cent&mdash;less than one per cent&mdash;of the total population taken into account by the Treasury in its distributional tables. In view of this result, the Treasury resorted to the now infamous bracket creep fiddle, to scrounge up the result it needed. But, even with the Treasury's dubious use of bracket creep, the Fightback package still comes out of the Treasury analysis looking good. Firstly, it is not 70 per cent of households, but 70 per cent of those households with full time wage and salary earners, which are supposedly worse off. It is because those households are paying tax that they are caught up in the Treasury's arbitrary bracket creep assumptions. Otherwise, they would still be better off under Fightback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The really interesting thing about the Treasury's distribution analysis, however, is that, despite the fiddling of the figures, vast numbers of people are still better off under the dubious Treasury figure, under the coalition's Fightback. One hundred per cent of age pensioner income groups will still be better off. One hundred per cent of the unemployed and those on sickness benefit will still be better off. Ninety per cent of sole parent and widow income categories will still be better off, as will be 90 per cent of superannuants and self-funded retirees. Of course, in reality, the overwhelming majority of Australians are going to be better off under Fightback when one ignores the arbitrary bracket creep assumptions of the Department of the Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If anyone is worse off as a result of the Treasury analysis, it is the Australian taxpayers who were obliged to fund this ridiculous Treasury exercise on behalf of the Government in pursuit of its ambition to get re-elected. The Government is entitled to take advice from the Commonwealth bureaucracy&mdash;of course it is&mdash;and to make use of that advice for its legitimate purposes of government. What it is not entitled to do, however, is to hijack the name and reputation of a Commonwealth department such as the Treasury for its own political advantage. The Government should have presented the analysis prepared by Treasury as its own analysis even though Treasury carried out the bulk of the work. Of course, the problem is that no-one would believe anything coming out of this Government, which is why it had to hide behind the good name of the Treasury in order to get away with its outrageous distortions and misrepresentations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has sought to imply that the coalition's Fightback package has been subject to independent analysis by the Commonwealth Treasury with the results that I have mentioned already. More ominously, because no-one believes this Government any more, the Government's actions have called into question the integrity and reputation of the Commonwealth Treasury. Within the Treasury portfolio we have the Reserve Bank of Australia, whose reputation and integrity have suffered heavily during the term of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that hardly a day goes by without a member of the Reserve Bank board, having been appointed by this Government, making some sort of attack on coalition policy. The Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Fraser, for a long time was guilty of making remarks that could easily be interpreted, and often were interpreted, as criticisms of coalition policy. He has long since crossed over that line, however, and lately has been guilty of outright interference in the political process, along with some other Reserve Bank board members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential to the conduct of monetary policy that the Reserve Bank be a credible and respected authority. Without that credibility and without the respect of economic actors, both in Australia and overseas, an anti-inflationary monetary policy is simply not possible, except by accident, as we find is the case as a result of the Government's deliberate recessionary policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certain members of the Reserve Bank board have done this country a great disservice by allowing their positions of authority to be used for partisan political purposes. There is also a strong argument for removing some of the undue influence of the Treasury from the Reserve Bank, by removing the Secretary to the Treasury from the Reserve Bank board. It was the mishandling of monetary policy at the behest of the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister (Mr Keating), that was primarily responsible for the recession from which we are now struggling to emerge. We should therefore attach considerable importance to reforming the processes by which monetary policy in Australia is determined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New Zealand example is an important one in this regard. It is worth noting what the Reserve Bank of New Zealand had to say in its monetary policy statement of September 1990, since it backs up a lot of what the coalition has been saying about the importance of reforming the conduct of monetary policy. That statement said of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act is based squarely on the weight of New Zealand and international evidence which suggests that price stability is the single most valuable contribution that monetary policy can make to New Zealand's economic and social welfare, and the only contribution that is likely to endure.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the position being put by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) on behalf of the coalition. I think it is something we could well dwell on and I would ask that the Government start getting its act in order and stop exploiting members of the Reserve Bank board, and certainly the Treasury, in the way it has and, in doing so, bringing that bank into great disrepute. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These Appropriation Bills are part of the larger Budget strategy which the Government is using to provide direction to the development of Australia into the 1990s. They illustrate the cutting edge of the debate with the Opposition about the role to be played in governing Australia by the market mechanism on the one hand and public policy and national objectives on the other. This dispute arises at both a macro and a micro level. In these Appropriation Bills at the macro level, Government policy will produce an economic stimulus of a $13 billion deficit which concentrates on developing the nation's transport skills and social welfare infrastructure; whereas the Opposition would like us to slash Government programs, hence stalling the upswing of the business cycle and destroying the welfare maintenance and equitable income transfer policies represented by the Budget in the health, child-care, training, income transfer and other spheres.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These differences show up in the broad Budget strategy but they also show up in the more careful and minute scrutiny of each department represented in these Appropriation Bills. Today we are talking about the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and Treasury. I should say as an aside, in response to the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who spoke previously, that the public of Australia is entitled to have both Government and Opposition programs costed by Treasury officials in the careful scrutiny which they are able to provide, to look at the credibility of their income-generating and expenditure patterns and to see whether there are any holes. They do this for governments of all political persuasions. They do it with every Budget and they do it with every economic statement. The public is entitled to see a similar estimate made of any Opposition statement, particularly when it runs to 650 pages and encompasses everything that one can envisage being dealt with in public policy. This is what the Treasury did. It found holes, and of course the Opposition is groping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to look at four items in the Prime Minister and Cabinet and Treasury appropriations, particularly the agenda for women, industry policy, multiculturalism and social justice. If one looks at the PM and C appropriation, one sees an allocation of $3.2m to women's programs. It is apparently a small amount but it is one which ensures that the agenda for women is at the forefront in the thinking of Prime Minister and Cabinet. Historically, women have been disadvantaged by the operation of the market mechanism in this country. They have had fewer opportunities in education, they have been paid less money, often for doing the same job and, until it was abolished by a Federal Labor government, they had lower award rates. They have had a lower level of access to superannuation and their chances of promotion in almost every sphere of economic activity have been lower. These situations have been greatly worsened when they have been performing the roles of both mother and worker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Market outcomes, in short, did not serve women well if they aspired to a role other than that of a non-working wife.

The entrenched prejudices against women in various areas of social life, particularly in the work force, have been vehemently fought against for the last 20 years by the modern feminist movement and by this Government for nearly a decade. Some amelioration of inequalities faced by women in social life has been in evidence. For example, of the 1.6 million new jobs created since 1983, despite the present recession, about 60 per cent have been filled by women. As a result, our labour participation rate is among the highest in the world and, as part consequence, we have a higher unemployment rate than we would have done with a similar participation rate to that of John Howard in 1982, which has added about 4 per cent&mdash;from 6 to 10&mdash;to our nominal unemployment rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These jobs have in part resulted from a quicker economic growth rate during the last 10 years, than the previous 10 years, and also from the reforms designed to make improvements in social access and equity for women. Child-care places, for example, have been increased from 40,000 to 160,000, with 50,000 more to follow by 1995. These have been targeted at low to middle income parents through a system of fee relief and operational subsidies. By moving to tax deductions and lower subsidies, and taking $30m out of the child-care system, the Opposition would make it that much harder for women to access the work force. As I told a child-care conference organised by the South Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry last week, this would mitigate and set on its heels a very effective mechanism for enabling women, if they so desire, to get back into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, if one looks at female equality outcomes in health, education and access to income levels, one finds that it requires intervention by government against the market mechanism to push in the direction of equality for women. The Opposition seeks to abolish those very agencies in government which we see funded in the Appropriation Bill, notably the Affirmative Action Agency, established in 1986; the equal pay unit in the Department of Industrial Relations; the work and family unit; and the Office of the Status of Women&mdash;the very agencies that are out there intervening in the market to try to ensure access and equity for women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The market alone will not do these things. The last 10 years have seen this process of assaulting market mechanisms in order to improve the situation for women. Treating them the same as men is to ignore 100 years of deep prejudice against certain roles being performed by women. I note the importance of maintaining these programs. While they are relatively cheap in terms of the overall Budget, they are an important symbol of this Government's commitment to equality for women within the national agenda for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar tale may be told in the industry policy sphere. In line 675, dealing with the Department of the Treasury, we see $22m allocated to the Industry Commission. This body is one of the major institutions through which the Commonwealth Government creates and operates its industry policy. The tariff is not the only policy tool but historically it has been a very important agency of industry policy in this country, together with industrial relations and capital markets access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission has been used by this Government as a major research body to determine the level and structure of assistance that should be granted to different industries in intervention of the operation of the free market. Among these, very importantly, has been car production. From the mid-1980s, the car industry has been subject to the so-called Button plan which has used tariff cuts, labour market reforms and import-export trade-offs to reduce the number of car models produced in Australia to get their quality up, their price down and to enhance their import capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two or three years ago the Industry Commission reviewed the progress of this plan and, generally speaking, approved the resultant movements that were taking place but suggested some further tariff cuts to a nominal 15 per cent by the mid-1990s. This followed exhaustive inquiries into the industry and talks with many of the producers in it&mdash;it was not something which was dreamt up in an office in Canberra; it followed quite exhaustive investigations and discussions with people actually involved in making motor cars. It was a recommendation based on government intervention to produce a viable domestic car industry, on the one hand, which would shed some of its least efficient producers and cars and components, on the other hand, but would maintain an industry producing a smaller number of automobile models in a better, cheaper and more efficient way. It was to be the planned application of the market mechanism regulated by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, these proposals went to the Government and it determined that the Industry Commission report was a little too radical&mdash;and, again, making the assessment of how it could maintain an automobile production industry in this country, but one which would be producing more efficiently for the consumers, workers and balance of payments of this country by enhancing its capacity to export&mdash;the Government decided that the target of 15 per cent tariffs for the mid-1990s would be pushed out to the year 2000. This would mean, combined with the export-import trade-off which had been operating very effectively to produce enhanced export capacity and intentions in the automobile industry, a real effective protective tariff regime of 35 per cent. The important point to note is that this was a plan formulated carefully and thought about with social objectives which uses government intervention to regulate the free operation of the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August 1990, at about the time that the Industry Commission was to report on this industry but apparently in complete ignorance of it, the Opposition announced that it would go to zero tariffs by the year 2000 if it were elected. It has not yet&mdash;two years later&mdash;announced the steps that it will take to meet this target. It has also given no indication as to what of the present car industry it expects to survive if zero tariffs were to be introduced. In some statements it suggests that it does not, and cannot, know because it is not its decision. In other statements it says that if nothing in the car industry survives it is not really its business. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was contacted by one of my constituents whose daughter's marriage unfortunately came to an end in 1990. In May of that year the Family Court at Parramatta issued an order requiring the husband of the marriage to contribute an amount towards the support of the son. In the 17 months since the order was made, only one payment was received and that was in November 1990. Since the date of the original order, the daughter of my constituent had frequent contact with the agency in a bid to secure regular payment of the commitment. My constituent says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The contact with the Agency has been marked by inertia, bungling, rudeness and lack of results.</PARA>
<PARA>His daughter took up the matter with her local member, the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Leo McLeay), and the honourable member's office secured an apology from the agency and a promise of action. That was in July 1991. Following that apology and promise of action, the agency said it would ensure that `the appropriate follow-up action quickly takes place'. But no payment was received following that letter. My constituent says that the staff at the honourable member's office agreed with his daughter that she should consider contacting <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Investigators</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the honourable member's staff now ignore her telephone calls and her last call to the agency ended when the contact officer hung up the telephone during the conversation. At all times this constituent's daughter had made known to the agency the address of the husband and his employment details. My constituent states that the husband:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . is in a stable residential situation and also in stable employment. He receives, apparently, a substantial regular salary.</PARA>
<PARA>That letter was written to me in October 1991. I wrote immediately to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) on 30 October drawing the matter to his attention. I concluded my letter by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that some action can be taken to improve the situation for those women who rely on these payments to make ends meet and the irregularity of the payments does little to enhance their financial security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would be grateful for your examination of this matter and your assistance in having it resolved satisfactorily.</PARA>
<PARA>That was on 30 October 1991. I wrote again to the Parliamentary Secretary on 13 May 1992, advising him that I had written to him on 30 October. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is now seven months since I wrote to you, the situation remains unchanged . . . I would be grateful for your urgent response to this matter.</PARA>
<PARA>There was no reply. I wrote to him on 31 August 1992 and I concluded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having received no further advice I wrote to you again on 13 May . . . To date no acknowledgment or reply has been received to my representations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As it is almost twelve months since I wrote to you I now ask when might I expect to receive an answer?</PARA>
<PARA>I wrote that letter to Senator McMullan on 31 August this year. I did get a reply from Senator McMullan on 8 September, in which he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As is usual in these matters, I sought the comments of the Child Support Registrar.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .         . . .         . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further summons has issued through the local court, for maintenance which has accrued between the period 1 August 1991 to 1 February 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Child Support Agency is actively pursuing all available methods to secure payment . . . However, payment of maintenance can only be made where a payment is actually received by the Child Support Agency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust this information is of assistance to you.</PARA>
<PARA>This reply was dated 8 September 1992&mdash;almost a year after I was in touch with him in October 1991&mdash;and still the daughter of my constituent has not received any child maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA>I understand that the CSA was established in 1988 and it is said to be generally doing a good job. This is indicated by the fact that before the agency began less than 30 per cent of maintenance was being paid. I believe the agency is now collecting 70 per cent. The average maintenance payment per child has risen from $27 per week in 1988 to about $50 per week at present. I do not make any assumptions about that. I am told that a Federal parliamentary inquiry of February 1992, which was headed by Justice Fogarty, reported favourably on the scheme. It is estimated that 2,000 new clients per week are being added to the agency. That is a comment on marriage breakdown within this community, which is a very sad indictment of the state of the situation regarding marriage in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, in the face of those encouraging statistics the example of my constituent's daughter comes to mind very starkly. It is well over 18 months since this case was brought to the attention of the Child Support Agency. It has been through the offices of two members of parliament. Unfortunately, it seems to me that the Parliamentary Secretary was very dilatory in dealing with my letter of 30 October last year. It took me almost a year to get something out of the agency through him, and even then the agency has not done anything to alleviate the circumstances of my constituent's daughter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main criticisms of the agency that I receive in my electorate office are that it is too slow, it is rigid and bureaucratic, it is totally inflexible in adjusting or correcting errors, its decisions sometimes appear arbitrary and ill-explained, and it is often suggested that the agency is under-staffed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is a fact that the estimated 2,000 new clients per week are being added to the agency, obviously the question of its staffing needs urgent attention because we are dealing with a situation in which many people are in very critical financial circumstances. If we have a situation repeated, such as that being experienced by my constituent's daughter, the agency is simply not doing its job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would suggest to the Government that whilst there is a real need for an organisation such as the Child Support Agency, and I am glad that Justice Fogarty found favourably in relation to its operations, a great deal more attention needs to be paid to the administration, the staffing and the work of the agency if it is to fulfil its basic function of providing services to those whose special needs are brought to its attention. In raising the question of the agency and its administration within the estimates that we are debating here this afternoon, I hope that the Government will look very clearly and closely at how the agency is actually functioning and whether it is effectively carrying out its charter of providing support for people who often find themselves in very real financial problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the estimates for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, I want to focus on some of the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) himself. We meet here today in the wake of the great Liberal-National Party victory in Victoria with the largest swing in the postwar period which savaged former Premier Joan Kirner and the Australian Labor Party. Those sympathetic to the Labor Party generally would see that election as fought on State issues but, as Glenn Milne, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper's political editor put it under the heading `Voters hate bad economics', the significant message of the Kennett victory is that `voters will not tolerate failed economic policies'. That includes Federal policies as well as State. That is precisely what the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland, embodies:  the failure of his economic policy manifested in the recession we had to have, and in the highest levels of unemployment since the Great Depression.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one counts underemployment as well as unemployment, in the order of 1 1/2 million Australians and their families are affected with all the tragedy and deprivation that that involves. But, what is more, the Government has no comprehensive, concerted program, no plan to address the deep-seated problems of this country. The first and foremost problem is tragic unemployment. Second is the slide in Australian living standards so that we are set to be the first generation of Australians who pass on to our children a lower standard of living than we ourselves received. Third, is the problem of the vast and disabling overseas debt, which currently totals $200 billion if one includes net equity liabilities as well as debt in a strict sense, and all that that involves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no plan but rather there is just the prescription of more of the same plus a stimulus, and the groundless faith that all will be fine. It has always been the line that things will be fine&mdash;when, in fact, the truth is that they will not be fine until we start to make some fundamental changes. We can go back over this Prime Minister's own words. I start back in 1987 when, over in the provisional Parliament House following the banana republic statement of 1986, as the Treasurer bringing in the Budget he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tonight I can report that Australia is winning.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1988 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this is the one that brings home the bacon.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister seems to have developed a particular interest in this area. In 1989, Mr Keating, the then Treasurer, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is entering a golden era of economic change.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1990 in the election he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I won't let there be a recession.</PARA>
<PARA>He was very emphatic and yet he knew that his policy of business interest rates greater than 20 per cent for more than a year would bring without any doubt the very recession which, when it really hit, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That was the recession we had to have.</PARA>
<PARA>In the previous session of the Parliament the Prime Minister was still conveying this impression that things would be fine. In that incredible speech to the Press Club he mounted an all out attack on the coalition's comprehensive plan to come to grips with Australia's great challenges; that is, the Fightback package. He said scarcely a word about what he or the Government would do about reforming Australia's economy and overcoming our tragic unemployment and debt problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the only deduction one can make. A specific charge that the Prime Minister mounted both in the last sitting week and in the Press Club address about the coalition's Fightback program was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it would put the entire economy at risk to deliver one political objective&mdash;a 30 per cent marginal income tax rate for most taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA>The way that reads there seems to be a question mark over that particular objective itself. But I would strongly assert that that is a most desirable objective, particularly from the point of view of creating incentive. Incentive is at the core of the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we offer is an income tax structure in which from an income of $20,700 per annum all the way to $50,000 the marginal rate of tax is 30 per cent. That would cover something like 95 per cent of Australian taxpayers. Incidentally, when one thinks of the sort of support expressed for the Bjelke-Petersen flat rate of 20 or 25 per cent, our proposed tax table would involve an average tax rate of only 20 per cent or less right up to about $40,000. This is a very important proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the tax cut objective is not only our view, it is also the Government's view, because the Government has pursued the same objective of a 30 per cent marginal rate for most taxpayers from the February One Nation statement right through to its desperation moves in the sales tax amendment Bills which were introduced in the last sitting week. Those Bills were brought in to dredge out an extra $4.5 billion towards the financing of that sort of marginal tax rate. Terry McCrann described them rightly as, `Prime Minister plums the depths of cynicism'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that reference to Fightback creating difficulties to achieve one political objective, I stress that the Fightback program is not focused on a single objective&mdash;although there may be only one that occupies the Prime Minister's mind.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is absolute hogwash&mdash;pun intended.

The goods and services tax is an integral part&mdash;not the be-all and end-all, but an integral part&mdash;of the coalition's total program for strong sustainable growth and jobs. It is not a case of GST or jobs, but GST as part of a total program for jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essential point is that with the abolition of those taxes we can strip away millions of dollars of cost burden on industry, and in particular on goods to be exported and goods to compete with imports. So, there will be increased production in Australia of export goods and the goods that compete with imports. This will lead to more jobs. By increasing exports and minimising imports the program will attack our balance of payments problem and our great and burgeoning debt.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are no magic solutions and everyone knows that, including honourable gentlemen opposite.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Recently the High Court took a decision, correctly or incorrectly, relating to free speech. I have some serious concerns about the long term implications of that decision. Firstly, one wonders what the term `free speech' means when we talk of free speech at $2,000 a second. It is supposed to reflect the expression and communication of political views when in fact, no matter which party is involved, it is a cut and paste job by an advertising agency which almost without question in no way relates to the political process or to any of the policies of the parties concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make that point because I think the movement of the High Court into the interpretation of matters which are not necessarily spelled out in the Constitution, moving in the direction of the American Supreme Court, is extremely dangerous. While in Europe last year I followed a number of the Senate hearings on the appointment of Mr Justice Thomas. I watched them on television as they were broadcast ad infinitum. I have to say it was certainly a demeaning experience for anybody who had reached a stage in life where he should have been either accepted or rejected as a person suitable for appointment to the highest court in that land. It was demeaning because Mr Justice Thomas was not questioned on his legal qualifications, his experience in jurisprudence or his likely ability as a judge; his appointment was being based on his likely political or social attitudes to questions where the Supreme Court of the United States, and not the Congress of the United States, exercises the political power and makes the political judgments&mdash;and, in fact, legislates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hate to see our High Court move in that direction. I would hate to see a situation where this Parliament felt that it had to take unto itself that sort of cross-examination or that sort of questioning of people chosen to go to the highest court in the land. We all dispute some of its decisions, but generally High Court judges in Australia have achieved a great deal of respect. If the Court moves itself into the political arena, then it must expect that the political process will move into the courts. This is not necessarily to the benefit of either. One would hope that the courts in this country can remain independent of the political process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat what I said before: I have grave doubts about this judgment in which the High Court chose to express its view, but I will not criticise it here. I have to say that a 30-second political advertisement does not really seem to me to be an expression of free speech. The vast majority of Australians could not even get on television once in a lifetime&mdash;they would have to sell their house to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter I wish to speak on is a matter raised by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar). It relates to the Family Court. I have no solutions to the problems confronting the Family Court, but I do believe that the whole operation of the Family Law Act and the Family Court should be looked at&mdash;probably not by this Parliament but by the next Parliament. We should have a very long look at the Act, at the enormous degree of bitterness coming out of that Court, and at the way in which some of the judgments and some of the legislation is affecting the lives of ordinary Australians, people who have lived normal lives until an event which unfortunately occurs too often, the break-up of a marriage, suddenly becomes an almost wartime battleground between two individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it is operating at the moment the Family Court appears to have no reconciliation role. It certainly does nothing to mitigate the circumstances in which a separation is taking place. The procedures which exist certainly make the way in which some non-custodial parents, to use the correct term, are being required to live subsequent to a break-up almost impossible. A lot of questions need to be resolved and there are no easy answers. It important to draw to the attention of the House the fact that the system is not working at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I remember it took three years for the Family Law Act to go through this Parliament; it may have been even longer. To commence a review at this stage of the Parliament would not necessarily achieve much, but I believe one of the most important things for the next Parliament to deal with is how that Act can be made to work better. In my opinion it is not a matter which impinges on party politics. Some of the worst aspects of the Act were passed here in good faith by majorities, and I think the time and effort put into it by individual members may well have been thought to have been in everyone's best interests, but the Act is not working and we have to look at it. As it is considered to be non-party and as the votes from the House will be non-party we will have to look at it as a Parliament, not as a group of individuals. Certainly I do not think the House will accept a Government-imposed solution to a serious social issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have one other point that I would like to make. I have heard two honourable members so far in this debate make reference to decisions with respect to the current generation and what we pass on to our children. I remember that the Commonwealth Bank Board in 1930 and 1931 took a decision not to allow the Government of the day to borrow money in order to finance a budget deficit, a procedure which was subsequently undertaken by the Roosevelt Administration in the New Deal in order to try to create jobs. The result in Australia was not in the best interests of the country. At that time the Commonwealth Bank Board was not capable of being directed by the Government, and an opposition Senate agreed with the board. The Government had to cut across-the-board almost all of its areas of expenditure. It is all right for people now to say that this will be the first government to pass on to its children a country which is in a worse condition than it was received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well be that if we had not had a Second World War the mess that was created by the bad decisions of the Commonwealth Bank Board, and upheld for several years by governments in this country, would not have been resolved by now. The Second World War is all that pulled us out of the 1930s Depression, nothing else, and I do not think that any of us want a third world war to end this recession. We need sound government policies which can be pursued. I make the point, as I did at the start, that there is no evidence that a VAT or a GST has worked in any of the countries in which it is being used at the moment. </PARA>

The country is leaping out of its skin. New Zealand was almost a basket case 10 or 15 years ago, and now it is winning contracts hands down from Australian companies on just about everything it is tendering for over here. The GST and the industrial relations package that it has put in place have rationalised the taxation system over there, restored incentive and got the number of trade union strikes down to almost record low levels, as I understand it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is somewhere between 10 and 11 months since the coalition launched the GST Fightback package. We are now within two years of having a GST Fightback package in this country up and running, as the first day it will be operating from will be 1 October 1994. I for one think that is a very exciting thing to contemplate. The effect that it has had on this country and on this Government since the launch has been quite dramatic. I have noticed in my electorate where I have gone around and explained it&mdash;we had a meeting of 600-odd in Dubbo last week&mdash;that people have embraced it very willingly indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But since the launch of the Fightback package, it has had a very dramatic effect on the Government. We have had three Treasurers since it was launched. All of them have fallen either directly or indirectly as a result of that package which has been brought down&mdash;and I am referring to the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) and the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins). We have also had one Prime Minister fall, whose fall perhaps was coming but it was certainly hastened because of the Fightback package as he could not answer the magnificent things contained in it. At the next election I think we will see another Prime Minister brought down as a result of it as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have noticed since the package was launched that in Question Time 80 per cent, by my calculations, of the questions from Government members to their own Ministers have seemed to precipitate a wailing and gnashing of the teeth against the GST. The Ministers seem absolutely obsessed with it. It is all they seem to talk about in Question Time. Given half a chance, or even no chance at all, they inevitably get on to the GST Fightback package and try to bag it and manufacture some excuse as to why it will not work. It gets a run in the media for a day and then dies away, never to be heard of again. </PARA>

No doubt as this debate continues later this afternoon and through the night we will have Government members talking not about their own policies but about the GST and saying what a dreadful thing it is.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that there is no more expedient and dishonest exponent of how the package will work than the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) himself. I sat there today listening to him in Question Time saying almost the opposite of what I think he actually believes in. One has only to turn back to some of his statements in 1985 when he was the greatest exponent of this type of taxation reform in this country. On 12 May 1985 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of tax reform is unambiguously to redistribute the burden of taxes, not to facilitate an increase in that burden.</PARA>
<PARA>On 4 June that year he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we don't as a nation adopt this proposal, then you won't see significant reform in this country in taxation for the balance of this century. </PARA>
<PARA>How true that is. We have seen the mess that the Government is in at the moment by trying to reform the wholesale sales tax system and the difficulties it is getting into. The more it tries to reform, the further the difficulties it finds itself in. At the National Press Club on 5 June that year he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is now well recognised that the Australian tax system is unfair. It is also widely appreciated that it encourages inefficiency and is extraordinarily complex. Clearly there is a need for action: for reform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . We must stop dealing with symptoms. The tax laws are in need of radical surgery. </PARA>
<PARA>Later in that speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . There are three main advantages of (consumption) tax:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, it will allow a more rational indirect tax system than the current anomaly-ridden wholesale tax, which has multiple rates, numerous exemptions, and fails to tax the services sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, it will enable us to generate tax revenues to provide for a major reduction in the marginal rates of income tax. No other tax has the same potential for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third, it generates tax from those who will continue to evade or avoid income tax. That provides a useful `net dividend' for distribution to the rest of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . The virtually zero exemption, single rate structure of the tax is a crucial design feature. It will assist both administration and compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . For business, this is a simple tax. They will also benefit from no longer carrying the cost of the wholesale tax which they pay and have to finance on their stocks.</PARA>
<PARA>Later in that speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . For too long the politically unpalatable decisions have been put off in this country because our politicians have not had the strength of purpose to tackle the hard issues.</PARA>
<PARA>There it is&mdash;an overwhelmingly strong endorsement of what the coalition is advocating today. I want to quote once more from the Prime Minister when he was Treasurer. On 7 June 1985 in Melbourne he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . All of us, especially those in positions of influence, have I believe, an important duty to ensure that the debate in the lead-up to the taxation summit remains on this higher plane.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . We must all recognise that it would be all too easy in this debate to inflame fears and prejudice. And we should realise that some people will be trying to do just this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . It would be all too easy to let the discussion collapse to the lowest common denominator. The emotive claim of the screaming headline will always be a strong temptation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the question is whether we have, as a nation, the maturity to pursue a dispassionate debate in order to achieve such overdue change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have no doubt that, unless this climate is acted upon, tax reform will be thrown back into the too hard basket for another 20 to 30 years at immense cost to the vast majority of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>If that were John Hewson speaking, one could understand it, but that is the present Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland, speaking back in 1985. I can tell honourable members now that he has not changed his mind. He still believes that this is the best way to go, but he has to be expedient about it and tell us the opposite to what he actually believes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very sad situation that we are in. The Prime Minister is not only saying things like this, but also he is changing his mind on policy matters. There was no greater advocate of lowering tariffs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is he doing today when he finds himself in a desperate position? He is saying that we have to maintain tariffs at a higher level than the coalition is proposing. Those who have analysed the debate thoroughly since the Prime Minister did a back flip in this area can see that the car industry now has some future under a coalition government. It will be able to sell its cars cheaper, which will mean that it will sell more cars; it will have more efficient work practices, which will make it internationally competitive; and it will be able to export cars on a proper footing, which we are not able to do now, except by using various devices. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In debating this section of the Budget, I want to deal with matters that relate to the retirement incomes policy. It comes very much to mind in this section of the Budget, as the Australian Taxation Office is being given responsibility by the present Government to collect the superannuation tax levy. In one form or another, the retirement incomes policy has, since Federation, been a perennial issue on the agenda of this Parliament. Over the years, there have been debates about many topics related to it: for example, the desirability of a universal pension scheme as opposed to a selective or means tested provision; the desirability of flat rate pensions as opposed to earnings related ones; the desirability of simple as opposed to complicated eligibility tests; the desirability of funded schemes as opposed to unfunded ones; the desirability of schemes which encourage personal responsibility as opposed to those which expand public sector dependency; and the desirability of allowing Australians personal control over their savings and choice as to how they are best invested as opposed to the conscription into the hands of fund managers over which they have little, if any, control.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a long time I have been an advocate of a universal approach to a retirement incomes policy. All Australians must be assured of a reasonable standard of living in retirement. The role of government should be to help and encourage all who are able to take responsibility for providing their own retirement incomes. But those who do should not be penalised for doing so. The self-reliant should not be burdened by taxes imposed to fund the retirement incomes of those who could afford to be self-reliant but choose, for whatever reason, not to do so. Those who fulfil their responsibility to provide their own retirement incomes should be fully compensated for relieving the Government of expenditure it would otherwise incur. One approach would be to pay the age pension to everyone. Another is to make payment of such a pension an alternative to a preretirement tax incentive for private provision for retirement, with the value of tax incentives being equal to the capital value of the age pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the age pension was first introduced, eligibility has nearly always been the subject of a means test of one kind or another: a double means test, a combined means test, a tapered means test, an income means test or an income and assets means test. All these methods of so-called targeting have had serious adverse side effects. They have distorted normal work patterns; they have distorted normal consumption patterns; they have distorted normal savings patterns; and they have distorted normal investment patterns. People do behave in a rational way. They adjust to optimise their situation. If, at some time in the past, the universal approach had been adopted and a flat rate pension paid to every residentially qualified Australian citizen, government expenditure on age pensions could well have been substantially less than it is today. If this course had been followed long before now, we would surely have questioned the appropriateness of continuing with earnings related tax concessions to those providing themselves with retirement incomes above the universal flat rate pension. If we had wanted to encourage saving in this way, the right to a flat rate pension could have been made convertible into tax relief in recognition of long term saving for retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Labor came to office in 1983, four out of five of those of pensionable age were in receipt of a part or full pension. The direct cost of abolition of the age pension income test could have been less than the indirect cost to the economy of its retention. Labor's action to limit those costs still further has given us a retirement incomes scheme which is a mishmash of complex and confusing arrangements&mdash;confusing to pensioners and self-funded retirees. Pensioners have more difficulty than ever before understanding the assets and incomes tests. Many of those with super entitlements are forced to seek advice from experts, who themselves have difficulty coping with the legislative nightmare put in place by the present Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Age pensions are paid at a flat rate; they are not earnings related. On the other hand, the reasonable benefit limits imposed as a pre-condition to the favourable tax treatment of superannuation savings are earnings related. Under the system of RBLs, the greatest benefit flows to those with the highest income. It is amazing that a government which seeks to justify so many of its actions on social justice grounds should continue to offer huge tax breaks to those with very high incomes. Labor gives to those earning $90,000 a year superannuation tax concessions worth about $57,000; but to those earning $30,000 a year, tax concessions worth only $8,700. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor's retirement incomes policy is based on the assumption that people cannot be trusted to manage their own affairs or discharge their responsibilities to provide for their retirement. Its latest act of State paternalism has been to legislate to garnishee a portion of every worker's wages. This money taken from their pay packets is syphoned to a small group of powerful fund managers with an unreliable promise that contributors will be better off than if they had managed their own savings. This anointed oligopoly of fund managers holds these conscripted savings until contributors reach retirement. Until then, contributors are denied the opportunity of using their long term savings in a manner which enables them to determine how those savings might best be invested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party offers an alternative in its Fightback policy. In developing our retirement incomes policy, we have abandoned the selectivity approach and adopted universality as the basis of our approach to the solution of a problem not solved by means tests. The main features of our policy are the retention of the compulsory employer contributions at about 3 to 4 per cent; capping of lump sum entitlements; access to superannuation for casual and part time employees and people outside the paid work force; abolition of lump sum tax; protection of lump sum entitlements accrued up to 1984; introduction of a tax refund of up to $1,500 for singles and $3,000 for couples on superannuation contributions of up to $6,000 and $12,000 per annum respectively; the right to carry forward unused tax refund contribution entitlements; the availability of retirement savings accounts and other low cost alternatives with the same tax concessions as superannuation funds; and access to accrued superannuation benefits for the purposes of first home purchases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the remaining moments that I have available to me, I want to stress what we say about retirement income savings accounts and other low cost alternatives. I believe that every Australian should have the right to directly control his or her own retirement savings. What is the public policy concern in the way in which I invest my retirement savings? The concern, surely, should be limited to my commitment that I will not expect other taxpayers to pay taxes to pay me a social security pension. If, therefore, I am willing to pay for a financial institution to give me a performance bond that I will honour that commitment, I should have the right, subject to whatever security I have to give to that financial institution, to invest those retirement savings as I please&mdash;on my home, on a share portfolio, on real estate, or in whatever way I like, provided I give that performance bond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, it becomes very important that we look to the opportunity to fund our retirement income scheme. In Fightback we propose that government superannuation schemes should be funded. I hope, in addition, that it will not be too long before we start funding the Government's social security commitment to those who could have provided for their own retirement but did not do so. I put in a different category the funds that are paid to those who could not achieve that objective out of their own savings. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

There are lots of civil actions, but very few convictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This scoreboard looks like the St George score line against the Brisbane Broncos in the Rugby League grand final&mdash;lots of activity but very few charges heard in the court; in fact, only in relation to two cases of the Big 16. One is Estate Mortgage, where charges of false advertising led to convictions, and the other is in relation to Rothwells. It says here that Alan Bond was gaoled, but of course he was granted a retrial. It also mentions Aleco Vrisakis, David Hurley and Nicholas Lee. Of course, Aleco Vrisakis was the Government appointed adviser on the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee to advise on the law. The Australian Securities Commission claims the Government's first legal adviser as one of its successful prosecutions out of Rothwells Ltd. I pass over without saying any more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the reason why there was lots of activity down on the back line but very few convictions has now become public for everybody to see; it is that a serious argument has developed between the Australian Securities Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions. It is an argument about who bears responsibility for bringing these convictions to trial, and each has its own case. I do not know who is right. I do not know whether Tony Hartnell is right and it is all Michael Rozenes's fault. I do not know whether Michael Rozenes is right and it is all Tony Hartnell's fault. Michael Rozenes said in evidence to a parliamentary committee that the fighting between them `must give them some heart, though'&mdash;it must give corporate criminals some heart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that we can, as a parliament, say who is right and who is wrong, but the one thing I know is who is responsible for both of them; it is the Attorney-General. I know that he is responsible for both of them and I know that for 12 months he did nothing. Twelve months ago I had put out a release and called on him to intervene; I said that bureaucratic wars were impeding law enforcement against corporate crime. He did nothing. He had to be dragged kicking and screaming into this issue after 12 months. He finally said, `I am going to fix the problem'. He stood up here in the Parliament in a very theatrical performance and said, `I am going to fix the problem. I've called them to Canberra'. He called them to Canberra. One can guess what happened, they refused to agree. He called them to this big meeting where&mdash;as his spokesman promised in the press&mdash;he was going to bang heads. The only head that got banged in this meeting was his. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have never seen such a deathly press conference. When the Attorney-General went outside after his great theatrical performance he said, `I am going to bang heads, and it is all going to be agreed'. They came to Canberra, but they took no notice of him, which was very predictable. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper in March of this year, Tony Hartnell, when asked about a report on the Bond Corporation, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Duffy had no need for the reports, and sat on them anyway . . . What benefit will it [reporting to Mr Duffy] have other than helping <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> and the ABC . . . ?</PARA>
<PARA>That was the Attorney-General's own Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission on 10 March of this year. He knew that in the Attorney-General's Department there was no interest in these things. He knew there was a problem. Michael Rozenes knew there was a problem. The only person who would not admit a problem and do anything about it was the Attorney-General himself. He puts out statements&mdash;in the paper that has been tabled in the Parliament&mdash;and says, `Look, it is much better than you think. We had 668 cases, so many criminal cases and so many civil cases'. We always had those cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the corporate affairs commissions were operating separately, they were always bringing multiple cases. We did not set up an Australian Securities Commission because we were worried about minor convictions at the bottom end. The Australian Securities Commission was set up because there was a worry, at the top end of town, with the big cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One only has to read his speeches&mdash;every one of his speeches&mdash;when he comes into this Parliament and says, `Australia's reputation has been hurt and I am going to clean it up'. He is talking about the same thing as Tony Hartnell was talking about&mdash;that is, the Big 16. They have been identified. There is a scoreboard published. It shows that progress has not been made, as we would have hoped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now know that bureaucratic wars between two agencies for which he was responsible have held that back. We know he did nothing for 12 months. We know that when he finally intervened he was unable to get an agreement and has now given directions to the men to agree and, when they cannot agree, effectively, to have their arguments arbitrated by the Secretary to the Department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point that I would like to make is that for a very long time now there has been the one person holding the chairmanship of the Prices Surveillance Authority and the Trade Practices Commission. The one person was given the job for one reason: the two agencies were going to be amalgamated. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Today, he announced his resignation. After 12 months&mdash;again, of inactivity and bureaucratic war; Treasury would not let go of the PSA, the Attorney-General's Department would not let go of the TPC&mdash;the Attorney-General's grand plan, which was the reason why he appointed Professor Fels to the Trade Practices Commission, failed. For a year, no progress was made to resolve the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, the Chairman of the TPC, Professor Fels, resolved the situation himself and resigned from the PSA. This is yet another example of ministerial inactivity, a failure to administer the agencies for which he is responsible properly, a failure in administration, and is a matter of great concern in relation to what should be a great department. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having just heard the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), speak on some of these issues, I would have replied with one answer&mdash;that is, that the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) adequately dealt with the first point he made in this chamber some two weeks ago. In respect of the second complaint that the honourable member has made, I would have thought that Professor Fels was quite able to speak for himself on that issue and that there is no substance to the honourable member's objection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, one of the chief responsibilities of the Attorney-General is to ensure that there are adequate resources provided to the Commonwealth law enforcement agencies for the maintenance of law and order and to combat crime. The increasing incidence of crime is now a major cause for concern to many Australians. The prevalence of home burglary, break and enter of stores, robbery with violence, physical assault, particularly against women, is now the topic of ordinary conversation amongst citizens, rather than being confined to the offices of law enforcement agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst these are matters primarily dealt with by State police forces, the Commonwealth has an increasing role in the national fight against crime, and in particular against organised crime. In that respect, the role of the National Crime Authority in counteracting organised criminal activity in Australia is crucial. The National Crime Authority is unique among law enforcement agencies in that its investigations are not limited by jurisdictional and territorial boundaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November 1990, the Authority adopted a new policy in strategic direction. The Authority has now placed increased emphasis on acting as a partner to other law enforcement agencies. It is continuing to develop the multi-disciplinary, multi-task force operational approach which has proven so successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the past criticisms of the Authority was its alleged failure to disseminate relevant criminal information and intelligence. The Authority now gives high priority to the dissemination of criminal information and intelligence. As a result, there is now a fairly good working relationship between the National Crime Authority and other law enforcement agencies throughout Australia. The National Crime Authority has developed a corporate plan for 1992 to 1995. This plan sets out strategies for which the Authority will achieve its objectives and also contains performance measures by which the effectiveness and efficiency of the Authority can be determined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past year, the National Crime Authority has continued to conduct and coordinate a number of major investigations into organised crime, but the primary focus on the investigations has been drug related and so-called white-collar crime. As a result of these investigations, some 42 persons were eventually charged, by either the National Crime Authority or other agencies, with 1,343 offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program performance statement for 1992-93 of the Attorney-General's portfolio&mdash;that is, in Budget Related Paper No. 9.3&mdash;notes that, in addition to these charges, over $30m in taxation and licence fee assessments were issued in 1991-92 by the Australian Taxation Office and State revenue agencies. This is a very creditable performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increasing prevalence of so-called drug related and white-collar crime places enormous pressure on the resources allocated to the Authority. This year's Budget outlays on the National Crime Authority amount to nearly $35.5m. Officers of the Authority are now located in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. This financial year, the Authority will be opening an office in Brisbane. The establishment of these regional offices will enhance the National Crime Authority's capacity to investigate organised criminal activity and assist the Authority to strengthen its attack on the monetary proceeds of organised criminal activity. The Government will ensure that the legislation enabling the National Crime Authority to facilitate the seizure of the proceeds of organised crime will be kept under review to block even sophisticated attempts by criminals to salt away their ill-gotten gains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The annual cost of crime through white-collar crime and money laundering is immense&mdash;$1.7 billion a year in insurance fraud; between $300m and $700m a year in computer fraud; $2 billion in business fraud; and between $2.3 billion and $9 billion a year by fraud committed against the Commonwealth Government through the tax, social security, Customs and Medicare systems. It is the whole community that suffers from the impact of large scale fraud, irrespective of whether it is by tax cheating, fraud on shareholders, or fraud against banking, government and insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is just over eight years since the National Crime Authority was established. In that time, it has grown into a competent, professional national law enforcement agency. As I have said previously in this House, it is now the most important agency in the national effort to combat organised crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to the staff of the National Crime Authority. Under the inspired leadership of its previous Chairman, Mr Justice Phillips, and his equally inspired successor, Mr Tom Sherman, the National Crime Authority is now well placed to serve the people of Australia in the fight against organised crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the issue of social justice. The Attorney-General's portfolio has responsibility for a number of social justice programs, including the issue of racial vilification. It is claimed in Budget Related Paper No. 9.3 that `the issue of racial vilification will be considered by the Government with a view to enacting legislation to proscribe it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also claimed in that document that reports of both the national inquiry into racial violence and the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody contained recommendations to ban racial vilification. Whilst one can have certain sympathy for the motives of these proposals, I wish to make some observations about them. Last week in two decisions, the political ads case and the Nationwide News case, the High Court asserted for itself the role of guardian of one of the fundamental concepts of the Australian political system, the concept of representative government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the Australian Parliament have been elected by our constituents to fulfil our role in Australia, that is, to function as a representative democracy. But the High Court has asserted the meaning and foundation of representative democracy&mdash;the right of political expression. The striking down of legislation attempting to regulate political advertising in the electronic media should send shock waves through this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this issue is not over yet; it is only just beginning. The High Court has held that legislation must be subject to a balancing test. It has laid down important criteria for determining whether legislation is compatible with this constitutional right to freedom of political expression. It seems to me that racial vilification legislation must satisfy the five most important tests laid down by the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is the extent to which freedom of political discourse is restricted and the effect that this may have upon representative government. For example, in the current political climate espousing the catchcry of the level playing field, it is difficult to understand why legislative protection will be available to some and not to other vulnerable groups in society, for example, women and disabled people, and not on the issue of violent films and pornography. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second test is the importance of the competing interest in an ordered democratic society. It seems to me that the strength of a democracy is the acceptance of diversity of opinions. People exercising their free speech must win support for their cause in an open way and on its merits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third test is whether the restriction on freedom of political discourse is proportionate to the interest served. In this regard no doubt the High Court would query whether the legislation was disproportionate because the normal means of protecting reputation is through the common law in the civil courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth test is whether the restriction does not go further than what is reasonably necessary to protect the competing interest. That test speaks for itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final test is whether there are other methods of protecting the competing interest which do not restrict freedom of political discourse. In this case of course that test can be satisfied through education and in many other ways. For example, there are adequate provisions in the existing criminal law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 51 of the Australian Constitution, which enumerates the main legislative powers of the Parliament, contains an overriding proviso that Parliament has the power to make laws `for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth'. It seems to me from my reading of some notes on these two particular cases that that section is going to come under active consideration by the High Court when applying the tests that I have just mentioned and determining whether or not legislation passed by this House can stand. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note under the section of the Attorney-General's Department there is a reference to trade practices and consumer affairs. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has also decided to establish a Consumer Protection Advancement Program to improve the protection of consumers' interests, including in the use of financial services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Literally just minutes ago my office was advised by Mr John Wood, the director of the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs, that this consumer protection advancement program, at a cost of $500,000, has three components. The first component is money for staff to undertake work on consumer and financial services, that is, policy formulation and recognition that the financial services area is a major item on the consumer agenda. I do not disagree with that, but I will come back to that in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second component of this program, at a cost of $500,000, is to expand the product safety compliance section. It is proposed that one person will be positioned in Brisbane and that that person will go out and inspect goods on the market to ensure that they meet safety standards. As I have said, I have only just received notice of exactly what is envisaged in this consumer protection advancement program, but I must say that I wonder why there is one person and why the capital city of Brisbane has been chosen over other cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third component of this program is that the program will be administered by the Office of Legal Aid to provide extra money for financial counselling. As I have just received notice of this and as there is little time available for me to speak, I am loath to go into any analysis of the three sections of this program. Albeit that the consumer protection advancement program is looking at financial services, it seems to me that the best form of consumer protection is for consumers actually to have a job. The Budget Statement, and this section of the Budget Statement, has missed the opportunity to put into place programs that would really protect the Australian consumers by putting into place job creation programs. This Budget has in fact missed the opportunity to remove all of those impediments that are preventing Australian consumers from having a job. That is a tragedy on a national scale because the opportunities were there. The Government had those opportunities and it has deliberately chosen to let them simply slip through its fingers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I say `provide a plan for the future, provide some job opportunities', the sorts of opportunities that I am talking about that would really protect consumers are those to reduce those very high oncosts that business is facing today. Not one member in this chamber could drive throughout his or her electorate and not see the physical evidence of the missed opportunities of this Government, which has refused to grasp these opportunities of reducing these high business costs. That physical evidence is in the number of empty shops in small towns and urban shopping centres. It is in the number of people who are joining the long and ever increasing queues of the unemployed. It is in the number of families who have lost their homes because they cannot meet mortgage payments. It is in the number of families who have disintegrated under those financial pressures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, when this Government talks about instituting a consumer protection advancement program and about looking at protecting consumers in regard to financial services, I say, `Why hasn't this Government actually tackled the problems at first hand&mdash;the problems that people are struggling with to meet their financial commitments simply because they do not have a job?' Those high oncosts for business that I am talking about are those high amounts of sales tax, fuel tax, payroll tax, the training guarantee levy and now, of course, the superannuation guarantee levy. All of those costs feed into the costs of business and make businesses no longer viable. They have deliberately caused so many thousands of businesses go to go the wall and therefore have caused the loss of the jobs of hundreds of thousands of consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has missed that opportunity to abolish those taxes, to lower the production and distribution costs of all businesses. In doing so, it has neglected its prime responsibility to look after the Australian consumers by, firstly, ensuring that they have a job. It also has neglected its responsibility to look after the rights of Australian consumers because, by maintaining those very high oncosts in business, it is ensuring that Australian consumers pay far more for their goods and services than they really have to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is also denying the Australian consumer competitive prices. It is denying the Australian consumer a wide choice of goods because, as more businesses go to the wall, more people lose their jobs in businesses. That means a reduction in the amount of goods produced in this country and a limit to the choice that Australian consumers actually have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give just one brief example of the practical nature of the way that these very high costs feed into the costs of all businesses. I cannot think of a business or an industry that does not depend on our transport industry. Just one of those large six-axle articulated vehicles, commonly known as large semitrailers, has a retail price of $250,000. Included in that price is $38,000 worth of sales tax. The vast majority of owner-drivers and transport companies do not buy those vehicles outright; they lease them. By removing the sales tax alone, those owner-drivers would save $945 per month on their lease payments. If one adds onto that sales tax $1,675 for just one set of tyres, one gets a bill of in excess of $2,000&mdash;just for the sales tax and the spare parts that those companies must use to maintain their vehicles on the road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reliably informed that the average rate of travel for one of those vehicles is 195,000 kilometres per year. The fuel bill for that sort of distance is $57,500. If one removes the fuel tax, one removes almost $25,000. When all those costs are added up, the total is in excess of $40,000 per vehicle per year. If one starts to pull that sort of cost out of business, because the cost of that transport is factored into the cost of all goods and services, one starts to lower the costs of production and distribution, and that is of direct benefit to the Australian consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian consumer is being denied that opportunity in these Budget Papers. It is all very well to have political rhetoric and to talk about a consumer protection advancement program, but surely this Government owes it to Australian consumers to go right to the heart of the matter and remove all those oncosts, thereby ensuring that Australian consumers maintain their jobs and get a range of goods at competitive prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many innovations in Australian industry, but it is those high costs which prevent many inventions being developed in this country. Once again, the Australian consumer is denied the choice of those new products. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

One cannot help feeling that he is still suffering from the knockout blow that the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) delivered to him some weeks back in Question Time when one would have thought that it was a dorothy dix question being asked by the honourable member for Higgins. It was quite amusing to watch the honourable member for Higgins squirm as the Attorney-General took him apart limb by limb, but it was more interesting to see his own shadow Ministry, his own backbench, delighting in the Attorney-General tearing him apart limb by limb.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I intend to further put on the record some material in relation to the Australian Securities Commission, but before I do so I think it is important to point out the major deficiency relating to the Attorney-General's Department and the provision of legal services to ordinary men and women in Australia that will arise from the introduction of a goods and services tax. We heard nothing about that from the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Higgins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a goods and services tax will do for the delivery of legal services in Australia is add 15 per cent to the bill of every person seeking legal advice and assistance. Anyone who has a will made or is involved in a conveyancing transaction will be charged 15 per cent on top of the fees presently charged for advice and assistance. Senator Cooney's committee in the Senate is currently preparing a report for tabling in the Parliament in relation to the high costs of justice in  Australia. A consumption tax will add another 15 per cent to the cost of services. What we have is a proposal by the Opposition to tax people from the cradle to the grave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Higgins made great play about the Australian Securities Commission and what it has done with its resources. It is important to again put on the record what progress the Australian Securities Commission has made in bringing to book the corporate wrongdoers of the 1980s. Of its budget of approximately $132m for 1992-93, the Australian Securities Commission estimates that it is devoting about $50m to investigation and associated legal and litigation activity, with external litigation costs in particular expected to amount to about $13m. The focus of its information program also strongly supports those activities. Additionally, some $5m in funding is being provided for corporate prosecutions to the DPP. This expenditure on corporate investigations and prosecutions far exceeds that provided for investigations and prosecutions under the cooperative scheme. Those increased resources are already starting to bear fruit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of public record that there was a dearth of prosecution activity under the old arrangements. I am pleased to say that the Australian Securities Commission, it appears, has vigorously applied itself to its law enforcement functions. One has only to go to the answer that the Attorney-General gave to this chamber some weeks back. I will restate it. The Australian Securities Commission initiated 668 new civil and criminal cases in 1991-92. These included some 80 significant criminal cases. As at 30 June 1992, there were 116 serious criminal trials under way. Trials during 1991-92 resulted in 36 significant convictions, 314 minor convictions, 12 acquittals of a significant nature and one acquittal of a minor nature. There were 89 discontinued  trials.  As  at  30  June  1992, a  total  of  77  civil matters were  under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point needs to be made to honourable members and the Australian community that corporate investigations and prosecutions are costly, because one needs to get behind a very complex framework. They are not like break, enter and steal, murder, rape, robbery and other cases along those lines. Corporate prosecutions involve bringing in accountants and getting behind a complex structure. They can involve months and months of court time in terms of preliminary hearings and eventually bringing people to trial. Their only equivalents in the criminal court system at the moment are the long drug trials, the conspiracies to import. It is a costly and complex exercise. It also takes time to bring to account those involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Securities Commission only commenced administration of the new Corporations Law on 2 January 1991. There is no doubt that there has been a learning process and I think people need to bear that in mind. I want to detail a number of the charges which have been laid against persons associated with prominent corporations in the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They include: Garry Carter, who was committed for trial under section 173 of the Crimes Act and section 229 of the Companies Code in relation to Entity; Brian Yuill, who was committed for trial under section 229 of the Companies Code, to do with Spedley; Christopher Skase, who was charged under section 229 of the Companies Code in relation to Qintex; Robin Greenburg, who pleaded guilty to charges under the Criminal Code and subsections 229 and 232 of the Companies Code; Kevin Parry of Estate Mortgage, who was charged under subsections 229 and 230 of the Companies Code; Abraham Goldberg and Katy Boskovitz, who were charged under subsections 229 and 556 of the Companies Code to do with the Linter Group; Reuben and Richard Lew, who were charged under the Crimes Act and section 229 of the Companies Code; Laurie Connell, who was charged under the Criminal Code, the Companies Code, the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Code, the Securities Industry Code and the Companies and Securities (Interpretation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Code in relation to Rothwells; Alan Bond, of course, who was acquitted on appeal; John Avram and Stanley Schneider, who were charged under sections 229 and 129 of the Companies Code to do with Interwest; Dallas Dempster, who was charged under section 129 of the Companies Code in relation to Rothwells; and Michael Fuller and Joseph Cummings, who were charged under section 229 of the Companies Code to do with the IRL Group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the Australian Securities Commission has made strong progress on the 16 investigations designated as national priorities by the Chairman of the Commission. Criminal charges to date have been laid in relation to eight of those investigations and civil proceedings have been undertaken in relation to six matters. I understand investigations are continuing in the balance of these matters and briefs have either been delivered to the DPP or will soon be completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a nonsense for the shadow Attorney-General to come into this chamber and attempt to score cheap political points. We are talking about complex investigations and complex trials which take time. It is no accident that the Government has allocated huge resources to the Australian Securities Commission and to the prosecution authorities in order to bring to book the corporate criminals of the 1980s. There is no doubt that many of the corporate criminals and practices of the 1980s will go undetected because of the nature of corporate crime. In many cases it is conducted behind closed doors and unless someone within the organisation comes forward to reveal a scheme it can take many years to detect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate that the shadow Attorney-General is trying to make a name for himself, but I think all he is doing is making a fool of himself in the way he is conducting himself in relation to these matters. He could do a lot better by acknowledging that a lot of work has been done. There is no doubt that there is a lot more work to be done in a partnership arrangement between the Australian Securities Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions. I think the Attorney-General ought to be commended on the way he has handled that dispute. It will bear results in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my remarks to the Budget allocation within the Attorney-General's portfolio pertaining to the provision of legal aid and family services, in particular the grants made to family service organisations. On 24 July this year the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) announced that the Government would increase support for community-based family service projects nationally in 1992-93 to about $19m. This announcement is reflected in the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I state at the outset of what can be only reasonably brief remarks that I support the increase. Indeed, I have argued consistently that the allocation ought to be greater&mdash;a position supported in recent research funded by the Attorney-General's Department. The release of findings of a national study about marriage education highlights the inadequacy of Federal funding for these programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This study, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Love, Sex and Waterskiing: the experience of pre-marriage in Australia</EMPHASIS>, involved surveys of 1,698 persons marrying for the first time who attended pre-marriage education programs throughout Australia between January and March this year. Key findings included the fact that 5 per cent of couples either cancelled or postponed their weddings after attending a pre-marriage education program. As one person said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We were made aware that we didn't know each other as well as we thought. [We] discussed issues previously overlooked. Discovered differences we couldn't resolve and which probably would have become major points of conflict in our marriage. I believe now we hadn't thought enough about marriage and everything involved. We would not have lasted. We are very grateful for this program.</PARA>
<PARA>After attending a program, 91 per cent of couples reported that they would seek professional help if problems arose in their marriage and 83 per cent of couples reported learning new skills as a result of attending a program. One-third of couples said that their program raised new issues for them. Forty-two per cent of couples said that their ideas about marriage had changed a great deal and nearly 80 per cent of couples who participated in the survey rated their program as good or excellent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These findings highlight the usefulness of the programs and the inadequacy of the funding. Even with the increase in funding for marriage education to $1.18m this year&mdash;which I acknowledge is a substantial increase on what was provided before&mdash;the Federal Government spends, on average, less than $10 per marriage on programs of preparation and education. Yet the cost of marriage breakdown is estimated at some $3,000m annually to the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the paucity of this allocation, what also concerns me and those involved in providing the services is the apparent absence of a clear Government policy about the allocation of funds. In September, the President of the Australian Association for Marriage Education, Jim Pilmer, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the good news of increased funding, a concern of AAME is that there appears to be no discernible Government or departmental policy on how these funds are allocated.</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In several instances grants for new programs were made when existing programs needing infrastructure and support in the same city were left languishing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This process of `sprinkling' money around rather than allocating it according to clearly understood developmental criteria has been a cause of concern for some years now. That concern remains.</PARA>
<PARA>Since then, similar complaints have been raised with me about the allocation of marriage counselling funds. I was pleased, therefore, to hear the Minister for Justice strongly refute claims that grants for family services were made on a party political or electorate basis when launching the national research into marriage education in Adelaide and indicate that all grants were allocated according to a clear policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would appear, however, that the policy remains unknown to everyone but the Minister and his Department. Less than two days after the Minister's remarks, the retiring President of the Australian Association for Marriage Education, Jim Pilmer, said in his report to the Association's annual general meeting:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to record again this year our bewilderment with the funding process or more accurately with the outcomes of the process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Generally speaking we are unable to discern a departmental policy regarding the assessment of submissions and the approval of grants for marriage education funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not the place to go into detail, but not to fund existing agencies with programs up and running and then to fund agencies in the same cities and towns to start new programs seems to penalise those who have developed a service and reward those who haven't.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The approval of grants to secular bodies is to be applauded. The main issue is on what basis the grants were allocated.</PARA>
<PARA>I am delighted, therefore, that there is a policy, as the Minister for Justice announced in Adelaide. I simply ask: will the Minister provide me with a copy of it? For more than a year my friend the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) and I have been asking the Minister to provide details of the number of persons with whom each agency that is funded by his Department has dealt with in that year. I have asked questions on notice, I have raised the issue in this place and I have asked departmental officers directly. The matter has even been raised in Senate Estimates committees. In each case the answer has suggested that the information is provided in a variety of ways by the agencies but that somehow it is statistically flawed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I am asking for are the figures actually supplied by each agency; that is, when an agency is providing marriage counselling, education, parent-adolescent or family mediation or a family skills training program, and it applies for a grant or a continuation of funding or makes its regular return to the Department which it is contractually bound to do, I ask for the actual figures as they are recorded by each agency in relation to each program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the Attorney and the Department have conceded that these figures are available. In fact, I would be surprised if a competent junior clerk would take more than half an hour to collate them. So I ask again: will the Attorney provide me with the figures for each program&mdash;that is, for marriage education, for marriage counselling, for family mediation, for parent-adolescent mediation and for family skills training programs for each agency which is funded pursuant to this Budget allocation by the Parliament for the year 1991-1992, and it is conceded that those figures are available, and I also ask the Attorney, whilst he is doing this, for the figures which are projected for 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note, for example, that the Department has collated the figures itself in Budget Related Paper No. 9.3. At page 172 the following is recorded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">an estimated 980 persons were assisted through the family skills training program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">during the 1991-92 financial year approximately 32,000 couples received marriage counselling.</PARA>
<PARA>Last year the Attorney was able to inform me that 9,434 couples attended marriage education programs, but somehow he could not indicate how he arrived at this figure agency by agency. I submit that the only way of arriving at these total figures which have been recorded, and which have been conceded, is by taking the figures supplied agency by agency and by simply adding them up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not my intention to make these matters the subject of party political debate. As I said at the outset, I applaud the increased funding but I do believe that minimum parliamentary accountability and review require that the Attorney provide both the policy which the service agencies seem unaware of and the basic numbers of persons to whom services are provided as a consequence of this allocation in the Budget of Commonwealth funding. I therefore ask the Parliamentary Secretary at the table, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), to take these questions on notice on behalf of the Attorney-General and to provide the detailed answers in due course. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy in this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) to follow the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), who has focused upon the very area that I have been pleased in many ways to focus upon following the Budget each year since I have been elected. I applaud the thread of his contribution and the points that he made during his delivery in the committee debate on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to focus my comments on the Attorney-General Department's programs, which appear on page 3.106 of Budget Paper No. 1 and which are referred to as `Grants to approved marriage counselling and marriage education organisations'. Each year we get the opportunity to speak in these debates on issues related to various parts of the Budget, and I think this matter is being brought very much to the fore at the moment by the comments of the honourable member for Menzies and, I hope, by what I have to add here tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over many years I have argued for increased budgetary allocations for family counselling organisations, for marriage education organisations and for family reconciliation centres in order that the tragedy of marriage breakdown might be minimised. It is a huge problem and indeed a great tragedy that confronts this nation and, indeed, many others. Over these same years I have been encouraged to see a significant boost to these types of programs, and this year is no exception. I was delighted to find in this year's Budget that allocations in this area have increased to $19.76m which, as the Budget document says, represents a 100 per cent increase since the 1989-90 Budget. I do commend the Government for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent statistics show that the divorce rate for married couples rose from 10.6 per cent in 1986 to 11.6 per cent last year. The retiring President of the Australian Association for Marriage Education, the Reverend Jim Pilmer, states that this level of family breakdown has been estimated to cost the nation $2.5 billion each year, although I estimate that it is probably closer to $3 billion&mdash;and when one takes all the other related areas of influence into account it runs into many more billions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Marriage breakdown in the community should be a major concern to us all, and I believe that underpinning the family unit should be made a priority by any government. I do not think I would find anybody on either side arguing about that very principle. I have, therefore, been greatly encouraged in recent times by the growing interest of honourable members in the whole area of family policy and, in particular, I would like to pay tribute to the marvellous work being done by the honourable member for Menzies. I believe his efforts in this area of policy will have far-reaching effects on the well-being of many Australian families, and I thank him for his interest in and commitment to this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the important facts that has come out of his recent work is that even with this increase in Federal funding the Government provides less than $10 for marriage education per person, yet the cost is over $12,000 for each separation. I was therefore delighted to read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 22 September that a recent study entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Love, Sex and Water-skiing</EMPHASIS> has confirmed what I and others have been saying for many years, and that is that much more emphasis should be placed on pre-marriage education&mdash;that is, learning about the problems and how to overcome them before the marriage takes place, and preferably well before. The study found that premarital education and a continuing commitment to education and counselling could save couples from breakdown and all the difficulties, problems and sadness associated with divorce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that 5 per cent of couples who undertook this education program either postponed or cancelled their weddings, yet only 12 per cent of Australian couples now do the courses. I think that is probably a slightly exaggerated figure. The problem is how to convince more young couples to undertake such courses, and at the appropriate times. Of those attending the program, 91 per cent of couples reported that they would seek professional help if problems arose in their marriages, and 83 per cent reported learning new skills. One-third of the couples said the program raised issues they had never thought about before such as expectations of the physical relationship, the role of religion in the relationship, the relevance of alcohol, the control of finances, and even annoying habits which are not talked about prior to getting married and which, added together, cause major problems later on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nearly half the couples said that their idea of marriage had changed as a result. The 1,698 engaged couples who undertook the premarital counselling for the study reported that getting married without first coming to terms with the pitfalls could be very dangerous. However, when young couples who are starry-eyed and longing for nuptial bliss come to face up to the prospect of marriage education it becomes a task in itself to get them to acknowledge that they might be about to walk through a minefield. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no reason why we cannot bring about attitudinal changes with effective education programs. Who would have thought 20 years ago that we would be as concerned for our environment as we are today? Who would have thought 20 years ago that drinking and driving would be the unacceptable social practices that they are today? These two examples amply demonstrate that attitudes can and do change. There is, therefore, no reason why we cannot see that 12 per cent participation rate in premarital education become 75 per cent or higher 10 or 20 years down the track. I hope it does not take that long. But we must start somewhere, and there is no better time to start than right now. We have to have rocks in our heads to even begin to think otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Personally, the place I would like to start is in the high schools around the nation. Although premarital education does not have to be taught as such there, there is no reason why we could not design a course for senior high schoolers centred around interpersonal relationships and communication as a very first step in overcoming this dreadful problem that is confronting our community. I am sure that honourable members would agree that the most important health and psychologically promoting relationship that anyone could have is a marriage relationship. Therefore, if young people are taught the basics of interpersonal relationships and how to be an effective communicator before they leave school, the poor communication skills that can undermine these relationships can be corrected before the crucial union takes place. Ideally, a young person could start with such a course in high school, later undertake a premarital education course with his or her engaged partner, follow it up, say 12 months later with a short course for the newly weds, and then some years down the track undertake marriage enrichment courses&mdash;a perfect formula for dramatically reducing the divorce rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whenever we talk about marriage breakdown, one of the most startling facts is that 70 per cent of all breakdowns occur through benign neglect, not through malicious intent. Therefore, marriage needs to be constantly worked at and early help sought if problems do occur. It seems so simple. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although we all wish that divorce could be avoided, the fact is that some marriages do break down, painfully tearing apart a once intimate relationship. In this regard, I would like to pay tribute to those who are dedicated to helping such people. There are many fine agencies right around Australia, some funded, many not. One such program that has been designed to facilitate the healing process that needs to take place so that victims of divorce do not carry unwanted baggage into new relationships is a program called Fresh Start. It is a program that to date has received no funding, yet has proven to be invaluable in its work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although this divorce recovery program has been in Australia only since 1990, it has helped many individuals and children of divorced parents cope with the grief associated with marriage breakdown. Fresh Start program organisers have conducted 18 seminars around Australia, with three to be conducted in Melbourne in the ensuing months. In total, 450 divorcees and children have received counselling and, in Canberra alone, 50 people are continuing to meet in a support group on a weekly basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to close with an appeal to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and his colleague Senator Tate to look further at this whole area of family services and consider the benefits of pouring more money into bringing about that attitudinal change that needs to take place in order that more and more people in our community may experience a full and rich married life. The savings would far outweigh any costs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the set of appropriations for the Attorney-General's Department, may I mention briefly my adjournment speech of Tuesday, 18 August last, in which I detailed the fate of the Gillespie children&mdash;Iddin, aged 9, and Shah, aged 7&mdash;from the time they were last seen by their mother, Jacqueline Gillespie, at 5 p.m. on 9 July 1992 until Sunday, 26 July, when she was informed that her children were detained by their natural father, Raja Bahrin Shah, a prince of the Malaysian royal family in Kuala Terrengganu on the north-east coast of the Malaysian Peninsula. May I also remind the members in this place that the Gillespie children are Australian citizens and are being held in open defiance of Australian laws and Australian Family Court orders, and even their basic right of access to Australian consular officials has been refused. For two months now Iddin and Shah have been denied any contact with their mother, also an Australian citizen I might point out, who is now suffering as perhaps only mothers of seriously endangered children can.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an interview conducted by Margaret Fletcher on Radio 3AW, Melbourne, on Monday, 31 August, Jacqueline Gillespie expressed the emotional torment suffered by her and her husband, Iain, since the disappearance of their children: the emptiness of their home; the unchanged rooms due to a police request that it be so; even the family dog taking the children's toys as sleeping companions.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jacquie explained that she was born in Australia and lived here until she left the country as the bride of Raja Bahrin Shah. She described the change in her first husband's attitude to her when they lived together in Malaysia, when her self-respect was taken from her, and, finally, she recalled the day when she was bundled on a plane with Iddin and Shah bound for Australia. Raja Bahrin Shah did not apply for custody of the children and actually signed over their custody to Jacquie at that stage. I will seek permission to table documents in that respect at the conclusion of my remarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have, in a previous adjournment speech, covered the action of Coastwatch and the Australian Federal Police in failing to adequately deal with the children's abduction. This was followed up in the Senate by my colleague the shadow Minister for foreign affairs, Senator Robert Hill, and subsequently an inquiry was set in motion by Senator Tate. However, the terms of this inquiry have been criticised as being far too narrow by both Senator Hill and Mrs Jacquie Gillespie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, I wish to emphasise in the strongest possible terms the failure of the Australian Government to protect its own citizens, with particular reference to the role of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans. Despite the clear obligation of the Labor Government to uphold Australian laws, protect Australian citizens and uphold the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which it is a signatory, the Minister responsible, Senator Gareth Evans, continues to insist that this destruction of Iddin and Shah's rights is a private matter. Senator Evans insists that Mrs Gillespie submit herself and her children to Malaysian law, when even his personal request for a visa for Mrs Gillespie to visit Malaysia has been ignored by the Malaysian Government. This is also despite the fact that an Australian Family Court order, stating the children are allowed to phone home at least once a day, has been completely ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the Gillespies had been informed by Mr David Rutter of Foreign Affairs on Friday, 24 July, that their children were `in Indonesia travelling towards Malaysia', attempts were made by the Gillespies' legal firm, Price Brent, to retain Indonesian lawyers, but Foreign Affairs refused to provide additional information. Mr Rutter informed Mr David Abraham, the managing partner of Price Brent, that Senator Evans had met with the Indonesian Foreign Minister at the ASEAN conference in Manila and was also seeking to meet with the Malaysian Foreign Minister. No details of the discussions between Senator Evans and the Indonesian Foreign Minister were ever released. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the subject of government financial assistance. As honourable members may imagine, the enormously time consuming details of events since the kidnapping&mdash;and that is what it was&mdash;of Iddin and Shah have done much to deplete the Gillespies' financial resources. Moreover, the costs involved in travelling to Malaysia and pursuing a protracted legal battle there are unimaginable. So far Jacqueline and Iain Gillespie have received no financial assistance whatsoever from this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the events of 26 and 27 July. When Iddin and Shah Gillespie arrived in Malaysia with their father, Raja Bahrin Shah, he announced at that time that he had taken the children for religious reasons and that it was Allah's will. Statements supporting his case were made by the Malaysian Prime Minister, the Malaysian Law Minister, the Malaysian Trade Minister, Rafidah Aziz, and the Malaysian police. Yet Senator Gareth Evans continued to insist publicly that this was a private matter and not a matter for the Australian Government. More recently, repeated requests from the Australian consulate in Kuala Lumpur for access to Iddin and Shah to check on their welfare have been refused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Gillespie has still not been allowed to talk to her children on the telephone. She has not been able to tell them that she loves them or that someone in Australia cares about them. Honourable members should keep in mind the fact that the children spoke only English at the time of their departure. Surely, such a small request, which would mean so much to Jacqueline, Iddin and Shah Gillespie, should not be denied. It seems ironic, as Jacquie Gillespie commented on the 3AW radio interview, which I mentioned earlier in my remarks, that the Labor Government was prepared to give assistance to Barlow and Chambers, two Australians accused of drug trafficking in Malaysia, and yet nothing has been done to assist Iddin and Shah Gillespie, who have committed no crime whatsoever. They just happen to be the natural offspring of a Malaysian prince who relinquished his rights to them a long time ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I re-emphasise that Iddin and Shah Gillespie are Australian children from an Australian family. Their mother, Jacquie, is an Australian, born of an Australian mother and a Malaysian father. The children's stepfather, Iain, is of Scottish origin and has been in Australia for over 30 years. They have two stepbrothers: Tyson, aged 20, and Drew, aged 17; a stepsister, Skye, aged 14; and a foster sister, Felicity, aged 16. They are part of an Australian family which is now broken and broken-hearted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The children were kidnapped over two months ago, yet their mother cannot phone them, no consular officials have been allowed to visit them, and Jacquie feels that she is farther removed from her children now than she was two months ago. Jacquie wrote to Senator Evans on 16 September requesting a meeting `as a matter of urgency', but was refused. Honourable members should keep in mind the fact that, although over two months have elapsed since the kidnapping, Senator Evans and Mrs Gillespie have never met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Sunday, 30 August, Prime Minister Keating stated that he wished to develop Australia's international profile `as a caring nation'. Yet representations to him from friends of the Gillespies have also fallen on deaf ears. After representations to the Prime Minister by Mr E. D. McArthur of Hughesdale, Victoria, an official of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet merely forwarded the comments to the office of Senator Evans. I conclude my condemnation of Senator Evans and the Labor Government over their appalling handling of the Gillespie affair by seeking leave to table certain documents to which I have referred throughout my remarks and which I have already shown to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Brereton). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise in these estimates concerning the Attorney-General's Department a matter relating to accountability. I am concerned in relation to an issue which I have raised with the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) on a number of occasions and about which, to date, I have not received any formal advice from him. Were it not for the fact that I have had responses from other Ministers which have suggested that they also have referred issues to the Attorney, I would be in some doubt as to whether or not the matter was receiving attention at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I first wrote to the Attorney on 16 December 1991. I wrote again on 15 May 1992 and, subsequently, in August of this year. To identify the issue, I am concerned particularly about litigation involving Mrs Sylvia Margaret Faulkner and the Commonwealth of Australia. I want to take the opportunity, if I may, in as short a way as possible, to advise the chamber of the issues that are relevant in this matter that I referred to the Attorney, firstly in December 1991, then in May and, finally, on 13 August 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter is described as involving proceedings commenced by Mrs Faulkner in the High Court in 1974. She, as the plaintiff, claimed to have suffered a considerable loss as a result of fraudulent and/or negligent statements made by Brigadier Flint as Engineer-in-Chief in the Australian Army. Proceedings were transferred to the New South Wales Supreme Court. While all this was happening, Mrs Faulkner became bankrupt and the proceedings were continued by the trustee in bankruptcy of her estate. The costs in relation to that matter were to be met by the Commonwealth under the provisions of section 305 of the Bankruptcy Act. A shorthand description is that that information was taken from some brief advice by the Australian Government Solicitor to the Law Council of Australia as to the issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth in this matter was responsible for both the costs of defending the Commonwealth&mdash;that is, the Department of Defence&mdash;and the costs of the proceedings of the plaintiff because she had a substantial claim against the Commonwealth. If that claim were to be successful, the estate would be reimbursed considerably and perhaps there would be funds left over for Mrs Faulkner. In the course of the litigation, the Commonwealth reassessed its decision, which at first involved an acceptance of the total liability to meet the costs for properly conducting these proceedings. The Commonwealth reassessed its position and, shortly before the matter was to be dealt with before the court, on advice from the Solicitor-General, I am told, the Commonwealth determined to constrain the basis upon which the proceedings could be pursued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that there were quite extensive restrictions placed upon the conduct of those proceedings. There were restrictions as to the amount of time and the extent to which counsel could be involved. There were restrictions placed upon the evidence that could be brought in these proceedings. They were very limiting restrictions which Mr and Mrs Faulkner believe effectively constrained their ability to be successful in these proceedings. Witnesses were required from abroad in order to adduce the necessary evidence to sustain the case. Once it had been determined that the costs of bringing those witnesses could not be met as part of the defence, the ability of the plaintiff in this case to be successful was severely jeopardised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very real concern, which I have raised because it has been raised with me by Mrs Faulkner's professional advisers&mdash;and it seems a proper point to be made&mdash;that, in order to protect himself, the Commonwealth Attorney sought advice from the Solicitor-General. The Solicitor-General, Dr Gavan Griffith, was the Commonwealth's principal legal adviser in relation to the proceedings involving the defence of the Commonwealth's position. As I understand it, he was not directly conducting that case, but he was called upon to give advice, wearing another hat, to the Commonwealth as to whether or not the aid under section 305 of the Bankruptcy Act should continue. Here he was, trying to set up a Chinese wall. That term is used in relation to legal advisers and other professionals who are acting for both sides and are supposed to set up some wall which would enable them to make their judgments quite independently of the other pressures that might ordinarily be there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Faulkners, properly, believe that the fact that the Solicitor-General was asked to deal with this matter in that way put him in a very invidious position. They were also not confident that it was an effective wall. They believe&mdash;and this point has been made very clearly to the Attorney in the correspondence that I have sent to him&mdash;that this matter may have been settled. I am told that there had been certain intimations that amounts as high as $800,000 might be talked of in view of effecting a settlement in this case. If those negotiations had been pressed and an offer made, a settlement may have been concluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems somewhat more than coincidental that at a later time, after the Solicitor-General had had the opportunity to pursue the claimants' evidence and the way in which they were intending to conduct their case, not only was there a certificate given under section 305 limiting the assistance available to conduct the case&mdash;only a matter of weeks before the case was to be tried&mdash;but the formal offer which had been intimated might be forthcoming never came. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have the Commonwealth's adviser able to look at the evidence on the one hand and offer advice. Perhaps we would be led to believe that, having undertaken that review, none of that information made its way into the hands of the Commonwealth, wearing its other hat, to enable the Commonwealth to know that if the matter were pressed, the claimants would be in a very much more difficult position to sustain their case. I have seen some advice from Mrs Faulkner's legal advisers to the Solicitor-General indicating quite clearly that they would be in a very much more difficult position to be able to sustain the case in this matter if those overseas witnesses were not available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My principal reason for raising this matter is that I think there are substantial matters that need to be addressed by the Attorney-General, and they need to be the subject of review. There are letters from me from December last year, through to May and August, that have not been replied to. Mr and Mrs Faulkner are both elderly people. There is medical evidence that suggests that, as elderly people and with the illnesses they are suffering from, they may even lose the ability to prosecute this matter as a result of the intervention of death. I would regard it as a tragedy if the delay in dealing with these matters were to further prejudice Mr and Mrs Faulkner. I think there are serious matters that the House ought to be aware of and that the Attorney ought to address as a matter of urgency. That is the reason I take this opportunity in these Estimates of pressing these matters at this time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the estimates for the Department of Transport and Communications, one of the</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>starting points should be the structure of the Department and whether or not it is appropriate to have transport and communications combined. The number of Ministers we have had in the transport and communications area, and the number of assistant Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries, is quite staggering. In recent times the communications area particularly has seen some dramatic changes in policy. Of course, this has to be reflected in the Budget allocations. These dramatic changes in policy have taken place over a period when we have had six Ministers. We have had Minister Kerin and Minister Richardson. We have now the current Minister, Senator Collins, and previously we had Minister Willis. Senator Evans, I think, was the first Minister, and there was Minister Beazley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dramatic changes that have been taking place in these policy areas and, at the same time, the rapid changes in their administration by a variety of different Ministers, do raise the prospect that this area, which is vital for micro-economic reform, perhaps has not seen the level of ministerial overview that it might otherwise have had. Certainly the instability in this area has been regrettable. Despite all of that there have been some changes, the most dramatic of which have been the changes to telecommunications last year and the recent changes to broadcasting law which came through the Parliament recently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When that broadcasting legislation came to the Parliament, it went to the Senate where an element of it was extracted&mdash;the pay TV area. That was sent off to a committee of the Senate to determine what might be the best way to deal with the start-up of the pay television industry in this nation. The Senate has now reported and we wait here today to determine what might happen and what is the state of play with regard to pay television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all rather intrigued to know exactly what the Government is going to do. Many potential players in the industry have waited a long time. I remember in past years a former member from our side of the chamber introduced a private member's Bill to try to facilitate pay television in this country. That was some number of years ago now, and we were almost on the threshold of commencing pay television. That opportunity was snatched away at the last moment because of the Government's inability to think through its policy. It arrived at the position that it took into the Senate in a Sunday morning television interview from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But enough is enough, and it is appropriate in this appropriations debate to make some judgments and some statements about where the pay television industry is going. To highlight this particular point, I wish to move the following amendment to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1992-93:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the proposed expenditure be reduced by $10.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(as an instruction to the Government to appoint for one year only the balance of board members to the Australian Broadcasting Authority; and to bring forward legislation to implement the development of an open and competitive satellite subscription broadcasting industry in this country which puts consumer interest first:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)by issuing all satellite subscription television licences at the same time with no exclusivity period;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)by not mandating the technology to be utilised by subscription television licensees;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)by requiring a common standard for customer reception equipment for a period of two years;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)by requiring an Australian content level of only ten percent.)</PARA>
<PARA>I think I need to outline why it is that I have taken this rather unusual step to highlight the difficulty that the Government has got itself into with regard to pay television, and I also wish to raise another matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment seeks to reduce the appropriation applied to the Department of Transport and Communications by the sum of $10, being a clear instruction to the Government, and particularly to the Minister and the Cabinet, to develop an open and competitive arrangement and structure for pay television in this country. There are a couple of key points that I outline in this amendment that I know the Government and the Parliamentary Secretary at the table, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr Price), are unlikely to accept, and unfortunately we will have to divide on the matter. Those key points will have to be at the forefront of Senator Collins's mind and the Cabinet's mind as they finally formulate a pay TV policy. First, we should be issuing all satellite subscription television licences at the same time with no exclusivity period. There ought not to be a preferential position for any particular players; everyone ought to be able to bid for the available transponders that are going to be offered by Optus at the same time. We do not believe, and I have said this many times, that there ought to be any exclusivity period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we ought not to be mandating the technology to be utilised by subscription television licensees. It is a real trap when there are rapid changes in technology for parliaments to be sitting here and to say,`In 1992 you have to use a particular type of technology'. If parliaments do that, they may be circumscribing the possibilities for market players to adopt other technologies that can deliver perhaps a better service at a better price to consumers. Who are we to say, and how are we to say, that we have all the knowledge to be able to determine what the technologies ought to be? So I think it should be a clear policy, and this is a policy that the Government did pursue in its telecommunications legislation, of being technologically neutral. We must not mandate the technologies that can be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point is that we ought also be aware that, in the multiplicity of delivery mechanisms that might become available for pay television, we do not want to see happen in Australia what happened in the United Kingdom when pay television arrived. There was a variety of customer reception equipment that was incompatible with each other, so a person would take one particular service and buy one particular black box which would have the capacity to take only one type of signal. There are possibilities for there to be black boxes that are compatible with a variety of reception capacities so that one can take several different signals, mating from different technologies. Consumers would not then find themselves in a position where, if they wanted to change, they have to go out and spend another $500-odd on reception equipment. I have said for some considerable time, as indeed the Senate committee has said, that we must look towards trying to set a common standard for customer reception equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that I think has not underpinned the Government's approach to communications policy is putting the consumer first. Whatever happened to the consumer? I think many from the Government side involved in the administration of the communications area have forgotten about the consumer. They are the ones we ought to be putting first. What those opposite have succeeded in doing in a whole variety of television decisions and radio decisions is visiting upon the industry extreme financial difficulty which has meant that the range of services provided to the community has diminished in variety rather than increasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can point to the devastation that has been visited upon the radio industry over a long period of time. For forty years other countries have had a broad range of FM services, but in this country we are still seeing many areas where FM has not become available. That has all been a product of a ludicrous government policy in more recent years that has meant that FM has not got to regional areas particularly, and I think that is very regrettable. The aggregation policy, the amount conceived with a view to trying to service and give extra choice to consumers, has been done in such a way that consumers have actually had to pay mightily for it. The amount of money that taxpayers have put in to try to make aggregation work&mdash;that is, three competing services in regional markets&mdash;has meant that taxpayers have funded well over $140m-odd a year with sales tax concessions and so on to try to make this policy work. But at the same time these competing services have seen the range of programming diminish rather than increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I well remember in the old chamber, I think in 1986, speaking in the debate about aggregation and trying to bring to consumers extra choice. We debated then multi-channel services, as they were called, and different options for utilising different technologies to visit upon consumers extra choice but still at the same time make it viable for the communication company deliverers of those services to continue to be viable. Of course, the Government would not listen, so we have continued to pay year on year extra subsidies, extra support for a policy that was conceived with possibly the right motives but in total ignorance of what its impact would be. That would not be so bad if one could not foresee it, but people in the industry and members of the Opposition told the Government what the problem would be. That is why we see this huge figure being appropriated in the Budget to support those services.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say at the outset that I do not agree with the amendment, but let me also say that there is one point on which I agree with the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith). I also find it quite puzzling why we have transport and communications lobbed in together. No-one consults me on the composition of departments, so I am as puzzled as he is. My personal view, which does not reflect the view of the Government, is that they are such important and diverse departments that perhaps we would be better served if they were separate departments headed by separate Ministers. But that is only my personal view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To illustrate his point, the honourable member for Bass spent his allocated time talking about communications. I will be spending my allocated time talking about transport. The appropriation for transport and communications illustrates this Labor Government's approach to these two disciplines. This has to be contrasted with the approach of the Opposition. Nowhere are the proposals of the conservatives more discredited than in the area of road transport. Not only is their policy as presented in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document discredited, but also this much-vaunted document has a $6 billion hole in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Fightback much is made of the abolition of the fuel excise. We are also told that the conservatives would implement cost recovery in each vehicle class. So, while the Opposition runs around Australia promising cheaper petrol, it knows that there is a $6 billion funding shortage for roads. Honourable members opposite talk about the cut in the cost of fuel but there is also a slug there. There would be a reduction in the cost of fuel but the slug would be for the road user. Those opposite would slug the road user with another tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite recently we saw a stunt by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) in Lismore selling petrol for what he said was a GST price. Obviously, this was a farce, about something the coalition knows it could never deliver because it would never fund a roads program. It is no wonder that the local newspaper on the north coast labelled it a `ridiculous stunt' and said that the Opposition must take the local people for mugs. I invite the honourable member for Flinders to try that stunt in the Illawarra and see the reception he gets. The people of the Illawarra, especially the truckies, would want to know the real cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's secret tax, a road user charge which it says it will impose but which it will not spell out, is causing considerable anxiety in the road transport industry and, indeed, in the wider community. There is no doubt that the coalition's position on road user charges continues to be riddled with confusion. This has to be contrasted with the Government's co-operative consultation with the road transport industry to create long term stability for operators. The Opposition's refusal to spell out details of its secret road tax will lead to serious undermining of confidence. Its reluctance to come clean and spell out exactly what road user charges would be imposed by it is having a destabilising influence on those industries relying heavily on transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier today I heard the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) say that he had recently addressed a meeting of some 600 people in his electorate and that after he had explained the GST to them they were very excited. Far be it from me to doubt the explanative ability of the honourable member for Parkes, but `very excited' might be the operative words. All road users should get very excited. I guess the honourable member for Parkes has many farmers in his electorate. They should be concerned and excited about the imposition of a road user tax of up to $30,000 on their trucks. No wonder the National Farmers Federation is very concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Opposition disputes this it should tell the Australian people how the nation's roads are to be funded. The Government has spelt it out in its document. Is the Opposition not going to build roads? Is it not going to repair them? The coalition needs to explain its policy on roads fully to the road transport industry. It needs to explain it fully to the farmers and to the wider Australian community. Until it does so no-one will regard its policies as having any degree of credibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Parkes also spoke glowingly about New Zealand. The New Zealand that he visited must have been a very different place from the one I visited with the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure of this chamber in June. We had a look at how the transport system was working in that country, and I came back with a markedly different view from that of the honourable member for Parkes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has been saying that cheaper petrol prices will lower the price of goods, but how can they when the road user charge will be passed on? Does the Opposition believe that this hidden levy will not be passed on? Not only will the Opposition collect a 15 per cent goods and services tax on everything, but the hidden road user tax will also be added to everything. The present Federal fuel excise, which the coalition claims it will abolish in government, is, as already stated, approximately 27c a litre. Private motorists, according to the Opposition, will pay about 19c a litre less under a coalition government, which means that they will be left with a GST of about 8c a litre. But, as the coalition well knows, on present national fuel consumption levels this 8c a litre is only one-third of what is required to fund Australia's annual $5 billion road construction and maintenance program. In any case, the GST is intended to be a general revenue tax and not a road construction tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has several options. The first option is to add a 16c a litre road user charge to its 8c a litre GST to finance the $5 billion national road program. But the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is adamant that this will not&mdash;repeat, not&mdash;take the form of a fuel tax. The second option is for the coalition to collect the shortfall by direct charges on private motorists and on commercial vehicles&mdash;a move which for motorists and commercial operators would largely negate the removal of the fuel excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third and only remaining option available to the coalition unless it intends that $3 billion plus of federally funded road works&mdash;that is, Federal special purpose grants and untied funds&mdash;be suspended per year is to finance the $3 billion plus gap out of general revenue. Obviously, this would mean diverting $3 billion in government funds from other programs such as defence, health, education or social security. It would also mean that the Opposition would have to drop all pretence of being committed to the user pays approach to charging for road use. This principle, which the Opposition presently supports, is crucial to the reform of the road transport industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Simple arithmetic tells us that unless the Opposition arranges to suspend over $4 billion worth of road words across Australia every year&mdash;road works paid for or underwritten by the Federal Government in one way or another&mdash;it must maintain a fuel excise of at least 16c a litre in addition to its GST of 8c a litre for private motorists. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member may think so. The clear implication is that the price of petrol for private motorists could not possibly be reduced by 19c a litre. At an absolute maximum it could be reduced by no more than 2c or 3c a litre by abolishing the present 27c excise, introducing a new 16c fuel charge and adding 8c to the GST. Our appeal to the Opposition is to stop this nonsense, to come clean and tell us how it will fund the roadworks of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I commend the Government for the figure in the Budget to update the Indian Pacific. I think the Indian Pacific has the potential to become one of the great train journeys of the world. It can be a paying proposition, but it has to be promoted correctly. As we have seen with the Ghan, if it is promoted correctly it can be a revenue earner for the Government. The Government took a commendable step in allocating that money for the upgrading of the Indian Pacific. I think it will be a decision the Government will reap many rewards from. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must start by refuting some of the utter nonsense espoused by the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). I thought he understood the basic thrust of the Budget a bit more than that. I remind him that the base funding from the Commonwealth for roads is around $1.4 billion. How he could say there is a $6 billion shortage for roads in Fightback is beyond me. It does his own credibility a lot of damage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He obviously had difficulty in reading the notes that he was given, let alone thinking about how nonsensical it all is. His speech was riddled with confusion, and simple arithmetic would tell him that. The Commonwealth puts a base rate of $1.4 billion into roads, and another $600m has been allocated in the February economic statement. There is no question that, once the Government has had that one-off extra spending, it will be winding that back, as has been shown in the Budget Papers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also point out very clearly to the honourable member for Throsby that the National Farmers Federation in its analysis said that the Fightback package would benefit farmers by between 7 and 22 per cent, depending on the type of farming operation. If we read the words, we see that that analysis included a worst case assumption on what a likely road user charge might be. The honourable member ought to do a bit more homework and take a bit more time to study and understand the matter before he comes into this chamber and makes a complete and utter fool of himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to talk specifically about the land transport program. The recession we `had to have' has taken a very big toll on the freight volumes of both road and rail sections. If honourable members look at Tasrail, they will see that Tasrail freight volumes have certainly been affected by the recession because it relies largely on export freight, such as woodchip logs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing to note about this recession we `had to have' is the effect that it has had on employment. Employment has fallen in four successive quarters. Nothing I have heard today would point to the fact that that is likely to change in the immediate future. I guess of equal concern is the fact that, since the 1990 September quarter, private investment has fallen continually. A dismal picture has been painted by the recession we `had to have', and the architect of that recession is the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to road funding. Although there has been an increase in spending&mdash;this was announced in the February statement and is only for the next two years&mdash;it is only a vote buying exercise. If we look a bit deeper at the record of this Government, we find that Labor has an appalling record. Since this Government came to office, over the last nine years&mdash;apart from the current year&mdash;we have seen a steady erosion, or reduction in real terms, in the amount of money going into roads. At the same time, the amount of revenue that has been taken off road users has risen quite dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fuel excise alone, which is dragged off motorists, is now over $7 billion a year. This shows the cynicism the Government has towards the road users and, in particular, the road freight industry. The Government is prepared to tax the industry to the hilt as a source of general revenue rather than looking at the question of user pays, which contrasts strongly with the approach that will be taken by a coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to remember who allowed the deterioration of our roads today. The Government has belatedly recognised this deterioration and has given a sudden one-off increase, which would be phased out in the next election if the Government had a chance. Mr Bill Bytheway, the Chief Executive of one of the major road freight companies, Mayne Nickless, made the following point about the taxing of the road transport industry:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nearly one third of Australia's transport costs went on government taxes and charges, hurting Australia's micro-economic reform process.</PARA>
<PARA>That spells it out very clearly. There is a need for micro-economic reform. The fact is that we want cheaper, more efficient transport. One of the major areas of reform, which the Fightback package addresses so clearly, is to take the tax off road freight. It is an intermediate cost to business. To tax road freight for the sake of taxing it means that the cost of doing business in Australia is significantly increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the various taxes. As I have mentioned, the Government expects to raise $7.3 billion from fuel tax alone this year. Sales tax is expected to rise and it will be extended to some categories of farm trucks. The Government has failed dismally to tackle another major tax on road transport: payroll tax. The Government has clearly found it too hard and is not prepared to bite the bullet, despite the fact that it has been given a lead by the coalition through the Fightback package. One can only assume that the Government's approach in this whole area is that it is too hard and that it is going to keep taxing the industry, keep using it as a milch cow, and keep taking more and more out with this indirect, hidden tax without ever admitting to the Australian public just how much it is taking and, more significantly, ever admitting how little of the revenue raised through road users actually goes back into the roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to turn quickly to the question of rail funding. After having neglected rail for nearly 10 years the Government has suddenly recognised the difficulties it has caused for our railways. There is a belated effort to try to redress that imbalance. I noticed in the Budget Papers that the National Rail Corporation was allocated $40m last year as the Commonwealth's equity contribution. For the year it was able to spend only $8.9m&mdash;less than one-quarter of the amount that was allocated. This was due to the late start-up date caused by delays in negotiations between the NRC and the rail unions. This Government always tries to pride itself on its close relationship with the unions. Yet when it is put to the test these are the sorts of results. The Government has allocated $162m to rail this year. Again, we must raise very serious questions as to whether that will be spent because that industrial agreement has still not been signed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under that heads of government agreement, that industrial agreement was supposed to have been signed by this month and then the equity contributions would be paid. But the question then arises: since the agreement has not been signed, and if it is not signed for some time, what will happen to that money? Also, very significantly and most importantly, what will happen to interstate rail freight?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see today that the New South Wales State Rail Authority is already winding down its operations in interstate rail freight because it says that it is now the responsibility of the National Rail Corporation; but the National Rail Corporation still does not have that agreement in place. Will there be a hiatus and a loss of business? Will that jeopardise further the prospects of the National Rail Corporation's meeting its target of breaking even within three years and being profitable after five? These are very serious questions because we are talking about not only very large sums of money but also the fact that our railways are losing so much money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again I come back to the question of spending by this Government on rail and how so much noise was made, particularly in the February economic statement, the One Nation statement, about the big allocation to rail; how $454m was going to be spent. The question is: how much of that money has been spent to date? We are now in October. There was a lot of hype and promise about this; the money was going to be spent quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I leave honourable members with a very simple question: how much of that money has been spent to date? If so little has been spent, as I understand to be the case, why has the Government been such a dismal failure in getting that program under way?</PARA>

It could mean a large increase in fuel costs if the user really does pay for roads. Will it be $10 billion or $7 billion?  Those opposite would have to add, not take off, fuel taxes. Of course, they do not say exactly how the user will pay for roads. What will they do? Will they do what they did with the payroll tax? They were very generous in saying that they would get rid of payroll tax. But who collects payroll tax? It is the State governments. Would the Opposition do that to get the alleged reduction of 19c a litre fuel tax with the user pays principle on the roads? Will it tell the States that they can develop the roads, run the roads and upgrade the roads; that they can spend all the money and raise the money? Will the States collect it? Just like the payroll tax, it is an easy piece of duckshoving&mdash;just send it over to the States and let them do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could be added on to registration fees so that we would have huge registration fees, with perhaps pensioners paying out large amounts once a year. With a principle of user pays, the money has to come from somewhere. So will pensioners have to pay it in their registration fees? If not, will it be added only to trucks? If it were added to trucks only, let us think what that would do to costs in places such as Bombala where there is no rail, or places on the south-east coast right down from Bombaderry to the Victorian border in New South Wales. In all of those towns such as Batemans Bay, Moruya, Bermagui, Narooma, Eden, Bega, Merimbula and all the small towns around people would have to pay a lot more because, instead of a $4,000 fee for some heavy vehicles, which has just been agreed to by the Premiers and by the National Road Transport Commission, it could be $17,000. </PARA>

Will it be any of these, will it be something else, or will it be the lot? They say that the user will pay&mdash;so we and the people of Australia want to know how they will administer this user pays policy in their Fightback package. They cannot do it and reduce petrol prices by 19c a litre without adding to the costs somewhere else. So they should be telling us clearly where it is going to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) mentioned that $30 billion was being given to the States. Unfortunately, last year the Federal Government agreed with the Premiers that it would no longer be designating funds to the States specifically for roads. I believe that was a wrong move by this Government and by the Premiers. That should never have been done because we here have to be accountable for taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is two years since the Auditor-General indicated that 18 months after money had been transferred from the Federal Government to the States the Federal Government was unable to account for $6 billion of that funding that had been given to the States&mdash;Federal taxpayers' money, not the Federal Government's money; it had not been properly accounted for. So we do not know what is happening to our money. It is important that we as a Federal government are accountable to our taxpayers for money that is spent. It was a wrong move to stop naming funds specifically for roads to both Federal and State governments. We have seen plenty of mistakes. For instance, many years ago New South Wales Premier Askin refused funding from the Whitlam Government because it was not going to be spent in the way the Whitlam Government said; so he would not take it. This has given us a legacy of bad roads in New South Wales. We are still catching up with those mistakes. One can drive in many other States and find that the roads are much better. I firmly believe it is because the New South Wales Government was being difficult about a Federal government telling it how to spend money that it had collected from Federal taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also had the case where the New South Wales and Victorian governments disagreed on where an inland link between New South Wales and Victoria should be. They disagreed on whether it should be the Bonang Highway or the Monaro Highway. The Victorians decided that it should be the Cann Valley Highway, which leads into the Monaro Highway. New South Wales decided that it should be the Bonang Highway. Each did their bit of bitumen and both lead to nowhere. It will still be another two or three years before we catch up and the New South Wales Government completes the Monaro Highway and joins it up with the already bitumened Cann Valley Highway in Victoria. This hopeless situation is not just costly; socially it is a bad decision. Economically, from a tourism point of view, it creates huge problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the case of the Princes Highway and the Kings Highway in New South Wales. The State Government has decided that it does not regard these roads as warranting national arterial priority, so it did not include them in a list to the Federal Government. We are giving the States money and saying to them, `You work out what your priority is'. They decide what the priority is and we have no say. The States' decisions may not necessarily suit the nation. It may well be that the Pacific Highway and the Princes Highway are a great and important second link between Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales&mdash;an alternative link&mdash;and it may not suit the nation not to list those highways as a priority. The Federal Government ought to be making the decision itself, and it ought to be making a decision in favour of those highways. It cannot do so because it suits the New South Wales Government to say that its priority is different. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting to follow the contribution of my friend the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) tonight. Without wishing to offer too much advice to him, I would suggest that he spend less time reading the propaganda that is put out by Australian Labor Party headquarters about what the coalition's Fightback package and its heavy vehicle road user charge is all about, because I can assure honourable members that what they have just heard from the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is simply that&mdash;it is just propaganda designed to scare the good citizens out there and to distort us from the truth of the policy that the coalition takes to the next election in regard to road funding and the heavy vehicle road user charge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By any fair and objective measurement, one can easily see&mdash;as I am sure the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, when he is not reading Labor Party propaganda, would agree&mdash;that the coalition takes a far better policy for road funding to the next election campaign. Our road user charge will be applied after the fuel excise has been removed. An amount of 26c a litre will be taken off the price of fuel for those heavy vehicles. Any charge like that has to be better than a charge that will be imposed by this Government which will be a heavy vehicle road user charge on top of the 26c a litre tax that the Government is imposing at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting also that since this Government came to power in 1983&mdash;nearly 10 years ago&mdash;it has increased that fuel excise from some 6c a litre to 26c a litre and in the interim it has reduced the amount of road funding from the Commonwealth by about 26 per cent in real terms. My colleague the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), I am sure, will be able to correct me if I am a little wrong. It is around 26 per cent in real terms since this Labor Government came to power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has nothing to crow about when it comes to road funding. Indeed, distorting the coalition's policy will do it no good because people in the heavy vehicle industry and the various motoring associations around Australia and organisations such as the National Farmers Federation&mdash;a body that is very important in the electorate of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro&mdash;all recognise the virtues of the coalition's policies on heavy vehicles and road funding and indeed in terms of the cost of motoring for the average motorist, let alone for heavy vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I wish to speak a little about the waterfront reform program that has been undertaken by this Government. Indeed we are coming up very shortly to the third anniversary of waterfront reform, which should be the conclusion of waterfront reform under this Government. We have seen a great deal of trumpeting from Senator Collins, the former Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, over the last year or so about what the Government has achieved and more particularly, as he would tell us, what he has achieved in waterfront reform. He seriously misinformed the people of Australia by telling them that if waterfront reform was not completed within 12 months of his taking over the job he would resign. Having had a 12-month anniversary of his taking over the job and waterfront reform being a long way from completion, he did not resign. So we immediately knew the type of personality and character that we were dealing with. Senator Collins has continued to provide rather exaggerated statements about the benefits of waterfront reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The acid test of any reform process, whether on the waterfront or whatever, is whether the process has delivered reduced costs and improved services. Using that as our basic measurement to analyse whether waterfront reform has been successful in Australia, I think we can say quite categorically that under this Government waterfront reform has not achieved what it should have. If honourable members went to all the shipping and waterfront conferences that I have the pleasure of attending they would hear the people who use the waterfront continually getting up at conferences and in the question times that follow speeches and saying, `Look, we've been using the waterfront for the last few years and we've not noticed any reduction in the cost of moving goods across the Australian waterfront'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we compare that example given by users of the waterfront with the experiences in New Zealand, we soon realise that when New Zealand undertook its reform process on the waterfront three years ago&mdash;exactly the same time that this Government did&mdash;New Zealand, by undertaking real reform of the waterfront, has achieved real advantages. For example, this Government's own document which it released in May this year, which did an analysis of stevedoring costs over the last couple of years, shows us that when waterfront reform commenced in New Zealand the cost of moving a 20-foot container was $298. Two and a half years after waterfront reform had been undertaken in New Zealand, the cost had gone from $298 a container to $166 a container&mdash;a fall of some $132 per container. Meanwhile in Australia, under this Labor Government, with waterfront reform commencing at the same time and being analysed under the same process, the cost of moving a 20-foot container was $282 when waterfront reform commenced and in May, according to the figures that were published then, the cost of moving a container had fallen by the mighty sum of $4 to $278 a container. In New Zealand there was a $132 fall in the cost and in Australia there was a $4 fall in the cost of moving a container. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comparisons could not be more stark when we look at one of the major users of our waterfront that travels between Australia and New Zealand&mdash;that is, Tasman Pulp and Paper, which has a couple of ships which supply the Trans Tasman. Its representatives said at the Australian Port and Marine Authority's conference held in June this year in Manly&mdash;in fact I spoke at it&mdash;that their stevedoring costs in Sydney ranged from $9.16 to $11.13 per tonne. Yet in New Zealand, after its waterfront reform had delivered the sorts of benefits that would be the envy of anybody, the cost of stevedoring was $2.72 to $2.96 per tonne. So it is easy to see, from $11.13 to $2.96, that New Zealand, with its waterfront reform process, has achieved the sorts of things that the coalition intends to achieve with its own waterfront reform process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having had virtually no reduction in the costs of using our Australian waterfront, we have seen massive amounts of taxpayers' money going into the hands of retiring waterside workers. The Commonwealth Government, under the auspices of its waterfront reform program, will have spent $430m over the last three years in topping up the retirement packages of retiring waterside workers&mdash;an additional redundancy payment of $100,000, on average, on top of their normal superannuation, long service leave and sick leave payments&mdash;to entice waterside workers to retire ahead of schedule. By anybody's measure, that is the most accommodating and generous redundancy package that has been offered to any Australian worker in the history of this country&mdash;all because the Waterside Workers Federation is a very powerful element of the Australian labour movement and this Government does not have the courage to stand up to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of that $430m we have undoubtedly seen some reductions on the waterfront in terms of waterside labour. But have we seen benefits for the people whom the waterfront is designed to serve&mdash;that is, the users; the exporters and importers? Have we seen them get any benefits? The answer is no. The only people who have derived benefit from the Government's waterfront reform process have been the retiring wharfies who have picked up an extra $430m. Needless to say, very few sectors of Australian society can boast that sort of generosity from this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst ever we have legislated jobs for life for wharfies, whilst ever we have stevedoring levies in place, whilst ever the Waterside Workers Federation has an iron grip on the Australian waterfront, and whilst ever stevedore managers look to the Commonwealth to solve their business problems nobody in this country can claim that the Australian waterfront has been reformed properly and that the benefits of it have flowed through to the people whom the waterfront is designed to serve: the users. This is the sorry tale of the Government's three-year reform process. It will continue for the next few years, I think at great cost to our exporters. This Government will simply add further taxes to the cost of our exports as a result of its reforms on the waterfront. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CE4">Mr O'KEEFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will; I will tell the Parliament. I took a group of about 80 of what I guess I would call opinion leaders&mdash;people who are the chairmen of their local regional development committee, mayors or people who have a lot of influence around the local community in Victoria&mdash;for a tour of the Melbourne transport hub. I did it for one reason and one reason alone. The honourable member for Gilmore, in particular, is one who wanders around Australia telling people about all of these problems. So I thought, `Hang on, instead of hearing all this kind of stuff why don't you have a look for yourselves?'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We started at Melbourne airport&mdash;an airport that has been described by the Opposition and others as a Third World airport. The group looked at the development plans and saw for themselves the work which is taking place. From there we went to see the western bypass which has just opened&mdash;the new national highway ring road which will eventually link the Hume Highway to the Western Highway. It will take the trucks off Pascoe Vale Road but, more importantly, will provide a major link between road, rail, sea and air in what is arguably Australia's transport hub. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then went to see rail transport. The honourable member sitting beside me, my good friend the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), will take particular delight in this. We went to South Dynon rail yard where the National Rail Corporation is about to take over operations&mdash;which is the first time in Australia that we have a national rail corporation encompassing the six States and bringing their operations together in this way. We could see there a quite amazing turnaround, not only in the business being won by rail in the area of heavy transport but also in goods being delivered with very high levels of efficiency and on time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the honourable member for Gilmore talks about the costs not being passed on, I can tell him that a factory in Cheltenham in the southern part of Melbourne which wants to send a container overnight to Parramatta in Sydney and which was previously sending that container for between $900 to $1,100 overnight on a truck, can now put the same container on rail on the superfreighter for $450. They are very significant improvements. The container arrives in Sydney next morning and is delivered on time. The people I took around could see all of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then went to the waterfront. Many of these councillors&mdash;particularly the rural councillors off the farm&mdash;had heard the honourable member for Gilmore and his colleagues talking about all of the wharfies sitting around playing cards and that sort of thing. What did they see at the waterfront? They saw stacks and stacks of containers&mdash;no wharfies in sight. We happened to arrive when a ship was due to leave. Honourable members know the old story: when a ship was due to leave they used to say, `Well, you know, it will be going at 5.30 p.m. You had better get off the ship at around 20 past five'. We left the ship and it was stacked up, packed up and gone. At 5.30 it was out in the middle of the river on its way to Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About two minutes before the ship closed its gate a truck arrived with a container. I said to the foreman, `Well, I guess he's missed the boat'&mdash;to coin a phrase. The foreman said, `Oh no, we'll get him on'. In front of us all this container was taken off the light truck, loaded onto the ship, the door was closed and the truck was actually on the waterfront for four minutes. The honourable member for Gilmore is telling people around Australia that it is there for four days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day these people&mdash;and when one sits down and looks at their constituencies one can see that these people represent one million Victorians&mdash;were saying, to a person, `Why don't we know about this? Why isn't this what we have been told'. I will tell honourable members why. It is not in the interests of Opposition members to wander around the business decision makers&mdash;the people who have to decide whether they should take an export order and whether they will be able to deliver it on time&mdash;and actually admit that where there used to be 27,000 wharfies there are now 2,700. It is not in their interests to admit that the turnaround time for a truck and a container at South Dynon railway terminal is 12 minutes. It is not in their interests to admit that 18,000 passengers per day are going through airports such as Tullamarine. It is not in their interests to admit that the Government has actually tackled these reforms in transport and communications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a very good measure for any member of this Parliament&mdash;and I am sure you would share this experience yourself, Madam Chair. When I was first elected to parliament Telecom complaints took up at least half of the working time of one of my staff members. Now in my office&mdash;and the new members in this place would not know about this because they have not had this experience&mdash;we would be lucky to get one Telecom complaint per fortnight. The fact of the matter is that that organisation has been opened up to competition and, given the structure that now exists, Telecom has lifted its performance standards dramatically. Another debate which will come up in this portfolio area is of course the future of Australia Post, as a result of the recent Industry Commission draft report recommending that it be opened up to competition and then sold off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very clearly, on the Government side we are satisfied with the way Australia Post has been through the reform process. We are satisfied with the improvements that it is making, and the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), must take great credit for this. We certainly will not be taking the Opposition position that Australia Post should be flogged off. We will not be taking the Opposition position that Telecom should be flogged off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can go to an area like aviation reform. Who scrapped the two-airline agreement? Who actually opened up Australia's biggest export industry&mdash;tourism&mdash;to efficient airlines providing increased flights and increased services at lower prices? Who has actually taken the step to merge Qantas and Australian Airlines at identified savings between the two airlines of $100m a year&mdash;money that was just wasted? Who allowed Ansett to take on some international partners and to develop a strategic international approach?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The list goes on and on in this field of transport and communications, but all the honourable member for Gilmore can do is come in here and talk about his favourite topic&mdash;how bad it is on the waterfront. He has cast this message all around Australia, but people who have been to the waterfront to see with their own eyes how it actually is have said to me, `Why did I think it was like that?'. The answer is, `Because you were told that by people who have a vested political interest in talking about down sides instead of positives and improvements in our economy'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can simply say to the farm sector, `Yes, you can commit yourself to export. You know the product will be delivered; you know the prices of transport and the costs are coming down'. These old messages are no longer viable. The fact is the reforms are dramatic, they are fast-moving, and they need to be recognised. It is in Australia's interests that the decision makers know that these reforms have taken place in this portfolio. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the estimates debate on the Department of Transport and Communications I wish to speak in relation to communications. I want to talk about the vexed question of the ABC. In May 1991 I tabled in Parliament a private member's Bill, which obviously the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) will remember, called the Ombudsman Amendment Bill 1991, and this sought to amend the principal Act such that the Ombudsman would be able to investigate complaints relating to programming decisions of the ABC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said then in my first reading speech, this sought to redress the present unsatisfactory situation where there was considerable evidence of a concern about aspects of the ABC's programming and presentation standards, but no independent review or adjudication procedures to handle complaints and grievances. I think it is fair to say that my speech acknowledged that at that very time&mdash;May 1991&mdash;the ABC had established an independent complaints review panel, but I noted at that time that it was really an in-house body and merely a belated response to pressure from the Government for something to be done about the growing disquiet over the ABC and its treatment of complaints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nearly 18 months have elapsed since the panel was established, and I think it is probably a convenient time to review its impact. In a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> article of 21 November 1991 the convenor of the panel, Ms Robin Hughes, is quoted as saying that the panel had not had a single complaint to investigate in its first six months of existence. With about 4,000 broadcasting complaints going to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal each year, and the hundreds of known complaints received directly by the ABC, it is a fairly difficult task to believe that none of these have been referred to the panel. It is simply not credible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly some sort of filtering procedure is at work. When I say it is a filtering procedure, I note that this is a conclusion that others also draw. I wish to speak to an article by Frank Devine in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 10 September this year titled `If you want to complain, don't trouble the ABC'. We know, we have been told, that the panel has considered four complaints and that in one case, that of Mrs Judy Baber of Port Macquarie, it was highly critical of the way in which the ABC handled her complaint. Let me quote from Mr Devine's article of Thursday, 10 September 1992 which starts off:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you want to complain, don't trouble the ABC.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Thursday&mdash;that is, 16 months after Mrs Baber sent off her letter of complaint&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The 7.30 Report's</EMPHASIS> NSW compere, Quentin Dempster, read at the end of the program a summary of a finding by the ABC's Independent Complaints Review Panel that the 1991 program had contained `elements of bias, lack of balance and unfairness'.</PARA>
<PARA>As Frank Devine went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was pretty hot stuff . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Leaving aside the next section of the article, he then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Study of the events and transactions that filled with lively activity the 16 months between the complaint and the ABC's on-screen response reveal a tortuous effort by the ABC to keep the matter to itself. It also shows, in my opinion, patronising, bullying and deceitful handling of Mrs Baber, and gives rise to speculation about the reason why only four complaints have been referred to the Review Panel since it was established in May last year.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not me, this is Mr Devine. Again I quote him:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is little doubt that if it had not been for the intervention of the federal Ombudsman&mdash;with whom the ABC has been engaged for the past four years in an unresolved dispute about whether it comes under his jurisdiction&mdash;the ABC would have succeeded in burying the complaint.</PARA>
<PARA>I go on with a later stage of the article:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On June 14, on the letterhead of the Review Panel, she received a reply from the `co-ordinator to the panel'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>note that title, the `co-ordinator to the panel'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">reporting that the complaint had been referred to `the principal community affairs officer' of the ABC, who had determined that she did not have `sufficient interest in the matter complained of because she was not adversely affected personally'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the co-ordinator to the panel did not even hint that she was also concurrently the principal community affairs officer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So she had referred this matter to herself. As Frank Devine said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Baber wrote back to this multi-talented officer&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I like that touch, this multi-talented officer&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">on June 24 declaring that she did, indeed, have `sufficient interest'.</PARA>
<PARA>And she did. Mr Devine went on later in the article to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the diffident Mrs Baber smouldered about her brush-off until December 11 when she wrote to the Ombudsman. His office later advised her that it had made some telephone inquiries of the ABC and written to Hill asking for his comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That letter, sent on December 20, was somewhat sharp in tone. It included an inquiry about why the Review Panel had had so few complaints. It noted that Mrs Baber had not been reminded in any ABC communications that she had a right, if dissatisfied with its responses, to approach the panel directly. Failure to do this might tend to explain why so few complaints reached the panel.</PARA>

<PARA>This article, so well written by Mr Devine, encapsulates concisely the sorts of concerns that I and many of my constituents have had over many years. I have had occasion to complain to the ABC about aspects of its broadcasting, about its statements, about its standard of language and historical reporting, and about the bias of various commentators, and yet never have I had a truly satisfactory response. That is why I introduced the private member's Bill called the Ombudsman Amendment Bill 1991 when I did. Honourable members may find it surprising, given my comments, that I support the ABC. I think it is a very fine body in concept. Unfortunately, aspects of its organisation and its management over recent times have led many people like me to question seriously aspects of its performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who have a complaint about the ABC really need to believe that their complaint is at least listened to, is seriously considered and is answered. That does not happen under the present situation. Despite this so-called independent review panel, four complaints have so far been considered. You would know, Madam Chairman, from your own experience as a member of parliament how many people seriously complain about the ABC. Something has to be done about it. It has to be held accountable. I hope that in the fullness of time my Bill will get the support of the Parliament. But in the meantime, I hope that people who do complain about the ABC follow through their complaint rigorously. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was pleased to hear the previous speaker, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar), speak about the ABC because I can assure him that for years now I have received hundreds of complaints from throughout my electorate about the general standard of the programs that we have in Australia. I accuse the ABC of this, but I too believe in the ABC. I think that it is doing a very good job in many respects. The important point is that we can turn on the ABC and not get advertisements. That is one of the reasons why we like to put it on. A lot of its programs are good.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know why it is that it has to indulge in many of the things that it does with regard to sex, murder and swearing that we do not want to hear on our television or the radio. This country is still good. The standards of this country have, I believe, deteriorated over a period of time. They will improve again, undoubtedly, but they have deteriorated because of the example that has been set by the media and particularly by television. I accuse the ABC of this. I agree, too, that the answers we receive from the Government to our complaints are not very satisfactory. I appeal to the Government&mdash;and particularly to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins)&mdash;to try to put some pressure on it. We know that it is an independent group, but we look up to the ABC as an organisation to lead this country so far as standards in general broadcasting and TV are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise this evening to speak briefly about roads. Many words have been spoken in the Parliament over the years concerning the standard of roads within Australia and the need for improvement. There always will be a need for improvement because of the fact that this country is still developing and over the years we are seeking a better standard of transport and a safer standard of roads. I know it has been said this evening that over the years there has been a deterioration in general spending. I commend the Government for allocating in the last year&mdash;I do not know whether it is because there is an election around the corner, but I assume it is&mdash;some additional money for roads. There is $1.4 billion in the Budget at the moment and the One Nation statement actually contains some more over a two-year period. So over $2 billion will be spent on the road system generally throughout Australia over the year to come. I welcome this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been explained by the shadow Minister for land transport, the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), we will maintain that funding. It has to be maintained if we are going to see the macro-economic reform that we expect in this country. If we look at the record, we see that in 1983 $970m was collected in Australia through the petrol tax, which was 6.15c per litre. Last year&mdash;9 years afterwards&mdash;$7 billion was collected through a tax of 26c per litre. As we have explained, under Fightback the motorist will not have to pay 19c of that; it will be cast away. That will have a tremendous effect on transport costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is recognised by the authorities that at least 15 per cent of everything we buy&mdash;on the shelf, in the shop or wherever it is&mdash;goes to transport costs. That is a very big percentage when we think about it. If we bring that down through all the commodities that we buy&mdash;whether it be food, electrical goods, motor cars or whatever&mdash;there should be a great reduction in costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told by the experts that by the year 2000&mdash;in eight years time&mdash;there will be 60 per cent more vehicles on the road. So road transportation is a tremendous factor in reform. In fact, I have before me the record dating back to 1981-82. I mentioned a while ago that the petrol tax was 6.155 cents per litre. That is now up to 26.154 cents per litre. That is a very large amount of money to be taxed from the motorist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said a while ago that we will maintain funding. This evening I would like to emphasise the fact that we still need further research and investigation into building better roads in Australia. Only the other day I travelled down a highway that I had travelled down over four months ago. The first time, I saw nine large machines on the side of the road. Only one was working, at 11 o'clock in the morning. I passed that same area about four months later and only two of those nine machines were actually in operation. That is tremendously inefficient</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I advocate very strongly&mdash;and I think it is the intention of the Government to do this wherever it can&mdash;letting our road development work out to private enterprise. It is essential that this be done because, if the road traffic authorities in the States receive a certain amount of money over a year and there is a certain amount of work to do, the work is spread out, I believe, over a period of time. However, if we allocate the work to a contractor, he will go ahead with his machinery and with his personnel to complete a contract as soon as he possibly can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was in South Korea a couple of months ago and I found that at 7 o'clock in the morning the excavators, graders and bulldozers were working. At 6 or 7 o'clock at night they were still there working&mdash;though I am not saying that the operator is necessarily the same. Surely with one million people out of work here in Australia we can organise ourselves better and build improved roads at a reduced cost. So I appeal to the Government&mdash;and I am sure that we will do this when in government because it is the policy of the Opposition&mdash;to let the work out to private contractors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to say something about the Pacific Highway. The honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), who is in the chamber at the moment, has said quite a lot in the House over the years in relation to the highway. Considerable works have been undertaken over the last year, principally because of extra funding from the Commonwealth. The Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) has made the allocation for the black spot areas. The New South Wales Government, in its 3x3 program, has also made a wonderful contribution to putting extra money generally into the highways, the arterial roads and the rural and urban local road systems of the State. So extra work is being undertaken on the Pacific Highway at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I travelled that highway yesterday. Admittedly, it was a long weekend, but on any quarter of a kilometre area there would be at least 30 or 40 vehicles coming one way or the other. This is a busy highway. There has been an increase in the traffic. I would like the Minister to tell us whether he can assure us that  areas such as the bypass for Newcastle will be available in the 1993 year. It will certainly be of assistance. The bypass of Raymond Terrace, the bypass of the mountain at Bulahdelah and the bypass of Taree city are very important factors, so far as the Pacific Highway is concerned. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was only the other day that the New South Wales Deputy Premier, the Minister for Public Works and the Minister for Roads, Mr Murray, intimated that there would be a dual carriageway up the Pacific Highway. That was the aim of the New South Wales Government. I am sure that it is the aim of the Commonwealth Labor Government too, and it will certainly be ours. I think that is one of the major routes within Australia that we ought to complete as soon as we can. I would have liked to say something about the railway. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I am moving an amendment to reduce by $10 the allocation to the Department of Transport and Communications as an instruction to the Government to appoint for one year only the balance of the board members of the Australian Broadcasting Authority, which commenced this week&mdash;only three members have been appointed, but there is an allocation under the Act for up to 7 members&mdash;and to bring forward legislation to implement the development of an open and competitive subscription broadcasting industry in this country, that is, pay TV, which has long been delayed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went into some detail earlier in the evening about why I believe this matter ought to be dealt with by the Government with some expedition. The Senate Select Committee on Subscription Television Broadcasting Services recently reported, but we are still waiting. We are none the wiser of what the Government is proposing to do and certainly about the impact on revenue. It is appropriate, as we debate these Appropriation Bills, for this matter to be raised at this point. I go into some detail about some of the elements of the pay TV policy that ought to be exhibited. The key element is that all licenses ought to be issued at the same time with no preferential position for any particular players, no exclusivity period. Also, we should not be mandating technology; we should not try to guess the future. We should allow operators to determine the best technologies that they believe will provide the optimum service to consumers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The estimates now before the Committee straddle by far the most important and sensitive political issue of the time&mdash;that is, the issue of employment. There is no doubt from Question Time today that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has a few views on employment. This side of the chamber will be absolutely delighted, in a political sense, if the focus of the Australian public between now and the next Federal election is very much on the issues of employment and unemployment, because it will enable all of us on this side of the chamber to remind the Australian public of just what a dreadful legacy of long term unemployment the administration of the former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, and the present Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland, has given to this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week there were a number of very sobering reports on the unemployment situation released to the Australian public. By far the most important of those was that released by the National Institute of Labour Studies, which is based at Flinders University. What that document indicated was the very sobering prospect that this country could have a long term unemployed level approaching 500,000 people by the middle of the current decade. In other words, we could be facing, without any argument, the worst outlook for long term unemployed that this country has faced since the years of the Great Depression in the 1930s. That is the sobering unemployment statistic that the Government would like the Australian public to forget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the Prime Minister that he should forget all his phoney rhetoric about the formal charter of the Reserve Bank of Australia. That will not save him from the wrath of the Australian people. What really matters is something that all of us understand as parents&mdash;that is, it is not what we say, it is what we do. It is the example that we demonstrate to our children that really matters so far as the responsibility of parenthood is concerned. So it is with a government. It is not what a government says about employment that is important; it is what a government does about employment that is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no argument that this Government, over the time that it has been in office, has delivered to the Australian people the worst postwar legacy of long term unemployment imaginable&mdash;a level of long term unemployed that I do not believe even the harshest critics of this Government would have imagined possible even three or four years ago. Anybody who has examined Budget Statement No. 2 that was brought down only two months ago must have been struck by the comparison between the fate of the middle aged and older unemployed in Australia in this recession and that in the recession 10 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) and many other Government members in the chamber know very well the real thing that they will have to answer to all of those marginal seat voters&mdash;and they can take all the comfort in the world they like from the fact that they have allegedly shored up their base in the Victorian election. As every member in this chamber knows, elections are won or lost according to what people do in marginal seats, not according to what people do in their safe, traditional seats. The people of Victoria, in all of those marginal seats, delivered absolutely ferocious rebukes in Melbourne to the colleagues of those opposite, and when they have an opportunity they will deliver exactly the same rebuke to those opposite at a Federal level. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very consistent. I will be so consistent that I will remind the Minister for Family Support that 10 years ago, when Bob Hawke led the Labor Party, he said that anybody who presides over a higher level of unemployment than 6 per cent deserves to be thrown out of government. That is what he said 10 years ago. When Hawke launched the Labor Party's campaign in 1981, he said, `This Government deserves'&mdash;referring to the former government&mdash;`to be thrown out because of the level of unemployment that it has presided over'. So if those on the Government side want to be consistent they will acknowledge that the same rebuke will be administered to them at the next election that was administered 10 years ago&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister can interject and he can talk about Queensland as much as he likes. I could talk about Queensland too, on occasions, as the Minister knows. But I would far rather talk to those on the Government side about the thing that absolutely obsesses and dominates the concern of every Australian family, and that is job security. Those opposite know, as well as I do, that the reason this economy is not taking off&mdash;despite what the Prime Minister said today the Australian economy is not taking off&mdash;and the reason we are still in recession, is that the approximately 90 per cent of the Australian people who are in work comprise a large number of people who are dead scared that they will not be in work next week. Until that expectation is turned around and until those opposite lift the Damoclean sword of potential unemployment from the heads of hundreds of thousands of Australian men and women, there is not going to be an economic recovery in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to see it lifted just as much as anybody on the other side of the chamber. None of us takes any joy in the fact that we have such a large level of unemployment. But do not let anybody in this chamber imagine, with all the rhetoric and noise, and the hype and propaganda under the sun, that when it comes down to the wire at the next election, the verdict of the Australian people overwhelmingly is going to be delivered on the issue of unemployment. They are going to ask themselves whether they ought to return the man who boasted about giving them a recession that caused that high unemployment. That unambiguously will be the most important question that will be asked at the next election. That will be the question that all of us on this side of the chamber will be asking as we go around the marginal seats, particularly in Queensland. Queensland is going to be a very important State indeed in the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately all of those on the Government side will be called to account and will have to explain how it is that they can expect the Australian people to return to the highest office in this land a man who, firstly, boasted about the measure of economic control. Has the present Prime Minister been trying to tell us for years that he has been struggling against that tyrant Bob Hawke who wanted to impose this ferocious monetary policy and that he, the present Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland, has been begging him to adopt different policies? No, he does not do that. He boasts about the way in which he controlled the affairs of government when he was Treasurer. He boasted about how he had the Reserve Bank in his pocket. He boasted about how he had his hands on the levers. He boasted about how he gave us the recession we had to have. He said that if he had been a finance Minister in Europe they would have lit candles in cathedrals in his honour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell those opposite that there will not be many of the one million unemployed who will light candles in cathedrals in his honour. He ought to hang his head in shame for the damage he has done. Let me say to my friends opposite: do not take any hyped up comfort in what might be said in hyperbole at Question Time. The grim, cold, harsh electoral reality of this place, and the grim, cold, harsh electoral reality of the Australian public is that those opposite are staring in the face the worst long term unemployed disaster this country has seen since the years of the Great Depression, and there is no real sign of that improving. I hope it improves, and that every man and woman in this chamber ought to hope that it improves. But that, my friends opposite, and that alone is the single most important issue that will obsess the Australian people between now and the next election. Anybody on the other side of the chamber who believes that he can inject issues of greater importance than that is really deluding himself. As we get closer to the wire, and all of us on this side of the chamber are looking forward to the day of political judgment by the Australian people, they will want to know more and more, `Why should I vote for the man who boasted about making us miserable?', because that is, in essence, what those opposite are asking the Australian people to do in asking them to return the present Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was, amongst that contribution of political predictions from a person with very questionable credentials in that field, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), and the usual diatribe against the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), one accurate statement, that this particular portfolio does straddle the crucial question of employment in this country. Whilst he did not address that issue at all and relate it to this portfolio, there is accuracy in that because this is an area of fundamental difference between the parties. Those opposite have very soundly told the Australian electorate that their aim in the area of training and education is to basically say to young people that for $3 or $3.50 an hour they have salvation; that there is nothing further required; that there is no need for training; that basically there is no need to go beyond that, and simply slashing wages and forcing people into those sorts of conditions will accomplish everything for this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few other people have tended to disagree with this view. Others have said that we have more to learn from the examples of Germany than from the honourable member for Bennelong. It was interesting to note an article by Andrew McCathie in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 24 July which perhaps puts the issue a bit differently from the honourable member for Bennelong, when Mr McCathie said of Germany:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . vocational training courses in Germany are the result of direct co-operation between the private sector and the Government, and go to the heart of the country's economic and political system of co-operation between unions, employers and government.</PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, he commented of Germany:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The apprenticeship scheme has developed in post-war Germany to such a degree that the concept of entering the workforce without undertaking some form of formal training or for that matter, employing someone who has not reached a particular level of training, is alien in Germany.</PARA>
<PARA>So there is, as the previous honourable member said, a very distinct policy difference in this portfolio area. There is, on the one hand, the attitude of those opposite to the employer giving somebody a paintbrush or a piece of paper or something, which is adequate training for a work force that is changing in a society where the very jobs that people have everyday are changing, with technology wiping out particular sectors, and the whole nature of work is changing in this country. But that is not of interest to those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have, in contrast to the honourable member for Bennelong, the Carmichael inquiry which said that this country has to do something about this field. It looked at the gains under the current Government, the very great gains in retention rates which are clearly not simply more people staying on because of the current unemployment pattern. We all know, apart from those who try to use it as a political kind of tool, that there has been a very clear increase in the number of people staying to year 12. It was the aim of that inquiry to go beyond the improvements that have been gained under this Government from the 1960s when only one-third of the population finished high school to a situation now where two-thirds do. That inquiry wants to go beyond that. At the same time it advocates that, whereas in Australia only 20 per cent of people after the post-compulsory section do any vocational training, we should aim to be like a country such as Germany where the figure has reached 80 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That inquiry, which has had the support of significant employer sectors, went on to say that we should look at the apprenticeship schemes in this country, that they are too narrow, that they exist in very limited fields and that, as a result, they discriminate against females. It said that we should move towards national standards and that there should be a compulsory year of vocational training after year 12. They are some of the proposals that the Carmichael inquiry has come forward with and some of the measures being funded by this Government in this portfolio area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish particularly to talk about one area of the education budget which is crucial to my electorate, the question of English language training. Under this Government in the last year, we have seen a clear re-emphasis on English language skills. Independent concessional family entrance to this country now has attached to it in 99 of the occupations&mdash;that is, 11 per cent of the total number of occupations for which people can get points&mdash;a clear and emphatic requirement for the English language. That applies in areas such as education, health, transport and engineering. The fact that we will stipulate that larger sections of the intake must be able to speak English will have a crucial impact on the degree to which English language training will be required in this country. That matter is mentioned in the Budget Papers. It will decrease training costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to notice in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> last week an article by Michael Millett which talked about the big downturn in the number of business migrants. We know that the Government, in reaction to the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee, brought down a new set of requirements in regard to business migration to the effect that people, rather than just bringing money into this country, had to have long term credentials of business experience in particular fields; that they would not qualify merely on the basis of having got $1m the morning before from their grandfather. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another stipulation that was brought in in relation to business migration was the ability to speak English. So a larger number of migrants to this country will meet the English language requirement. That, of course, will decrease the training cost. At the same time, there has been an unfortunate failure to concentrate on those sectors of the migrant population that lack the ability to speak English. As I said earlier, that is crucial to my electorate. The high unemployment levels, particularly in the municipality of Auburn, are very definitely related to the high Turkish and Arabic speaking population in that electorate. It has been quite obvious for some time that people kicked out of the work force by the rampant technological changes and by tariff policies are finding it very difficult to be re-employed. That clearly relates to the very long term unemployment in that sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Budget provides for expenditure of $317m over five years to overcome the language barriers. Of that sum, approximately one-half will go to English language tuition and a little over one-half will go towards income support. A very clear change has been made in this Budget in regard to the adult migrant English language program. The suppliers will be required in the future to put greater emphasis on people who lack functional English and those who clearly need the skills to enter the job market, whereas up to now private suppliers have been oriented towards giving greater proficiency to professionals from other countries who would seek to utilise those skills in the fields in which they are trained or to gain higher skills in this country. That is, of course, necessary, but there is an understanding of the role of the English language in the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be a transfer over five years to 1996-97 of $100m to DEET for controlled labour market programs. In that period a fairly significant figure of 38,000 job seekers will be assisted by this change. It is a crucial change in this Budget. It is necessary that we move away from the past attitudes that we had to supply English training only to those who did not speak functional English. I am pleased to see that in this Budget there is a re-emphasis on giving people skills that make them employable again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of significance is that of expenditure in higher education. There has been a series of increases in regard to the capital works program in higher education&mdash;$20m announced in the employment statement, another $20m in One Nation and $21.5m in the November 1991 economic statement. That will have an impact on the University of Western Sydney, which is partially within the Reid electorate. I note that $2.5m will go to student amenities at Campbelltown, and funding will be provided for the conversion of the music office at Milperra and additions to the computer centre at Milperra. There is a significant allocation for the University of Western Sydney, an institution advocated by this side of the chamber to make up for the failure of the previous Liberal State Government in New South Wales, which placed the Macquarie University in a rather unfortunate position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On a theme associated with that dealt with by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), as I have said many times before in this place, education in Australia remains at the crossroads in terms of content, quality, policy direction, administration and, of course, its dependence on a funding linchpin with its attendant degrees of governmental control, once again, I regret to say, reflected in the Budget Papers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government in general and its education Ministers in particular have fallen down in many of these areas, at the same time, unfortunately, injecting a degree of unparalleled governmental control and political ideology into a policy area which should rise above party politics. Those Ministers once again stand condemned for their ideological push at the expense of quality standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably for this nation, their ministries remain some of the most political in the Federal arena. Meanwhile, basic national literary and numeracy standards are certainly not improving. Whilst for good reasons many of us have concentrated in this place on the technicalities of Australia's economic ills in the short to medium term, there is little doubt that an increasing consensus is emerging not just that the key to our future prosperity lies in the radical economic reform processes that are necessary if we are to get this nation back on an even economic keel, but that our future prosperity lies in large part in the proper education and the basic training of our youth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to think that the old ocker image that ignorance was blessed is disappearing and that the days are over when two out of every three of our teenagers dropped out before finishing school and went off to work. However, that ability to work has taken on catastrophic dimensions in recent years as a result of this Government's economic failures, with at least one in three of our 15- to 19-year-olds out of work and many ill-prepared and ill-educated to enter a work force which has to be increasingly clever if we are to climb out of our rut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is little in the Budget Papers which alters my view that we remain in danger of degenerating into a nation of educational, professional and commercial mediocrity unless we lift our game in economic, social and political terms. This Government's policies for higher education continue the funding arrangements described by the Industry Commission as `fatally flawed'. Despite its vast spending spree announced in the Budget Papers, the Government cannot provide the places needed for qualified students and refuses to give the institutions the freedom which allows them to create places. For example, while the proposed open learning program will provide opportunities for some who have been deprived to date, it will not address the unmet demand, and serious questions remain over its quality. I am sure that the remark made by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in his Budget Speech that every Australian with access to a television and a letter box now has access to a university education will come back to haunt him over and over again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His disregard of the requirements for a quality university education is well known, but this appalling denigration of what a university education really means will disgust, and has disgusted, many in higher education. The concentration of scarce resources in the hands of one university will do irreparable harm to the other established distance education centres at the University of New England, Charles Sturt University, the University of Southern Queensland in my electorate, the University of Central Queensland, the University of South Australia, Deakin University and the Western Australian distance education centre consortium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, this Government does not appear to recognise that the capital cities in our nation do not have a monopoly on quality tertiary education. As Professor Barry Leal, the Vice-Chancellor of USQ, said earlier this year:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a tradition in Australia that everything of the best in education is found in big capital cities, but this is just an Australian phenomenon . . . You haven't got to look far at all to see that some of the best universities overseas are smaller, regional universities.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say, if I can be parochial:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in Toowoomba we can develop a regional university that is not inferior to anything in the capital cities.</PARA>
<PARA>Seemingly, that view is not shared by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) in these Budget Papers. I refer to some correspondence between Professor Leal and Mr Baldwin from which I will quote, in part. The letter to Mr Baldwin states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the latest position which the Commonwealth has taken with regard to capital funding for higher education institutions. The reason for this correspondence is to make you fully aware of the impact which the Commonwealth's new arrangements will have on this institution, which is the lowest funded per capita of any of Australia's universities. Without risk of overstating the point, the new arrangements are potentially disastrous for the development of the University of Southern Queensland. The situation can be summarised as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The Commonwealth had previously indicated to the University of Southern Queensland that it had a strong chance of being successful in 1994 and in 1996 for grant submissions of $12m and $8m respectively to fund the construction of a much needed Technologies Building for this campus. With the timing of the proposed roll-in of capital funding the possibility of receiving these lump sum grants is now lost. This is a major blow to the development of this University and could seriously limit the University's course developments in the important areas of Engineering and Computing. It also means that other severe accommodation problems will not be solved by the flow-on effect of having a major new building for the technologies. We are very concerned that the Commonwealth has not sought to compensate this institution in any way for this major set-back, and indeed has treated the institution in a most unfavourable manner in all aspects of the implementation of its capital funding programme.</PARA>

He said that employment was one of the most important things that will be before the electorate at the next Federal election. I was disappointed that he did not offer us any discussion or expansion on what the coalition intends to do on employment. I totally agree that that will be the major issue at the Federal election. The electorate will be looking to see whether the Government or the coalition offers them the most hope for the future.</PARA></TALK.START>

At times the honourable member did his old trick: he pointed at different marginal members on the Government back benches and made threats that they will not be back. I remember that, when he was Leader of the Opposition, when those sorts of threats were directed to somebody, they were taken as a badge of honour. Those sorts of threats usually guarantee that those members come back with even greater majorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian electorate would like to know what the coalition will do to promote job growth. When we look at the Fightback package, we see that there are very few answers. It appears that the application of a new tax, a GST, in some magical way will promote employment growth. When the honourable member for Bennelong speaks at the National Press Club tomorrow about industrial relations, will he try to give us the linkage between what is said in Fightback and how the coalition will create and promote job growth? Quite frankly, I do not think it is likely, whenever he goes before the Press Club to announce the industrial relations policy of the coalition&mdash;I am now reliably informed that it may not be tomorrow&mdash;that he will be able to assist in exposing how the new industrial relations policy from the ultra right think-tanks who are advising the coalition will assist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, the Government will go to the people with policies in the One Nation statement made earlier this year and policies in the Budget, which is under discussion. These policies indicate a commitment to getting the Australian economy going and putting in place employment growth without endangering the type of reform that has been taking place. This will ensure that, in the future, we will not have the problems we have at present because of past policy errors. When people talk about the lack of endeavour and the lack of commitment in creating a skilled work force, they are surely not talking about this Government, because that is something on which this Government has a good track record. It has, most definitely, put in place a whole series of reforms with the purpose of ensuring that the Australian work force is better skilled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the northern region of Melbourne, if we look at what has happened over recent years through the cooperation of the now departed State Labor Government and this Federal Government, we see that there has been quite a great change. For instance, servicing the electorate of Scullin are now two new campuses of the Northern Metropolitan College of TAFE. These are initiatives that Labor governments can point proudly to. The Epping campus, which opened earlier this year and which has continuing works going on to the extent of about $14.7m, offers a range of training programs that meet the needs of the local area. At the moment new facilities in building, engineering and rural studies on this campus are being completed so that those aspects of training will be available to local residents by the start of next year. There will be further facilities to open up horticulture&mdash;industrial skills programs, at a cost of $2.9m&mdash;on this campus. These courses have been developed through the cooperation not only of the TAFE system with government but of the TAFE system with government and local industry. That is the reality that we see in the way that this Government goes about putting in place these types of programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time in my electorate the Greensborough campus of the Northern Metropolitan College of TAFE opened for business this semester. This facility was constructed at a cost of $9.8m and when it is fully operational will include applied science, electronics, business and other general studies courses. These are two local facilities that now meet the needs of the local community and what it has been seeking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This contrasts with years of neglect in the expansion of the TAFE system under previous coalition governments. I now turn to the Phillip Institute of Technology, which has now merged with RMIT and the new institution has been given university status. At the Bundoora campus, which is in the electorate of Scullin, the RMIT is about to launch fully its technology transfer, manufacturing industry and technology courses. In doing so it has fortuitously been able to purchase the regional office of Melbourne Water. This is to be refurbished at a total cost of $4m of which the Federal Government has put forward $2.6m from One Nation capital funding that has been brought forward. This sees the return of an engineering faculty to the northern suburbs. It is interesting to see that at a time when there is greater competition between universities La Trobe is now putting in place its engineering facilities. So, whereas two or three years ago there were absolutely no engineering faculties, we now have a choice of two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another pleasing aspect of RMIT is that it has been able to gain funding for an advanced engineering centre. It will manage this in conjunction with the University of Melbourne. Again, this is an important project for which the Federal Government has put $2.1m towards establishment costs and will put $500,000 a year for operating costs. This is another example of government, educational institutions and industry being able to work together in partnership for things that are very positive for Australia's future and very positive in ensuring that Australia's manufacturing base has a solid and sustainable future. This centre will assist industries to develop world competitive practices and, with the expertise of the people who work at those institutions who can work more directly with industry, that will be of a very positive nature. It will also look to attract other educational partners to improve programs of a postgraduate nature for students. It will also put in place courses that have a practical side to them that can be conducted from the shop floor level so that people in their employment can further their professional level of skills. It will also establish a very fine information base for those manufacturing technology concerns. It is something that is exciting; it is something that is required if Australia is to go through the type of structural reform that is necessary to ensure that employment growth is sustainable in the future. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak tonight about unemployment, particularly as it affects my electorate of Warringah but more generally as it affects the Government's efforts to bring under control this most pressing and vexing question which faces so many people in Australia. It is fair to say that the Government has given priority attention to youth unemployment, and I guess we all understand that. But, in effect and in fact, business people and community leaders in Warringah have recognised very clearly that a high level of long term unemployment, irrespective of age, is the major social problem. It is very understandable that people should concentrate on youth unemployment. After all, they are the people who will be leading us in terms of the work force and providing the taxation needed to look after the ever increasing number of older people in the community in future. But in the medium term those people who have the most trouble in obtaining employment are not the youth; they are those older than the youths, and the middle aged. Not only do they have more problems in obtaining employment once they have lost it, but also they are the ones that in many cases have most of the responsibilities within the community.</PARA></TALK.START>

These are the ones that have the most difficulty in obtaining employment under the present circumstances, and these are the ones who are suffering most. These make up the majority of the long term unemployed. They constitute a most serious social problem which has not been properly addressed by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I brought this to the attention of my electorate earlier this year in a more sharpened sense, people within the electorate responded by joining me in setting up an employment task force. This Warringah employment task force consists of business people, people from the CES and from the Department of Social Security, from educational institutions and from the churches. What we determined to do was not to try to solve Australia's unemployment problems in Warringah; we had to work with the programs that were in place. What we found very early on was that a whole heap of employers simply did not know the range of assistance that was available through government agencies at both the Federal and State level to assist them in employing more people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Warringah employment task force has attempted to bring home to potential employers within my electorate just what assistance is available at present. We all understand that we are not going to get out of this mess until we get a change of government and of economic direction. But while we have to suffer the continuation of this Government we have to work within the confines that are available to us at present and work within those programs that are presently available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that Australia faces a very long haul out of the recession that we had to have, the Prime Minister's recession. Let nobody ever forget that. This Government, which has now been in office since 1983, cannot say that this was something left to it and that it is working its way through it. This is an economic recession that it, solely, brought upon this country&mdash;and the hundreds of thousands, in fact approaching one million, unemployed in this country should sheet that home directly to this present Labor Government and to the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland, the present Prime Minister. He cannot escape that responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the situation in New South Wales at the present time. The ABS labour force statistics show that in New South Wales in July 1991, 24 per cent, or 59,000 people, had been out of work for more than a year. Twelve months later, in July 1992, this had increased to 38 per cent, or 111,000 people. Those are the long term unemployed&mdash;people who have been out of work for more than a year. Despite the suggestions by some that unemployment may have bottomed in Australia as a whole, and also in New South Wales, it certainly continues to get worse in my electorate. I will give honourable members some local statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Dee Why regional office of the CES, over the two years to August 1992 unemployment increased from 799 to 2,878. Similarly, at the Manly regional office, over the same two years, unemployment increased from 595 to 1,610. In fact, it increased in 23 of those 24 months and is still increasing. This is the reality of the situation that we face in Australia at present. It is the situation that I face in my electorate of Warringah and it is the situation which all members of this Parliament face in their own electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that there seems to be no real fresh thinking on the part of the Government in relation to how we can deal with this problem. One of the most dispiriting aspects of the current debate about unemployment, it seems to me, is the sheer absence of intellectual activity brought to bear on what the future holds. We have the same tired old formulas being repeated by the Government. We have these schemes which, I have to say, in their particularity offer some assistance to those who have employment to offer the unemployed. There is no doubt that some of the schemes can make a marked difference to those people in the community who can offer jobs to the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in reality, in the longer term, there is no fresh thinking from the Government&mdash;no attempt to come to terms with the fact that we are, as some people would say, in a post-industrial world. I do not know of any clear direction from the Government which would suggest that it has any concept of the role Australia can play into the next century in terms of its membership of the industrialised world. I fear very greatly for the fact that some people are accepting too easily the concept that we will have a fairly large pool of unemployed and that there is nothing that we can do about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When looking at the question of employment, or unemployment, it seems to me that we have a huge social problem not only on our doorstep but also very much in the process of gestation. We are now getting into a situation, <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">particularly in certain parts of New South Wales and other parts of Australia, where we have second or third generation unemployed people, children of families whose parents have been unemployed and whose grandparents have been unemployed.

Unless we start looking at these questions and at what we can do in Australia as a post-industrial society, we will face ever-increasing social disruption as more and more of our people come from families who have never known anything else but dependency on social security payouts. That is a concept which horrifies me and which I would suggest should horrify any thinking member of this Parliament. </PARA>

Our Government knows that the key to providing a sustainable improvement in the employment position is to encourage investment in industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through One Nation and the 1992 Budget, this Labor Government is working to stimulate growth and create job opportunities. Our training initiatives will improve the skills of the Australian work force and give young people a better start in life. Labor's unemployment support, which includes a range of labour market programs, will help people get jobs. The Opposition, on the other hand, proposes to remove many of the foundation stones of our labour market and make it tougher for people who are unemployed. And as if that is not bad enough, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) proposes to hit people with a 15 per cent consumption tax and push up their cost of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Keating Government is expanding labour market programs to help the unemployed. Funding has increased from $598m in the 1991-92 Budget to $1,150m in 1992-93. This will provide direct assistance to more than 420,000 job seekers. The 1992 Budget built on the February 1992 One Nation statement and the July 1992 national employment and training plan for young Australians to provide additional funding for Jobstart, Jobskills, the Office of Labour Market Adjustment, pre-vocational training places and related student income support, training schemes for apprentices with small- and medium-sized businesses, local capital works and accredited training courses. On top of this, the Government is offering more skilled training opportunities, including $36m to expand apprentice and trainee opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one compares the education and training policies of this Labor Government with those of the coalition, one realises that there are many elements of the Opposition's policy which radically change, cut and damage Labor's balance of training choice and opportunity. For instance, the Opposition would abolish the Commonwealth Employment Service and contract out employment placement functions. Under a coalition government, the role of the Department of Social Security would be only policing eligibility for benefit, not actively helping Australians to get jobs. Blue collar workers in particular would be left without any assistance. Private employment agencies would not be interested in them as they would be unlikely to rush into providing job placements for the most disadvantaged workers, so many people would lose their access to help. Those who do use private services would, however, have to pay fees, including the GST. Private agencies charge a placement fee of 10 to 20 per cent of the employee's annual salary. This fee would also attract a 15 per cent GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition would spend only $350m on labour market programs. This is a cut of $140m from the base figures used in Fightback, and a cut of $400m from the Government's planned expenditure on programs including Jobstart, Jobtrain and the self-employment assistance program. This 35 per cent reduction would be equivalent to 150,000 fewer places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year Skillshare will help 117,000 unemployed people. It is one of the most successful community-based programs ever funded by the Commonwealth Government. The Opposition says that under a coalition government `there will be an increasing requirement over the decade for Skillshare groups to become self-sufficient'. The Opposition would not abolish Skillshare immediately; it would just starve it of funding over a decade. Local employment boards would take the place of Skillshare. These boards would lack the coordination of a national scheme and would depend on community volunteers, which would be particularly worrying for small and provincial communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The self-employment assistance program will cost the Government $44m this year. The program helps unemployed people start their own businesses and has a very high success rate. In a most recent survey, 91 per cent of respondents were still employed a year after doing the program. This program helps people who have a lot of personal initiative but who are unable to get jobs in their community. This encouragement of entrepreneurial skills should fit well with the Liberals' philosophy and their voluntary local employment board idea, but the Opposition would axe that plan completely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's proposed rules for unemployed people are supposed to save $745m by taking unemployment benefits from some 90,000 people: 40,000 people who have been on Job Search allowance for less than nine months would go under stricter and more stringent work tests and 50,000 would go at the nine-month point. The Leader of the Opposition says his computer model would lead to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the creation of around 2 million soundly based jobs&mdash;enough to halve the rate of unemployment by the end of the decade</PARA>
<PARA>He calls this his `high road scenario'. However, this `high road' model includes an inflation rate of more than 12 per cent. High inflation would lead to an increase in interest rates which would mean higher, not lower, unemployment. What the Leader of the Opposition does not say about this model is that it does not even make any provision for the impact on the economy of his proposed goods and services tax. Furthermore, the Leader of the Opposition has admitted that two million jobs is only a guess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most frightening aspects of the Opposition's policies for unemployed people is the proposal to cut the Job Search allowance after nine months. The Leader of the Opposition would have us believe that this would result in a saving of some $755m and take 90,000 people off the Job Search allowance. However, the Department of Finance believes these savings are overestimated by $500m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A coalition government would increase the waiting period for Job Search allowance and sickness allowance and decrease the savings threshold for families from $10,000 to $5,000. There would be no four-week maximum waiting period. Unemployed workers would have to use all leave entitlements before receiving unemployment benefits and retrenchment payments would be run down at the rate of 80 per cent of average weekly earnings per week. This would have a dramatic effect on people who lose their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Youth unemployment is an issue which is close to my heart and it is certainly an issue of great concern to all Labor members of parliament. However, youth unemployment figures in Australia are cynically abused and inflated by the Leader of the Opposition and the coalition who say, `One in three of our young people are unemployed'. This is the number of young people who are unemployed as a percentage of those actually in the labour force; but the majority of young people are not in the labour force, they are in education or training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor Government policies have seen a revolution in education and training among our young people. Now 72 per cent of young people between 15 and 19 years of age are in some form of education or training. Secondary retention rates increased from 34 per cent to 72 per cent between 1980 and 1991. The overall rate of unemployment among all people under 20 is between 10 per cent and 11 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has proposed a youth wage of $3 or $3.50 an hour for workers between the ages of 15 and 20. Many young people would be worse off on a wage of $114 or $130 a week than they are on unemployment benefits, so the incentive to work would be destroyed. Worse still, the youth wage proposed by the Opposition does not guarantee training. Young people could be employed on these wages for five years and still have no quality training for a future job. There would be nothing to stop employers regularly replacing those who turn 18 with younger workers on lower wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition also proposes to abolish the training guarantee levy which encourages larger employers to train their workers. It applies only where an employer does not otherwise meet a reasonable specified training commitment. This adds to productivity because workers are better skilled and are therefore better workers. The abolition of the training guarantee levy would remove the current compulsory training measures. In 1991, only $3m was paid out as a consequence of the TGL penalties. This shows massive support for the TGL across all industry sectors&mdash;yet the Opposition wants it scrapped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Government has a firm commitment to education. Between 1988 and 1994 the education budget will have increased from $3.3 billion to $4.5 billion in real terms, creating an additional 85,000 places. With the extra places Labor has created in higher education&mdash;our $720m in extra technical and further education funding in the One Nation statement; the historic agreement with the States on TAFE&mdash;it is obvious that this Labor Government has significantly broadened access to education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition has no commitment to educational planning, no vision for Australian education and no understanding of the public good served by education. Coalition policy would return us to the days when getting a good education depended on the size of one's bank account rather than one's ability and enthusiasm for studying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes equality of educational opportunity is possible only through a market approach to schooling: letting parents choose schools for their children. However, this assumes that all parents have equal ability and access to information to make informed choices and that the competition helps all schools. It is obvious, however, that schools serving educationally disadvantaged students would suffer without special assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, Labor believes government should ensure minimum standards and provide the opportunity for excellence through a dual system of education which supports both government and non-government schools on the basis of need.

If we add these special children and we reach at least 80 per cent of the student population, one can only wonder about the remaining 20 per cent which, by definition, must be made up entirely of middle and upper class white Anglo-Saxon males. It sometimes seems to me that the progressive education attitudes of our teacher union bureaucrats and our education system bureaucrats have reached a crescendo of high farce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our general acceptance of a child-centred approach to education is dedicated towards achievement of social justice outcomes of uniformity of results rather than uniformity of opportunity. Uniformity of opportunity for a specially gifted child will likely require different mechanisms than those employed in teaching a child classified as educationally disadvantaged. We do not hesitate at the latter but we seem quite frightened of the former. In 1988 Professor Brian Start of the University of Melbourne observed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The gifted will produce far more than they consume. This country has an enviable record of caring for the disabled. But let's face it, the cure for Down's Syndrome won't be coming from a child with that problem. But it may come from one of these gifted children. They are our greatest national resource.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with Professor Start, but many do not. In April 1991 Anne Morrow, whilst still Chief Executive of the Ministry of Education and Training in Victoria, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The point is that we are trying to make our classrooms not only places where learning is valued and achievement and performance is valued, but also where the environment is fair to everybody who is in that classroom, not a technically defined group that occupies a third of the seats or one per cent of the seats.</PARA>
<PARA>It has been my observation that the bureaucratic rhetoric translates in practice, at least in my home State of Victoria, so that the poorest achievers are encouraged and helped to approximate the results of those in the middle and that those at the top are left to fend for themselves. We have well and truly flattened the bell curve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our Victoria Premier of three days ago, Joan Kirner, was, as Joan Hood, a gifted child. It is reported that at 16 she was the youngest ever entrant to the University of Melbourne. But as the architect of our now infamous Victorian Certificate of Education she has been quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am concerned that the individual must not be separated from social roots and personal development because a person can't be bright if they can't be socially adaptable.</PARA>
<PARA>She has described education as the pursuit of excellence for all, but is bitterly opposed to some children receiving a more academically concentrated education than others. An editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 8 July 1991 concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But for the sake of all school children&mdash;from the precocious to the plodding&mdash;there must be a return to the liberal, humanist tradition according to which the brighter members of all social classes could hope to better themselves through their ability and industry. That is the tradition of the truly progressive for whom elitism in education is not an ideological anathema but an aspiration.</PARA>
<PARA>In both ideology and practice the former Premier of Victoria and the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> are light years apart. The Senate Select Committee on the Education of Gifted and Talented Children in its report in March 1988 stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee refutes the suggestion that talented students will automatically fulfil their potential, unaided. Studies of high achievers nearly always point to the influence of supportive individuals or institutions. Research indicates that there are many gifted children who under-achieve.</PARA>
<PARA>New South Wales under Virginia Chadwick is making a real effort to give our talented children an equal opportunity. Victoria is not. Commitment to our talented youth in other States is quite variable. But there is no national direction or effort either in support of the gifted and talented or an assessment of students' individual abilities or achievements. In a national sense we have no idea where we stand in the world in terms of education outcomes generally or, more specifically, our standards of achievement in literacy and numeracy. Professor Start commented in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 27 October 1990:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When a scientist is confronted with conflict between theory and data he revises the theory. In education in Australia we stopped collecting data.</PARA>
<PARA>It is to our national shame that we have no mechanisms in place to either determine our level of education outcomes generally or the capacity of individuals separately so that we can treat them as individuals. I believe that we need national assessment of critical key competencies at various stages throughout the school cycle to help guide us in raising our national standards. I also believe that we need rigorous assessment of individuals' capacity, capability and achievement so that teachers can assist each to higher results. </PARA>

Without special recognition and attention they are unlikely to achieve their full potential. It is our view that the Labor Government has enforced mediocrity upon our schools and actively discouraged gifted children from realising their potential. Current programs for gifted and talented children are not nationally coordinated, and it seems clear that the Commonwealth should play a significant leadership role in this area. </PARA>

It is an absolute disgrace for this Parliament here at this stage after it has been told various things by the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), now the Prime Minister of this country. I want to go back and read some of those comments into the record of this House. In the 1988-89 Budget the honourable member for Blaxland said this:</PARA>

When we go to the conclusion of the next Budget Speech in 1989-90 we heard:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the Government's economic policies Australia will emerge from the recent high level of spending without a recession and with its economic and social structure improving.</PARA>
<PARA>How on earth could a person, who is now the Prime Minister, say that the social structure was improving when unemployment was on the rise and is continuing to rise at this stage?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly working to put hundreds and thousands of young and middle-aged people out of work. That is what is working in this country.

The absolute disgrace about this is that here we have a country that is fabulously wealthy in resources and has the capacity to use those resources. Yet the Government has failed to put in place a structure, an economic framework, in which employment can be created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) there is no doubt that a plan, a well coordinated structure, has been put forward to the Australian people that does not have a dead end approach to it in regard to training.

Yet if we go to down to the CES office and look at the list of jobs available and the skills that are required and go through the people who are unemployed, we find that there are already hundreds of people with those skills who cannot get jobs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this country there is far too little recognition nowadays of the fundamental, one could say primary, role of this Parliament and of an Australian Government to provide for the defence of Australia. There is far too little debate also in Australia about the security environment within which we in Australia live and the need for us to continue to take very seriously the process of providing for the effective defence of Australia at a time when the Cold War has come to an end and we are seeing the world break into a more multipolar arrangement and, as a result, an arrangement which, whilst welcome in terms of the end of the Cold War, creates a very unpredictable and uncertain environment within which we all have to live.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in those circumstances that we on this side of the chamber believe there still remains a very strong case for Australia to retain a substantial Defence Force and, indeed, to improve the combat capability of that Defence Force. It disturbs me, though, that too much of the defence debate nowadays is simply taken up by peripheral issues such as the debate within the Labor Party over whether there should be homosexuality in the Defence Force or whether there should not be, an issue which fills the columns of newspapers but which I have to say is not what one would describe as of fundamental importance to the future defence and security of this nation. Yet it seems to be the beginning and the end of the defence debate in Australia, and that is to me a matter of real concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In this Budget we have a government, as usual, blowing its trumpet, claiming that as far as defence is concerned the Opposition's position as outlined in the Fightback plan will be some sort of great disaster for Australia but that Labor has this wonderful program. In reality, it is worth having a look at what the Government is in fact talking about. The first point to note is that this Budget foreshadows an ongoing cut to defence spending of $50m a year for each year from 1993 to 1994 onwards. There is no attempt to identify where those cuts will take place, and no effort is made to indicate when this process of reducing spending each year by $50m will end. The logical conclusion at the moment is that these cuts will go until there is no defence expenditure at all, although presumably that is not the real position of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in fact the effect of these cuts which the Labor Party is now proposing is to further undermine the Government's own defence strategy which is built on the foundation of the 1987 Defence White Paper. The fact is that the defence strategy outlined in that outdated document called for something like 3 per cent of GDP to be spent on defence. Defence spending has fallen way below that 3 per cent target so, just in terms of the relevance of the White Paper today, setting aside the total change in the global strategic environment since it was produced, the fact is that that 3 per cent figure which was regarded in those days as essential to the strategy of the White Paper is not being achieved. In fact, the prospect is that every year from 1993-94 onwards a further $50m will be knocked off the defence budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed defence cuts also highlight the fact that the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) has once more been rolled by Cabinet on his view that defence spending should stay at the existing level. He put this case very strongly to the Cabinet, but in the end it was rejected. The Minister has not only been humiliated on the issue of homosexuality in the Defence Force&mdash;he took a perfectly sensible and legitimate position; however, he raised the issue to contentious levels and has been overruled by the Caucus committee and now faces the prospect of being overruled by the Cabinet and his own Party&mdash;but he has also lost credibility on defence strategy. On 11 December last year, Senator Robert Ray told the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All Ministers who become Minister for Defence have an obligation to the future of the defence forces . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Of course they do. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to see a secure and proper future for the defence forces and not some cheap opportunist political trick to rip money off defence to no effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that we are at our absolute minimum in respect of defence expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA>That was what he said on 11 December last year. But in the Budget there is the prospect of reducing defence spending by $50m every year from 1993-94 onwards. So less than nine months after he made his statement, the Budget shows that Senator Ray has, once more, been forced to make an embarrassing back down on his commitment to the defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the detail of the defence budget is concerned, there is no doubt that this is a disappointing budget. It is, if you like, a `do nothing' budget. The major change in focus is to turn defence into a make-work scheme to provide short term jobs in national employment disaster areas. More money is being spent on bureaucratic administration and the bringing forward of minor repair and maintenance programs which add nothing to the combat capability of the Australian Defence Force, and which should be the overriding priority of any government. The bringing forward of some $59m of defence spending on minor repair and maintenance programs means that we will lead the world in having some of the best painted white rocks around the officers mess. But the spending has absolutely nothing to do with the nation's defence requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also nothing short of disgraceful that this spending should be brought forward at a time when the Services are being forced to cut back on operational activities, such as flying hours, ship days at sea and Army training and exercises. At the same time as Labor is turning the Australian Defence Force into a make-work scheme, the Government will slash the number of people in Regular Army combat forces in 1992-93 by almost 1,500 positions. The bulk of this number will come from the two Regular Army combat battalions which are being disbanded in Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor says that it will make savings by employing the less costly Ready Reserves, which have grown by almost 900 people this financial year. But its costings for the Ready Reserves, as people in the Defence Force know, are grossly underestimated. Senior defence sources have told us that the new cost estimate is that each Ready Reserve soldier will cost around 71 per cent of the cost of a full time regular, which contrasts with the Government's original estimate that the cost of a Ready Reservist would be about 30 per cent of the cost of a full time soldier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another disappointing aspect of the defence budget is that the bureaucracy and non-combat elements continue to grow: for example, spending on general administration grows by 2.8 per cent to a massive $1.36 billion, whereas significant savings could realistically have been made in that area. At a time when combat forces are shrinking and when spending on operational activities is being cut, it is ridiculous that spending on administration should simply grow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor has never been very serious about cutting the defence bureaucracy. More significant cuts could have been made in the civilian personnel area, which makes up a massive 24 per cent of all defence employees. Again, as far as equipment is concerned, we see absolutely no mention at all in the Budget of the proposed airborne early warning and control aircraft, which every defence authority in Australia agrees is essential to our requirements. It is also disappointing to see that Labor has no intention to increase spending on the defence cooperation program over the next five years. From $75.2m in 1991-92 to $83.7m in 1995-96, defence cooperation remains a minuscule part of the defence budget; it is less than one per cent of the total and, indeed, constitutes very nearly the same amount of expenditure as the telephone bill of the Department of Defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, this is an uninspiring defence budget. It marks another lost opportunity where Labor has simply given up the ghost in terms of trying to make fundamental changes and improvements to the defence capability of this country. It still operates on the basis of the Cold War written 1987 Defence White Paper, which it claims is highly relevant today though the world has changed. As far as the defence budget is concerned, the Government is increasingly squandering money on the bureaucracy, on logistics support, on make work programs and the like, whilst all the time cutting the combat capability of the Australian Defence Force. That is a very serious thing at a time of such insecurity and instability in the international community, including in our own general part of the world. </PARA>

But if that was the best performance that can be given by the shadow Minister for defence, I think it is a disgrace. It was a puerile effort.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me begin my remarks by restating the fundamental responsibility of any Australian Government, which is to ensure the security of Australia and to preserve, protect and defend the Australian people and Australia's interests. The 1992-93 defence budget fulfils this responsibility in three ways. First of all, it provides necessary resources to increase Australia's ability to defend itself; secondly, it will assist the Australian Government in promoting regional security and stability; and, thirdly, it reaffirms Australia's alliance with the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the third element of Australia's defence policy&mdash;and I will say something about this later&mdash;I restate what I have said previously in this House and that is that Australia's alliance with the United States is fundamental to our long term security. The alliance provides a deterrent should Australia be threatened with substantial military aggression in the future. Therefore, it is incumbent upon political parties who aspire to lead this nation not to downgrade the significance of ANZUS as the Liberal Party has done. Unfortunately, the shadow Minister for defence seems hell-bent on doing just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence expenditure for 1992-93 has been set at $9.885 billion, which represents approximately 2.4 per cent of GDP&mdash;the same as in 1991-92. This is a creditable achievement at a time of economic constraint. The Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) is to be congratulated on ensuring that defence expenditure has been maintained in real terms. Not only does the 1992-93 defence budget maintain the current real level of defence expenditure but it also brings forward an additional $59m to assist in creating employment and growth in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate Senator Ray on his decision to maintain the huge capital equipment program planned by the Federal Labor Government many years ago. This year's defence budget contains over $2.1 billion in major capital projects, including ongoing funding for the Anzac ship program, which will receive more than $443m; the Australian frigate project, $79m; the submarine program, more than $720m; the updating of electronic support measure systems and P3C aircraft, $24m; the F111 avionics updating, $86m; and the billion dollar Jindalee radar network project, $193m&mdash;to name but a few. I also note that a substantial allocation has been made for the purchase of additional Harpoon missiles and other military stores. Capital facilities expenditure on works in progress and new works is in excess of $330m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I again congratulate Senator Ray on the decision to proceed with the development of RAAF base Scherger at Weipa in Queensland. This project involves the construction of a defence airfield capable of being an operational forward base for all types of military aircraft. It will be similar to RAAF base Curtin at Derby. It is important for the defence of Australia that construction at RAAF Scherger get under way as soon as possible. In addition, a redevelopment project at Lavarack Barracks, Townsville, has been approved, which will upgrade working and living accommodation facilities. The estimated total cost of that project is $23.44m. This project will have a significant impact in providing new jobs in Townsville. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Army Reserve will also benefit significantly from the defence budget of 1992-93. The budget contains funds for the Australian manufacture of forty-six 105 millimetre field guns for the Army Reserve. I am disappointed, however, to learn from the defence program performance statements that the levels of preparedness for the Army's follow-on, protective and logistic forces were not achieved because of overall resource constraints, including limited equipment holdings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 11th Brigade, which is the only Army Reserve land unit formation in North Queensland and, I might add, the best in Australia&mdash;it is led by Colonel John Crocker, AM, one of the Australian Army's ablest field commanders and a former commanding officer of the Australian contingent in Namibia&mdash;commands units as widespread as Torres Strait in the north, Mount Isa in the west and Gladstone in the south. The 11th Brigade, together with the 6th and 13th Brigades, has been identified for motorisation. This will add significantly to their operational capabilities. Nevertheless, the Army Reserve is constrained by the low number of training days allotted. An Army reservist requires at least 50 days training per year to achieve a reasonable level of efficiency. I appeal to Senator Ray to ensure that in next year's Budget sufficient resources are allocated to the Army Reserve to ensure that each Army reservist has a minimum allotment of 50 days training per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although these defence initiatives are welcome, there is an urgent need for the acquisition of coastal minehunters, replacement aircraft for the C130E Hercules, airborne early warning and control aircraft, Anzac ship helicopters and night fighting equipment for the land forces. A major lesson to come out of the Gulf war was the ability of Allied forces to fight effectively at night. The Australian Army has now launched project Ninox, named after a small Australian owl, as a high priority program, valued at $174m. Equipment to be procured includes image intensifiers and hand-held thermal images to improve night vision capability, as well as various weapon sights and aiming devices, all preferably manufactured in Australia. The program also addresses the requirement for unmanned aerial vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to an issue which would inevitably cause great alarm and concern in the Australian community: the proposed shift in Australia's defence focus by the Liberal Party. Not only will the Liberal Party significantly reduce defence expenditure; it will also impose a goods and services tax of 15 per cent on inputs into the Australian Defence Force. More ominously, a Liberal government would seek to boost military links with regional neighbours and at the same time rely less directly on the United States for the security of Australia. </PARA>

It is astonishing that a political party which has prided itself on being to the forefront on defence policy for generations among Australian political parties should treat the alliance between Australia and the United States in such an immature and ill-informed manner. It appears that the Liberal Party's defence policy is based on three premises: firstly, that Australia's current defence policy is based entirely on the ANZUS alliance; secondly, a Liberal belief that the United States is withdrawing from Australia's area of strategic military interest; and, thirdly, that Australia should be pursuing a policy of cooperative regional deterrence.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In talking about the appropriations for the Department of Defence in the committee stage of the 1992-93 Budget, I want to draw attention to a matter which threatens serious injustice to some members of the Australian Defence Force, the ADF. This situation concerns the ability of redundant members of the Australian Defence Force to seek employment with the Australian Public Service, the APS, following their redundancy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Committee would be aware, the employment prospects for former members of the ADF are not always very extensive. Former ADF members have largely military specific training that does not easily translate into civilian employment when they leave the ADF. As well, a vast majority of ADF personnel leave the force long before reaching retiring age, as is generally recognised, and are expected to re-enter the work force as a consequence. In that context, and for a number of reasons, a major employer of former ADF members is the Australian Public Service, particularly the Department of Defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following implementation of the Government's force structure review, many ADF members have been offered, and have subsequently taken, redundancy packages in the expectation of being able to take up employment with the Australian Public Service. Some of those ADF members made redundant early in the force structure review now have APS employment. However, on 11 September of this year the Public Service Commissioner wrote to the Deputy Secretary, Budget and Management, in the Department of Defence advising that ADF members who have taken redundancy packages could not be employed with the APS for a period equal to the length of their severance benefit. For the purposes of the Australian Public Service, the ADF is to be regarded as a non-APS Commonwealth agency according to the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This letter denotes a major change in policy by the Australian Public Service in relation to members of the ADF and creates a number of problems for redundant ADF personnel. It gives rise to a serious inconsistency in the treatment of ADF members who took redundancies and the associated severance benefits early in the force structure review and who have been able to take up appointments with the APS on the one hand. On the other hand, those who have taken similar redundancy packages will now be denied that very same opportunity. Many ADF members accepted redundancies in the expectation of being able to secure immediate APS appointments and made some important superannuation and other decisions accordingly. Now they find that the rules have been changed on them midstream, as it were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, it took a week or more for the decision of 11 September to be communicated to ADF members. Accordingly, some ADF members accepted redundancies without being aware of this belated decision about their future employability with the APS. The timing of this change in policy on the part of the APS could not have been worse, given the superannuation and redundancy decisions that ADF members have been in the process of making. Moreover, it represents disgraceful personnel management practices by the Department of Defence. The employability of redundant members of the ADF with the APS should have been, and could have been, settled well in advance of the implementation of the redundancy program under the force structure review. For such a fundamental issue to be determined in the middle of the implementation of a major redundancy program is simply a joke, I put it to you, Mr Deputy Chairman. The determination, as it stands, is grossly unfair to redundant ADF members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a start, it would appear not to apply to many other non-APS Commonwealth employees and others who draw their income from Commonwealth sources and who are subsequently made redundant. While it may not be the intention of the Public Service Commissioner that this should occur, it would nonetheless appear to be a fairly common practice. The letter from the Public Service Commissioner to which I have referred appears to have been written at the behest of senior public servants in the Department of Defence. Despite this, the decision fails to recognise that the ADF is an employer with unique characteristics. There are no mechanisms for ADF members to transfer to the APS in the normal course of events. There is no possibility of redundant ADF members obtaining re-employment with the ADF within a period of 12 months, their not doing so being one of the conditions of their redundancy. There is also no scope for ADF members to be redeployed within the ADF, as occurs routinely with public servants in public service positions. The Public Service Commissioner has written to me and said, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My concern in this matter is the potential for taxpayers to be burdened with a double payment to a person in a redundancy situation if the person is subsequently re-employed by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA>It should be apparent that our main concern and criticism is that ADF members have had the rules changed on them in midstream, and not the question of double dipping. It is debatable whether double dipping is an issue here, given that there is no real prospect of ADF members double dipping by resuming employment within the ADF. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the APS to employ former members of the ADF in receipt of redundancy benefits would not appear to raise questions about the integrity of the Commonwealth as an employer, contrary to what the Public Service Commissioner has suggested to me. The Commissioner's statements are also at odds with Determination No. 211 of 1989 by the Minister for Industrial Relations, which requires the repayment of redundancy benefits only where `the member subsequently commences a further period of continuous service with the permanent forces within 12 months of the prescribed day'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Assistant Chief of the Defence Force (Personnel) has indicated to ADF members that the Commissioner's decision is to be challenged at a high level by the ADF. I have sought and obtained from the Public Service Commissioner clarification of the implications of his letter of 11 September and I have also drawn the matter to the attention of the Defence Force Ombudsman, who is investigating. It is totally unacceptable that this situation should arise and that it should come at such a critical time for many members of the ADF. It is indicative of what little regard senior public servants have for members of the ADF that such action should be taken in the middle of a major redundancy program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have received, and I suspect others in this place have received, many representations from ADF members on this issue. Many of these people have also approached the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), who is at the table, and sought his attention to the matter. The Committee of the Whole should be aware that the Minister has simply fobbed off many of these representations, as I understand it, in some cases referring them to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appropriate Minister should be taking an active interest in this issue and his intervention on behalf of redundant ADF personnel would be most welcome, both by the Opposition&mdash;the coalition parties&mdash;and ADF personnel themselves. So far as I have been able to establish, his inattention would suggest that he shares the indifference of some senior public servants towards the well-being of these people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to raise the difficulties facing the motor trades industries of Australia in the context of the recession and the threats to those industries from both Government and Opposition policies alike. The motor trades are a substantial regionalised industry. It is an industry characterised by small to medium size businesses under local control and a large decentralised employer of skilled labour. The industry is important in maintaining a wide range of technical skills in the work force. Many of these skills are transferable across different sectors of the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motor trades are especially important in training young people, many of whom find employment and acquire technical skills by taking up apprenticeships. The industry feels threatened by tariff policy, the ever increasing amount of on-costs on small business and the importation of used cars, tyres, farm machinery and car engines from Japan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry feels threatened by the proposed goods and services tax, increased State charges, the imposition of the superannuation guarantee levy, the current tax regime, the need to ensure that the new simplified sales tax does not unfairly affect business, and the unfair competition between government business enterprises and the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The future for motor trades is unclear under both current and likely future policy. Unrestrained imports would soon consign a substantial part of the industry to the fate accepted by both Government and coalition for Australia's textile, clothing and footwear industries&mdash;that is, no future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Motor traders, like other industries, are carrying enormous on-costs of such items as payroll tax, superannuation, work cover, the training levy, leave loadings and public holidays. Irrespective of the merits of these charges, they do not exist in Asian economies; and the Government cannot have it both ways. If these charges remain it is unreasonable to demand unprotected competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Japan has a huge supply of second-hand cars and parts with no local market, so they are dumped overseas. Last year some 66,000 used engines were imported. These are brought in cheaply, many entering apparently as scrap metal. These engines can be installed for under $1,000. This is having a dramatic effect on the local engine reconditioning industry and has reduced the intake of new apprentices sharply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a substantial trade in second-hand tyres from Japan. Some 700,000 of these tyres are entering Australia each year. The safety of all Australians is threatened by this trade. So far no action has been taken by the Government to stem the flow of these imported used engines and tyres, which makes a mockery of Australian standards and design rules. This is in contrast to the high volume importation of second-hand Japanese cars which the Government recently decided to stop with a $12,000 tariff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even this has not been fully effective. Now that Japan has developed a range of prestige cars, it is only a matter of time before we see imports of such models as the Lexus, the Honda NSX and the Nissan GTR. The Government's $12,000 tariff is a flat tax and it will not stop the importation of these luxury cars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also uncertainty and alarm about the effects on the industry of the Opposition's goods and services tax. The GST has the potential to dramatically alter the used car industry, through not only the coalition's opposition to tariff on used cars but also the application of the GST to car dealerships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Five years ago 45 per cent of used cars were sold privately, and the proportion has now climbed to 60 per cent. With the GST applying to dealerships but not to private vendors, legislation attempting to protect consumers and public safety on used cars will soon be meaningless as the 40 per cent of cars sold through dealerships shrinks to negligible proportions. The Government needs urgently to address the problem of the importation of used car components such as engines and tyres. Otherwise we will have a serious loss of employment in skilled trades and declining road safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many government enterprises compete unfairly with the private sector. They enjoy a wide range of subsidies in relation to motor vehicles. They receive sales tax concessions, then depress the used car market at auctions by bypassing dealers bearing the full weight of government charges. They are doubly subsidised by the private new car buyer, who pays sales tax and then receives a lower resale price. The most blatant and obscene example of unfair competition and political hypocrisy is Comcar. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to talk about hypocrisy and the motives of certain people in the Liberal Party in Western Australia. I have mentioned before in this House the situation we have had with the brewery in Western Australia. Here we have a historic building, one of the few remaining turn of the century industry complexes. I believe it should be preserved. It was the subject of some very spurious land claims and it was being held up in the name of Aboriginal people by a certain Mr Bropho and people who supported him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is on the record that I was able to muster support from Aboriginal people who were sick and tired of having others, mainly whites, speak in their name. We assembled at the brewery site 120 Aboriginal people to be confronted by fewer than 20 Aboriginals from Mr Bropho's family but hordes and hordes of white people&mdash;a motley collection. There were the Greens, the animal liberationists, the Democrats, the Trotskyites from the CMEU and the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is on the record that we were able to stop the Aboriginal Legal Service from funding Mr Bropho. After funding to the extent of at least $300,000, we were able to get the Legal Service to stop it. The minute that funding was stopped&mdash;and bear in mind that the Service had represented Mr Bropho something like 45 times and Mr Ivan Yarran, one of his camp followers, some 34 times at this enormous expense&mdash;these people immediately went to the Liberal Party and demanded an inquiry into the Aboriginal Legal Service. I have no complaints about that; I believe that there should be full accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But having cut off the funds from the Legal Service we were then appalled to find that this group was being funded by certain people in the Liberal Party. What are the motives of these people? Is it some high moral ground that they seek to hold? I think not. One of these people is Marie-Louise Wordsworth, the wife of David Wordsworth, a member of the upper House in Western Australia. I do not think he had spoken in the upper House since he was elected until recently when he applauded the decision of that House to reject the Government's legislation which would have allowed the brewery to go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why would Marie-Louise Wordsworth fund Aboriginals? Anyone who knows her would know that it is not out of compassion. There is, however, an interesting scenario. She is a proprietor, amongst others, of the Captain Stirling Hotel. The Captain Stirling Hotel just happens to be the first hotel out of Perth on the Stirling Highway. Marie-Louise Wordsworth is, if nothing else, a very vigorous businesswoman, and she thought that a tavern located between her and the city would have been injurious to business. Frankly, I do not think that is the case. I do not think hotels get their trade that way any more. I do not think people rush out of the city and say, `First pub: let's stop and have a drink'. But she was clearly concerned. So she funded Mr Bropho in the very early days. I am told that two other prominent liberals also funded him, and I will have their names in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now see that the Liberal Party is engaging in advertising and it has advertisements in the newspapers rating against development. It is certainly a strange situation: the Liberal Party in Western Australia is opposed to development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a great believer in the Western style of democracy, I find this very worrying&mdash;fraught with danger, in fact. How can we have responsible government when we have such an irresponsible Opposition? There is no doubt that Marie-Louise Wordsworth has been culpable, greedy and self-serving. But so too, by association, has the entire Liberal-National Party in Western Australia. I think it is about time the public were made fully aware of the hypocrisy that pervades the Liberal Party. Clearly, it is not fit to govern. </PARA>

The inspiration of one of my constituents, the legendary bushman R.M. Williams, the trail follows historic coach and stock routes, old pack horse trails, brumby tracks, bullock trails, fire trails and country roads.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While still very much in its development phase, the trail's enormous potential is now being tapped by people involved in all sorts of activities, as well as the horse riding and bushwalking for which it was initially established.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trail lies within four hours drive of 11 million Australians and its length and variety ensure that it can be all things to all people; a wilderness or a weekend ramble, a place for the experienced trekker or the first time adventurer. Age is no barrier to enjoying its pleasures. All people, from young children to those of advanced years, will find areas suited to both their fitness level and their interests. Experienced trekkers will find as many challenges as they care to confront, while the less experienced can choose a section of the trail which will give them more easy-going adventure. Everyone who loves the Australian bush and its unique attractions will find the trail a profoundly enjoyable experience. </PARA>

This public manifestation of a subversive and sinister political agenda is the work of former teachers cum union hacks who now infest what used to be the Education Department. What was once a relatively apolitical aspect of public endeavour is now largely in the grip of the Marxist graduates of the 1960s and 1970s. It is the VCE more than any other attempt to undermine what is the basic purpose of education&mdash;the transmission of knowledge&mdash;that has revealed the parlous state of education in Victoria.

Indeed, one of the VCE's most ardent advocates, failed Premier Kirner, summed up her malevolent intentions in 1984 when, as Minister for Education, she aimed to `reshape education so that it is part of the socialist struggle for equity, participation and social change, rather than an instrument of the capitalist system'. </PARA>

In this endeavour, Professor Pennington has been ably supported by the work of the Institute of Public Affairs and the writings of such critics of the VCE as: Robert Rofe, the Principal of Brighton Grammar; Michael Hallpike, a secondary teacher from Bendigo; and Kevin Donnelly, a Master at Camberwell Boys Grammar School. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr Dawkins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) Income from a trust set up in a tax haven by a person  who is now dead is not necessarily exempt from accruals tax. The precise tax treatment of such income depends on the circumstances of the particular case, as set out below.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The accruals tax measures, which apply from the 1990-91 income year, contain provisions that deal with certain non-resident trusts which have had property or services transferred to them by Australian residents. These provisions are referred to as the transferor tax measures. In general, they treat the low-taxed income derived by the trust as derived by the resident who transferred the property or services to the trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transferor tax measures do not always apply to the beneficiaries of the estate of a deceased transferor. This is because a beneficiary of the deceased estate cannot be treated as having transferred property or services to the trust merely because he or she is a beneficiary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this does not mean that such a non-resident trust is necessarily outside the scope of the accruals tax measures. For example, if a person other than the deceased has also transferred property or services to the trust, the low-taxed income of the trust would then be treated as income of that person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definition of "transfer" is sufficiently wide to include transfers made by companies controlled by a resident and transfers made on behalf of a resident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, if residents have a present entitlement to a share of the income of the trust, they will be taxed on that income on a current basis under the normal trust provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where there is no present entitlement and the transferor tax measures do not apply, low-taxed income accumulated by an offshore trust will still be subject to Australian tax when it is distributed to an Australian resident or applied for the benefit of an Australian resident. In these circumstances the taxpayer is liable to pay, in addition to the tax, an interest charge to compensate for the deferral of tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) It follows from the answer to (a) that there is no automatic exemption from the accruals tax measures for the beneficiaries of the estate of a deceased transferor. So the question of "removing the exemption" does not arise. The Government is not presently considering altering the measures to treat the beneficiaries of such estates as if they had themselves transferred property or services to the trust. Such treatment would be counter-factual and could produce unfair results in many cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government were to alter the measures in that way, the revenue effects are not clear. Any additional revenue that might arise from such an alteration could of course be applied to any purpose, including those listed in the question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is satisfied that the package of accruals tax measures, together with the Foreign Investment Fund measures announced in the 1991-92 Budget, strike a good balance between ensuring that Australian residents with foreign source income pay their fair share of Australian tax, and not discouraging legitimate Australian investment offshore.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) and (b) The acquisition of Australian urban land by foreign interests is regulated by the provisions of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (the Act).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Act, any overseas interest acquiring an interest in Australian urban land is required to seek approval unless that acquisition falls into a category which is exempt by regulation. Foreign investment policy is tightest in the area of existing housing, where most proposed foreign acquisitions&mdash;other than by Australian citizens abroad and foreign nationals entitled to permanent residence in Australia&mdash;are examinable and not normally approved, except for foreign nationals temporarily resident in Australia for a year or more, and a few other special categories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its Annual Report, the Board provides summary details of the level of expected foreign investment in urban real estate. The Board's Annual Report for 1990-91 was tabled in Parliament on 25 February 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some instances the acquisition of Australian urban land by foreign interests may be subject to the parties meeting certain conditions.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr Dawkins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) Branch Office in Townsville administers the taxation affairs of some 600,000 taxpayers in northern and central Queensland and is supported by Regional Offices in Cairns, Mackay and Rockhampton.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gladstone is the most southern fringe of the area covered by the Townsville Branch Office and the area between there and Brisbane is being served by the new Chermside Branch Office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) Queensland has been divided into 4 regions for ATO administration to be serviced by new Branch Offices at Chermside and Upper Mount Gravatt, a smaller Brisbane CBD Office and the Townsville Branch Office. This division is consistent with the ATO policy of moving towards offices of 600 to 800 staff. Offices of this size have been found to be more efficient and capable of providing a high level of service to taxpayers whilst providing career opportunities for staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy will result in a total of 25 branch offices being established throughout Australia by the end of 1994. Significant planning and lead times are involved and as a result a 3 to 6 year time frame is not uncommon in finalising construction of a branch office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Townsville Branch Office covers a large geographical area but was selected as the most practical location to service taxpayers in the northern region of Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The taxation base of Central Queensland represents less than 25% of Townsville Office's file size and as such would not warrant the establishment of a full branch office in the Rockhampton region. In addition to the services available from the regional office in Rockhampton a range of other initiatives have resulted in a better level of services to taxpayers throughout Australia. Recent developments such as TaxPack are going a long way towards meeting the needs of individual taxpayers. The introduction of BillPay means that people will no longer have to pay their tax bill at a Tax Office but at the local Post Office. 008 numbers are available for country people to seek assistance on a variety of subjects. The ATO is also looking at a number of initiatives under its Modernisation Program that will result in a better service to people making general phone enquiries to the ATO.</PARA>
