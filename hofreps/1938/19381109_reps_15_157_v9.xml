                        <para>- I have in my hand a small registering instrument which is already being supplied to the Postal Department for use in recording the number of telephone calls made by each subscriber attached to an automatic telephone exchange. I am informed that it costs the . department approximately <inline font-style="italic">Vis.,</inline> and that it is manufactured by a number of firms in Australia. In view of the widespread dissatisfaction among subscribers at their inability to check up on the number of calls for which they are charged, and as the suppliers of gas, electricity, and water make this facility available, will the Postmaster-General consider the possibility of having this instrument installed in the home of every telephone subscriber? If in the initial stage that is not found financially practicable, will hp consider enabling subscribers who elect to do so, to have it installed at a little extra cost? </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - On the notice-paper a question appears in the name of the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> in regard to the occupancy hy Ministers of the Crown of positions on directorates of public companies. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>As honorable members arc aware, this matter was referred to on the motion for the adjournment of the House on Friday last by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin).</inline> In the course of my reply, I then stated that the Government was giving consideration to the setting up of a definite precedent for future guidance. </para>
                    <para>The circumstances attending the resignation  of  the former Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J.</inline> McLachlan) have given rise to general discussion as  to  the position which should be taken up by Ministers in relation to the holding of seats on boards of directors. As the matter is of great public importance, I think it proper that 1 should state my own view in genera] terms. Honorable members will understand that I am dealing not with the problems of actual constitutional disqualification which arise under section 44 of the Constitution, but with cases not covered by that section which are of such a nature as to give rise to problems of propriety and not of legality. </para>
                    <para>Having regard to the enormous development during the present century of the joint stock company idea in relation to both public and private companies, it does not seem to me to be practicable or dcs i ruble to lay down a general rule that no Cabinet Minister shall be a di runtor of any company. It would be plainly anomalous if one Minister could retain the whole of the proprietorship of some business or enterprise, while another Minister was debarred from being one of several directors conducting an exactly similar business or enterprise. Thus it has never been .suggested that a Cabinet Minister may not continue  to be, for  can triple, a grazier. Could it be reasonably suggested that, should he decide to incorporate his business as a grazier, he him self being the principal shareholder and director, there would be some impropriety on his part in remaining in the Cabinet? I make these observations in order to show that in my opinion the important criterion is. not the fact that a Minister is n director, but the nature of the company of which he is n director and the business which it does. </para>
                    <para>Applying this test, it seems to me that there are. broadly speaking, two classes of company to be considered. The first is the company which has, in fact, direct dealings with the Government, whether those dealings are by way of the sale  ot  goods or the provision of services. </para>

                        <para>- In view of what I have previously stated as to the importance of the rule that public men should avoid being placed in a position in which their personal interests may conflict with their public duty, it would appear that, prima facie, no Minister should be a director of such a company; but this, too, requires some qualification. If the contract which the Government makes with such a company is one which results from the exercise of individual judgment or selection, as in the case of the supply of goods of some special kind, it seems clear that a directorship of the company concerned would be inconsistent with the discharge of ministerial duty. But some arrangements which are technically contracts are made on a non-selective or nondiscriminating basis. For example, at election time routine electoral advertisements are inserted in every newspaper, great and small, in Australia. It would he difficult to suggest that some Minister, who was associated with a newspaper, would be put into an invidious position simply because that journal accepted, in common with every other newspaper, advertisements of this kind. This consideration leads to the conclusion that, if there is the slightest element of judgment or choice involved in the placing of government business, no Minister should be a director of a company which is the recipient of that business. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The second class of company consists of ' those which have no business dealings with the Government at all. Unless we . are to lay down a rule that no Cabinet Minister is to have any business or financial interests outside the administration of his own department, it seems impossible to decide that the holding of a directorship of this class of company is inconsistent with membership of Cabinet. A Minister's paramount duty is, of course,the discharge of his public responsibilities, and he should not allow any private interest to interfere with that duty. But, subject to that limitation, I am not prepared to lay down a sweeping rule, the effect of which would be to exclude from the public life and service of the country, men who are available for that service. </para>
                    <para>However, I have excluded from what I have said any consideration of the position which arises in relation to the occupancy by my colleague, the Minister for External Affairs, of a seat on the board of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. As honorable members know, difficulties arose in 1922 as to the appointment of the seventh director to the board of that company, the controlling share interest in which is held by the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> who was then. Prime Minister, was induced, with the consent of all parties, to resolve the impasse that had arisen by himself becoming the seventh di rector. That position he has since continued to occupy, to the knowledge of the Parliament,' and with, I believe, its approval during the whole period. He has been re-appointed with the approval of the Government, as expressed through its directors, under successive governments. </para>

                        <para>- It is impossible to say exactly when the service will be commenced, as there are many factors to be taken into consideration. The preparation of the draft agreement is completed, on all the major points agreement has been reached by the Governments of the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth and New Zealand, and further negotiations are being carried on at the present time in connexion with certain matters of detail. The companies nominated by the respective governments have entered into an agreement among themselves to conduct the service. The necessary flying boats are being built and tested - I understand that one has already been tested - and, as far as I can judge, the -service should be in operation by about Easter next. </para>

                        <para>- I think that I can say that I am aware that there is some apprehension in the minds of certain people with regard to the migration of aliens to Australia. It is with a knowledge that that apprehension exists that the Government has framed and administered its policy with regard to alien migration. I should be able to set at rest any apprehension that exists when I inform the honorable member that no alien may land in Australia without first securing, for himself as an individual, a permit to land in this country. Such permit is not issued until he has supplied many particulars with regard to himself, as to his character, health, financial standing, the amount of money he is able to bring with him, and the employment he proposes to engage in, or the avocation he proposes to follow, after his arrival in Australia. If the Minister is satisfied that his arrival in Australia will not be derogatory to the employment of any Australians and, after a very careful scrutiny of the particulars which I have briefly indicated, is convinced that the applicant is of a. desirable type, a permit to land is issued. As the responsible Minister administering Government policy in this respect, I am satisfied that there is no need for alarm as to the number of aliens coming into Australia at present, and that those granted permits are individuals of a desirable type. </para>

                    <para class="block">I do so for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, " The perilous condition of the wheat industry and of the wheatgrowers, and of the consequent imminent danger to all sections of the Australian community, and the necessity for a vigorous, well-directed and immediate governmental policy of relief". In availing myself of this democratic privilege I should like to assure honorable members that I have no desire to delay the ordinary business of the House; but I am impelled to do so owing to the tragic position which has developed throughout a great portion of the wheat-growing areas of the Commonwealth owing to the failure of seasonal rains. The position calls for the active interest of this Parliament and of this Government, because it has been authoritatively stated in the last few days that the total Australian yield of wheat is likely to be 40,000,000 bushels less than last year. The greater portion of that decrease will be in Victoria. Notwithstanding optimistic estimates I believe that the yield in that State is more likely to be 10 million bushels than 20 million bushels as has been stated in some quarters. I suggest to the Government that the position can be met by the payment of an acreage bounty to those growers who will get little or no return, and that the money should be made available by the Treasury. The wheat-growers have had to contend not only with drought conditions but also with low prices: and the conditions this year are similar to those which obtained when the Royal Commission on the Wheat Industry conducted its investigations. Owing to the policy of procrastination adopted by the Government rural rehabilitation has been unduly delayed, and debt adjustment payments which were promised have not yet been fully made. This has necessitated State governments having to hold up this important work. I believe that the debt position of the Australian wheat-growers is not much better, if it has improved at all, than it was when the investigation was conducted by the royal commission. The position is serious in the States most affected, and the ability of the State governments to deal with the situation is limited. In my opinion and in the opinion of many others it is imperative that the Commonwealth Government should offer co-operation and financial assistance. Honorable members generally should give serious consideration to the gravity of the situation which I believe is not fully appreciated. Recently I visited wheat-growing areas in my electorate where I saw a state of affairs which can scarcely be envisaged by honorable members who have not had actual experience of the ravages of drought. I saw miles and. miles of wheat lands that have been sown from which not a grain of wheat will be harvested. In some instances a small return will bo obtained, but probably only sufficient to provide seed wheat for next season. These unfortunate growers will not have any grain to sell, and consequently will not have any income to enable them to carry on next season. Owing to the scarcity of feed, stock is being sacrificed, and as time goes on there will be further heavy losses. Barren pastures are expressive of the struggle which stock will have to survive in the grim fight with nature. Men who have painstakingly given their labour in the hope of securing some return for their work will receive little or nothing. A great majority of the settlers have just secured a final adjustment of the contracts entered into with the States closer settlement authorities. They have been given what would be considered a small equity in their properties if the conditions were normal. Many of them, believing that it might enable them to raise small loans to tide them over, have been forced to realize that there is little that is tangible in the assets which they have created. Consultation with the executives of wheat-growers' organizations have revealed that they do not desire in any way to interfere, with the proposal to establish a home consumption price for wheat. What is needed is a Treasury grant in the form of a bounty to be paid to those who will not have one bag of wheat to sell. Many men with wives and families to support are in need. Many of these men, with their wives and families, are in need of the barest necessaries of life. Thousands do not know how they are going to live until they may receive some return from the land, perhaps a year hence. There is another large section of wheat-growers who, normally, would be able to finance themselves over a difficult period, but now find it well-nigh impossible to finance themselves because the trading banks so seriously view the position that they are applying the most stringent financial restrictions upon their operations. In some cases, these men, fearing such a contingency, last year contemplated making use of the debt-adjustment scheme; but, heeding the counsel of the financial institutions and their other creditors and on their promise that they would be carried in the event of an emergency, they ignored the opportunity provided by the scheme to safeguard their interests. I am sorry to have to say that the promises given to them are not being honoured and that their future and, to a considerable degree, that of this valuable exporting primary industry is in jeopardy. </para>
                    <para>I do not desire to paint too gloomy a picture of the conditions that I have seen and of the difficulties which beset the farm population in my electorate, but I do wish to give honorable members some idea of the seriousness of the position. My electorate, although probably the worst sufferer, is, unfortunately, for Australia, not an isolated example. Recent information received from Western Australia indicates that an equally distressing position exists in the north-eastern wheat belt of that State. According to a statement issued by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> L. Warner, a member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, anything from 20,000 to 30,000 acres of crops will not be harvested at all-, and, unless assistance is rendered, there must be a further exodus from that portion of the State. Reports received from the wheat areas of Kew South Wales suggest that the position is almost as desperate there as it is in Western Australia. In parts of the Riverina, of course, drought has already levied its toll upon stock, and in some districts sheep have long ago been transferred to better pasture areas. I understand wheat crops have completely failed in many Riverina districts. I am, however, not entirely cognizant of the position in the Riverina, and, probably, some other honorable gentleman will be able to supplement my remarks. </para>
                    <para>A duty devolves upon this Parliament to take full cognizance of the position and to render effective aid to tide farm people over their difficulties. During the last two years, wheatgrowers, as the result of improved prices for their product and also, in my opinion, as the result of the frequent optimistic statements of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> and other responsible Ministers to the effect that the depression was past and that the future could be looked to with confidence, launched out in increased areas and bought new modern equipment. The position of these people is indeed desperate. </para>
                    <para>First and foremost, let me say that there should be an immediate stock-taking of the farmers' debt adjustment. The Government cannot be admired for the manner in which it has handled this matter. Many warnings have been issued in this chamber regarding the Government's evasion and procrastination in dealing with debt adjustment, but those warnings have not been heeded, with the result that there has been most unfortunate delay. </para>
                    <para>I am not concerned with the arguments that have been adduced in an attempt to shift the blame from the shoulders of the Government and of this Parliament, however ludicrous they may be. What I am concerned with is an immediate acceleration of the process which creditors and debtors thought would be adopted. The failure to honour obligations in regard to debt adjustment moneys has caused many cases to be held in a state of suspense and, at the same time, caused the present position to be aggravated. I urge, therefore, that the Government take immediate steps to provide the necessary moneys to the States for the completion of the work. Even now, if the 'Government would make the promised amounts available to the .States, the State governments, possibly, could again, for a limited period; make available to embarrassed farmers the benefits of the debt adjustment legislation. I suggest that this be done. </para>
                    <para>I would remind the Prime Minister in dealing with the subject of rural difficulties of a statement which he was recently reported, to have made. If correctly reported, he said : " We as a people now have a lasting peace ". If these words can be accepted as an indication of the Government's genuine belief, it is its duty to divert some of the £43,000.000 which is thought necessary for defence, into channels which will prevent primary and secondary industry from receiving the full impact of the blow which threatens to fall because of drought conditions. Otherwise there will be recession in business with resultant unemployment. There is a disposition on the part of some honorable members to suggest that the present position should "be exclusively handled by the States. That that outlook is incongruous must be realized when it is recalled that the welfare of primary industry affects our whole national structure. lt is not a problem which should be dealt with in piece-meal fashion; otherwise, the more impoverished is a State, the greater will be its difficulty in sotting affairs right. Furthermore, there are no existing State institutions adequately equipped to deal with the situation, whereas the Commonwealth has an authority which it can use with good effect - the Commonwealth Bank. I understand that proposals are being considered at the moment for the establishment of a mortgage bank, and I suggest to the Government and the House that legislation should also be introduced for the broadening of the powers of the rural credits branch of the Commonwealth Bank. At the moment its operations are confined to the provision of moneys for collective marketing. If the powers of that branch were increased, it would be enabled to ease the pressure upon those who have reasonably good security, but who are unable to borrow. It would, by that very operation, check the disastrous policy of deflation which  financial institutions are at present introducing. We are told that there are at the moment influences at work which object to the use of free money for the purpose of the establishment of a mortgage bank. It is evident that those influences are concerned not with the greater national aspects, but with the protection of the interests of the private money changers and lending institutions. </para>

                        <para>. - I thank the honorable member for "Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wilson)</inline> for raising this subject, which is both urgent and important at the present time, for it gives to the Government an opportunity to reveiw  the position of the wheat industry, and enables members of this Parliament to consider its more important phases before the Government actually introduces legislation on the subject. The problem is so difficult as to require the combined wisdom of all political parties to find a satisfactory solution. Moreover, the assistance of all the Governments of Australia, irrespective of their political outlook in other directions, will be necessary. A review of the subject reveals that this Parliament has always been interested in, and sympathetic towards, this industry. As the honorable member for Wimmera has said, Parliament has recognized that wheat-growing is one of the great basic industries of the Commonwealth; it employs large numbers of workers, and its prosperity or adversity is reflected throughout the whole community. At the present time every wheat-growing country is facing a most serious problem. The difficulties are accentuated in Australia by the federal system of government, under which the Commonwealth Government and Parliament merely control the export marketing side of the industry, whilst the State governments and parliaments control production. Those difficulties have been enormously increased by the interpretation of section 92 of the Constitution by the Privy Council in 1936. The constitutional position is that neither the Commonwealth Government and Parliament nor the State governments and parliaments can control adequately the marketing of wheat. The story of the last few years in regard to the wheat industry is a sorry one, indeed. At the beginning of 1930 wheat was 5s. a bushel f.o.b. Australian ports, but by December of that year the price had fallen to 2s. 6d. a bushel. In 1931 the price reached the low level of 2s. Id. a bushel, and for the next four years it remained low. In 1936 there was an improvement, and wheat realized more than 4s. a bushel; in 1937 the price further increased to more than 5s. a bushel. That rise was the result of drought conditions in the northern hemisphere, which affected both the American and European crops. At the present time the price of wheat in Australia is below 3s. a bushel f.o.b. Australian ports. To-day's quotation is 2s. 9d. or 2s. 9jd. a bushel for bagged wheat, whilst the price quoted for January deliveries <inline font-style="italic">ex</inline> silos and for new wheat is 2s.  7½d.  a bushel. Present-day prices reflect the world position in regard to wheat supplies. </para>

                            <para>- The price varies, but generally 6d. or 7d. a bushel must be allowed for freight to Australian ports. The supplies of wheat available for export this year by all exporting countries are estimated at 925,000,000 bushels, but the world import demand is estimated at only 550,000,000 'bushels. That means that this year there will be a world surplus of approximately 375,000,000 bushels, and consequently it is not difficult to see the reason for the present low prices. The excess of production over demand has caused a relapse of prices, following a temporary recovery. I emphasize that the present prices for wheat are due not merely to Australian conditions, but to world factors. A world surplus of wheat is forcing down prices. One explanation of the over-production of wheat is that many European countries, in an attempt to become self-contained, are growing wheat on an uneconomic basis. Instead of importing hundreds of millions of bushels of wheat, as they did in the past, they are supplying their own requirements. Again, newer wheat countries, which during the war increased their production of wheat enormously, continued that production after the war, and, in some instances, actually increased it. Obviously, if the present world volume of production be maintained and there be no increased consumption, there will be a continuance of low prices. The only permanent remedy is either an increased consumption of wheat, which does not appear to be likely, or a reduction of production. If a reduction of production in European countries which are now producing wheat uneconomically cannot be brought about, we in Australia will have to face the possibility of persons who are now attempting to grow wheat in marginal areas directing their energies to more profitable undertakings. </para>

                            <para>- That will have to be considered in a proper and systematic way. The Commonwealth Government has been fully alive to the difficulties of the wheat-growers, for. during the last eight years, it has distributed £14,000,000 throughout Australia for the assistance of the industry. Amounts of £3,250,000, £4,000,000 and £1,878,000 were made available in 1031-33, 1934-35 and 1935-30 respectively. These bounties have undoubtedly been merely palliatives. Some permanent remedy -is needed. To provide this, the Commonwealth Government has done several constructive things. It appointed the royal commission, presided over by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Herbert</inline> Gepp, to inquire into the industry. The commission, after taking evidence throughout Australia, made many recommendations, some of them of a major character. Of these  manor recommendations, sixteen have been implemented by the Government. The Government also established the Australian Agricultural Council, in an effort to secure complete co-operation between the State governments, which control production, and the Commonwealth Government, which controls export marketing. One of the first subjects dealt with by the council, in December, 1934, was the re-organization of the wheat industry, and the adjustment of farmers' debts. In this respect, an amount of £6,317,000 has been made available to the State governments in the last four years, which is more than half of the £12,000,000 arranged to be provided for this purpose. The reason why a larger sum has not been provided is easily explained. The Commonwealth Government, which has not borrowed any money for its own purposes in the last four years, informed the State governments that if they would agree to the Commonwealth borrowing certain moneys for public works, the Commonwealth would make available an equivalent amount for farmers' debt adjustment. The rate at which money may be made available is, therefore, controlled by the State governments. The only limit is the limit determined by the Loan Council, on which the State governments have six representatives. A contribution of £6,317,000 for the purpose of farmers' debt adjustment must be regarded as substantial. Personally, I regret that a larger proportion of this money has not been used to try to divert more wheat-growers to other lines of production which offer a prospect of permanent profit. This would help to solve the main problem. The greater part of the money has been used, however, to pay current debts. I admit that the State governments have a difficult problem to deal with in this connexion. </para>

                    <para>In 1935, a conference held under the auspices of the Australian Agricultural Council of all the wheat interests of Australia discussed in great detail the principle of fixing a price for wheat for home consumption. Subsequently, legislation embodying the decisions of the conference was passed by this Parliament, and by three State parliaments. Unfortunately, this whole plan was rendered abortive by a decision of the Privy Council. The attempt made, by referendum, to amend the Constitution to permit that plan to be carried into effect failed. During the referendum campaign the whole of the members of the United Australia party and the Country party, and also a considerable number of members of the Labour party in Victoria, Queensland and South Australia cooperated in an endeavour to obtain an affirmative vote by the people, so that the Commonwealth Parliament could  make effective arrangements for both the domestic and overseas marketing of our wheat. The Government was grateful for this co-operation. Many of the members of the Labour party in New South Wales, however, refused to co-operate, and so it has not been possible, so far, to deal with the subject in a national way. After the defeat of the referendum proposals, the whole position was very carefully examined in the light of the decision of the Privy Council, and it was found that that decision undoubtedly revealed that the States had greater powers than was previously thought to be the case to fix the price of their products. In August, 1937, the Agricultural Council, at its meeting in Brisbane, found a. means by which the States could, by fixing the' price of flour, indirectly secure a home-consumption price for wheat. On the 26th August of this year, the Council again considered the whole subject and the State Premiers said to the Commonwealth Government, in effect, "We will fix the price of flour within the States if the Commonwealth Government will take complementary action to make available from the proceeds of the fixed price a levy to permit the payment of a fixed price for wheat-growers for home consumption ". The Prime Minister gave an assurance that the Commonwealth Government would co-operate in bringing the scheme into operation, seeing that it had the unanimous support of the State governments. On the 29th August last, at a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers in Canberra, the general principles, and the greater part of the detail of the whole scheme, were agreed to, and since then, bills dealing with the subject have been passed by both Houses of the Parliaments of New South Wales and South Australia. The necessary legislation has been introduced in the Parliaments of Western Australia and Tasmania, and notice of its introduction was given in the Parliament of Queensland on the 4th November. The Victorian bill has been drafted and submitted to the Commonwealth Government for approval, though it has not yet been actually introduced. But the States have now suggested a variation of the agreed method of dealing with the position. In short, their new proposal is that the pro ceeds of the levy should be distributed on a different basis from that already approved. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dunstan,</inline> the Premier of Victoria, was the first one to make this suggestion, when, a few days ago, he telephoned me. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid.</inline> the Minister for Agriculture of New South Wales, communicated with mc last Friday, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Playford,</inline> the Premier of South Australia, telegraphed me yesterday on the matter. As the result of the telephone conversations that have ensued, which suggest that some variation of the scheme already agreed to is desired, I have informed the State representatives that [ shall bc available in Canberra next week-end to discuss the whole subject with them, and also to endeavour to find some means by which a measure of relief may be accorded to farmers in wheat-growing areas where the seasonal conditions have proved to be extremely bad. Strange to say, such areas are to be found in every State, and are widely scattered throughout the Commonwealth. Within the same State conditions in some areas have been exceptionally good, and farmers will have excellent crops, whereas in certain other areas extremely difficult conditions prevail. The following table sets out some interesting details : - </para>
                    <para>Because of the diversity of the problem within the States themselves, quite apart from the difficulties arising as between the States, it is very difficult to devise any uniform scheme to deal with the position. Consequently, we are discussing the matter with all of the State governments, which are representative of all political parties, in an endeavour to arrive at some solution of not only the problem of providing a home consumption price for wheat, but also the general question of relief in stricken areas. We desire to bring down legislation not merely to deal with the present crisis, but also to establish co-operative action as between the Commonwealth and  the  State Governments in the industry itself, and to secure not only organized marketing, but also systematic control of the industry in order to prevent the growing of wheat in areas in which farmers will obviously have a rough time. We hope to devise means to transplant farmers who already find themselves in such a position, to callings in which they will find a job of work to do and have a decent chance of making a success of it. </para>

                        <para>.- On general principles, I support the motion moved by the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wilson),</inline> although I do not agree with the basis on which he suggests relief should be given to wheatgrowers in distress. I agree with the principle of a home-consumption price for wheat. Furthermore, it is the duty of this Government to make special grants to the respective States for the relief of farmers who find themselves in distress as the result of bad seasons. I cannot quite follow the reasoning of the honorable member for Wimmera that such relief should be distributed on an acreage basis. In every case the financial position of applicants for relief should be taken into consideration. In some districts, wealthy corporations and individuals own areas up to 10,000 acres. Despite seasonal adversity, these remain in a strong financial position and, because they do not need assistance, they are not entitled to any. If relief were granted on the basis of 5s. an acre, for instance, the owner of a 10,000 acre farm would receive £2,500. However, in many wheat-growing centres, the average cropping area owned by the small farmer is only from 300 to 400 acres, and on that basis, most farmers, despite the fact that they and their families depend on the industry for their livelihood, would receive only £75 or £100. The inequity of such a basis of relief is obvious. In respect to bounties also, I have always contended that payments should be made only to those who are in desperate financial straits. The honorable member for Wimmera has pointed out that distress is most acute at the present time among wheat farmers in his electorate, but I venture to suggest that extensive tracts in that district are controlled by wealthy corporations which do  not  need assistance  from  the Government. Assistance should, therefore, be distributed  on  the  basis of need. </para>

                    <para>The Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> mentioned the sums which had been voted, and actually paid,  in  respect of farmers' debt adjustment. We know that the present trouble would have been obviated but for the tardiness of this Government in making that money  available.  Yet, in spite of the fact that the sum which it was originally proposed to vote for purpose of rural rehabilitation was £20,000,000, and only £12,000,000 has been actually voted, whilst only £6,000,000 of this amount has actually been made available to date, we are now informed by the Minister for Commerce that the State governments have been given the option of saying how they will use the balance of this money. They have been given the choice of using it for the construction of public works. As the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> has interjected, this departure from the original promise of the  Government  constitutes a grave betrayal of the trust reposed in it by the wheat-growers. Throughout New South Wales, under the operations of the Farmers'  Relief  Act, during the last three or four years, hundreds of farmers, because of financial difficulty have had their holdings placed under the control of receivers. This position has been brought about, purely because the money promised for rural rehabilitation has not been made available as expeditiously as it might be. Every honorable member who represents a country district is aware that during the last three or four years many farmers have lost their holdings through their' inability to meet their financial obligations. I suggest that this would not have happened had the money voted for rural rehabilitation been made available more expeditiously. </para>

                            <para>- I know that it is largely as the result of the position which has arisen in consequence of that fact that the honorable member for Wimmera has found it necessary to move his motion, [t has been stated by the Government, and by members of the Country party, that the Labour party has not consistently advocated the granting of assistance to wheat-growers. I know, as one who has been engaged in wheat-growing all my life in the north-west of New South Wales, that the only assistance of any real value ever received by the wheat-growers was given by a Labour government. Years ago, when the Labour party was in power in New South Wales, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> T. Lang was Treasurer, the Government made an advance of 2s. 6d. a bushel which, in addition to the price of 5s. a bushel guaranteed by the Commonwealth, made a total price of 7s. 6d. a bushel, the highest ever received by the growers in Australia. The effect of this was to rescue many wheat-growers in northern New South Wales from their difficulties, and place them in a sound financial position, thanks to a Labour government. Labour governments hav0 always done everything possible to assist those engaged in the key industries of wheat-growing and wool-raising. <inline font-style="italic">[Leave to continue given.]</inline> In 1930, when the Scullin Government was in power, a bill was passed to provide for a compulsory wheat pool with a guaranteed price to the growers of 4s. a bushel. Arrangements were made with the Commonwealth Bank for it to finance the pool, and make advances to growers on delivery of wheat it railway sidings. This bill was rejected by the Senate - some of the Country party senators voting against it. In December, 1930, another bill was passed to provide a guarantee of 3s. a bushel, without a pool, but, on the Commonwealth Bank Board receiving a legal opinion that it was not constitutional, it declined to make the money available. </para>

                    <para>Later in that year, a bill providing for a fiduciary note issue was passed through the House of Representatives. It was proposed to find £3,500,000 for a wheat bounty and £2,500,000 for distressed wheat-growers, making in all £6,000,000 for wheat-growers. That bill vas rejected in the Senate by the antiLabour senators. In spite of these setbacks, the Labour Government still persisted, and in 1931, made available £3,296,000 with which to pay a bounty of 4£d. a bushel to wheat-growers, on all wheat marketed. Yet, in face of these determined attempts to help the wheatgrowers, and of the practical assistance given to them, some members of the Country party persist in saying that the Labour Government did nothing for the wheat-growers. I hope that a bill will be introduced immediately for the fixing of a home-consumption price for wheat. </para>

                        <para>.- I am very sorry that the honorable member for Gwydir (Mr! Scully) should have endeavoured to make of this more of a party question than one of assistance to the farmers. He has indulged in exaggerations, and has made statements that are far from correct regarding the record of the Labour party in its dealings with  the wheat-farmers. I endorse the statement of the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wilson)</inline> regarding the serious position of many of the agriculturists throughout the greater part of Australia. In South Australia, Victoria, in many parts of New South Wales, and in Western Australia, the drought has been very severe, and this, combined with the very low price of wheat, has placed the growers in a position of extraordinary difficulty. Something drastic must be done to meet the position. Recently, it was decided, after much argument, to introduce legislation to provide a home consumption price for wheat. As was pointed out by the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> just now, wo are awaiting the passing of legislation by the State parliaments before complementary legislation is introduced into this Parliament to give effect to that decision, that is the fixing of a home consumption price of wheat. It would be  a  great pity if the scheme had to be dropped. In Western Australia, the wheat pool has decided to make  a  first advance of only ls. 3d. or ls. 4d.  a  bushel at sidings. When we realize how high is the cost of production, and the many difficulties which the farmers have to face, it is evident that this is an unpayable price, even for the man who gets 20 bushels an acre. Only a few days ago I gave notice to the secretary of our party that I proposed to call  a  meeting to discuss this matter. The meeting was held this morning, and it was decided to bring the matter before the Government with  a  view to having the scheme gone on with as soon as possible, and to urge that some relief be granted to growers, not on an acreage basis, .but in accordance with their needs. </para>

                            <para>- He could have attended if he thought fit. I should like the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> to give an assurance that, if the States pass the necessary acts, the Opposition in this House will support legislation providing for a home consumption price for wheat. It may be true that some wheat farmers on big areas of 10,000 or 15,000 acres are in a sound financial position, but I am not asking for assistance on their behalf. I am asking for assistance for those who are in actual need. In my own electorate there are more than 1,000 farmers, many of whom have been growing wheat for only the last seven or eight years. They were not able to take advantage of the good prices which ruled up to 1929. In 1930 and 1931 they had magnificent crops, but prices were ruinously low. Since then they have had drought after drought. lt is true that many of the farmers are operating in marginal areas, but I do not want to see them forced off the land. After all, they are the cream of our population, and they are battling along, year after year, under the most adverse conditions. The Commonwealth Government should do something to help them. It should at least lend money to the State governments without interest for a number of years to enable production to be carried on. Honorable members must realize the enormous value to Australia of the wheat industry. In my opinion the economic collapse in 1930 was due entirely to the catastrophic decline of export values, which was the direct cause of all the misery suffered by the people during the depression years. It would be ruinous from a national viewpoint not to continue the development of a comprehensive production programme in order to increase our population and ensure the safety of the nation. There can be no doubt about the necessity for Commonwealth assistance to our primary producers. I have in my hand a graph which includes data taken from Table 13 of the memorandum on the international wheat situation, prepared by the secretariat of the Wheat Advisory Committee in London. This data has been checked carefully. It shows that over a long period of years, from 1922-23 to 1937-38, the purchasing power of a bushel of wheat in Argentina, Canada and the United States of America, in every year, and in some years to a very great extent, was much higher than in Australia. This, I contend, has been due entirely to Commonwealth policy. I pointed out some time ago that a return, prepared by a qualified accountant, showed that the cost of the development of a thousand-acre  farm in Western Australia in 1913, was £2,600, and in 1931 was £4,400, an increase of nearly 100 per cent. In these circumstances there is a definite obligation on the Commonwealth Government to do something to assist the establishment of a home-consumption price should be utilized to keep these men on the land." I am not now speaking only for farmers in my own State, but for wheat-growers throughout the Commonwealth. Enormous losses have been </para>

                    <para class="block">industry. This could be done by agreeing to the proposal for a home consumption price for wheat and making available a sum of, say, £500,000, to assist farmers who are in financial difficulties. If this cannot be done, some portion at least of the money derived from the suffered by many wheat-growers in other States. Some farmers may not be In urgent need, but I know that a great many wheat-growers are, year after year, finding it most difficult to carry on. Rather than allow these people to go off the land and increase unemployment in the cities, assistance should be given by the Commonwealth Government, not only in the interests of the farmers themselves, but also in the interests of the nation. In reply to the statements made by the honorable member for Gwydir <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully),</inline> I point out that the Loan Council is not controlled by the Commonwealth Government. Each State has one vote on the council and the Commonwealth has only two, so that the States have full control, if they desire to utilize it. I am, however, more concerned with the present condition of the wheat-farmers than with political considerations. I hope that all parties will unite in an appeal to State governments and to the Commonwealth Government to fix a home-consumption price for wheat and also to provide the very necessary assistance to those farmers who are in dire need of it. </para>

                        <para>.- I welcome the motion because it gives honorable members an opportunity to impress upon the Government the necessity for steps being taken to deal with the effect upon the nation generally of the desperate condition of the wheat industry. In my opinion, this problem ranks only second in importance to that of unemployment. The present situation has arisen during the last twelve months and has been accentuated from day to day by a continuous fall of the price of wheat as well as by the neglect of the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> deal with it. Whenever the subject has been raised in this House, it has been the practice of the present Government, since I have come into this Parliament at all events, to throw responsibility on to State governments. </para>

                            <para>- The present Government has consistently shirked its obligations by endeavouring to place on State governments responsibility for action to assist our wheat-growers. The Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> this afternoon made an interesting statement, which contained a mass of historical data. He told us that there had been an inquiry by a royal commission into the condition of the wheat industry and that the previous Lyons Government had given effect to sixteen of the recommendations made by that body which cost this country £29,000. I ask the right honorable gentleman to name one recommendation that has been of substantial help to the wheat-farmer. </para>

                            <para>- Everybody who has read the speech of the Minister for Commerce knows that, in respect of debt adjustment, the right honorable gentleman made the plain statement that £12,000,000 would be made available by the Commonwealth to assist the States over a period of three years. Now the right honorable gentleman tells us that, under the arrangements of the Loan Council, a certain amount of loan money is allocated to the States to assist them in carrying on their ordinary public works' programme; therefore, the wheat farmers and other farmers must suffer. </para>

I do not wish to indulge in recrimination, but I think it is high time that this National Parliament faced up to its obligation in respect of this problem. It should not await the passing of uniform legislation by the different States, nor should it be necessary to call a meeting of representatives of the States and insist on unanimity among them when a new problem arises such as is confronting us to-day by reason of drought. This Parliament has all the financial and other powers necessary to give effective relief to wheat-growers and to distressed farmers generally. </para>

                            <para>-I did, and I am proud of the fact. It ill becomes this Parliament, when confronted with certain obstacles by virtue of a decision of the High Court, to unload its obligation, to decline to explore new methods which undoubtedly exist, and to thrust back on the States the initiative in the matter. While conferences are being held by State governments, whose capacity to raise money is limited, the Commonwealth Parliament being all-powerful in the financial sphere, the wheat-growers lose their means of livelihood and the unemployment problem is intensified. I am not very much concerned as to whether the assistance takes the form of a home consumption price, a bounty, or an acreage payment ; but, generally speaking, I have a decided preference for a bounty, according to the factors that operate in any particular area; because I have always felt- and still feel - that, under the home-consumption price proposition, particularly in relation to wheat, flour and the by-products of wheat, the undoubted effect is that the greatest burden is borne by the weakest and poorest section of the community, who are the greatest bread-eaters. I do not think that that can be successfully contested. In these circumstances, I, and I hope other members of my party, definitely favour a bounty of a given amount a bushel, or a payment based on an acreage calculation. I know that there are many objections to the payment on an acreage basis ; but I suggest that, because of the factors which operate in Victoria to-day, that basis might be favorably considered. One objection to it is that, as occurs in every walk of life, there are among wheat-growers dishonest people who, if they knew they were to receive an acreage payment yearly, would simply scratch the surface of their land instead of manuring and cultivating it properly. But that could not occur this year, when such persons could not realize that, owing to drought, an acreage basis of payment might be necessary. I put that view even at this late stage - and it is becoming late. The position in Victoria is desperate, and the Government should be courageous. I am not suggesting- - I never have - that the Minister for Commerce and his colleagues are unsympathetically disposed towards this problem, but I do contend that they lack initiative and courage. </para>

                        <para>. - Different honorable members <inline font-style="italic">who</inline> have addressed themselves to this matter have criticized the Government on the score, first that it has failed to provide for a home-consumption price  for  wheat produced within the Commonwealth, and secondly, that it has failed to make available a Treasury advance to distressed wheat-growers throughout  the  Commonwealth who are suffering greatly ab the result of drought losses. </para>

                    <para>In the brief time at my disposal I propose to discuss first the second criticism. 1. combat unequivocally and very strongly the principle enunciated in the proposal that the Commonwealth should accept any responsibility in respect of drought losses incurred by wheat-farmers, or any other farmers, or by graziers, wherever they may operate in this country. I suggest that there is considerable support for my attitude in the fact that no Commonwealth Government of any political complexion has ever accepted such responsibility. </para>

                            <para>- I make that statement subject to correction, but I believe that generally speaking it is substantially correct. In the first place, it is argued that the Commonwealth should accept responsibility in respect of drought losses incurred by wheat-farmers. The acceptance of that proposition would inevitably involve the more general acceptance of responsibility for drought losses incurred not only by wheat-farmers but also by other farmers and graziers. </para>

                            <para>- One could continue <inline font-style="italic">ad libitum.</inline> One cannot enunciate a principle, and claim its acceptance, in respect of the wheat industry, unless one is also prepared to advocate its acceptance in respect of the grazing industry, the fruit-growing industry, or any other industry. The Commonwealth Government dare not put itself in that position. Every practical farmer knows that drought losses are among the inevitable contingencies associated with the conduct of agriculture or grazing. In every part of Australia, those who buy or lease land for the purpose of carrying on agriculture or stock-raising, know perfectly well that they have to consider the possibility, indeed the inevitability, of drought and its resultant losses, when deciding what price they shall pay for the land. Possible drought losses ars always reflected in the price payable for land. Again, this Government could nol put itself in the position of accepting responsibility for losses attributable more or less directly to drought, which would involve it in treating the man who cultivates his soil well in exactly the same manner as the man who cultivates it badly. As every honorable member knows, in almost every district in a fairly dry year will be found one man who has cultivated  wisely,  carefully and well, with the result that he has raised quite a good crop, while his next-door neighbour, who has neglected to cultivate his land, has perhaps failed to harvest any sort of a crop. </para>

                            <para>- The Government cannot treat those two men on an equal basis. It should not encourage - as it would if it accepted responsibility for losses incurred by drought in respect of wheat-growing - the production of wheat on land which, because of climatic conditions or other causes, is unsuited to its production. It is generally recognized that to-day many persons are growing wheat under unsuitable conditions, climatic and other, which make its production unprofitable. If the Government accepts responsibility for drought losses in such circumstances, it will encourage a class of agriculture and a type of settler which should not be encouraged. I there- fore submit that it cannot accept responsibility for losses incurred by wheatgrowers by reason of drought. It has a certain responsibility towards wheatgrowers and has observed that responsibility in recent years. Year by year, it Lias made grants to the weaker States,' which very largely engage in the cultivation of wheat; it is probably their main agricultural industry. It accepts certain responsibility for the effect of drought on the revenues of those States. Consequent upon the recent calamitous depression, provision was made in respect of farmers of all classes in the different States. As the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> has stated, up to date the Commonwealth Government has made available to the various State governments for the assistance of those farmers no less a sum than £6,317,000, and for this year it proposes to make available for debt adjustment the sum of £2,000,000. Whilst it may be possible to criticize with some modicum of justification what the Government has done in that respect, there is no denying the fact that it has made available a larger sum for debt adjustment than any other Ministry has done at any time in the history of the Commonwealth. That is something for which this Government can take considerable credit. </para>

                    <para>The Government, finally, takes responsibility in respect of a home-consumption price for wheat, because it accepts the principle that the man who grows wheat, as much as the man who conducts a dairy farm, or makes boots, or engages in any other form of secondary industry, is entitled to a price for his commodity that is in keeping with Australian standards of living. The Government accepts responsibility in respect of  the  price of wheat, because it realizes, also, that it cannot afford to let the wheat industry languish entirely, on account of the fact that it makes a substantial contribution each year to the overseas funds which this country, through its exports, is able to accumulate. </para>

The reasons (advanced for the motion are sound, and the Opposition can wholeheartedly support it. It is gravely concerned regarding the distress amongst workers through unemployment, and it is equally concerned about the distress amongst struggling primary producers throughout Australia, resulting from droughts and low prices of their commodities.

At the elections in 1931 and 1934, both the Country party and the United Australia party assured the farmers that they would be able to effect the desired economic stability by legislation, if returned to office; but it is quite clear from the speeches delivered this afternoon that the Government has failed to bring about these reforms, as it has failed in other instances. </para>

At the 1934 elections, the Lyons-Page Government promised £20,000,000 to assist distressed farmers. After the elections, that sum waa reduced to £12,000,000, and, in introducing the bill in March, 1935, the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page),</inline> who was Acting Prime Minister, said - </para>

                    <para class="block">What has happened with regard to that money? Up to the 20th June, 1938, which is over three years since the bill was passed, only £4,000,000 had been made available to assist distressed farmers. When the wheat problem was being discussed in the House on the 21st June, 1938, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> referred to these promises, and the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> interjected and asked " Is the Leader of the Country .party the Leader of the Government?"; but I emphasize the point that the Minister for Commerce was Acting Prime Minister when he introduced the bil], and was, undoubtedly, speaking on behalf of the Government. He set out to convince us of that fact. The honorable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nock)</inline> also interjected with the remark " The farmers could have had £3,S00,000 last year, but preferred only £2,000,000." I found, on investigation, that that statement was not only absurd, but also incorrect. Communications were sent to the Premiers of Victoria and Western Australia drawing attention to the statement, and I now quote extracts from the replies which have been received from them. The Premier of Victoria, who is associated with the Country party, wrote as follows: - </para>

As a matter of fact, Victoria at the last meeting of the Loan Council applied to the Commonwealth Government for £1,200,000 and only received £500,000. The settlement of a large number of cases is being held up on account of the Commonwealth Government not meeting its obligations and creditors' and farmers' interests are both being adversely affected. So far as Victoria is concerned, it has always been understood that an allocation of £3,000*000 over a period of three years was to be made.

                            <para>- The honorable member for Gwydir <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> was correct in referring to the misrepresentation sometimes indulged in by certain honorable gentlemen regarding the Labour party's action in assisting the wheat-growing industry. He was wise in pointing to the bill passed in 1930 to provide for a compulsory wheat pool, with a guaranteed price to the growers of 4s. a bushel, and to the £3,296,000 that was later granted by the Scullin Government; also to the action of certain senators of the United Australia and Country parties in defeating the measure. </para>

                            <para>- But I understand that the honorable member is quite satisfied with the proposals submitted originally by the States, which are now under consideration by the parliaments of the various States and are likely to be presented to this Parliament soon. Supplementary to these, he also wants an additional sum made available from some source, preferably the Commonwealth Bank, if I correctly interpreted his suggestion, as a sort of relief bounty to meet the special circumstances of farmers affected by drought conditions, particularly in Victoria. I am pleased, indeed, to know from the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, who is, I suppose, the highest authority on the Opposition side present in the chamber at the moment, and who was speaking for his party, that the Government is bound to have the support of the Labour party when these proposals come before the House. I had no doubt that the Labour party, with its well-known anxiety for the welfare of the wheat-growers, would support the Government up to the hilt. </para>

The Labour Government enjoyed a very large majority in this House, and proposals submitted by it for the benefit of the primary producers were supported by members of the Country party. The proposal referred to was defeated in another place by certain Western Australian gentlemen, who acted on instructions from the Western Australian wheat-growers' organizations. </para>

                            <para>- I take this opportunity to tender my thanks to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for making Lt quite clear that when the legislation for the establishment of a home-consumption price for wheat comes before this chamber it will receive the support of the members of his party. If that is so, the Government will have no difficulty in having it passed by Parliament as quickly as possible, thus enabling much-needed relief to be afforded very rapidly to the necessitous farmers of Australia. </para>

                    <para>The question of the provision of an extra amount for the relief of necessitous farmers was raised by the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wilson).</inline> In respect of that, I can only repeat what my colleague the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> has already pointed out, that the States have been asked to formulate proposals for the consideration of the Commonwealth Government. The States know well that the Commonwealth Government is sympathetic to the claims of the wheat-growers, and if it is practicable to do what the States want, and if they display the same unanimity as they have already done in regard to the original proposal for a home-consumption price, there will be not the slightest difficulty, as far as this Government is con corned, in giving their proposals effect, It is not known yet what method for the assistance of the wheat industry will be adopted; the Commonwealth is waiting to hear what the States have to say in regard to it; but I assure the honorable member that he need have no doubt whatever that when the States, which are at present holding up their legislation, have agreed upon the necessary details, no time will be lost by this Government ii» passing the necessary implementing legislation, so that distressed farmers, irrespective of whether their difficulties have been brought about because of low prices or drought conditions, shall receive their just due. </para>
                    <para>The Deputy Leader of the  Opposition  repeated the misleading statement so often tittered, that the States are being deprived by the Commonwealth of money that should be devoted to debt relief.

He always seems afraid that his arguments, so carefully prepared, might be destroyed by a simple interjection. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members know that the allocation of money for debt relief is determined, not by this Government or this Parliament, but by the Loan Council, on which the States have a majority of the votes. The States, through their votes on the council, can decide not only the amount of loan money to be made available each year but also the proportion to be allocated to farmers' debt relief. What <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dunstan,</inline> the Premier of Victoria, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Willcock,</inline> the Premier of Western Australia, have done is only what one would expect. Those gentlemen asked for two or three times the amount allocated by the Loan Council last year for farmers' debt relief. Before the meeting of the Loan Council Victoria made a demand for £1,500,000 for that purpose. It is significant that the request was made, not to the Loan Council, but to the Commonwealth Government, which has no power to deal with the matter. The Loan Council may decide, for instance, that out of the total loan moneys available two-thirds shall be appropriated for distribution to the States for public works and the balance for farmers' debt relief and other purposes. "When a decision is reached by the Council the State Premiers know how much money will be provided for their works programmes and for debt relief. </para>

                            <para>- It is. The money is then passed over to the States and the States themselves determine the amount of money which is to be distributed by them for farmers' debt relief. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dunstan</inline> received only £500,000 last year it was because that was all his State was entitled to receive after the Loan Council, of which he is a member, had decided how much would be made available in that particular year. The same remarks apply to Western Australia. Although that State might require £3,000,000 for farmers' debt relief, after the States have decided on the allocation of moneys for their public works programmes it might be found that only £500,000 could be made available for Western Australia for farmers' debt relief. The Treasurer has promised that money shall be made available by the Commonwealth to the States as they require it. Thus, the onus is upon th« States to distribute it as they think best. The reason why the States have not received sufficient money for farmers' debt relief is because they have absorbed relatively too much money in financing public works. </para>

                        <para>.- I think that the members of this House who are seised of the position of the wheatgrowers do give them their sympathy; but I think that this Parliament has not only to consider the position as  it  affects the wheat-growers themselves but also to recognize how seriously their position reacts  on  the national position. The figures published  in  the press a few days ago with regard to the prospects of the wheat crop in the various States were - </para>

                    <para class="block">It will be seen that the total is approximately 132,000,000 bushels, compared with 186,000,000 bushels last year. When we take the relative price of last year's crop, after having kept out seed, and compare  it  with this year's prospective crop, after having kept out seed,  it  will be found that the farmers this year will receive about £11,500,000 for their crop, whereas last year it was worth £34,000,000. It represents a reduction of £22,500,000. When people are fully aware of these figures they will see how serious the position is both to the wheat-grower and to the economic welfare of Australia. It has been admitted by the Federal Government that  it  is prepared to co-operate with the States in order to bring  in  a scheme to provide a home-consumption price for wheat. I was pleased to hear the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wilson)</inline> say very definitely that he  did  not desire any interference with the basis and the principles of that proposed scheme, but that he advocated that there should be some extra assistance for those necessitous farmers who have been affected by drought and who will harvest little or no crop in respect of which they could participate in the distribution of money from that source. The position of the Government, as I see it, was outlined fairly clearly by the honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. John Lawson).</inline> There must be a line of demarcation as to what its responsibility is, what is the responsibility of the State governments, and what is the responsibility of the individual wheat-grower, and nobody else's but his own. We know that neither the Federal nor any State government has any say in regard to the locality in which a wheat grower decides to farm or as to the methods adopted by an individual farmer in growing his crop, the acreage or seed he plants, or whether or not he uses superphosphate. Consequently I say that many of the disabilities of the man on the land are not the responsibility of the Federal Government. But the tariff effect on his costs is a responsibility of the Federal Government, and the burden of arbitration, which is national policy, cannot be borne by anybody else but the Commonwealth Government. It should not be put on the exporting industry. The primary producer has also to pay for workmen's compensation and will soon be burdened by contributions to the national insurance fund. Unlike those engaged in secondary industries he is unable to pass those costs on. </para>

                            <para>- I submit that there is an obligation on the Commonwealth Government to compensate wheat-growers for the cost of these burdens. But compensation for drought is not a federal responsibility. If there is necessity for particular assistance because of this or any other cause, it is for the State governments  to  take whatever action they consider necessary. It may apply only to a part of a particular State or to the whole of  a  particular State, but to one State only, and, in. these circumstances, it is not a federal responsibility. Men are established on the land in certain areas of various States which are quite unsuitable for wheat-growing, and governments w hich encouraged them to go there should have to shoulder the burden of any assistance necessary to aid them to carry on. This point should be considered. The proposed home-consumption price scheme will assist the industry, but not discriminate in favour of any particular farmers in the industry. Those farmers in the industry whose successful operations have been prejudiced by drought conditions and other unfortunate circumstances should make an appeal to the State governments, but if the State governments cannot provide the necessary finance for relief, I would take no exception to the Federal Government providing money on. loan to the State governments, possibly free of interest, so that they could have no ground upon which they could refuse assistance where it was justified. The £12,000,000 being provided by the Commonwealth Government for rehabilitation is surely all for which it should be asked. It would be a great mistake to mix necessitous cases with the proposal for a home-consumption price, the principle of which has been agreed upon by six State governments and the Federal Government. It would be a catastrophe to break down that principle. I may add that I have received advice from the leading farmers' organizations in Western Australia in support of this view. </para>

                    <para>Some incorrect statements have been made during the course of this, debate. The honorable member for Gwydir <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> referred to assistance provided by the New South Wales Labour Government in 1920 as being the greatest measure of assistance which the wheat industry has ever received from any government. The fact is that the New South "Wales growers received a. guaranteed price of 7s. 6d. a bushel, 5s. guaranteed by the Commonwealth Government a.nd 2s. fid. by the State </para>
                    <para class="block">Government; but 1 would remind the honorable member that the world's price for wheat at that time, and paid to growers in States where no guaranteed price applied, averaged 7s. 4½d. a bushel. The Victorian farmers received 7s. 4½d. a bushel. The extra advantage received by the New South Wales wheat-growers, as the result of the guarantee, was only 1½d. a bushel on a crop of 53,000,000 bushels, less seed. The burden imposed upon the taxpayer to provide the extra. l½d. a bushel was 3d. a bushel. Thus, the taxpayers had to find a -total of £600,000, of which the wheat-growers received only £300,000. The honorable member compares that advantage of £300,000 with the £14,000,000 which this Government has provided by way of assistance to wheat-growers, and then claims that the New South Wales Labour Government did more in 1920 to assist the wheat-growers than has ever been done by any other government in Australia. Surely the fallacy is obvious. The honorable member's statements are not in accordance with facts nor are those of the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> in regard to rural rehabilitation. They show that he has not a clear conception of the manner in which the Loan Council operates, because he contended that some of the money allocated for rural rehabilitation purposes has been used for public works. That is not so. The Loan Council has the power to allocate a certain proportion of the money raised by loan for specific purposes, and the State Ministers, having a majority on the Loan Council, have the power to determine the purposes for  which such amounts are made available. The Commonwealth Government does not intend to default in its promise that £12,000,000 shall he made available. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of my motion is to . upset the arbitrary action of the Government in making regulations under the Customs Act in order to prohibit the export of iron ore from Yampi Sound. I thank honorable members opposite for their vote against the motion of- the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> for the postponement of all intervening business on the notice-paper until after my motion had been disposed of, because it showed that they have sympathy with my motion. They know that, if my motion were not discussed and disposed of, either to-day or to-morrow, the regulations, for the disallowance of which I have moved, would become void. That would have achieved my objective. But it was because of that fact that the Minister for the Interior moved his motion. The attitude taken by honorable members opposite assures me that I shall have their support when a vote is taken. I ask honorable members to realize the significance and importance of the regulations which I seek to have disallowed. The Ministry, without consulting Parliament, and without endeavouring to bring down legislation to deal with the subject, gazetted customs regulations of vital concern to the policy of this country. Similar methods  wore adopted with the trade diversion policy, which caused immense losses to graziers and wheat-growers, and honorable members should resent such important decisions being applied without the approval of Parliament. There is too much apathy among honorable members of Parliament towards Executive action without the authority of Parliament. A long period has elapsed since I placed my motion on the notice-paper, but, until to-day, when it was realized by the Government that it would have to be disposed of, I have not had the opportunity to move it. Members of this Parliament are losing that control of Parliament and of legislation which is essential to the best interests of parliamentary government, and it behoves them to enforce their rights. </para>
                    <para>It is worth while to recall the events which led up to the imposition of the embargo on the export of iron ore from this country. It was imposed simply as the result of the report of a departmental officer to the Ministry. It was the most drastic action that it was possible for the Government to take, and its results have been detrimental to the interests not only of the State of Western Australia, but also, I venture to suggest, of the Commonwealth as a whole. The embargo could quite possibly have become a major issue resulting in hostility to Australia on the part of other nations. When a government does something that is likely to cause serious trouble, it is the duty of this Parliament to decide immediately whether or not its action is justified. For a long time prior to the imposition of the embargo all of the actions of the Government in respect of the export of iron ore, showed that it had no objection to it; but there was a sudden change of policy, and an embargo was enforced. In substantiation of my claim that the Government made a <inline font-style="italic">volte face,</inline> I shall, at a later stage, quote from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and various documents. There would have been extreme antagonism towards an embargo had it been imposed even early in the history of the development of the iron ore deposits at Yampi Sound, when comparatively little expenditure had been outlayed; that antagonism must be intensified now when tens of thousands of pounds of expenditure has gone for nothing, because of the Government's change of policy. It is in the interests of Western Australia that I have moved this motion, because that State will undoubtedly suffer a great financial penalty as the result of the Government's action. Another motive that actuates me is the fact that for more than 20 years I have advocated greater freedom of trade between nations of the world. That I am not alone in that attitude is amply shown in the annual report of the Department of External Affairs for the year ended, the 31st December. 1937, page 65 of which contains the following passage :  - </para>

                    <para class="block">On the one hand, we have the Minister for External Affairs advising the people of Australia and members of this Parliament as to suggestions that have been made by the Economic Committee of the League of Nations on the need for breaking down international trade barriers, and on the other, the Commonwealth Ministry, including the Minister for External Affairs, agreeing to do the very thing which it was counselled not to do in these suggestions. It was as the result of a somewhat similar policy in Europe that this country, along with other countries of the world, a few weeks ago was confronted with the likelihood of a repetition of the horrors of 1914-18. The situation was engendered by Germany, like Italy, previously, and Japan, even now, demanding expansion. In Australia  we have an area, almost the size of the United States of America, supporting a population of about 7,000,000 people, which, in itself, presents a grave menace to this country's safety. Yet, when there is more than a possibility of the develop- ment of a sparsely-settled part of this. great nation by the development of the iron ore deposits on the north-west coast of Western Australia, the Government prevents that development by prohibiting the export of that ore. </para>
                    <para>Only a few weeks ago we were oppressed by the fear of war, with a renewal of all the horrors of 1914-18. The League of Nations has proved to be a complete failure in its efforts to preserve peace. Pacts of non-aggression and of mutual assistance have been found wanting. Not only have they not prevented war, but also they have not solved the primary essential of the cause, of war. We ought to do more than spend millions of pounds to protect ourselves; we must go to the people and tell them the fundamental causes of war. And restraint of trade, excessively high tariff restrictions, embargoes on imports and exports, are undoubtedly those fundamental causes.  They breed discord, antipathy and a sense of injustice. When we extend the policy to the application of an embargo on raw materials in the manner that we have done, we flaunt a policy of "what we have we hold ", irrespective of the needs of the nations of the world. </para>
                    <para>The embargo applies only to iron ore, but honorable members know that for years past hundreds of thousands of tons of iron ore have been exported from Australia, by, not an outside organization, but the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, the only great smelting company that we have in Australia. At the present moment, the Government, by licensing exports, is allowing that company to meet contracts which had been made for the delivery of iron ore overseas, up to the end of 1938. I cannot imagine that it was the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited that informed the Government there was likely to be a shortage of iron ore in Australia, because it would be a strange thing, if it had that information, for it to be exporting vast quantities of iron ore for many years to japan and the United States of America. It has been said in support of the embargo that iron ore is an essential to the manufacture of munitions for war purposes, but I remind the Government that there are other materials equally essential for that purpose, the export of which from Australia remains unchecked - pig iron, iron and steel, copper, spelter, wolfram, tantalite, and scrap iron. </para>
                    <para>At least three years ago the Government was aware of the development that was taking place at Yampi Sound, because certain questions about the project were asked and answered in this Parliament by the then Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page).</inline> About a year later another question was asked as to whether certain Japanese assayers were to be allowed to enter the country in order to watch the operations of the company. I am constrained at this point to emphasize to honorable members that the laws of Western Australia do not permit Asiatics to work on mining projects in that State. I also emphasize that the company which was set up to exploit the iron ore deposits at Yampi Sound was an English company which had financial assistance from Japan. Only people of our own nationality could be employed at Yampi Sound. The honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drakeford),</inline> three years ago, asked a number of questions relating to the export of iron ore from Yampi Sound and in doing so explained the position from his viewpoint. The right honorable member for Cowper, in his capacity as Acting Prime Minister, answered the questions thus :  - </para>

The original contract was for 25,000,000 tons, but, later, the quantity was reduced to 15,000,000 tons. If an emergency arose, how different the position would be if development had proceeded to that stage ! A syndicate in Western Australia expended over £8,000 in 1922 in an attempt to get British people interested in these deposits, but the people in England pointed out that the distance from that country was so great that they could not associate themselves with the enterprise. Yet there are people in Australia who tell us that the decision of the Commonwealth Government was made at the request of the British Government. There has been no request by the British Government for such action. The answer of the Minister continued - </para>

                        <para>I wish to dispel any misapprehension that may exist in regard to the attitude of the Commonwealth Government in connexion with the export of iron ore from Yampi Sound. A preliminary survey of the potential supplies of iron ore has revealed the existence of very considerable deposits, sufficient for all our requirements for a great many years ahead. </para>

                    <para class="block">The exports of iron ore from Malaya amount to about 1,000,000 tons a year. The deposits at Yampi Sound have remained untouched for thousands of years, and although efforts were made to obtain British capital to develop them, it was only when Japanese capital was made available that their exploitation was undertaken. I emphasize that, although Japanese capital would have been expended to develop the deposits, no Japanese labour could have been employed. The arrangement between H. A. Brassert and Company Limited and the Nippon Mining Company to provide £300,000 was somewhat similar to an agreement entered into for the development of some deposits of crystollite asbestos in Western Australia. This material, which is difficult to mine, is useful for making clothes for firemen, drop scenes for theatres, and other purposes where a fire-resisting material is required. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fenton,</inline> a manufacturer of asbestos clothing in England, visited Western Australia where he found a man trying to develop a small asbestos deposit. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fenton</inline> told him that without machinery success was impossible, and offered to supply a plant from England. An arrangement that half the value of the . product of the mine from time to time should be applied to meet the cost of the plant was entered into. The arrangement entered into for the development of the iron ore deposits at Yampi Sound was similar, although on a larger scale. I cannot understand the Government's sudden change of attitude. </para>

All honorable members will agree that the peopling of that part of Australia is of vital importance. Here was an opportunity for the employment of 200 or 300 Australian workmen directly in the production of iron ore, but no one could say what other developments might have taken place had the work been proceeded with. I have been to Yampi Sound, and I realize something of its possibilities. In addition to great deposits of iron ore, there is a magnificent harbour. Moreover, it is claimed that in the vicinity there is not only copper, but also coal and gold. The Government's decision was made despite the fact that it did not know of any other company willing to undertake the development of these deposits. It arbitrarily decided that the works should be closed down, regardless of the consequences to Western Australia. The Premier of Western* Australia, speaking in the State legislature, recently said - </para>

The amount of royalty lost will be £250,000. Wages lost, which would .have been paid to Western Australian workers, reckoning 200 men at an average of £6 10s. a week, approximate £1.000,000. </para>

                    <para>The decision of the Commonwealth Government will result in heavy losses to Western Australia. I should like to know what induced the Government to take this action, and, particularly, the reason for keeping secret the reports of the Government Geologist. Why were not his reports tabled in Parliament, as I repeatedly requested? It is true that some short reports, dealing, for the most part, with generalities, have been made available, but no full report has been released. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woolnough</inline> may be a good lecturer on geology, but I do not regard him as an authority on mining engineering.

Official estimates of tonnages available lie between 150,000,000 and 200,000,000 tons. These deposits do and must unquestionably constitute the backbone of the Australian iron industry for a long time to come. Unfortunately, the largest deposits of the group show an increasing percentage of manganese, to more than the admissible limit, with increasing depth of exploitation. This must be' counteracted by dilution of the ore with other, iron ore low in manganese, since the manganese cannot effectively be removed in smelting. </para>

But I remind the House that an arrangement had been made that if Australia desired to smelt any of the ore it could be supplied with such quantities as it requested.

                    <para>I admit that some of the deposits to which reference is made in the article are not accessible and might be very costly to develop; but some of them are quite accessible. As to the economic handling of the ore, I do not know whether the Government has given any consideration to the probable cost of shipping ore from Yampi Sound to Newcastle under Australian conditions. That would be a costly operation. At present, the freight charge between Sydney and Darwin is £3 a ton, though no doubt if large parcels of iron ore were shipped that rate would be reduced, but freight costs around the tropical north of "Western Australia would be very high. There were good, economic reasons for continuing to develop the deposit at Yampi. I am not very greatly impressed by the statement that Australia could not afford to allow additional quantities of ore to be exported. Statements of that kind are frequently made in respect of various commodities obtainable in different countries. Not so long ago a report was issued to the effect that the export of petrol and crude oils from the United States of America would be prohibited; that was due to the fear that the oil wells would, become exhausted. But nothing has been done in that regard. The limitation of our iron ore deposits is not nearly so serious as some honorable gentlemen have stated. </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid I cannot deal with that intricate subject in reply to questions. As far back as 1926-27, the Bruce-Page Government brought British specialists to Australia to make geophysical surveys in various parts of the country. At that time, an amount of £32,000 was expended in such work. One result of it is the development of the Captain's Flat mine, not far from Canberra. The present Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> introduced a bill into this Parliament not very long ago which provided for the making of geological and geophysical surveys of certain parts of North Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Parliament passed the bill, and an amount of £180,000 was expended under its pro visions, but, so far as I know, there is very little to show for it. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline> The introduction and passing of that bill showed that the Government and the Parliament had considerable confidence in geophysical survey work. </para>

                    <para>I ask now that arrangements be made for a thorough geophysical examination of the iron ore deposits of Australia to ascertain their probable extent and quality, so that 1,Ve may have reliable and up-to-date information on the real position of Australia in respect of iron ore reserves. If a geophysical survey had been made we should have been enabled, within a couple of months, to ascertain the extent and tonnage of these deposits. Some honorable members seem to be inclined to treat this matter lightly, but developments in geophysics during the last century in Sweden, and Germany,' and more recently in Russia and the United States of America, prove that geophysical surveys offer a means of estimating fairly accurately the tonnage of dense bodies of ore. When I advocated the adoption of this method the Treasurer replied to me by letter stating that geophysical methods would not enable us to arrive at the value of the ore. The value of the ore was beside the point. The Government's advisers estimate the quantity of ore available at Koolan Island and Cockatoo Island at from 60,000,000 to 90,000,000 tons. That is the available ore above high water level, but it is quite possible that treble that tonnage could be profitably won below high water level. </para>

                        <para>- I submit that we could have got that information fairly accurately through geophysical survey. However, the Government intends to survey the deposits at Yampi Sound by tunnelling, and it will bear the whole of that expenditure, which, it is estimated, will be between £30,000 and E40,000. That estimate was supplied to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Major Vail</inline> when I was last in Western Australia. <inline font-style="italic">[Leave to continue given."]</inline> I repeat that if the results obtained from the geophysical method in other countries are of- any value at all, we could get a fairly accurate idea of the  tonnage of these deposits. It is ridiculous to accept the report that ore below the high-water level at Yampi Sound cannot be mined. We shall not get anywhere if we accept advice of that kind. </para>

                        <para>remind honorable members of the loss which it is estimated Western Australia will suffer through the imposition of this embargo. We must also bear in mind the loss of trade with Japan which will result from the imposition of this embargo. All of us are aware of the losses which the wool-growers of this country sustained as the result of this Government's trade diversion policy. I entirely disapprove of legislation of this kind. I cannot go so far as to allege that the Government, in imposing this embargo, yielded to vicious influences. I prefer to believe that it was actuated by the fear that Japan might obtain control of the valuable deposits at Yampi Sound. That fear, however, is quite unfounded, because every safeguard has been provided to ensure that the Government of Western Australia, as well as this Government, shall retain that control. I repeat that it would bo far more preferable to develop these resources than merely to allow them to remain unworked. I recall that when, in 1924, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited was approached with the object of developing these deposits it refused to have anything to do with the proposition. So small a quantity as 15,000,000 tons which, it was proposed, should be the maximum quantity allowed to be exported under this contract, is but a small proportion of the total deposits. The exploitation of these deposits would mean a great deal in the development of the northwest, and would enable us to police and people that part of the Commonwealth, whereas the policy of this Government in this instance must not only antagonize other nations, but also destroy Western Australia's hope of settling the north-west and inflict a serious injury on that State in respect of its commerce and finances. </para>

                    <para>I listened very carefully to the speech of the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory).</inline> In moving my amendment, I do not want honorable members to assume that I am in favour of allowing the export of iron ore from Australia if it can be shown that we have not more than sufficient reserves to meet the requirements of our great key industries. Our first duty should be to Australia, and we should not approach this subject from a purely State viewpoint but from the viewpoint of the interests of Australia as a whole. As a protectionist and a strong advocate for the development of Australia's primary and secondary industries, I emphasize that we must give first consideration to our own requirements. I have a right to ask, however, what are our resources of iron ore ? Is the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> yet iu a. position to make any definite statement in that respect in addition to that made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> when he announced the imposition of this embargo? Parliament has a right to the very latest information from the Government on this point. "We also have a right to call upon the Government to do something towards developing these valuable iron ore resources at Yampi Sound. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but as the result of the imposition of this embargo, the men already employed there will lose .their jobs. Consequently the concern exhibited by the Western Australian Government is more than justified. This Government cannot allow the matter merely to rest where it is. Searching investigations should be made to ascertain just what are the iron, ore resources of Australia. We should be told what steps are proposed by the Government to have those resources developed, in co-operation with the State governments of Australia. Has it any scheme for the exploitation of those resources? Has it approached the Government of Western Australia, or of any other State in which there are rich deposits? It is not justified in adopting a " dog-in-the-manger " attitude, or the policy of vacillation which has characterized its administration during the last three or four years. The statement by the honorable member for Swan, that in the opinion of the British Government, to be of use in an emergency any iron ore deposits must first be developed, is worthy of attention. In time of emergency, it would be of no use merely to point to iron ore deposits at Yampi Sound or other remote parts of Australia, and say, " Look at the raw material we have for our iron and steel works " ; they must be developed. </para>

                            <para>-/That statement furnishes ample justification for the amendment I have moved. The obligation is on the Commonwealth to ascertain definitely the resources available in Australia, with a view to their early development  and exploitation in co-operation with the States, so that they may not remain in their present undeveloped condition. The honorable member for Swan is reasonable when he says he is much concerned about the future development of the north-west of Australia. He knows the north-west of Australia very well. My only regret is that he does not always take a deep interest in industries which affect the north-eastern portion of the continent. He is very sound on the development of the iron ore deposits of the north-west, but evinces little interest in the fostering of the great sugar-growing industry in the vulnerable north-east, preferring the importation of sugar from Java or other coloured-labour countries. On that matter, he and I do not see eye to eye. If he were as sound in regard to the north-east as he is in regard to the north-west he would be a thoroughly good Australian. </para>

                    <para>The iron ore deposits of Australia have been the subject of a great deal of controversy for some considerable time, but it was not until May of this year that the Commonwealth Government decided to impose an embargo on export. We were then informed that it intended to make a comprehensive survey. I want to know just what has been done. The Government's attitude has been characterized by hesitancy, uncertainty, and contradictory statements. I was amazed at some of the statements quoted by the honorable member for Swan, particularly the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Pearce, as Leader of the Government in the Senate, that to take steps to prevent the export of iron ore from Yampi Sound would be playing into the hands of Germany, and that the Commonwealth Government had no intention of prohibiting such exports. </para>

When the stage was reached at which something might be done in a big way, the prohibition of exports was like " a bolt from the blue ". It would seem that the Government more or less went to sleep, as the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">("Mr. Wilson)</inline> this afternoon accused it of having done in regard to affording relief to wheat-growers. It has been repeatedly accused of being lethargic, and extremely difficult to move, in regard to a number of other big matters. Indeed, but for the pertinacity of the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drakeford),</inline> in raising this subject on numerous occasions by means of questions, the position in regard to the export of iron ore "would have been completely overlooked. </para>

                    <para>I find that the Government earlier opposed the placing of a ban on the export of iron ore. In the beginning of last year the then Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> said that the Federal Government had no intention whatever to prohibit the export of scrap iron or other metals, even if they were to be used for war purposes by a foreign country. That bore out what had been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Pearce, who for several years had been Minister for Defence. Yet twelve months later the Government decided to impose a ban on exports ! In my opinion, it is largely to blame for the position that has arisen, and from which it is to-day endeavouring to extricate itself. </para>
                    <para>There is no doubt that Yampi Sound has very valuable iron ore deposits, which are a great asset to Australia and should not be sacrificed if they are likely to be required by our secondary industries. Various estimates have been made of their extent. We have been told by one geologist and engineer that there is 63,000,000 tons at Koolan Island and 90,000,000 tons at Cockatoo Island - the two islands in Yampi Sound where these great deposits lie. We must not forget, however, that at the present time Australia uses 2,000,000 tons of iron ore per annum. </para>

                            <para>- This is a difficult and delicate problem for any government to deal with. Whilst I stand for the placing of Australia's requirements first, I appreciate the difficulties confronting the State of Western Australia, which contemplated the development of the rich resources at Yampi Sound with imported capital, and consequent increase of employment in the north-west provinces. However, the interests of the whole of Australia must be paramount. That is why I approve of the imposition of an embargo on' the export of iron ore. It is, however, the duty of the Commonwealth to ascertain, at the earliest possible moment, the true iron ore resources of Australia, and, in cooperation with the State governments concerned, take whatever steps may be necessary to develop them. The Commonwealth should not wait until a state of  emer- gency has arisen, because it would take probably twelve or eighteen months to install the machinery necessary to bring the deposits to the point of production. </para>

                    <para>Prior to the dinner suspension, I mentioned Koolan Island and Cockatoo Island, and apparently gave the impression that they contain 63,000,000 and 90,000,000 tons of iron ore respectively. That, of course, is wrong. The Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> asked me where I obtained my information. My answer is that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woolnough,</inline> the Commonwealth Geological Adviser, stated in one of his reports that the Yampi Sound deposits had been variously estimated to contain from <inline font-style="italic">63,000,000</inline> tons to about <inline font-style="italic">90,000,000</inline> tons of iron ore. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woolnough</inline> also said - </para>

                        <para>At present we are using over 2.000,000 tons of ore a year. In view of the expansion of the iron and steel industries of Australia which has taken place during the last few years and the practical certainty of further large expansions within the next few years, it is certain that if the known supplies of high grade ore are not conserved, Australia will, in a little more than a generation, become an importer rather than a producer of iron ore. </para>

                    <para class="block">We may take it that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woolnough</inline> had no axe to grind, and that his sole purpose was to safeguard the interests of Australia. Therefore, we cannot lightly brush aside his opinion in the absence of more authentic advice as to our resources of iron ore. Indeed we have reason to complain that the Government allowed the negotiations for the development of Yampi Sound to proceed for a lengthy period and actually encouraged certain companies to invest a considerable amount of money in the enterprise before it suddenly imposed the embargo. That action was characteristic of the Government. It never knows where it is going. I read recently, in <inline font-style="italic">Current Notes on International Affairs,</inline> published on the 1st March, 1937, that in October, 1934, permission was given to a group of five Japanese experts to inspect the Yampi Sound deposits. It was known to the Government then, and has been known ever since, that the development of the Koolan Island deposit was under consideration by Brasserts Limited, an English company, with, I understand, Japanese financial backing. </para>
                    <para class="block">The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> and other representatives in this Parliament from Western Australia, have good reason to complain about the manner in which the Government misled that company. It even went to the extent of announcing, through the then Leader of the Government in the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Pearce, that it would be most unwise to prohibit the export of iron ore from Australia. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Pearce added that to prohibit the export of iron ore would be to play into the hands of Germany. </para>
                    <para>In view of the definite statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woolnough</inline> it would be foolish  foi  us as a nation, in the process of development, having great secondary industries, which in the future will require much more than 2,000,000 tons a year - in the next ten or twelve years the demand will probably be trebled if not quadrupled - to deplete our iron ore resources by allowing unrestricted export. I have in mind the experience of the United States of America. At one time it was thought that that country had an unlimited  suPply  of iron' ore, but the demand is now so great that importation is necessary. A similar situation may arise in Australia unless adequate precautions be taken to husband our resources in the interests of Australia's industries. Realizing that the Government had not done the right thing, the Prime Minister in an announcement on the 19th May, 1938, said, probably as a sop to the companies affected and to the States involved - </para>

Consequently the Government of Western Australia was quite justified in looking forward hopefully to the development of, for example, Yampi Sound. </para>

                    <para>My point is that since the Government has received authentic and up-to-date information regarding Australia's iron ore resources, and is convinced that it would be .against the best interests of Australia to export iron ore, it should immediately take steps in co-operation with the governments of the States concerned, to develop those resources. It has been said that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited is largely interested in this matter. Indeed, the honorable member for Swan insinuated, although he did not say so in so many words, that that company largely influenced the Government in imposing the embargo. I should like to know whether the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited has given an undertaking that it will work its lease at Yampi Sound. Has the Government discussed this matter with the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, which, we are told, has been exporting iron ore from Australia for some time in small quantities? It exported 437,000 tons in 1935-36, and 267,000 tons in 1936-37. No doubt this export trade is still being carried on. The Minister for the Interior has said that exports would cease in December next. Practically every country in the world is demanding increased supplies of iron ore. That is not due solely to re-armament programmes ; it is due in some measure to the fact that nations are becoming increasingly industrialized and therefore require greater supplies of this commodity. Large quantities will bc required for Australia in the near future - very much larger quantities will be needed ten or fifteen years hence than are required to-day. We do not want to find ourselves short of this essential raw material. In the United States of America the shortage is so acute that the construction of six warships has been delayed. Reserve stocks in France have been exhausted, and the Government of that country has proposed a prohibitive export tax on iron ore. In Italy steel has been rationed, and in Germany military demands have monopolized practically all available supplies. The position is so acute in Italy that limitations have been placed on the use of metal in buildings. It is strictly forbidden to use iron bars on railings, gateways, parapets, balconies, floors, &amp;c. The Japanese government has suspended the import duty on pig iron and steel. Several reports have been issued in connexion with Australia's iron ore resources, and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woolnough</inline> has said, only two ore bodies of large extent, high grade, and easy access, are known iu Australia, namely, Yampi Sound in Western Australia and Iron Knob in South Australia. No one will deny that the conservation of our iron ore resources is a national necessity. Australia must look to its own supplies for its future requirements, and not to overseas countries. </para>
                    <para>Iron ore is an irreplaceable asset, and a great obligation is placed upon the Commonwealth Government to look, not to the immediate future, but to the far distant future. An adequate supply of iron ore is of paramount importance to Australia. There is an obligation upon this Government to ascertain definitely and without delay the extent of these resources. The Queensland Minister for Mines, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Foley,</inline> last year stated that Queensland was complying with the Commonwealth Government's request to defer the granting of mining leases or rights for the working and export of iron ore. </para>

                            <para>- I was told 80 men, but L shall accept the Minister's correction. Those engaged in the cattle-raising industry in the north-west of Western Australia, were led to believe that a settlement of 1,000 persons was to be established on the island, or in its vicinity, and they proceeded on the assumption that this settlement would constitute a market for beef. Various commercial enterprises have been committed to the expenditure of substantial sums of money because the Government was not able to make up its mind; because, in fact, it went to sleep on the job, and was as apathetic in  dealing  with this matter as it has been in its approach to other important national issues. Its failure in this regard was very similar to its failure to formulate a truly national policy to be considered by the Premiers Conference held recently at Canberra. The Premiers came to the conference with all kinds of schemes for the development of Australia. The Government of Western Australia had in mind the development of the iron ore resources in that State. The visiting Premiers received an unsympathetic reception because the Com. monwealth Government was too busy trying to patch up its internal quarrels, and in trying to establish an inner Cabinet group to determine national policy. It is no wonder that there - was keen disappointment among the representatives of the States, which have the responsibility of caring for upwards of 150,000 unemployed persons throughout Australia, in regard to whom the Commonwealth Government has disclaimed all responsibility. </para>

If it does, it will indicate to the Government that, in the opinion of this House, an obligation rests upon it to take steps definitely to ascertain the extent of the iron ore deposits in Australia, and to co-operate with the State governments in their development. A plan could be formulated at a Premiers Conference, or at a special conference  representing the Commonwealth Government and the Governments of Western Australia, South Australia, and Tasmania, to decide on methods for the development of deposits at Yampi Sound and other places in order to create the maximum amount of employment. This is especially necessary, in view of the fact that there are 150,000 persons unemployed in Australia at the present time. It cannot be said that they are unemployable. In fact, the vast majority of them could be employed on developmental works of this kind. The difficulties of the Government of Western Australia have been greatly accentuated by the backing and filling and general indifference of the Commonwealth Government. Ministers of the Government gave misleading answers to the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drakeford)</inline> and other honorable members who made inquiries on this subject. Then, like a bolt from the blue, came the action of the Government in imposing a total prohibition upon the export of iron ore at a time when the Government of Western Australia, and the. company concerned, had every reason to believe that nothing would bc done to prevent the development of the industry. </para>

As for the amendment of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> it is only necessary to point out that what he proposes has, in fact, already been done by the Government.  His  amendment is to the effect that the Government should undertake a comprehensive survey of Australia's iron ore resources. It is within the knowledge of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, as of other honorable members, that many months ago the Government arrived at that conclusion and acted upon it. It initiated a survey of the iron ore resources of Australia, and I shall give details of that survey a little later. </para>

                    <para>I should like to set out clearly the history of events which led up to the imposition of the export embargo by the Government, and to the decision to embark upon a survey of the iron ore resources of the country. It was stated by the honorable member for Swan, and reiterated by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> and the Leader of the Government in the Senate at that time, had stated that there existed no reasons for preventing the export of iron ore from Australia. That is true: those statements were made, but, unfortunately, it transpired that the statements had been made without such knowledge as later came into the possession of the Government. Very briefly, the history of that phase of the matter is as follows : On the 16th November, 1935, the Premier of Western Australia advised the Prime Minister of a proposal to develop the iron ore leases at Yampi Sound, and to export the ore to Japan. At that stage, the Commonwealth Government and its officers believed - and their belief was in accord with the general impression of most Australians - that the iron ore resources of this country were very substantial ; in fact, so substantial ns to be practically unlimited. Acting on that belief, the Prime Minister advised the Premier of Western Australia that he saw no reason why the leases should not be developed for export purposes. It is the attitude of the Government to-day, as it was then, that if there is more than sufficient iron ore in Australia to provide for our requirements now am i in the future, there exists no reason why the surplus should not be exported to foreign countries. Shortly after rJ-nt expression of opinion by the Prime Minister, doubts were raised regarding the extent of our iron ore resources. On the 9th March, 1937, Cabinet decided that an investigation should bc made, and all the States were approached in an effort to obtain information on the subject. It may be noted here that the Constitution leaves all matters pertaining to raining within the control of the State parliaments. It is another unfortunate aspect of Australia's federal system of government that the governments which were constitutionally <inline font-style="italic">hi</inline> control of mining had not, in the exercise of their powers, conducted a survey of the iron ore resources of the various States. No doubt they desired to make the survey, but the fact remains that they did not do so, probably because of shortage of funds. In reply to the inquiries addressed by the Commonwealth Government to the State governments, information was furnished on the  18th  June, 1937, and was submitted to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nye,</inline> the chief executive officer  of the North Australian survey, for comment. On the 22nd June, J 937, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nye</inline> furnished a report in which he said, among other things, that there was. evidence in the information supplied by the States that iron ore deposits were adequate for the immediate heeds of Australian industry.' but that there was considerable reason to doubt the adequacy of those resources to meet the needs of the more distant future. Acting on that report, Cabinet decided, on the 5 th August, 1937, that Dr.' Woolnough, the Commonwealth Geological Adviser, should make an investigation. On the 11th August, 1937, the States were asked to grant no further leases where there was any prospect of the Ore obtained- on those leases being exported. They were told that the preliminary investigation had raised a doubt fis to the adequacy of Australia's total resources. On the 31st August, 1937, the Prime Minister announced that, in view of the definite information then in his possession, he saw no justifiable reason immediately to interfere with the development of the Yampi  Sound leases. Further inquiries proceeded, and, on the 14th April last, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woolnough</inline> submitted a report in which he stated that, unless our known resources of accessible iron nr« were conserved, Australia, in a little more than a generation, would become an importer rather than an exporter of iron ore. On the 19th May, 193S, the Prime Minister announced that the exportation of iron ore would he prohibited as from the 1st July last. That action was not claimed to have been taken by reason of final and sufficient information as to the total resources in Australia. The prohibition was imposed rather because serious doubt had been thrown upon the previous estimates, and consequently most serious apprehension had arisen as to the adequacy of the resources for the future development of Australia's iron and steel industry. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr, Gregory)</inline> based his case on a series of contentions from separate aspects of this matter. He introduced, with very great force, the international implications of the embargo. We must all agree that it is undesirable to deny to any foreign country access to raw materials; but I am sure that the honorable member recognizes that this objection to the prohibition could be upheld only if conclusive evidence were available that the supply of raw material was adequate for the nation's own use. He also referred, as did the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition CMv. Forde), to the economic aspects of the embargo. He told us, with considerable force, of its economic effect upon Western Australia, and also upon individual miners and mining interests. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition' dealt more particularly with, the economic effect of the embargo on the national development of Australia's steel industry. The honorable member for Swan further mentioned that the projected development at Yampi Sound has been prevented. </para>

                    <para>The general right of every nation to make a preferential reservation of its raw materials and natural resources for its own use will not be disputed by any honorable member. The honorable member for Swan quoted a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Pearce during the time when he was Leader of the Government in the Senate, that to deny access to these resources by, for instance, Germany, would be to strengthen the claims of that country for colonies. It has been pointed out, and none of us wish to dispute the fact, that to deny to any foreign country access to raw materials is to engender at least an unfriendly attitude to the country imposing the embargo; but it is conceded by every civilized nation that any country has a right to reserve for its own people first use of its natural resources. Not only has this principle been generally conceded, but the Raw Materials Committee of the League of Nations, during the time when Japan was a member of the League, declared, on behalf of all the member nations, that, whilst it was desirable that access to raw materials should not be denied to foreign countries, it was the belief of all members of the League that each country should have the first right to its own raw materials, and that only when there was a reasonable surplus of those materials should there be an expectation that they would be made available to other countries. Only because serious doubt has arisen in the mind of the Government as to the adequacy of Australia's resources of iron ore has it imposed the present prohibition. </para>
                    <para>Every one of us hopes that it will not be necessary to maintain the embargo permanently. The Government has made it clear that if the investigations demonstrate that sufficient reserves of iron ore are available in Australia for our own immediate and future requirements, it will lift the embargo, and make available to foreign countries any surplus which Australia can afford to export. The embargo has not been aimed at any particular country. The Government's action has been taken for one reason only, namely, the need for conserving for our own people the resources which we are fortunate enough to find in Australia, and which are certainly necessary for the development of our industries. </para>

                    <para>The point on which the honorable member for Swanhas dwelt most fully is his doubt that there is a fear in the mind of the Government regarding the adequacy of Australia's resources of iron ore. He has referred to the opinions of various authorities, and has quoted some  who have said that the resources are adequate. He remarked that one authority estimated sixteen years ago that' Australia had' visible and potential resources of iron ore totalling800,000,000 tons. I believe that that estimate was made by a committee from Great Britain, which visited this country for only a few weeks. It made no personal investigation, but, collating the estimates in certain old reports, merely ventured that opinion. It certainly had no information available to it which is not equally available to the present Government. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that the investigation will not be unduly long. It is not sufficient to know the dimensions of the beds of iron ore; it is also necessary to find out their assay value and their mineralogical characteristics. It is important to know whether the ore is suitable for smelting, or whether it is of a refractory kind. It is certainly necessary to consider the resources from economic aspects. It is of not the slightest use to say that there is 5,000,000 or 7,000,000 tons of iron ore at Tennant Creek, and to include that in the iron ore resources of Australia. Such resources have been taken into account in the total figures which the honorable member for Swan has mentioned, but they are of value only if they are economically available, and it is possible to exploit them profitably in the interests of Australian industry. Therefore, the Government proposes to conduct an exhaustive and detailed examination of all the iron ore resources of this country. In this regard, the Commonwealth Government has called to its assistance the Mines Departments of the various States and their respective experts, and has asked every State government whether it would choose with its own Mines Department and its own officers to conduct a survey of its own ore, or whether it would prefer that the Commonwealth Government should do so. With this inquiry has gone the offer of the Commonwealth to bear the cost of the survey, irrespective of whether a State elects to conduct the survey itself or asks that the Commonwealth should do so. The States have elected in different ways. </para>

                    <para>I propose briefly to refer to a few of the known deposits in Australia, and to give a short history of them, so far as the claimed knowledge of their magnitude is concerned. We have heard much, for instance, of the Portland Roads deposit in Queensland. An investigation has lately been made of that deposit by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woolnough</inline> in company with the Queensland State Geologist, and the conclusion which they arrived at- and in this they are in agreement - is that this deposit is much too highly contaminated with silica and rock material, and is too scattered for economic working. The ore is too friable to stand transport without high loss, and therefore the deposit must be regarded as of no value when assessing the iron ore resources of the Commonwealth. The deposits at Mount Lucy, in Queensland, aro regarded - and in each instance I am stating the joint opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woolnough</inline> and the 'State "Geologist - as too small and too impure in the bulk. Then there is the deposit at Iron Island, off the Queensland coast. A preliminary reconnaissance indicated that that deposit rep- resented a bulk of iron ore of some 2,500,000 tons. A more close examination has disclosed that it is merely a sheeting of iron ore over a core of diorite, and it has been necessary to reduce the initial estimate from 2,500,000 tons to 500,000 tons. The ore has also been disclosed to be of the magnetite variety which is refractory and not amenable to smelting. At Biggenden, Queensland, there is a deposit which was estimated at 600,000 tons, a very small quantity in considering the iron ore resources of the Commonwealth. This earlier estimate still stands, but considerations of quality eliminate the deposit from consideration. It contains impurities of various kinds, including bismuth, and the ore itself is of the magnetite variety. At Mount Philp and Mount Leviathan, in the Cloncurry district, there are undoubtedly large deposits but these are 400 miles from the coast and very much further from airy potential smelting centre. The cost of transport would put these deposits quite outside the range of economic consideration. </para>

                            <para>- For so far into the future as it is possible for us to look. At Cadia and Carcoar, in New South Wales, there are deposits originally estimated by the State Geologist at 39,000,000 tons. They would be included at that figure in the total cited by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory).</inline> This is one deposit which has been actually worked. Exploitation has proved that there are very substantial quantities of enclosed rock, and very great impurities in the ore. There is conclusive evidence that the total volume of usable ore in those deposits is 2,000,000 tons as against an original estimate of 39,000,000 tons. Certain other deposits in New South Wales disclose similar features. </para>

                    <para>Turning to Tasmania, there is a deposit at Beaconsfield which was originally estimated by people who were regarded as competent investigators at 35,000,000 tons. It is obvious that they did not make a very comprehensive investigation because drillinghas proved that the deposit is entirely superficial where it was first regarded as being deep-seated, with the result that the original estimate has to be entirely eliminated. In respect of Blythe River, Tasmania, the original estimate was 24,000,000 tons; but there have been progressive investigations and diminutions of the estimate until to-day the most comprehensive and the most authoritative survey may reduce the original estimate of 24,000,000 tons to 12,000 tons - not one shipload ! </para>

Turning to Western Australia, and excluding for the moment the Yampi Sound deposits, there is a known deposit at Wilgie Mia in the Weld Range, which is estimated at 26,500.000 tons. There has never been a detailed survey, and it is certain from investigations that have been made that this ore contains very much barren material. The deposit is situated 305 miles distant from Geraldton, the nearest port, and is, therefore, also necessarily eliminated from economic consideration. Then there is the Peak Hill field, which is situated at a distance of 70 miles from the nearest railway, and then 335 miles by rail from Geraldton, a total of 405 miles of land transport to the coast. No estimate has been made of the resources of this field. At Tallering Peak there has been no estimate. The deposit has been seen by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woolnough,</inline> but not closely examined by him. He reports, however, that this deposit is not of major dimension and there are indications of considerable contamination by silica. Here again land transport costs are a factor in any assessment of this deposit as being economically valuable. Then there is the Koolyanobbing deposit, situated near Southern Cross, which is being surveyed by the Government Geologist of Western Australia at the present time. It is 30 miles from the railway and a total of 268 miles from Fremantle, and therefore, also has to be eliminated from economic consideration. </para>

                    <para>Turning to the most controversial deposit, that at Yampi Sound, here again the history has been one of diminishing estimates. In the years gone by, there, was an opinion widely held that the amount of iron ore at Yampi Sound could be regarded almost as illimitable; but in 1920 an investigation was made as to its magnitude by the then State Mining Engineer of Western Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Montgomery.</inline><inline font-style="italic">[Leave to continue given.]</inline> In 1919, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Montgomery,</inline> then State Mining Engineer in Western Australia, proceeded to Yampi Sound to make an investigation and assessment of the quantity of iron ore at Cockatoo Island and Koolan Island.

                            <para>- Yes. Subsequent assessments made by various persons - investigations have been made by private mining interests as well as by Government authorities - have agreed in certain respects, in that they have shown that of the two deposits those on the northern ends of the two islands must be eliminated from consideration because their siliceous nature renders them unsuitable for smelting purposes. The southern ore body on Koolan Island, leased by Brasserts Limited, of London, tapers from a thin deposit at each end to a thicker deposit in the centre. The whole of the deposit was taken into consideration by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Montgomery,</inline> but later investigations tend to show that the tapering ends are highly siliceous and will have to he eliminated. Only the middle portion can be considered. Even acting upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Montgomery's</inline> estimate, the centre portion of the southern deposit of Koolan Island will not give a total of more than 40,000,000 tons of iron ore. At present the usable deposit at Cockatoo Island is being investigated by Australian Iron and Steel Limited, a company which has been merged with the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited. Later this deposit will he investigated by Western Australian mining authorities at the request and at the expense, of the Commonwealth Government. The result of the investigation to date compels us to reduce the expectation from the Iron Knob and the Yampi groups very materially - to what extent, I am unable to indicate. However, it is the considered opinion of the Commonwealth Geological Adviser, </para>

                        that the total usable iron ore available in these two deposits is not less than 150,000,000 tons, and that it is not likely to exceed 200,000,000 tons. This has to be considered against the knowledge that Australia is at present using 2,000,000 tons a year, that two new large blast furnaces just completed will raise this amount to about 3,000,000 tons, and that our iron and steel industry is sure to expand and demand a constantly increasing amount of ore. I have given to the House the history of the successive investigations of individual deposits, showing a progressive diminution of the estimates of iron ore available. Deposits may be eliminated for various reasons - high land transport costs, their siliceous nature, or the fact that the ore is refractory. In the light of this information, I -suggest that every honorable member should concur in the action which the Government has taken in imposing an embargo upon the export of iron ore from Australia. If further investigations should disclose  that there is more than an adequate supply available foi Australia's immediate and future requirements, the embargo will be lifted and the export ro foreign countries permitted.

                            <para>- Yos, four claim* have been received. I can include the claim made broadly by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> on behalf of workmen who were employed, or who might have been employed at Yampi Sound. It would appear that 52 or 57 workmen, I am not sure of the number, were engaged. The company had given these workmen notice of dismissal, but I was able to arrange with the Western Australian Mines Department, which had undertaken' to conduct a survey, that every one would be employed at the then rates of wages which have since been increased. Those men are to continue in useful work associated with investigations on the island, such as tunnelling and assisting in the transport of supplies. The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> said that tunnelling involves unnecessary expenditure, and that the investigations could have been carried out more cheaply by geophysical methods. In reply to that contention I may say that the exact methods to be employed in conducting a survey at Koolan Island have been decided upon by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Forman,  the Government Geologist of Western Australia, and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woolnough.</inline> They visited the island together and after an inspection decided that tunnelling and certain other measures would be the most effective. We shall know not only the exact dimensions of the deposit, but also its assay value. 1 have been informed by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woolnough</inline> that he is very familiar with geophysical methods. The honorable member  for Swan referred to the geophysical methods practised in Sweden. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woolnough</inline> has informed me that he has studied in the original language the full reports upon which action was taken in Sweden, and bc points out that whereas geophysical investigation discloses, not the certainty, but the probability of a deposit, it is not possible by that method to disclose the type of ore, its usefulness or its smelting properties. Moreover it is impossible to determine whether it is associated with impurities or is of a refractory nature. That can be determined only by the actual excavation of the iron ore itself. The honorable member for Swan also referred to the possibility  if working the iron ore deposits at Yampi rsl and below high water level. He has informed us that similar deposits in Newfoundland are worked below the high water level, but he does not know that the geological natures of the two ores are dissimilar. He does not know that there are great cavities or voids iu the ore at Yampi Sound. At least three private companies have attempted to investigate, by diamond drilling, the magnitude of the deposits in the Yampi group, and in not one instance has it been possible to reach the footwall because of the cavities which exist. These have been set down Ivy one competent authority as embracing 10 per cent, of the volume of the deposits. With such cavities it would be quite impossible to work below high water level. 1 am informed that the deposit in Newfoundland extends below sea level on an almost horizontal slant, and is covered by a capping of rock which is impervious to water. In these circumstances it is possible for the deposit to be worked below the sea level without being interfered with by seepage of sea water. Thu deposit at Yampi Sound enters the sea at a steep slope, has no capping, and as it is full of cavities or voids, it can never to worked below high water level. None of these opinions need be accepted as conclusive or final, but we must ask ourselves whether  we can permit our iron ore resources so to diminish that we shall be forced to import supplies. I believe that the Government, has taken the action which any responsible Australian Government would have taken in the light of the information and advice furnished by experts. I trust that, final investigations will prove that it will yet be possible to lift the embargo, and thus make some of our iron ore. available to foreign countries. But that will not be done by the Government until it is convinced that there is ample iron ore available for  our  own present and future requirements. We not wish to be compelled, a few years hence, to import iron ore in order to meet the requirements of our key industries, or have men thrown out of employment because the cost of- raw material would be prohibitive to our iron and steel industries. In the circumstances, I ask the House to oppose the motion of the honorable member for Swan. </para>

                        <para>. - The Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen),</inline> in opposing the motion moved by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> has in his usual eloquent and persuasive maimer endeavoured to convince the House that the Government has acted in the right way. Whilst I support the action of the Government in imposing the embargo, I blame it for the difficulties which have been created. The Minister succeeded in showing again what is known to every independent thinking man, namely, that the Government has been, as it usually is, asleep and neglectful of Australian interests. The whole of the information which the Minister has given to us to-night, except for the detailed investigations which have been made by the Commonwealth Geological Advisor, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woolnough,</inline> since the embargo -was imposed, was available for anybody to study calmly if he thought fit to do so. The State of Western Australia undoubtedly has a grievance because of the delay which took place before the Government awoke to its responsibilities. The Minister has given honorable members particulars as to the dates when the extent of the Australian resources of iron ore was brought under its notice, but it is quite evident that ample information was available on which it should have acted when the position was brought to the notice of this Government as early as 1935. It was then apparent that foreign interests were seeking a foothold in Australia, and the information that the Government had available did not make it necessary for an investigation to determine the extent of the Commonwealth's resources of iron ore. I claim that had the Government, or those responsible within the Government, taken the trouble to look up information then available, the fact would have been discovered that the utmost limit which could have been given reasonably to the quantity of iron ore available in Aus-, tralia - that is ore which could be economically worked - was 313,000,000 tons. That quantity was fixed upon by an authority who probably knows as much as, if not more than, any other authority in the world about iron ore. He is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. P.</inline> Clements, M.I.C.E., M.I.M.E., M.I.E.E., general manager and director of the Park Gate Iron and Steel Company, Rotherham, England. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Clements</inline> was the Bessemer Gold Medallist for 1936 of the journal of the Iron and Steel Institute of Great Britain and he is eminently qualified to express an opinion on the subject. I know that he could not have made a personal thorough survey as is being done by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woolnough,</inline> but  he probably thoroughly examined and applied all the reliable information that was then available. From the lengthy and detailed statement which the Minister for the Interior has furnished to the House, it seems that the estimate of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clements</inline> must be reduced and that our iron ore resources amount practically to nothing. Indeed, if the Minister had spoken for another quarter of an hour in the same strain I think the House would have had to draw the inference that there is no iron ore left in Australia at all. </para>

Something should he done by this Parliament to compel the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, that great organization which appears to have a monopoly in Australia, to develop its lease at Yampi Sound, or to encourage some other local company to do the work which is waiting to be clone, but the Government has done nothing in either direction.

                    <para>The honorable member's action is understandable in view of the delay which took place in prohibiting the export of iron ore from Australia, delay for which this Government was entirely responsible. 1 do not think that it can shift its responsibilities, no matter how hard it tries to Jo so, on to the shoulders of any other authority. The Government's inaction has -justifiably given rise to a spirit of disappointment and resentment in Western Australia. As far back as September, 1936, the Government encouraged those interested and the general public to believe that there was little, if any, chance of a restriction being placed on the export of iron ore. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> said that the control of the development of the deposits in Western Australia was a matter for the Government of that State. He indicated that the Commonwealth Government had power to prohibit or to refuse a permit for export, but said that the Government felt no more justified in prohibiting the export of iron ore to Japan than in prohibiting the export of wool! The ridiculousness of that statement is shown by the fact that, whilst we can produce large quantities of wool every year, we know that, if we export our iron ore, we can never replace it. That is just an example of how this Government looks at things until it is startled into life again by the Opposition. When attention was drawn to the matter in. August, 1937, the then </para>

                    <para class="block">The excuse made by the Minister for the Interior to-night was that the Government was not at that time in possession of information which would have justified it in taking action; yet we know that the Government could have been in possession of authoritative estimates which showed that the supplies of iron ore were limited. If the Government were assured that there was only 313,000,000 tons of iron ore available, would it in 1936 have permitted export to take place? That question demands an answer. </para>
                    <para>When I raised this matter in 1937 it was received with incredulity by members of the Country party. They ridiculed my estimate that Australia would soon be absorbing 2,000,000 tons of ore a year as not being worth considering, but we have since learned that the amount of iron ore which Australia uses annually has increased much above 2,000,000 tons, and it is possible that, before long, we shall be needing 5,000,000 tons per annum. If it be true, as was suggested by the Minister, that iron ore resources in Australia do not exceed 200,000,000 tons, they will not have a very long life on an annual local use of 5,000,000 tons of iron ore. The Government has fallen down on this job as it has fallen down on other jobs. There was plenty of information available at each of the dates mentioned by the Minister on which the Government could have acted, but it failed to obtain it, and it caused the belief to develop that the deposits at Yampi Sound could be exploited, and the ore extracted and exported without damage to our position. lt neglected its duty, and that neglect, in  the  first instance, has given rise to an expression of sentiment, both in this Parliament 1111(1] in the Parliament of Western Australia, which indicates - I am sorry to find that it is so - an extension of the feeling against the Commonwealth at a time when everything possible should be done to allay such hostility. How can we make progress towards a more united Commonwealth when these things are done? </para>
                    <para>There is at least one newspaper in Australia, the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> which did not hesitate to point out the danger of allowing the export of iron ore to proceed. It gave particulars and information based on an interview with or an article by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. G.</inline> B. Pritchard, a well-known authority, who was lecturer in geology and metallurgy at the Melbourne University and head of the School of Mines at the Melbourne Technical School. The estimates by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Pritchard</inline> were, as a matter of fact, more conservative in regard to Yampi Sound than those of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clements,</inline> and they seem to have been based on good grounds. The Government, as the result, of questions and criticisms, awoke from its sleep and decided that it was time to do something. The article and the publicity helped to concentrate attention on the position. It was followed up in Victoria by another person - a layman, but one who is well-informed on the question. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Bell, a constituent of mine. He is a blast furnace man, but he spends hours in seeking information as to Australian resources, not only of iron ore but also of other raw materials. </para>

In what way would the Western Australian Government or the Commonwealth Government gain any advantage by permitting foreign nations to exploit the best iron ore resources in Australia ? In what way would the export of iron ore to foreign countries mean the development of agricultural or pastoral industries in the north-western area of Western Australia? It seems to have been claimed by  the State Premier and other members of the Western Australian Parliament that as iron ore would occupy only a small space on vessels carrying it to Japan, the remainder of the space could he filled with cattle from the north-western districts. It seems to me that there is very little in that claim. Even store-bred cattle cannot be exported from Canada to England, so what chance would there be of exporting wild cattle from Western Australia to Japan? </para>

The Minister has indicated that something will be done by way of compensation. There may be some justification for compensation being paid to the State of Western Australia, but before any payment is made to the company or other private interests concerned, the nature and extent of the work carried out by it at Yampi Sound should be ascertained. </para>

I hope that any claim by the company for compensation will be investigated carefully before public money is paid out, but I also hope that the claims of the State of Western Australia will receive sympathetic consideration. The idea of sending cattle to Japan in the vessels conveying the ore, as a means of developing trade between these two countries, however, is impracticable. </para>

                            <para>- I realize that. The statement was contained in a pamphlet which has been circulated to honorable members; it was also made in the Parliament of Western Australia. I do not suggest that Japan would use wastefully the iron ore from Yampi Sound; 1 am inclined to think that, that ore is required because of its free-smelting qualities. I have some data here which indicate that Japan's iron ore resources are less than ours. It is well-known that if a country while conserving its own resources can get other countries, which may be possible enemies, to deplete theirs, it gains a practical and lasting advantage over them. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clements,</inline> the iron ore resources of Japan total about80,000,000 tons. In addition, Japan is supposed to have in Manchuria further reserves totalling 500,000,000 tons, but that ore is of poorer quality. Naturally, Japan does not want to use any of those deposits if it can get the free-smelting haematite ore from Australia. Twenty years ago, the iron ore deposits in the United States of America were estimated to total approximately 4,824,000,000 tons. For the year 1917, that country produced 75,288,851 tons of iron ore', and in 1910 it produced : 39,434,797 tons of pig iron. Notwithstanding that production, the United States imports iron ore from other countries to mix with its own ores. That country, which is the world's greatest producer of iron and steel, finds it advisable to import iron ore for mixing purposes from Chile, Brazil, Newfoundland and Spain. Australia has so little iron ore that it would be calamitous to allow its first-quality ore to be shipped to Japan. The iron ore at Yampi Sound contains 68 per cent, iron free of melting difficulties and is therefore of such good quality that most countries would be glad to have it. </para>

                    <para>Should iron ore from Yampi Sound be exported to Japan the ships used to carry it would probably bring to Australia goods which would compete with Australian products, thereby reducing employment in this country. That would certainly be the result if manufactured goods were brought here in such vessels. That is a. point which the Government should not overlook. We should not encourage other nations to bring to this country goods which can be made  here.  On the other hand, if iron ore from Yampi Sound were taken to the eastern States for smelting purposes - and there is no coal close to Yampi Sound to enable smelters to be set up there - the ships used to transport the ore could take Australian goods to Western Australia on the return journey. Moreover, in such circumstances, both the ore and the manufactured goods would he carried in Australian, not foreign vessels. There would be loading both ways. I am convinced that the export of iron ore to Japan would be detrimental to the best interests of Australia. The production of pig iron in the Commonwealth for manufacturing purposes in this country would give employment to many factory workers, in addition to those 'who would be employed in the transport vessels, and on the waterfront, whilst in producing coal and fluxing materials work would be provided for many others. Should the iron ore pass through the various processes until it reaches the manufactured stage, work for many skilled artisans would be afforded. If we do anything toprevent employment in Australia we shall render a distinct disservice to this country. </para>
                    <para>The remarks of the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> regarding the mining of iron ore under the sea, have been dealt with by the Minister, who set out clearly the difference between the conditions prevailing in Newfoundland and at Yampi Sound. At the latter place, the porous nature of the country might enable the sea to get into the workings. Experience has shown that cementing has sometimes to be resorted to. It would appea r that the idea of mining  below , sea level at Yampi Sound is impracticable. In this matter I would be guided by the advice of experts. </para>
                    <para>If the Government were honest, it would admit that it did not realize the possible effects of its inaction. But instead of admitting the error, which arose from its delay, it now claims to have done the right thing. These mineral deposits are a heritage for the present and future generations of Australians which we, as representatives of the people, are bound to protect. We cannot allow people who belong to the  getrichquick   fraternity and are backed by foreign interests, to exploit these irreplaceable assets, and thus establish in Australia a field of influence which later may become a source of international complications. We must safeguard our own interests. Japan has control of vast quantities of iron ore in China. Why does Japan not exploit those deposits, instead of endeavouring to secure a footing on the coast of Australia? The probabilities are that Japan's mineral experts know that the haematite ores of Yampi Sound are the richest available, and are much more easily worked than are supplies nearer to hand. Apart from the sphere of influence which it is recognized a nation acquires by investing its capital in other countries to obtain essential raw materials, under the existing capitalistic system an imperialistic nation which can induce possible enemies, or even trade competitors, to use their essential raw materials, while conserving its own, gains a tremendous advantage. That appears to be the aim of Japan. In a book entitled <inline font-style="italic">Political and Commercial Geology and the World's Mineral Resources,</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> E. Spurr, an authority on this subject, referred to the Japanese position. In a chapter dealing with political and commercial geology, he said - </para>

                    <para>Probably the position has developed greatly since that was written in 1920. I suggest that Japan was about to pursue a policy of peaceful penetration by obtaining the right to take iron ore from Australia.

                        <para>The success of the plan of German penetration was most disagreeably brought home to the British mind, as well as to the French and the American perception, by the war, and during the war England took under government control her mineral industries more definitely and systematically than did we. Moreover, perceiving the success of the German system as a means of penetration, and as a method against competitors, she has adopted it, there being a striking tendency to put her key industries under syndicates, unions, cartels or trusts controlled directly by the state. </para>
                        <para>A system, of State Socialism thus takes the place of the freedom of individual competition. As regards the mineral industries, much of the same action has been taken by France.

                            included in his review a long list of minerals of one kind and another and the position, in order of importance, of the nations in respect of each mineral. The list is interesting, but time will not permit me to give it in detail.
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spurr</inline>
                            emphasized the important place that the United States of America holds in respect of petroleum which is, of course, the source of power and light and is the key to the mastery of the air. Next in order is fuel coal and its ally, the great metallic mineral, iron, which must go together for the manufacture of iron and steel, the backbone of . all our mechanical achievements. Why should we permit this essential mineral to go away to other countries?

                        <para>Australia has certain mineral resources which should be used to the best advantage. I have no desire to say anything that could be justly interpreted as expressing a wish to prevent another country from obtaining minerals from Australia which are available in this country to. an almost unlimited extent. All I say is that iron ore does not fall into that class. We have not an unlimited supply of iron ore. In these circumstances Western Australia has no real grievance; in regard to the embargo itself, it should look at the subject in the light of the national requirements of Australia. </para>
                        <para>Undoubtedly when the Lyons Government first considered this subject it showed that, like practically all composite and compromise governments, it lacked vision. Otherwise it would not have permitted, without protest, foreign interests in the guise of a company with a British name, to acquire a footing at Yampi Sound. When it came to understand the real position it also showed that it lacked the power, as do all governments comprised of opposing interests, to deal with the situation effectively. If the Government yields to the pressure now being brought to bear upon it to withdraw <inline font-style="italic">or</inline> slacken the regulations now in force, or if it does anything to weaken the effectiveness of this too-long-delayed embargo on the export of iron ore, it will undoubtedly deserve the derision of the Australian people. </para>
                        <para>However, the claim by the Western Australian Government, and the representatives of Western Australia in this chamber, that the Commonwealth Government should take steps at once to develop the iron ore deposits of Yampi Sound and utilize them for the benefit of the Australian people has merit in it. A government which is not deprived, by its very composition, of the capacity to put into operation progressive ideas would find no insuperable difficulty in developing this deposit, and, by pursuing such a course, it would win the admiration of Australia, generally, and of Western Australia in particular. </para>
                        <para>The amendment of the Acting Leader of the Opposition should commend itself to every member of the House who has a true Australian outlook, whereas the proposal of the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> being of a retrograde nature, should be resisted.

The amendment provides the opportunity for honorable members to indicate, on a non-party subject, that the Parliament believes it to be the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government to ensure that the resources of this country, in whatever State they exist, are not allowed to remain undeveloped so long as any </para>

It appears to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woolnough</inline> set out with the intention to arrive at a certain result.  His  opinions on this subject might be classed with the opinions of many experts on different subjects with whom I have come into contact in the course of the years. When an expert's opinion is challenged, and he is asked to review it, it is an extraordinary fact that he generally sets out with the definite purpose of obtaining every possible scrap of evidence that will reinforce the views which he originally expressed. Moreover, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woolnough's</inline> opinions as to the extent of our iron ore deposits have been progressively reduced.  His  first report on the subject was comparatively mild ;  but his latest report practically pulverizes the ideas of other Australian geolo- gists and mining men concerning our iron ore resources, for in setting down our usable and readily available resources at 150,000,000 tons he has plumbed the depths. </para>

The bulk of the ore above plain level is estimated at more than one hundred million tons. The estimate for Iron Duke, 18 miles south, is equally as great. The estimate of the period likely to elapse before underground mining will be necessary is given as being beyond this century, based upon the present rate of consumption. <inline font-style="italic">[ Quorum formed.]\</inline></para>

                    <para>Surely that statement ought to be thoroughly reliable. I have: heard it mooted lately that another company proposes to develop other iron ore deposits on the Middleback Ranges, and intends to provide £1,000,000 for the purpose. We must also remember that Australia possesses the acknowledged valuable iron ore deposit at Yampi Sound. I much prefer the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Montgomery,</inline> formerly State Mining Engineer of Western Australia, to that of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woolnough,</inline> on this subject. The honorable member for Swan referred in some detail to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Montgomery's</inline> estimates. I feel that we are justified in asserting that, having in mind the deposits at Iron Knob, and Yampi Sound, we have probably 300,000,000 tons of first class iron ore available for immediate development above ground and high-water level. Of  course, we must bear in mind that, so far, there has been no real exploration of the iron ore occurrences of the Commonwealth, the reason being that hitherto iron ore has been too cheap for us to devote much time to it. </para>
                    <para>The proposal made to the Commonwealth Government in respect of Yampi Sound was that the export of 15,000,000 tons of iron ore, at the rate of 1,000,000 tons a year, should be permitted. Even if <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woolnough's</inline> figures were accepted, the iron ore at Yampi Sound would not be exhausted for over 50 years. Of the acknowledged resources of first class iron ore in Australia, an export of 15,000,000 tons would represent only about 5 per cent. I invite honorable members to contrast our attitude in respect of iron with that adopted by America with respect to oil.- At one stage alarming reports were circulated that the oil wells in the United States of America were rapidly becoming exhausted, but, in spite of such fears, the people of that country realized that the export of oil was a profitable trade and refused to curtail it in any way. I fail to see any reason why we should expect a shortage of iron for our requirements, Iron has been used for thousands of years - as far back as Tubal-Cain, of Genesis. It was used freely in the earliest ages, and at no time in its history has the world experienced a shortage. That probably accounts for the cheapness of iron. On the other  hand, however, there is a prospect that the demand for iron will diminish, because the tendency in modern times is to rely more on the use of lighter metals, and, it may be, that iron will share the fate that has befallen coal. At one time the fear was expressed that the coal deposits of Great, Britain would soon become exhausted with the result that opposition arose to the export of coal. As the result of the discovery of other kinds of power, however, coal has become comparatively a drug on the market, and to-day England, like Australia, has more coal in reserve than it can use. In hoarding up our resources of iron, we may hoard up something for which, in the not far distant future, we shall have comparatively little use at all. The existence of the deposits at Yampi Sound has been known for half a century, and at various times efforts have been made by specu lators to induce others to exploit them. Those efforts were unsuccessful, and there was no suggestion of prohibiting the export of iron from Yampi until, at last, a company was formed which was prepared to do something, not merelyin the way of speculation, but actually to utilize the deposits. Immediately thai company showed that it meant business, and proceeded to go about its work, propaganda of the kind usually associated with commercial rivalry was disseminated in the eastern States, and, ultimately, pressure was brought to bear upon this Government to frustrate it. Although the Government had for eighteen months permitted, and, indeed, encouraged this company to go on with its proposal to work these resources, it finally yielded to that, pressure and imposed this embargo. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps, I should correct that statement and say that, at any rate, the Government changed its opinion. The Government has placed itself in the humiliating position of having to meet claims for compensation amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds. It was asked to permit the export of 15,000,000 tons of iron ore at the rate of 1,000,000 tons a year. It would have been eighteen months before any ore would have been exported. In any case, 15,000,000 tons is not an appreciable proportion of the total deposits of iron ore in Australia, and I am of opinion that the Government rather gave way to panic in going back on its previous decision. It has been said that this embargo has been imposed in the interests of our own iron industry which is at present controlled by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited. I shall not yield to the temptation to say that that company is behind this move, because [ can find no evidence to support such a statement. Indeed, I have the greatest admiration for that company. However, the result of the embargo will, in fact, be to the benefit of that company, because it has a monopoly of iron in Australia. Taking a long view of this policy, I am quite sure that, despite the fact that under the embargo that company also is prevented from exporting iron ore, it will suit the interests of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited to prevent other people, who might feel inclined so to do, from developing the deposits at Yampi Sound, or elsewhere. I suggest that if this embargo is being imposed in the interests of industry in Australia, and if that company enjoys the monopoly to which I have referred, it is the duty of the Government to sec that the company works the leases which it holds at Cockatoo Island, Yampi Sound. It is not right that any company should be permitted to hold leases unless it makes some attempt to work them. I point out that the taxpayers of Australia will have to foot the bill for compensation, and that, perhaps, is one of the most unfortunate results of the Government's action-. The people of Western Australia are extremely disappointed that this embargo has been imposed. They had hoped that this new industry would have been established in that State, particularly in view of the fact that it will be extremely difficult to develop the north-west by any means other than mining. Western Australia does not receive assistance from the Commonwealth proportionate to that which is given to the Northern Territory. We must also bear in mind that an empty northwest is a national danger, and, consequently, there are strong national reasons for populating that part of the Commonwealth. It would be more satisfactory to have a. sturdy population of miners established at Yampi Sound. There may be room for differences of opinion as to how we can best serve national interests in this matter. Many honorable members have suggested that Japanese interests should not be permitted to secure any footing in Australia. On the other hand, purely as a matter of national expediency, it may he better to adopt the policy of trading freely with our neighbours rather than provoking them by refusing to trade with them, or by refusing to supply to them raw materials which they require and of which we have ample supplies. More than in any other way the peace of the world is endangered by the placing of restrictions upon trade between nations. The interests of peace can best be served by insisting upon the principle that there shall be no hoarding of raw materials on the part of any nation. Much has been said concerning the necessity for a policy of decentralization in Australia. Australia may very soon have to consider its position in relation to the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. The adoption of this dog-in-the-manger policy in regard to raw materials will, more than anything else, provide grounds for the intervention of other countries. After all, we are only a small community. We cannot expect to hold valuable deposits like those at Yampi Sound, unless we are prepared to use them. Instead, the opinion is being put forward, I think with justification, that no nation is entitled to retain possession of large areas of land unless it can effectively occupy them, and countries like Australia will not be permitted to hold large and valuable areas unless they can defend them. If we are to defend Australia, and particularly north-western Australia, we must people that area, and the exploitation of the mineral resources there offers the best hope of establishing a population. In this regard, the Government seems to be actuated by those narrow and selfish motives which are, unfortunately, too much in evidence in Australia. I do not think that honorable members are looking at this matter from a national standpoint. It is unfortunate for those whose capital has been vested at Yampi Sound, that the deposits are not situated in New South Wales or Victoria. If they were. and the Government had proposed an embargo, honorable members representing the State affected would have combined in protest against interference with the exploitation of natural wealth. </para>

                            <para>- I am speaking from general experience. State interests are just as strong in the eastern States as in the west. It is most unfortunate that this industry, which is the most promising development we have had in Western Australia for many years, should be squashed by the Government in the alleged interest of Australia as a whole. It does not seem to me that there was any need to impose this embargo, in view of the limited quantity of ore which was to be  exported. After all the quantity involved was only  15,000,000  tons. There was no clanger of the development of interests which might cause international complications at a later stage. The Government could have made it quite clear that, in allowing that quantity of ore to he exported, it reserved the right to restrict or prohibit exports at any stage, if necessary. Fifteen million tons is a mere trifle compared with the total iron ore available, and it would have been better, in the interests of Australia as a whole, if the embargo had not been imposed. </para>

                        <para>. -  I do not propose to speak on this matter at any length. The honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drakeford)</inline> has expressed the views which I hold, and the explanation of the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> was  100  per cent, satisfactory to me. I believe that it would be wrong for Western Australia to insist upon the removal of the export embargo. Western Australia is not playing the Australian game on this occasion. Much has been made of this interference with the possible development of the resources of that State.  I.  have been over a considerable part of the territory within which the deposits lie, and while the deposits are undoubtedly large, they have never been worked by Western Australia. Only now has an attempt been made to scratch the surface, as it were, and the fact that a halt has now been called, regrettable as that may be from the point of view of Western Australia, does not justify the representatives of that State in taking up an anti-Australian attitude. The fact is that everyone in Australia, until quite recently, thought that the iron ore resources of the country were very much larger than they really are. We have been told by visiting experts that our resources are almost unlimited, just as we have been told other things by visiting experts when we should have been much better off to have found things out for ourselves. Now it appears that every time a fresh investigation is made, the extent of our resources shrinks. It is well known that all over the world to-day the better grades of iron ores have been given a scarcity value. One of the principal reasons why Spain has been torn asunder by civil war is that in that country there happens to be the kind of iron ore deposits that everybody wants. Of course, there are iron ore deposits in almost every country, but there is not much that is of great commercial value. Recently, we were told by Great Britain that we can no longer depend upon it for the implements necessary for peace or war, but the authorities in Great Britain are willing to co-operate with us in the establishment of industries in Australia to supply om needs. This is surely the time, of all others, when we should take steps to conserve our supplies of essential raw materials. </para>

                    <para>I am opposed to the proposal of the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> to disallow these regulations, and I support the amendment of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde).</inline> We would have frankly opposed the lifting of the embargo, but we have put forward this amendment because wo believe that the interests of Western Australia, and of Australia generally, will be best served by the development of our own iron and steel industries, rather than by the export of our iron ore to other countries. For years past I have been listening to honorable members from Western Australia condemning the exploitation of the consumers by the monopoly which controls the manufacture of iron and steel products in Australia. Over and over again, I have heard the honorable member for Swan complain of the high price of galvanized iron. Very shortly we shall be needing large quantities of steel rails; we shall be needing iron and steel for the construction of locomotives, aeroplanes and automobiles. We are only on the threshold of industrial development. Why should not Western Australia have such an iron and steel industry? I remember when a previous Commonwealth government made it possible to exploit the low-grade ores, at Wiluna in Western Australia, and what a boon such aid was to the people of that State. I cannot visualize a better method of using the free credits obtainable through the Commonwealth Bank than in the provision of funds for the establishment of the iron and steel industry in Western Australia and in other places. It  is  essential  that  we should utilize these raw materials for  the  development of our own iron and  steel  trades. Every ounce of iron ore which can bc economically mined will be needed for the production of raw materials for Australian industries. Honorable members may recall that construction work on the Sydney Harbour Bridge was delayed  for  some time owing to a shortage of  Steel,  and it is well known that the scarcity of steel girders is retarding the building boom in all States. Yet some people are inclined  to  encourage  the  export of Australian iron ore. </para>
                    <para>My principal reason for taking part in this debate was to protest against  the  regrettable note sounded by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> who seemed to imply that there was something underhand about the method in which the  more  recent reports  on  Australian iron ore reserves were furnished  to  the Commonwealth. Possibly I misunderstood the honorable member for Swan, but clearly he gave me the impression that he was casting a reflection upon <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. "Woolnough,</inline> the Commonwealth geological adviser. I regret this very much indeed, and I should not he doing my duty if I did not say that not long ago I had the pleasure, not of working with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woolnough</inline> but of accompanying him through Central and North Australia. On that occasion he was engaged in making an examination of a ridge  30  miles long at Tennant Creek, where gold had been discovered. The miners, numbering about  150,  whose interests were, bound up in that venture, were very concerned about the potential value of their leases, and were waiting for some company  or  the Government  to  assist them. They were reluctant  to  install plants, which would cost probably  .£100,000 or £1.50,000,  pending a report from some recognized expert. Accordingly, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woolnough</inline> was sent  to  Tennant Creek  to  examine the  area  and report  to  the Government. I saw him carrying out his important duties there under very great difficulties, and doing work which many  a  younger man would not have cared to face. Later, at Darwin, I met, the Mines Director, and other mining experts  at  "Waverley, Pine Creek and other parts of Central Australia, all of whom expressed complete satisfaction with the work done by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr.</inline></para>
                    <para class="block">Woolnough. 1 think that the Government is very fortunate to have an adviser deservedly enjoying such a high reputation inside and outside Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woolnough</inline> has had  40  years' experience in this country. He is a competent adviser in all matters relating to metals, minerals, oil or other geological features, and knowing him as I do, I resent any suggestion that he would be associated in any way with advice that was not founded upon a thorough investigation of any problem submitted to him. </para>
                    <para>I do not know whether the honorable member for Swan intended to convey that impression of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woolnough's</inline> report, but I would say that if there was any suggestion of ulterior motives in connexion with the exploitation of the Yampi Sound deposits, it was in the method by which the original company obtained its charter. All the world knows that the promoters did not make clear that it was a purely Japanese concern. Only when those in authority became aware of this fact was action taken to put a stop to foreign exploitation. Then with the assistance of some Australian people and some English people, a company was established in London to work the deposits; but everybody knew that it was still a Japanese firm. I am not concerned whether Japan or any other country gets our raw materials if they are not necessary for Australian industries. I do not believe in favoured nation treatment. I believe that if we have an excess of raw materials they should he made available to all nations on equal terms. I cannot understand any Australian not desiring that raw materials should not bc exported until we are quite sure that our own requirements are met. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not desire, at this late hour, to debate this highly technical subject. It has been discussed exhaustively from all parts of the House, and I think that the House is agreed that the first duty of the Commonwealth Government in this matter is to ensure that we retain within Australia, an adequate supply of those raw materials which are essential for our &lt; future development. Accordingly I believe that whilst they would be opposed to the motion of the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> the majority of honorable members would be prepared to support the general terms of the amendment moved by the Acting Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde).</inline> But the amendment, as it stands, might suggest that the Government has not been sufficiently active or thorough in making the necessary investigations of our iron ore resources, and further that it has not taken effective action to develop them. Consequently, in order to express what I believe to be the view of most honorable members, I propose to move at the appropriate time to add the following words to the amendment: "And this House commends the Government for having instituted a comprehensive and detailed survey of Australia's iron ore resources". If these words are added to the amendment, it should be supported by practically every honorable member. </para>

                        <para>. - I listened with a great deal of attention to the remarks of honorable members representing Western Australia, with whom I have every sympathy. As I believe in the development of Australian industries, and as the interests of South Australia are vitally concerned in this matter, it is, I think, high time that action was taken to decentralize some of our heavier industries. The motion, however, has not my wholehearted support. The subject has been canvassed from different angles. One of the arguments  advanced was that Australia should export to countries from which it imports. If our iron deposits are of such vital importance as has been suggested, we should safeguard them. When the matter was debated in this House recently,I could not understand why the Government declined to grant permission to an all-British company, or a group of men, who were prepared to invest a good deal of capital in the enterprise, to operate on the deposits at the Middleback ranges; but I was not astonished at the imposition of an embargo on exports to a country like Japan. The Minister for the Interior has referred to-night to many deposits in different parts of Australia, and has said that the best of them are to be foundin South Australia, although he admitted that those at Yampi Sound have some value. I want to know what quantity of ore is in sight in Australia? </para>

                            <para>-I shall welcome that development. This raw material is of inestimable value to Australia; it will aid in the development of our secondary industries. The manufacture in Australia of motor car engines is not very popular in certain quarters at the moment, but that industry must be established eventually, and the sooner the better for all concerned, because a car sold in the United States of America for £200 costs from £440 to £460 in Australia.I believe that an economic unit could be established in Australia, and a car manufactured at a cost of something like £200. We already have motor-body builders in Australia and they are doing an excellent service. I appeal to the Government to investigate very seriously the quantity of iron ore available in Australia; that would be a national service. We could then embark upon the manufacture of motor car engines and proceed with the development of our iron and steel industries generally. </para>

                            <para>- I am not satisfied with the information furnished to the Minister by the Commonwealth Geological Adviser. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woolnough</inline> has not had sufficient time to gather more than meagre information as to our iron ore resources. I am fortified in my view by the remarks of the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn),</inline> who has thrown new light on the matter of the surplus. I am in complete agreement with him, that our resources would be so slightly depleted that <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> company operating in Western Australia should be given the right to continue for at least a further fifteen years. The exploitation of the deposits from Cloncurry to Yampi Sound would hare considerable effect on the development of the northern areas which are now sparsely populated ; we should thereby increase our defensive strength. The development of the last 150 years proves that the more remote an area is the more necessary is reliance upon the mining industry to provide the initial urge to the introduction of population. Surely every honorable member must realize the necessity for fostering that area and placing in it a population which will engage in economic endeavour ! I was astonished at the remarks of the Minister, who inferentially practically admitted that he has not yet sufficient information in regard to the resources of Australia, and stated that the Government will later alter its decision in regard to the export of surplus production. </para>

Even during that fifteen years, however, I do not think that it should exploit the ore to the full extent.

                    <para>A negative attitude has been adopted by the Minister to Portland Roads, regarding which only meagre information has been obtained. The Minister stated that the iron ore beds in the Cloncurry district are too far from the coast, but I claim that they are in an ideal position. They art near Mount Isa, where machinery to the value of £4,000,000 is available*. That plant could be converted into a little arsenal. If this Parliament is to display any vision at all, it must realize that an outlet to the Gulf of Carpentaria will be required in the near future. Portland Roads is only fifteen miles from the North Queensland coast, where deep water is available, yet the Minister is prepared to accept a tentative report from two geologists to the effect that that area is inaccessible. 1 am given to understand that the iron ore from Portland Roads could be carried on a downhill grade to the sea and thence to Bowen, where there is a deep-water harbour and ample supplies of coal and coke. Therefore, 1 am surprised that the Minister seems to show an unconscious bias against the development of known resources without accurate information regarding their value. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Swan referred to the geophysical survey now being undertaken in Northern Australia. It seems to rae that in the near future this Parliament will demand to know whether it is receiving full value for the money already expended in connexion with this investigation. To a certain extent, I am in. favour of this survey; in fact, my maiden speech in this chamber was delivered in support of the bill by which the money was made available for this work. Yet I fear that much money has been wasted, because advantage has not been taken of scientific information that was available to us by reason of the Canadian practice. This practice has not been followed in locating ore at depth, apart from the simple procedure of locating magnetic iron at depth. The survey committee has been guided merely by the movements of a compass on radial lines in locating anomalies at depth. In locating ore structure, geophysical instruments respond in about four general ways. In the first place, iron responds in the simple way to the compass, and this is the only method that seems to have been adopted here. Secondly, they respond to a sulphide body, but no geophysical instrument is accurate at a depth greater than about 400 feet, and attempts are being made to locate ore at greater depths than that. In Canada, where glacia'l action exposed the sulphides, it was possible to obtain information as to conditions down to 400 feet, because the sulphide bodies were either exposed or left at a lesser depth than 400 feet. Under the third method, the instruments are influenced by a shear or fault at depth, and it would be necessary to sink a. shaft to a point near or within 400 feet of the shear-zone before it would be possible to obtain a definite reaction by the instrument; even then, it would be necessary to cross-cut to the spot in order to ascertain whether the instrument had re-acted to a sulphide body, a fault, or shear-zone. Fourthly, by the sound method used in Canada, the scientist can recognize certain reactions off the dome, in contrast to the greater depth from the oil bed abutting on it; naturally, the bore is not placed above the dome. </para>

                            <para>- The reason I enumerated the various methods was to point out that further immediate advantage should be taken of the one and only method that has proved of value to Australia, the location of magnetic iron ore, and that money should not be wasted in producing maps such as I have before me, unless shafting and cross-cutting are adopted to tost values at depth. We should find out as expeditiously as possible the extent of the iron resources, and then we should adopt a vigorous policy by allowing the exportation of ore not required for our own purposes. Unless we utilize the methods which I have outlined, and get down to depth by shaft and cross-cut, the greater part of the present geophysical survey will be of little value. I have for years advocated the adoption of this course, but,  up to the present time, with no satisfactory result, because <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woolnough</inline> determines whether a shaft shall be sunk or a cross-cut made in the Northern Territory. The State geologists determine this policy in their respective States.I appeal to the Minister to call for a report from <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woolnough,</inline> now that he has changed his opinion and is utilizing both shafting and crosscutting, in order to compute the volume of the deposits at Yampi Sound. I urge that the same methods be adopted also for the development of mineral deposits in the Northern Territory, so that we shall know at the earliest possible moment what is the mineral value of its gold and other deposits at depth. </para>

                        <para>. - I direct the attention of honorable members, to the paucity of reports received by the Government. The speedy manner in which reports were obtained rendered it impossible to determine the actual area of Australia's iron ore deposits. Moreover, those submitted in connexion with Yampi Sound dealt only with the estimated quantity above high water level, but in a locality where there is a tidal rise and fall of 28 feet one can readily imagine that large quantities exist below high water mark. The Minister stated that reports have been received that boring has disclosed large cavities or voids which preclude the possibility of working the deposits below high water level. The extraction of 15,000,000 tons of ore for export from such a huge deposit would have had but a slight effect, upon our iron ore reserves, but it would have enabled the deposits to be fully developed and made available for our future use. In the event of a national emergency the Government has power to impose an embargo on exports and thus reserve sufficient supplies for Australia's requirements. The Government should expend money on geophysical and other surveys in order to demonstrate, as far as is possible, the actual extent of our iron ore resources. The information before me discloses that for over 200 years Sweden has employed geophysical methods to locate iron ore. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The United States of America, Russia and Germany also adopt such methods. It has been suggested that had the embargo not been imposed Japan would have got a foothold in Australia. All that the company asked was that certain assayers and weighing clerks, about four or five people all told, should be allowed entry. The Western Australian mining legislation prohibits any but our own people from being employed in mining in the State, and there was no possibility of Japan getting a foothold in Australia through the Yampi Sound project. </para>
                    <para>I again direct the attention of honorable members to the extraordinary procedure which is developing in this country of legislation by regulation. A year or so ago, the trade diversion policy, which involved a tremendous change of policy on the part of the Commonwealth, was imposed by means of regulations. Now to-day, we have the export of iron ore from Australia prohibited in a similar manner. </para>

It has been suggested that the Yampi Sound deposits should be made available for exploitation' by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, and I hope that, if that be done, the company will be compelled to pay for them, and that the Government of Western Australia will receive a royalty in order to recompense it for the financial loss and other trouble that it has sustained as the result of the unfair action by the Commonwealth Government. Time will tell whether I have been right and the big majority which rules in this House wrong in this matter. </para>

                        <para>.- As the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> has said, there are rumours that the Government, does not propose to proceed with the national insurance scheme. According to information that I have received, the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> which is recognized as the Government's mouthpiece, published to-day a statement to the effect that the Government intends indefinitely to postpone putting this legislation into operation. As similar information has been broadcast by a number of radio stations to-day, the House is entitled to a definite pronouncement on the subject. It. is stated that the main reason for the postponement is dissension among members of the Cabinet. There are reports that once again the ( ,A......... party is exercising its influence : i 11(1 embarrassing the Government. It would appear that the newly-formed grand Fascist council of seven members- the inner group of the Cabinet - has not been the success which the Prime Minister had hoped that, it would be. It is stated that even the Big Three who control the inner group - I refer to the Prime Minister ( <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons),</inline> the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> and the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> - have been unable to reach unanimity. If rumour bo correct, the Acting Leader of the Houseis the chief cause of the trouble. I trust that the rumour is correct, and that the Government does nor intend to give effect to the national insurance legislation which recently passed through this chamber. Despite the fact that, within the last hour, members supporting the Government resolved themselves into a mutual admiration society, and carried a cheap resolution- </para>

                        <para>. - This morning a Sydney daily newspaper set out to misrepresent me and to create in the minds of people in my electorate, and other supporters, the impression that a statement I made recently was a fabrication. As I am called upon from time to time to make statements in connexion with my parliamentary duties, I take this opportunity to give the facts to the House, and to name some of the people concerned in this matter. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>On Wednesday, the 14th September, 1938, the maritime unions connected with the port of Sydney, invited the secretary of the British Transport Workers Union, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ernest</inline> Bevin, to a luncheon at Usher's Hotel, Sydney. All the maritime unions were represented and others present included <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. D.</inline> Clyne, M.L.A., representative for Darling Harbour, and <inline font-style="italic">I,</inline> as representing the ports. I was requested to propose the toast of the health of the visitor, which I did. I was supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clyne,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin</inline> responded. At the conclusion of the luncheon, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin,</inline> accompanied by the secretary of the Maritime Unions' Council. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Tudehope, visited me at the Federal Members' rooms on the eighth floor of the Commonwealth Bank Building, Martin-place, Sydney. A conversation took place. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Bevin said he wished to discuss with me the advisability of him attending a dinner to be arranged by the general manager of the Bank of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson,  at  which representatives of the Heffron Labour party would attend. These would include the general secretary of the New South "Wales branch of the Australian Railways Union, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Lloyd</inline> Ross, who is also a member of the political bureau of the Communist party; the secretary of the Heffron party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> Evans; the organizer of the Clerks Union, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Hughes, and the  president  of the Heffron party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> O'Neill. </para>
                    <para>Before asking me for a reply, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin</inline> related the following experiences he had had with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson : - Arriving in New Zealand, on his way to Australia, to attend the British Relations Conference at Lapstone, New South "Wales, he was met by a gentleman who stated that he represented <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson, and had been asked to inquire if he, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin,</inline> would meet <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson soon after arriving in Australia. More than likely that gentleman in New Zealand was one of «the representatives of the Bank of New South Wales in that dominion. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin</inline> said that he remarked to that gentleman that he was at <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> loss to know why <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson should want to see him, but finally said that, at that, stage, he could see no harm in the meeting taking place. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevan</inline> duly arrived in Sydney and, according to arrangements made for delegates to the conference, went to the Hotel Australia. Not very long afterwards, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson visited the hotel, presented his card, and was duly ushered in to see <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin.</inline> After introducing himself, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson1 early indicated his mission. The request he made to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin</inline> was that he should meet the representatives of the Heffron Labour party. At that stage <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin</inline> had no knowledge of the Heffron Labour party, so he made some inquiries from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson, who explained that it was a party that had broken away from the official Labour party of New South "Wales and formed another organization. He added that the Heffron party was anxious to discuss its problems with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin. Mr. Bevin's</inline> answer was to the effect that he had no desire to meet any breakaway organization. Such a discussion would, in his opinion, be in extremely bad taste, and con trary to the conduct which visiting labour representatives should observe. He further declared that if a representative of Labour in Australia went to London and engaged in consultations with breakaway movements in- England the action would be roundly condemned by the British Labour party. Therefore, he added : " I am not going to consult with or meet people in Australia that I certainly would not expect an Australian Labour representative to meet in Great Britain." So the conclusion of that interview was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin</inline> refused to meet the breakaway organization. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson apparently was not to be pushed aside by one refusal and he awaited another opportunity. </para>
                    <para>
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin</inline>
                        continued his conversation with me by informing me that the programme of the conference at Lapstone included a garden party at the property of the Macarthur Onslow family at Camden. Many delegates attended, including
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin. Mr. Bevin</inline>
                        explained to me the happenings at the garden party. He said that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline>
                        Davidson again appeared on the scene. He managed to engage
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin</inline>
                        in conversation by first discussing newspapers, directing attention to
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin's</inline>
                        association with the London
                        <inline font-style="italic">Baily Herald.</inline>
                        He informed
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin</inline>
                        that he was handling the accounts of
                        <inline font-style="italic">The Labor Daily,</inline>
                        of Sydney, and would like
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin's</inline>
                        comment on the paper.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin's</inline>
                        comment was not very complimentary. However,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin</inline>
                        said that he made some reference to two features appearing in the newspaper. He explained to me that his reason for that was to " try out "
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred.</inline>
                        Davidson in order to ascertain what control and influence he had over the
                        <inline font-style="italic">Labor Daily.</inline>
                        This test had an effect, according to
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin's</inline>
                        advice to me, in that two days later he noticed that corrections had been made in the features. That fact was sufficient for him to know who was running the
                        <inline font-style="italic">Labor Daily.</inline>
                    </para>
                    <para>The conversation between <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin</inline> continued, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson again pressed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin</inline> to meet representatives of the Heffron Labour party. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin</inline> was of the same mind as at the previous interview', but <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson continued to press his request. There the matter rested for the time being, and so concluded the talk between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin, Mr. Tudehope,</inline> aud myself. </para>
                    <para>
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin</inline>
                        returned to Lapstone. The conference later concluded,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin</inline>
                        arrived hack iu Sydney, and, after meeting
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline>
                        Davidson, dined with him  at  the bend office of the Bank of New South Wales. The conversation that took place  at  that dinner was told to me by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin</inline>
                        in Canberra on the 23rd September when he arrived here on his way to Melbourne, en route for England.
                    </para>
                    <para>At the dinner, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson put several points to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin.</inline> These were as follows : " We want to alter the rules of the Labour party  in  New South Wales. We want to remove <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> from the leadership of the party. We want the party and not the conference to elect the leader. Generally, a new Labour organization is required in New South Wales ". In speaking of the rules of the party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin</inline> said he told <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson that he thought it was a matter for the members of the party,  as  was the cas» elsewhere, and that  if  the members wished to alter the rules it was within their power to do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson's answer was to the effect that the Heffron party, lacking the numbers, was unable to do that, so another organization had been set up. </para>
                    <para>Referring to the leadership, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson said that the Heffron party claimed that Labour could not win with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> and that he, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson, was in agreement with that view. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin</inline> inquired whether it was a fact that his, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson's, government was in power, and if so, why he wanted Labour to win. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson's reply was to the effect that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin</inline> did not quite understand politics in New South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson said: "You know, Bevin,  it  is different here from what it is  in  your country. What we want here  In  New South Wales is a ' properly-led ' Opposition. We have not got that with Lang. I know the Government in power is to tuy liking, but I am concerned with the future, and, in fact, I feel that we want an Opposition Leader who is respected. In effect, we want a properly- led Opposition, and that is what the Heffron party is fighting for. Do you know, Bevin, that this Lang also selects his own Ministers? Now we want to change all that. Lang has raised the Communist issue against us in this fight, but I want you to disbelieve that, although I admit that Communists are in the Heffron organization. They have attached themselves to the movement." </para>
                    <para>Air. Bevin. replied that he felt it was none of his business. While <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson's statements were all very interesting, he, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin,</inline> recognized the official movement, and it was not within his province, as a visitor to Australia, to interfere in the domestic affairs of the Labour party of New South Wales. </para>
                    <para>Naturally, I inquired from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin</inline> what his reactions were to the whole affair. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin</inline> replied: "It is all very strange to me to find a leading banker so deeply interested in the domestic affairs of the Labour party as to have such a close alliance with men who claim to be militant Labour representatives. I do not know all the details, but <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson's anxiety about Lang was most pronounced He had Lang firmly impressed in his mind, and, it appeared to me, that he would do all in his power to remove him. It is a strange alliance. I know what I would think of such a position in England. It is natural that I must think the same of it in Australia". Ho concluded by particularly requesting me to work for the success of the Dominions Labour Conference in New Zealand in 1940. </para>
                    <para>I have made this definite statement on the floor of this House for very specific reasons. First of all, it will explain an attempt made by a newspaper this morning to make it appear that any references which I have previously made to the subject are mere fabrications. I point out that I have corroboration for all that I have said. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudehope</inline> will substantiate my statement of what took place at the first interview with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin.</inline> and corroboration of all of the other incidents which I have mentioned can be given by the honorable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mulcahy).</inline> My main purpose in making this statement in this Parliament is to convey to the electors whom I represent my attitude on  this matter, and to make perfectly clear my determination to disclose, so far as 1 am able, what appears to be an unholy alliance between <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson and the Heffron party, and also to warn supporters of the Labour movement of what is actually going on. I wish also to reveal to them the manner in which a leading banker is dabbling, interfering and assisting financially, and otherwise, certain people, some of whom I have named, for the purpose of gaining complete control of political affairs in the State of New South Wales. I thank honorable members for their courtesy in allowing me to make this statement. </para>

                        <para>s. - The answers to the honorable member's questions are as follows : - 1 and 2.  Imports  into Australia of peanuts, both shelled and unshelled, and the principal countries from which they were obtained, during the past ten  years,  were as follows: -  3 and  4.  In April, 1927, an embargo under the Quarantine Act was imposed on peanuts. This embargo was modified in September or that year, imports being permitted for roasting and manufacturing purposes. This position obtained until April, 1929, when action was taken under the Customs Act to prohibit further imports of peanuts, excepting that prior contracts entered into by importers wore exempted from the embargo. As a result of a drought the Australian production of peanuts in 1932-33 represented only 14 per cent, of requirements, and the following year there was again a shortage due to many growers changing over to maize production on account of the high maize prices at that time. Having regard to the needs of consumers the Government removed the embargo in December, 1933. Since that time the Australian industry has been adequately protected by duties under the general tariff of4d. per lb. on unshelled peanuts and6d. per lb. on peanut kernels. The adequacy of the protection is demonstrated by the small quantities which are imported under these duties. Peanuts for oil expression purposes are, however, admitted free of duty, but only in respect of such quantities as are found necessary to meet the requirements of manufacturers after the local supplies of milling nuts have been absorbed. </para>

                        <para>s.- On the 21st October, the honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Frederick Stewart)</inline> asked a question, <inline font-style="italic">without notice,</inline> regarding the provision of internal supplies of liquid fuels by means of the hydrogenation of coal. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> desire to inform the honorable member that the Government has constituted a Standing Committee on Liquid Fuels comprising departmental officers and representatives of industry. The reference to the committee is to inquire into and to report, from time to time upon the possibilities of the production in Australia of liquid fuels and substitutes therefor from all sources with a view to obtaining greater national independence in this regard. Oil from coal will be one of the sources of production to be investigated by the committee. As the honorable member is aware, the question of the production of oil from coal by hydrogenation has been under the consideration of the Government for some time, and has been reported upon by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Rivett and the Common wealth Hydrogenation Committee. The Standing Committee on Liquid Fuels will use these reports as a basis for further investigation. </para>

                    <para class="block">Acts 1936. Particulars regarding the expenditure  from  this account were tabled on the 7th October, 1938. The money has been expended on advances to operating companies, the purchase of modern drilling equipment and administrative expenditure. An amount of £166,933 15s. 7d. remained in the account on the 30th June, 1938. The money advanced to companies has been expended on geological survey  work  and test drilling at Roma, Hutton Creek and Arcadia, Queensland; at Kulnura andMulgoa, New South Wales; and at Lakes Entrance and Longford, Victoria. Four drilling plants have been purchased. One is at Hutton Creek, another at Kulnura, while a third has  been  made available for the joint Government scout drilling campaign inGippsland. The fourth plant is stored in Sydney, but an application for its hire is under consideration. The Prospecting for Petroleum Trust Account was created under the Petroleum Prospecting Acts 1926, 1927 and 1928. Only £388 3s.11d. remained in this account at the 30th June, 1938. The expenditure of £4,010 10s. 3d. from this fund during the financial year 1937-38 comprised a contribution of £4,000 by the Commonwealth to the fund provided jointly by the Victorian and Commonwealth Governments  for  the scout drilling campaign in Gippsland. The balance was incurred on administrative expenses. While actually no oil in commercial quantities is being obtained, it is considered that the search  for  oil in Australia has progressed materially as a result of the expenditure incurred by the Government. Much additional information is available and generally improved methods are being employed by operating companies. </para>

                    <para>I desire to inform the honorable member that the Commonwealth Government directed the committee of inquiry to investigate the disaster so that it would report upon the cause or causes, with a view to obviating such accidents in the future. The committee was free to conduct its inquiry in any way that it desired, and if for certain reasons it was deemed by the committee to be inadvisable to publish certain evidence, such a decision was the responsibility of the committee. The Government does not propose to issue directions to the committee other than those given at the beginning of the investigation. The Government considered that the committee should be free to conduct its investigations in its own way. The Government has issued no instructions to the committee  as  to what evidence should be published or not published, nor does it propose to issue any such instruction. </para>
