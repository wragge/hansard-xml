The negotiations following upon Mr. Chamberlain's visit to Herr Hitler and the subsequent agreement between the British and French Cabinets upon a policy for the peaceful settlement of the Sudeten question are still proceeding, and have, at the moment, reached such a delicate stage that a premature statement, or even a loose word, might well imperil the peace of the world. In the circumstances, I feel that I cannot, and ought not, speak. I hope that I shall soon be in a position to make a full statement. </para>

However, the Labour party's policy in regard to international affairs is well known, and there is not, nor will there be, any wavering in regard to it; it stands. We are advocates and supporters of peace. Therefore, we agree that nothing should be done or said to-day which might prejudice the efforts being made to secure a peaceful solution of the problem.    </para>

If the honorable mem-, ber would even read the newspapers he would not have to ask either the Minister for Commerce or myself the question which he has now submitted. He would know that the States came to an agreement,' submitted it to the Commonwealth, and were promised that when the full Cabinet was present the Commonwealth Government would deal with the matter. The Government has intimated its approval of the plan, and its willingness to co-operate, and when the proposal comes before the House the honorable member will be in possession of all the information available in regard to it. </para>

                        <para> It is my intention at the earliest possible moment to make a statement on the whole mission of the delegation overseas and to state the position clearly with regard to what has been done. The Anglo-American trade negotiations are at present incomplete and it is impossible to say what will be the final outcome until decisions have been reached. I venture to say, however, that the statements that will be made by me on these subjects will cover the point raised by the honorable member. </para>

                        <para>- In directing a question to the Minister representing the Postmaster-General, I point out by way of explanation that I have received from an authoritative body in New South Wales a statement that a parcel sent by air-liner to Tasmania at a cost of approximately 7s. would cost about 28s. if sent by air through the Post Office. I am told that Air Lines of Australia will carry parcels to Hobart by air at 9d. per lb., with a minimum charge of 2s., whilst the cost of sending a 1 lb. parcel through the Post Office to Hobart by air is 8s. 8d. If the parcel weighed more than 1 lb., the Post Office would charge letter rate for it, namely, 2d. per ounce, plus 3d. per half ounce for air mail, a total of 8d. per ounce. If a private individual can make arrangements with private air lines for the despatch of parcels at such reasonable rates, cannot the Postmaster-General's department supply similar facilities for the benefit of the people generally? </para>

                        <para>- Is the Minister for the Interior able to give honorable members any idea when the examination of the iron ore deposits at Yampi Sound is likely to be completed? Will he also tell us whether he made a statement recently to the effect that it was estimated that the deposits at Yampi were approximately 57,000,000 tons? On 'whose report was that estimate based, and may the report be made available to the public? </para>

                        <para>- I am not able to give the honorable member any accurate estimate of the time likely to be occupied in making the survey of the Yampi Sound iron ore deposits. . The work is being done by the Mines Department of Western Australia acting in co-operation with the Commonwealth Geological Adviser. At present it is believed that the survey will not be concluded in less than six months, but it is quite impossible to gauge accurately the time likely to be occupied by it. As to the extent of the deposits, I said that among other estimates made of the quantity of iron ore at Yampi one was 63,000,000 tons. That estimate was' made by officers of the North Australian Geological Survey. I shall inquire whether it is possible to make that report available to the public. </para>

                        <para>- The position with regard to the conduct of this survey is that the Commonwealth Government intimated to the Western Australian Government, as it did to other State governments, its intention that such a survey should be made, and offered that, should the State governments so desire, they would have an opportunity to con duct the survey through their own Mines Departments, the expense being borne by the Commonwealth. The Western Australian Government elected to conduct the survey itself. The Commonwealth Geological Adviser and the Geological Adviser of the Western Australian Government proceeded together to Yampi Sound, and there agreed upon the work necessary to be done in order to conduct the survey. The work now in progress is work of a nature mutually agreed upon by the Commonwealth and State Geological Advisers. Naturally, no new estimate of the ore resources can be made at this stage, because that is the purpose of the survey. As to the cost of the survey, preliminary estimates have, of course, been made, but it is not possible. I believe, to make further estimates of cost at this stage. </para>

I had not been approached to intervene in the dispute until recently when the Leader of the Opposition induced union representatives to come to Canberra and discuss the matter with me and asked me if I would be prepared to discuss it' with them. I then made it perfectly clear that the attitude of the Government was that 11 tribunal had been appointed to settle matters of this kind, that if the dispute was confined to a State a State tribunal could deal with it, and that if it reached interstate proportions the Federal Arbitration Court could deal with it. Recently the Federal Arbitration Court, through one of its judges, has called a compulsory conference. I hope that that will have the effect of bringing the parties together, and of inducing the men to go back to work. </para>

                        <para>- Is it a fact that the commission appointed under the provisions of the National Health and Pensions Insurance Act, has arranged that approved societies will be paid ls. for every insured person who joins their membership? If so, will this not involve an expenditure of approximately £90,000 in order to ensure the enrolment of persons who, under the act, are obliged to join approved societies, and who, moreover, in the event of a society not being named by them, will be allotted by the commission to such society as it thinks fit? In the circumstances, what is the justification for the expenditure of so large a sum of money? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable, gentleman is correct. The justification of the payment is the recoupment of the approved societies approximately the amount of clerical and other expenditure to which they will be put in starting the approved societies and in the initial enrolment of members. The commission does not believe that the amount, of 3 s. a head is at all excessive as the amount essential to recoup that initial expenditure. </para>

I understand that the Public Service Commissioner, in terms of the Public Service Act, is obliged to confine his choice to persons within the Service, unless he is conscientiously able to say that the post cannot be filled from within the Service. I understand that very few appointments have been made up to the present time of persons outside the Service. Possibly only one such appointment has been made - a professional person. </para>

                        <para>- The present time is one of great competition between those persons who wish to form approved societies. The National Insurance Commission has become aware of quite a large number of unwarranted statements that have been made in circulars issued by one or other of those persons forming approved societies. The statements to which the commission has taken exception are by no means confined to those which originate with employers' organizations. In all cases where the commission has found that unjustified statements have been made it has taken steps at once, by correspondence or otherwise, to notify the persons concern-ed of such statements. It is hoped that approved societies will be formed under fair conditions. </para>

As has been pointed out on previous occasions, the Australian Broadcasting Commission has specified certain hours within which broadcasts may be made. It makes no discrimination against individuals or churches, but it does prescribe the hours during which .broadcasts may be made. So far as I am aware, the only broadcasts of the nature referred to which have been refused have been those asked for at hours earlier than the opening hour for the day. I should not attempt to dictate to the commission in this connexion, even though I myself have been affected by its decision. </para>

Is it also a fact that these natives are contracted to work for 10s. a month and their keep, which consists of sweet potatoes-? If this is correct, will the labour that is proposed to be used for the construction of a new road, for which £250,000 has been made available by the Commonwealth Government, be exploited in a similar manner by the contractors? </para>

It is not a fact that the Commonwealth Government has expended or contemplates expending £250,000 on a road. The only road that is to be built is to be built by those persons who have interests in New Guinea. They will find the money and will build the roam As the honorable member has a passion for information, however, I . shall make inquiries myself and, when I have information about the things of which he has spoken, I shall pass it on to him. </para>

No conference of protectors of aborigines is projected; one was held about twelve months ago. The Ministers responsible for the administration of native affairs in the States will be asked to meet in conference with the Commonwealth Minister concerned - myself, at the present time - to consider aboriginal affairs on a wider basis.

                        <para>- That is not correct. The first report was tabled over two years ago, but, owing to the closing down of certain sections of the industry, there has been a more recent inquiry. The report on this investigation has been received by the Government and is now under consideration. Negotiations are in progress between the Trade Treaty sections of the Department of Trade and Customs and one of the countries engaged in the export of cut glass. I expect to announce the result shortly. </para>

Following upon my assurance to the honorable gentleman, when he called the attention of the House and the country to the injuries suffered by Frigo Orlando, I saw the new Italian Consul-General, and I discussed the matter with him at great length. He gave me the benefit of his views, and I corrected him on points of fact. I was able to present him with the depositions of Orlando, and with the first-hand evidence that was available to the department. The Consul-General professed himself greatly impressed by them, and asked for an opportunity to review the position in the light of these facts. There the matter rests. </para>

I gave no assurance in regard to the abolition of slums, because it is not possible for the Commonwealth Government to do that. The slums fall within the jurisdiction of the State authorities, and they constitute a difficult problem for the States. </para>

                        <para>. - In spite of considerable difficulties created by overseas developments, the past year has been one of appreciable economic advance in Australia. The" wide fluctuations and instability experienced in many important oversea countries have not been, to any appreciable extent, reflected in Australia as a whole. Indeed, we may congratulate ourselves on the degree of resistance that Australia has shown to adverse oversea influences. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>In regard to employment in Australia, the average trade union unemployment percentage in 1936-37 was 10.6 and in 1937-38 it was8.5. A slight increase occurred in the last quarter of the financial year, the latest available figure being 8.6 per cent. </para>
                    <para>The value of Australian recorded material production, which had fallen to £305,000,000 in 1931-32, reached £456,000,000 in 1936-37, and the final results for 1937-38 will probably showabout the same figure. But for the unfortunate decline of export prices, which began in May, 1937, the value of production for 1937-38 would, of course, have reached a considerably higher level. </para>
                    <para>Building activity continued to expand in 1937-38 from its previous high level. The value of building permits issued in Australia in 1937-38, apart from governmental buildings, is estimated to have been approximately £56,000,000, as compared . with about £48,000,000 in 1936-37, and only about £9,000,000 in 1931-32. </para>
                    <para>The value of our wool clip was approximately £52,600,000 in 1937-38, as compared with £63,600,000 in 1936-37 The prospects for the coming year arc difficult to gauge, but it is not unreasonable to expect that any change will be for the better, particularly if the European political difficulties are overcome. </para>
                    <para>Wheat has been heavily hit by falling prices. It is difficult to be optimistic about the prospects for wheat prices in the coming year. </para>
                    <para>Taking our exports as a whole, average prices realized in 1937-38 were 12½ per cent, below those for 1936-37. However, although prices were down in 1937-38, the volume of exported production was appreciably higher, and our 1937-38 export income was but little below that of 1936-37- £125,400,000 sterling against £129,000,000 sterling. </para>
                    <para>The investment of overseas capital in Australia also continued at a satisfactory rate, and the call on London funds was less than might, have been expected. The net drain on London funds in 1937-38 was probably not over £10,000,000 sterling. Taking the last two years together, it is probable that at least £15,000,000 sterling has been added to Australia's reserves of London funds. </para>
                    <para>Prophecy as to the future entails speculation as to political and economic trends which at present are very confused. In the political sphere, particularly in Europe, one can only hope for the best. In the economic sphere, I do not believe that the situation is as disquieting as we might be led to believe. The recent trend towards recovery in the United  'States  of America may well grow in strength sufficiently to offset and eventually to  change the hesitant and downward trends in some other countries. The favorable developments will have to be accelerated appreciably, however, if they are to make themselves feltbefore the bulk of our own export commodities of this season begin to be sold on the world's markets. </para>
                    <para>I have already referred to the remarkable resistance that the Australian economy has shown towards adverse overseas developments. This may be attributed to some extent to an increased production, which has offset a decline of prices, but I believe that just as potent a factor has been the determination of those in charge of our institutions not to let their minds be unduly affected by every economic breeze that blows from overseas. </para>
                    <para>The Board of the Commonwealth Bank is carefully watching business activities for any signs of recession. With the helpful co-operation of manufacturers and others, the Board is in a position to keep itself promptly and fully informed of current trends and, within the limits of sound finance, can be relied upon to use appropriate central banking measures to assist in counteracting or lessening a decline of activity. </para>

                <para>The Loan Council will shortly undertake the task of arranging the first large conversion loan in Australia since the internal conversion of 1931. The amount of loans to be converted is about £68,000,000, which falls due for repayment on the 15th December next. Of this amount £6,000,000 carries interest at 3 per cent, and £62,000.000 carries interest at 4 per cent. Approximately half of the ma turing loans represents Commonwealth debt, and the balance is debt of the various State governments. </para>
                <para>Sinking fund operations in recent years reduced these securities from the peak of £78,000,000, and a further £4,000,000 of sinking fund moneys will be available towards redemption of the loans before the15th December. </para>

            <para>Before coming to the budget for the current year, I will deal briefly with the past year.

            <para>The principal factor which contributed to the excess revenue was customs and excise revenue. The budget estimate for these revenue items was £44,500,000, and the actual revenue £48,3S3,000, an increase of £3,883,000. . The difficulty of estimating customs and excise revenue is well known. The improvement over the estimate in this case was due to circumstances which could not be foreseen. Internal conditions continued very buoyant during 1937-38, despite the decline of export prices. Imports for the year just closed amounted to £112,000,000 sterling compared with £91,000,000 sterling for the previous year. </para>
            <para>Revenue receipts under headings other than those of customs and excise were close to the revenue estimates, as were also almost all of the expenditure items. </para>

                <para>In April last the Prime Minister outlined to Parliament the main features of the Government's defence programme for the next three years, under which extensive measures will be taken to strengthen greatly the Navy, Army and Air Force, to expand the Government munitions factories, and to organize civil industry for an emergency. The subsequent trend of the international situation has unfortunately only emphasized the urgency and importance of pressing on with J;he strengthening of our defences. The progress of the programme has been constantly under review by the Government and ' satisfactory results are being achieved. </para>
                <para>In May last Parliament approved of a loan appropriation of £10,000,000 for defence purposes. Of this amount £4,000,000 has already been raised, and is being applied towards the defence programme of this financial year. </para>

It is anticipated that contributions by and in respect of insured persons under the national insurance scheme will commence on the 2nd January, 1939, and that for the halfyear ended 30th June, 1939, approximately £5,500,000 will be received. Of the amount mentioned, approximately £3,000,000 will be credited to the Pensions Fund and £2,500,000 to the Health Fund. </para>

                    </para>
                    <para>In September, 1937, the rate of pension was increased to its former maximum level of £1 per week and the total expenditure for the year ended 30th June, 1938, amounted to just under £15,800,000, an increase of approximately £1,800,000 on the previous year. This increase was due to the normal net growth of the number of pensioners, the cost of the increase of the maximum rate of pension from 19s. to 20s. per week, and the fact that there were 27 pay-days during the year instead of the usual 26. </para>
                    <para>At the 30th June, 1938, there were 310,250 invalid and old-age pensioners, <inline font-style="italic">an</inline> increase of a little over 11,000 during, the year. </para>
                    <para>Approximately85 per cent, of the pensioners receive the maximum rate of pension, £1 per week, and the average rate of pension is 19s. 3d. per week. </para>
                    <para>It is estimated that the net increase of the number of pensioners during the current year will be approximately 11,500 and that the total cost of invalid and old age pensions for the year will be £16,150,000. This represents an increase of £350,000 over the actual expenditure last year. But for the extra pay-day last year the increase would be £865,000. </para>
                    <para>During this session the Government will introduce legislation relating to reciprocity between the Commonwealth and New Zealand in the matter of invalid and old age pensions. At the present time, residence in New Zealand is not accepted as residence in Australia for pension purposes, and vice versa. The new legislation will enable residence in either country to be taken into account, with the result that the total period of residence in the two countries will , be accepted by both. </para>
                    <para>In regard to invalid pensions, an essential qualification at present is that permanent incapacity for work shall have occurred in Australia. It is now proposed that permanent incapacity occurring in New Zealand shall be accepted as having occurred in Australia, and vice versa. </para>
                    <para>The cost of these liberalizations will be borne by the Commonwealth and the Dominion of New Zealand in proportion to the respective period of qualifying residence in each country. </para>

Apart from defence, the estimate for additions and new works is £5,423,000, an increase of £885,000 over the actual expenditure of last year. The increase is mainly due to post office, Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory. For the post office, the estimated expenditure is £3,938,000, which will be referred to later. </para>
                <para>For the Northern Territory, £300,000 is to be provided. The increase over last year is £197,000 and is necessary to provide water supply, a new hospital and other services in keeping with the growing needs of the territory. </para>

                <para>The ordinary services of departments also necessitate increased expenditure this year. For ordinary departments - excluding business undertakings and territories - the increase over last year is £407,000. About £30,000 is due to the restoration by an award of portion of cost of living reduction; £42,000 is due to exchange charges now being included in ordinary departmental votes instead of in a special Treasury vote. Apart from these special items, the increase is £335,000 and is mainly due to expansion of the Department of the Interior caused by the heavy defence programme and general increase of works. </para>

                <para>There is no need to reiterate the great importance of scientific research in our national life. Such results as the discovery that Australian hardwoods are suitable for paper manufacture, the development of a process for the transport of chilled beef from Australia to the London market, valuable work done on kiln seasoning of timbers, and achievements in respect of animal health and the control of pests, have been of inestimable benefit to the country. </para>

                <para>In considering the . grant to Western Australia it is necessary to hear in mind that the normal grant paid in 1937-38 was £439,000 plus a special advance of £136,000 on account of drought, to he. adjusted in 1939-40, bringing the total sum to £575,000. The normal grant recommended for this year is £614,000, from which is deducted a special advance of £44,000 made in 1936-37.

            <para>Last year the estimate for customs and excise revenue was £44,500,000, and the actual revenue was £48,383,000.For the current year the difficulty of estimating this revenue is accentuated by the high level of . imports last year, the decline of export prices during the last twelve months, and the impossibility of forecasting the future trend of prices. Inquiries indicate that traders generally anticipate no decline of business activities in the first six months of the financial year and are making their arrangements on that basis. Some fall of imports and customs revenue seems inevitable during the financial year. After careful consideration I have put down the customs and excise revenue for this year at £46,750,000, namely - customs, £31,250,000 ; excise, £15,500,000. This estimate represents a reduction of customs revenue by £1,723,000, and assumes that excise collections will be at about the same level as last year. </para>
            <para>For sales tax the estimate of £7,800,000 allows for a slight fall as compared with last year. </para>
            <para>For income tax the estimate is £10,700,000, which represents an increase of £1,302,000 over last year. This is due to the improved incomes last year upon which assessments this year will be based, together with the fact that the system of averaging will cease to operate under existing legislation, except in respect of primar y producers. </para>
            <para>The estimate of £3,265,000 for "Miscellaneous " includes an amount of £500,000, being balances of sundry trust accounts which are no longerrequired for their original purposes. This is a non-recurring item of revenue. </para>

            </para>
            <para>The Government has given full consideration to the various ways and means of bridging this gap of £3,184,000. It is necessary to bear in mind not only this year's budget, but also the position next year when the Government will be faced with further liabilities for defence, national insurance, and invalid and old age pensions, and will only have available £1,000,000 of excess revenue of last year, in lieu of £2,495,000 which is available towards this year's budget. </para>
            <para>The question of raising further loan moneys has been explored, as this source of finance to assist the budget might be justified on the grounds of the defence programme and the public works expenditure, particularly for the Postal Department. In view, however, of the large conversion loan which is to be faced in the immediate future and the requirements of the States for their public works programmes, it was found impracticable for further loan moneys to be provided beyond the £4,000,000 which has already been raised for defence and the amount of £2,000,000 which is being raised for grants to States for farmers' debt adjustment. </para>
            <para>The Government was therefore forced to the conclusion that the whole of the shortage of £3,184,000 must be covered by additional taxation. The proposals of the Government are as follows :  - </para>

For the present year all taxpayers, other than primary producers, will lose the benefit of the " averaging " system, and, even if the rates were unaltered, many taxpayers will be called upon to pay extra taxation, as their taxable incomes for 1937-38 will be higher than the average of the last five years and will therefore attract a higher rate of tax. </para>

            <para>A budget speech has necessarily to cover a great deal of ground. I have attempted this year to condense the story as much as possible, in order that the broad picture of our Commonwealth finances should not be encumbered with too much detail. </para>
            <para>Despite some recession overseas, our own internal financial and economic position has remained good - I might even say remarkably good - compared with other countries. We are, as a country, preparing to meet very large increases of expenditure on defence and on social services, and, at the same time, maintain our progressive development in the manifold other directions in which the hand of government is essential for the welfare of the people. We are doing this in the face of world difficulties of a serious order. As a self-governing member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, we have no enemies and no enmities - and yet we find it essential, the world being as it is, to impose great burdens on ourselves in an endeavour to ensure some measure of security for ourselves and for our children. This endeavour means increased taxation which, as I have outlined, the Government proposes should be spread in as equitable a manner as possible. </para>
            <para>No government enjoys placing a higher burden of taxation on its people, but we believe that the responsible taxpayers of Australia are ready to meet the task of endeavouring to achieve social betterment and national security. The times are too serious to allow of dispersion of effort in internal political dissension, and the Government hopes that the Parliament will accept this defence budget as a courageous effort to add to our national security in the widest sense of the term. </para>

                <para class="block">Under the Supply Act (No. 1) which was passed in June last, provision was made in the ordinary services of the Commonwealth for the first three months of the current financial year. The present measure makes provision for a further amount of £5,349,050 for another two months to meet expenditure under the following headings :  - </para>

                <para class="block">The provision made in this bill is for essential services only. The amounts provided, together with the Supply already granted by Parliament, represent the provision necessary for the services up to the end of November. The amounts included in this Supply Bill are 'based on the rate of expenditure for the last financial year, or for the current year, whichever is the lower, and represent the proportionate amount of the total provision, with a few exceptions, in which cases the expenditure is heavier in the earlier months of the financial year, such as, for example, certain defence expenditure, in connexion with which it is necessary to place orders in the early part of the year, and also in respect of some items in the Postal Department, where mail contracts have to be made in the earlier months of the year. The provision of £400,000 for refunds of revenue is necessary to enable refunds to be made of amount which, under statutory authority, are temporarily credited to revenue for payment at a later date. Honorable members will notice an . amount of £500,000 for Treasurer's Advance. This sum, with the £2,000,000 included in the earlier Supply Bill, brings the total up to £2,500,000 for 1938-39, as against £2,000,000 in recent years. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I may be allowed to offer a word or two of explanation with reference to this item, in order to remove . a misunderstanding of its purpose. This is a vote, usually of appreciable size in one or two Supply bills introduced before the budget is passed. Supply bills make provision only for the ordinary expenditure of departments and not for such items as additions, new works, or for other proposals which are the subject of special appropriation by the Parliament. The most important of these are grants to the States. Accordingly, in addition to providing for the ordinary services, the Government, at the beginning of each financial year, has also to make provision for carrying out publicworks from the 30th June, from which period the- vote of the previous year ceased, until the budget is passed by Parliament. The normal public works programme has to be carried on and other financial commitments met, such as Commonwealth grants to the States. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, subject to adjustment later. These are the two heaviest items contained in Supply bills before the budget is presented. Although a large sum is set down in the annual Estimates for the Treasurer's Advance, it is not the practice to include any portion as a charge to the budget. Items contained in Supply bills in respect of" which Treasurer's Advance has been expended are subsequently incorporated in. the budget, which gives authority, retrospectively, of course, for the expenditure. The Treasurer's Advance also covers other unexpected items of expenditure, but usually they are relatively small amounts which are later accounted for in Supplementary Estimates. The increased provision in respect of the Treasurer's Advance in this measure and the earlier supply bill is due to the largely expanded works programme, mainly on the defence side; but as I have already said, the expenditure under each relevant heading is proportionate to last year's expenditure or to this year's expenditure whichever is the less. The Government gives an undertaking that the bill contains no provision for new proposals. </para>

                    <para>A review of the Australian tobacco industry has recently been undertaken, and, having regard to the increased production of Australian leaf, combined with the remarkable improvement of quality, the G overnment has decided to take the necessary steps to raise the minimum percentages of Australian-grown leaf used in the manufacture of cigarettes and tobacco. For cigarettes the required percentage is to be raised from 2½ per cent, to3 per cent., whilst in the case of tobacco the percentage is to be increased from 13 per cent, to 15 per cent. This action can be regarded as a second step in the implementation of the Government's policy to ensure the purchase and consumption of all usable tobacco leaf grown in Australia. Further steps in conformity with this policy will depend upon future crop production, improvement of the quality of Australian leaf, stocks of matured tobacco leaf held by manufacturers and the effect of the present measures on consumption. Future percentage increases will be investigated by the Tariff Board. The increased percentages take effect from the 1st October, 1938, as far as leaf used by Australian manufacturers is concerned, and from the 1st January, 1939, with respect to manufactured tobacco and cigarettes imported from the United Kingdom. These brief periods are allowed in order that manufacturers may have sufficient time in which to adjust the formulae used in connexion with the manufacture of the numerous brands of tobacco and cigarettes produced by them. My colleague, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> has already indicated that certain increased excise duties are proposed under the budget. I am able to enlarge on the information he has already given by stating that an increase is proposed in respect of the excise duties on manufactured tobacco by 8d. per lb. This increase is expected to yield £500,000 additional revenue over a f ull twelve months' period. During the currency of the present financial year this increase of excise duty is expected to add £375,000 to the revenue. </para>

                    <para class="block">I do not wish to expand on what I said in the budget speech, in respect of the proposed increase of the rate of sales tax, except to remind the committee that the new proposed 5 per cent, rate will, it is estimated, produce £1,300,000 for the balance of this financial year. It is estimated that the total value of the wholesale turnover in Australia is about £550,000,000 per annum. By progressive steps, exemptions have amounted to about £350,000,000, leaving taxable turnover to the value of only about £200,000,000. As I have said in the budget speech, the Government has, as far as it is possible to do so, in respect of indirect taxation, by a judicious selection of exemptions, particularly of those items which enter into the regimen of the basic wage earner, endeavoured to make this tax one in regard to which those who can afford to pay do so, and those on the lower range of income are shielded from "the tax. </para>
                    <para>The value of the wholesale turnover of exempted foodstuffs is estimated at £130,000,000; fuel, light, and other services of a similar character, £70,000,000; clothing, £10,000,000; medicines required by hospitals, benevolent institutions and the like, £2,000,000, making a total wholesale turnover to the value of about £220,000,000 that can be said to be related directly to the budget of the average basic wage worker and others on the lower ranges of income. The Government, in its sales tax exemption policy, has examined progressively each year the regimen of the various wage fixing tribunals and has selected for exemption items that in the main affect those on the lower ranges of income. </para>
                    <para>Honorable members may wish to know why such an early date as to-morrow has been fixed for the operation of the new rate of tax, instead of the end of the month or the 1st of October. The object is to prevent a dislocation of trade that would certainly occur if any date other than the nearest possible date to to-day were chosen. If the end of the month were chosen there would be a definite dislocation of trade, in that there would be a large turnover in the remaining stages of this month to the detriment of the succeeding month's business, so it has always Been the policy of the Government in the past, when the rates of sales tax have been decreased, to make them applicable as from the next day after the date of the budget speech. </para>

                        <para>. - I quite realize that the mere adoption of the motion before the committee will not give effect to the increase of sales tax, but the motion is a preliminary stage to the introduction of legislation which has for its purpose the imposition of an increased rate of tax as from to-morrow. Yet any steps the committee may subsequently take once it has accepted the principle of the 5 per cent, tax would appear to me to be steps which would lead naturally to the acceptance of the Treasurer's proposal. Therefore, as I am not able to support the increase of the sales tax from 4 per cent, to 5 per cent., I have to oppose the adoption of the motion at this stage. I submit to the Treasurer that the procedure he has explained as being part, apparently, of the practice of the House in previous years was one which worked fairly when sales tax rates were being reduced. The presumption is that no parliament would seek to tax a community to a greater extent than the financial position of the Government made necessary, and that therefore any reduction of tax would obviously be a proposal which the Parliament would support. The theoretical position, at any rate, is that the Parliament does not ask the citizens to pay more for the services of government than the Treasurer for the time deems necessary; but, once we agree to the adoption of this motion, we say that the principle of an increase of the sales tax from 4 to 5 per cent, is acceptable to us, and, logically, the committee authorizes the bringing down of the bills providing for the increase. Therefore, the substantive proposal is now before us. I speak under great disadvantages, for the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> must realize that is was not until a few minutes ago that the Parliament had any cognizance of his intention to increase the sales tax. I object to the increase on the ground that the general budget could have made provision for the extra revenue desired in some alternative way which would have been fairer to the community than is the proposal before us. It would be much fairer for the committee to deal with the general principles of the budget prior to considering the specific legislation arising out of if. "We are now asked to agree in part to a specific proposal in the budget, without at the same time dealing with the budget as a whole. With the very limited notice we have had, but for which I do not hold the Government culpable, as we are the victims of our procedure, I am unable to support the motion. I submit that the Government should have arranged the incidence of taxation more fairly in other ways than by raising the tax on the commodities which are at present subject to sales tax. I know the Treasurer says that the basic wage earners are, for the most part, relieved of the contribution to sales tax. That is a most extraordinary argument, since the commodities which the workers consume and which are not subject to sales tax are the very same commodities which, if the rich consume them, are also exempt from the tax. The rich man eats foodstuffs the same as the poor man. It is merely a trivial debating point to say that the basic wage earner does not pay sales tax because foodstuffs are not subject to the tax. The bread which the Treasurer eats is as much bread  a3  that which is consumed by any other citizen. I do not think the Australian public or business community can regard the proposed annual approximate increase of the sales tax by 25 per cent, as the only reasonable course which the Treasurer could have followed in bridging the gap in his budget. </para>

                            <para>- I know that. A flat rate of increase is to be imposed on all articles at present subject to sales tax. It might have been preferable to lift the rate of tax on certain articles but maintain it at the present figure on the other articles. We have no opportunity to examine that point at this juncture. It might also have been preferable to increase the land tax rather than the sales tax, more particularly as the primary cause of this budget gap is the insurance of the property and lives of the community against aggression. </para>

                    <para>We should have been given an opportunity to consider the general policy of the Government before being asked to affirm any specific proposal in that general policy. The sales tax was introduced at a time of great financial emergency. The Government of the day, being faced with a staggering deficit, adopted this unusual form of taxation for Australia. Since that time not only has the rate of sales tax been reduced but the scope of goods exempt from the tax has also been greatly widened. The Treasurer is not faced, at this moment, with a condition of economic stringency. His trouble is that he has to meet  a  specific obligation in respect of the defence of this country. He proposes to obtain an additional £2,000,000 from  revenue for this purpose this year, compared with last year. We are to find approximately £8,000,000 from revenue for defence this year, whereas last year we found £6,000,000 from revenue towards the total defence expenditure. The Treasurer estimates that he will obtain an additional £2,000,000 from sales tax alone. The other burdens on the budget arise out of the national insurance policy and the necessity for increased provision for invalid and old-age pensions, and for an expansion of the works programme of the Postal Department. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly it is intended to spend a little more money in the Northern Territory and in the Australian Capital Territory ; but that would surely be on capital works, and not on maintenance. While I appreciate that Commonwealth activities in general are expanding and that therefore the annual maintenance charges must necessarily increase to some extent, I point out that the revenue must also expand. It must be apparent that with an increase of population there must be an increase of the general sources from which revenue will be available to the Government. </para>

                    <para>In these circumstances it appears to me to be undeniable that the proposal of the Government to increase the rate of sales tax indicates that it prefers to impose indirect rather than direct taxation. The increases of direct taxation proposed this year will, it is true, give a greater yield of revenue than the increases of indirect taxation; but this is duo to the lower revenue which the Treasurer expects to obtain from customs duties. I must say that the Treasurer is the most consistent person I have ever known in making errors in respect of customs revenue. </para>

                            <para>- I should say that they are. I should hesitate to accuse the Treasurer of deliberately understating the revenue which he expects to get through customs; but it is an amazing thing that each year since he has held the portfolio of Treasurer the receipts through the customs have exceeded his estimates by millions of pounds. The honorable gentleman has .never been optimistic in respect of customs revenue. While 1 think that he acted sensibly in forecasting a falling off of customs revenue in the current financial year compared with last year, it must be remembered that his actual receipts from this source last year were £4,000,000 in excess of the estimate. I think he has erred in assuming that the customs revenue will fall to such a great extent as he has indicated. To make up the leeway in this respect the honorable gentleman has turned not only to sales tax, but also to excise duties. It is from these two sources that he anticipates making up a good deal of the revenue that may be lost through the reduction of customs revenue. </para>

                    <para>The honorable gentleman has shown himself to be very reluctant to increase direct taxation in such a way as, in my opinion, the national necessity demands. If the Treasurer feels that he cannot prune his expenditure to a greater extent he should have made provision for a greater yield from income tax. </para>
                    <para>We have been unable to examine the estimates of expenditure in order to determine for ourselves whether this great volume of additional taxation should be approved. That is another dilemma in which we find ourselves. We have to say in effect, " You intend to spend so much. We do not know whether it is justified or not because we have not had an opportunity to examine the expenditure. Yet you ask us to approve of the imposition of sales tax at a rate 25 per cent, higher than was in operation last financial year, and you want us to agree to this new tax coming into effect from to-morrow ". In such circumstances "I find myself in the position of having to vote against th' = proposal, not because, in the ultimate, I might not find such a  course inevitable  - I do not say that - but because the circumstances make it impossible to say whether the proposal is justified or not. We should be given an opportunity to examine the general principles of the budget before we are called upon to approve of one specific proposal which will be the subject of legislation to be introduced subsequently. </para>
