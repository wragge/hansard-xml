                        <para>- The answer to the hitter part of the question is &#34; No.&#34; Recognizing that it is essential to have the co-operation of the States before proceeding with such a proposal, the Government has done everything possible, without success, to secure that co-operation, but it has not come to the conclusion that it is impossible to obtain it, and it will continue its efforts in that direction. </para>

                        <para>- Yesterday, in reply to a question asked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I inadvertently said that there were no applicants for appointment to the Inter-State Commission. What I had in mind was that the Government had taken no action to call for applications. I overlooked the fact that quite a number of persons, anticipating the possibility of the passage of legislation for the appointment of the commission, have sent on reminders that they will be applicants when the positions are being filled. </para>

Seeing that iron ore is being continuously exported from Port Pirie, to the benefit of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited., what action is being taken in regard to the embargo in connexion with Yampi Sound? </para>

If this is so, will the Minister accede to the request of the New South Wales Government that the Commonwealth Government should&#39; communicate details of its defence plans to the State Government, so that the latter will be able to plan road, bridge and other State works of defence value ? </para>

                            <para>- The Treasurer gave a fairly comprehensive outline of the defence works as apportioned amongst the various States, and he indicated the kind of works to be put in hand in the coming year. A careful dissection of these proposals has been made to ascertain the amount of employment they will give in various groups and in different areas of the States, and it is wrong to say that skilled artisans only will benefit. The defence programme will provide employment for a large number of unskilled men, even, for instance, at Newcastle. </para>

                        <para>- I noticed in the local press that it is proposed to erect offices for the Health Department on the site in Canberra set aside for the Institute of Anatomy. If a decision has .been made in regard to this matter, will the Acting Minister for Health state whether cognizance has been taken of Act No. 29 of 1924, under which the Commonwealth of Australia covenanted with the donor of the exhibits housed in the Institute, that this site would be set aside for the sole purpose of the erection of a Museum and the housing of the exhibits? If this matter has not been finally dealt with, I shall be glad to know whether it will receive the attention of the Government, because the rumour is current in this Territory that the act to which I have referred has been contravened. </para>

                        <para>- No consideration has been given to that subject lately. Although I am quite prepared to make an inquiry in regard to it, I suggest that to adopt such a policy would involve the  honorable  members who live in distant parts of the Commonwealth spending a much longer time in Canberra than they do at present. I am not personally optimistic  about  the prospects of such a procedure &#39;being adopted. </para>

                        <para>- The statement of the honorable member is not quite correct. Inverell has been without a rifle range owing mainly to the inability of the local riflemen to agree upon a new site. The present range was condemned because it was dangerous to the public in consequence of the fact that a main highway lias been constructed behind the rifle butts and in the direct line of rifle fire. There is no relatively high ground behind the existing rifle butts. An officer of the department has visited Inverell on two occasions with the object of assisting in the selection of a new site, and he is at present conferring with local residents on the subject. </para>

                            <para>- The position is that no white alien migrant may enter Australia without a permit, and that permit is not given without an intimation, among other things, that he will not be allowed to land without an examination at the first port of call in Australia. The invariable custom, therefore, is for the migrant to undergo an examination before he leaves his own country so that he will not be refused entry by our authorities at the first port of call. </para>

                        <para>- Is the Minister representing the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs aware that farmers are able to obtain for fencing purposes steel posts and other material of that kind which are, I understand, the monopoly of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, only on advance order&#39;s of six months, and has he considered that matter in relation to customs duties? What is the Australian Liberal Country party doing about it? </para>

                    <para>I should like as briefly as possible to explain the purposes of this measure and then leave the matter for debate at a later date. The purpose of this measure is to appropriate the sum of &#163;250,000 from the revenue of this current financial year in order to form a trust fund which will be known as the Science and Industry Capital Trust Account for the purpose of financing capital works in connexion with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. Honorable members are, of course, aware that the work of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research up to the present has been confined almost entirely to attempting a solution of primary production problems. Honorable members will also be aware that late in 1936 the Government set up a committee known as the Secondary Industries Testing and Research Committee which was composed of leading industrialists and eminent scientists. The report of that committee, which has been actually available to honorable members and to the public for some little time,I formally laid on the table of the House yesterday, and several copies are available to honorable members on the table in the Library. This committee made its report in 1937, and it recommended, amongst other things, an Australian standards reference laboratory, an aircraft and engine testing and research laboratory, a research service, an information service and a testing service for secondary industries. Subsequent to the report of this committee, the Government, as the House is aware, was fortunate in having the services and advice of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> E. Wimperis, lately director of Aeronautical Research in Great Britain. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wimperis</inline> is a very eminent gentleman in his field, and we had him here for upwards of six months. He was primarily engaged in advising the Government on the establishment of an aircraft industry in Australia and on the necessity for aeronautical research.  His  report, which has been in the hands of the public for some time, was also formally tabled yesterday and copies are available in the Library. Broadly speaking, for the purposes of this bill his report bore out in its entirety the report of the committee on secondary industries research. So far as this bill is concerned, the broadening of the activities of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has a distinct defence flavour. The two main institutions that will be brought into existence by reason of the moneys made available under this bill are an essential link in the big defence effort that Australia is making now and will make in the years immediately ahead. The two principal institutions which it is proposed to bring into existence are a National Standards Laboratory, which it is hoped to establish in the University grounds in Sydney, and an Aeronautical Research Laboratory situated close to the works of the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation at Fishermen&#39;s Bend, in Victoria. The report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wimperis,</inline> dealt more specifically with the aeronautical side, and honorable members who have read his report, or even such extracts from it as have been published in the press, can be in no doubt regarding the need for the inauguration of aeronautical research in Australia. </para>
                    <para>There is already in existence in Australia a number of standards, which really means that there is no standard at all, and it is to overcome that disability that these proposals have been evolved. Up to the present these matters, where they have been dealt with at all, have come under the control of the State governments, though the Commonwealth Government has power, under the Constitution, to legislate in this respect. At the present time, there are as many standards in Australia, as inert; are States, but there is no set of standards common to Australia a3 a whole. 1 refer of course, in particular, to standards of length and mass, of electrical and light units and to all the other physical properties with which mau has to deal in secondary industries. In Great Britain, standards are dealt&#39; with by the National Physical Laboratory. The Commonwealth Government has been in close touch with that body which has agreed to afford us all possible assistance. &#34;We are approaching in Australia the era of what is called &#34; mass production &#34;, when parts of any one implement, whether for defence or for any other purpose, may be made either in separate factories or in different branches of the one factory, and it is essential that all those parts should be, within very close limits, of the same size. </para>

                            <para>- It is not a matter of imposing ourselves on any one. I believe that those who control the secondary industries of Australia will welcome the setting up of an institution to ensure the maintenance of absolute standards. These standards will be made available from the central laboratory in Sydney through subbranches established in all the other capital cities where there is need for them. The absolute standards will be taken from the standards of the National Physical Laboratory in Great Britain, and they will be exchanged with those in that institution from time to time in order to ensure continuing accuracy. In all capital cities there will be kept substandards calibrated against the stan dards in Sydney, and various factories will have their master gauges calibrated in the same way. </para>

                            <para>- No. The main institution will cost approximately &#163;80,000 for building and equipment, and this will cover also the bare necessaries for the creation of sub-standard branches in the other capital cities. </para>

                    <para>The Government&#39;s proposals&#39; have been acclaimed by the leaders of all branches of secondary industry in Australia. It is also proposed to establish a testing service which will be a branch of the principal National Standards Laboratory. The object is to organize a system of testing by a national body whose status will carry recognition throughout the Commonwealth and abroad. At the present time there exists only to a limited extent means for the testing and supervising of materials to ensure that they conform to a standard size. I am sure that we shall receive the co-operation of the States in this respect. It is also proposed to inaugurate an information service. This is not directly relevant to the present measure, but its purpose is to disseminate scientific knowledge among Australian manufacturers. It is proposed to seek such knowledge in Australia and abroad, and to make it available for the benefit of secondary industries in this country. We want manufacturers to know exactly what is going on in other countries, and to apply the fruits of that knowledge to Australian production. </para>
                    <para>It is estimated that the Aeronautical and Engineering Research Establishment will cost eventually &#163;143,000., and that the National Standards Laboratory will cost &#163;80,000, making a total of &#163;223,000. The whole of this amount will not be expended immediately, but we desire to press on without- delay with the designing of the buildings, and the ordering of the necessary equipment. Some part of this., delicate equipment must be imported from overseas. The Commonwealth is fortunate in having been able to make arrangements to retain the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wimperis</inline> to advise it upon the purchase of equipment suitable for Australian conditions. </para>
                    <para>The balance of the &#163;250,000 which it is proposed to appropriate will be needed for the setting-up of a number of subsidiary establishments of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and  for  the extension of existing establishments. One of these is a fisheries research station at Port Hacking in New South Wales. The Government of New South Wales has kindly handed over to the Commonwealth the old State fisheries research station at Port Hacking. It has not been in use for some years, but the Commonwealth Government, through the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, proposes to modernize the station, and to make such additions as are necessary. It will then become the head-quarters of the fisheries research vessel which is shortly to be put into commission. A sum of &#163;12,000 is to be expended upon buildings and equipment. The station at Port Hacking is peculiarly suitable, for. this purpose, not only because i.t is situated roughly in the middle of the coastline upon which the research vessel&#39;s activities will be carried out, but also because it will be possible from there to keep in close touch with the food preservation laboratory which is being established at the Homebush abattoirs in Sydney. </para>
                    <para>The Government proposes to inaugurate a trust fund .to be known as the Science and Industry Capital Trust Account, into which will be placed this year a sum of &#163;250,000 from revenue. .The Government has always exercised the closest scrutiny over such trust funds, and they are established only when it is believed that they are the <inline font-style="italic">most</inline> suitable method of financing a particular undertaking. It is of no use commencing a project of this kind unless the Government can see its way to carry it to completion. Very little of the amount of &#163;250,000 will be expended this year, but a great deal of it will be committed, some of it -in the ordering of equipment overseas, though that equipment may not be delivered for over twelve months. The actual expenditure of the money will extend over a period of two years, though most of the commitments will be entered into almost at once. </para>

                            <para>- The maintenance cost of the National Standards Laboratory in all its activities will be about &#163;10,000 and that of the Aeronautical Laboratory will be about &#163;12,000 per annum. This subject is so large that almost infinite details could be sought. To the best of my ability I shall at a later stage of the debate supply to honorable members who are interested the information for which they may ask. Generally speaking, the Government is convinced of the necessity for the closest link between science and industry. Other countries, particularly those which are more advanced industrially than Australia is, found out years ago the necessity for such a link. In these proposals we are following them along the soundest lines that -we can discover. </para>

                    <para>. - One cannot consider the defence proposals of the Government without taking into consideration some of the events in international affairs which led up to them. At the time of the Imperial Conference, about a year ago, the international situation was certainly not without clouds. Since then the position has progressively deteriorated, not only in Europe, but also in the Far East. We Lave witnessed the intensification of the civil war in Spain and the intrusion of other Powers on the Spanish Peninsula - and when I speak of other powers, I do not mean only those which have assisted General Franco, but also those which have assisted that institution which, for want of a better name, is&#39; known as the Spanish Government. More recently, we have witnessed the inclusion of Austria in the German Reich, and we have been forced to take notice of the situation which is developing day by day in Czechoslovakia. There have also been difficulties in the newer States along the Baltic, as well as uncertainty in Poland, whilst the state of affairs existing in the Balkan Peninsula -generally gives ground for concern. The only two rays of hope which have brightened the situation were referred to by the Prime Minister, when he spoke of the consummation of an agreement between the British and Italian Governments, and an agreement, possibly of less moment, but, nevertheless, important, between the Governments of Britain and Ireland. In connexion with the latter of those agreements, it is interesting to note the rather extraordinary change of front on the part of the head of the Irish Government, as reported in to-day&#39;s press. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. de</inline> &#34;Valera is reported to have said that whereas a few years ago he wished that Ireland was 500 miles further out in the Atlantic, to-day he is happy to know that it is situated under the apron of Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>- I thought that my remark would  bring  the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> into the debate. Last night the honorable gentleman had a rather extraordinary experience. He could not be persuaded, by any interjection whatsoever, to depart from his written notes. Indeed, he established a completely new record. It may be that the notes which he quoted with such eloquence and fervour were not his own, and that, therefore, he was under necessity to conform strictly to the text. </para>

                        <para>- The Premier of Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ogilvie,</inline> had something to say on the subject. I repeat that we in Australia cannot but be influenced by the trend of affairs in the Pacific. A night or two ago the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> took the Government to task for the general military situation. He referred to the example of the United States of America in regard to trade agreements, but he did not tell the House that that country, in addition to establishing records in the consummation of trade agreements, is also establishing other records, particularly in regard to its expenditure for defence. On the showing of the United States of America, the trade agreement between that country and Australia is certainly not a reason why that nation should fail to provide for the effective defence .of its territory; nor should we fail to provide for the effective defence of Australia. It is - not part of my duty to go into the details of the defence plans of the Government. That will be done by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby),</inline> a gentleman who is carrying out a very onerous task with, I think I may fairly say, the full concurrence of the House, great ability and tireless energy, as is evidenced by the magnitude and complexity of the proposals which have been brought before the Parliament. </para>

                <para>During the last election campaign the Government was accused by the Opposition of having only one objective in view in its defence policy, namely, the introduction by some subterranean method of a form of conscription. I do not think that the gentlemen who said that really believed it themselves. At any rate, the electorate did not believe it. A clear distinction must be drawn between conscription as describedby the members of the Opposition, and the existing law of this country, as contained in the Defence Act. Under that legislation every man between the ages of 18 and 60 years is liable for military service, as and when required, within the territories of the Commonwealth of Australia. During this debate&#39; I have not heard one word from Opposition members to suggest that they desire those provisions of the Defence Act to be repealed ; and certainly the Labour party, when it was in office, did not attempt to repeal them. The Scullin Government did not even take the trouble to repeal the compulsory provisions of the act; it simply suspended them. </para>

                        <para>- The Opposition must face up to this problem. It will have to explain to this House and to the country the medley of voices which comes from its members on the subject of defence. What was the note on which the speech of the Leader of the Opposition ended yesterday? If I understand the English language aright, the honorable gentleman said that the Prime Minister had given no conclusive proof of the necessity for the defence programme of the Government. </para>

He said that the Government was getting away from the ideals in regard to defence which ought to actuate the Australian Government. </para>

                        <para>- The other night exception was taken to certain actions of this Government in relation to the international position. We were told that we had no foreign policy, that we were following blindly in the footsteps of Great Britain. We were criticized for not having taken certain action consequent upon the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eden,</inline> and then, on other occasions, it seemed that the fault of the Government was that it had taken _ action in this respect. The fact of the matter is that this Government cannot concern itself with the resignation of a member of a government of another British country ; that it not our affair. All we were concerned with was the implications of the moves that led up to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eden&#39;s</inline> resignation, and anything that might eventuate therefrom. Other resignations have taken place, and anybody, I think, would admit that the British Government would have been quite wrong if it had taken steps, for instance, to inquire into the reason why a very senior member of the last Lyons Government resigned from office. Similarly Australia would have been surprised if Canada had concerned itself with the resignation at a later date of our Minister in Charge of Negotiations for Trade Treaties. Such matters concern only the governments involved, and we must give each government credit for being able to manage its own affairs. This Government is certainly able to do that. </para>

                        <para>- There is nothing secret about party meetings of honorable members on this side. They are fully reported in the press, and I suggest that it would be an excellent thing for politics in this country if similar conditions applied in respect of party meetings of honorable members opposite. If that were so we would be presented with a rather interesting story, one which would provide headlines &#34;for the press. The issue confronting the people of Australia in respect of defence is that they can rely on the Government as at present constituted to give effect to a certain defence policy, one which is flexible and definite in its purpose, and has as its first objective the safety of our country. The Government&#39;s first consideration is local security, and it has not deviated in the slightest from that purpose. This policy conforms absolutely to the first principle of war, namely, to guard one&#39;s own territory and forces. </para>

                        <para>- The Leader of the Opposition is absolutely beside himself on that point. In yesterday&#39;s debate I noticed a remarkable measure of agreement among honorable members opposite, and I was astounded. I did not hear the early part of the debate, but I was amazed and delighted to hear the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> announce that he was in absolute agreement with the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> on the question before the House. That, I think, is something for which the Opposition can feel extremely thankful&#34;, it is the only sign of agreement among themselves in respect of defence that we have yet witnessed, because never before has disagreement among honorable members opposite on this matter been deeper, greater, or more unbridgable than it has been during the last few weeks. Lot us examine these differences of opinion. The Leader of the Opposition - Caesar - and his political wife, the honorable member for East Sydney, have told us different stories. </para>

                        <para>- During, my membership of this House I have not yet heard oneword from honorable members opposite to suggest that they believe in training:  anybody. All I have heard is that they believe in a system of home defence, and on that point also they are not unanimous. If the honorable member for East Sydney can explain what form of defence he believes in, I suggest that every member of this House will be prepared to stay here for a week to listen to him. I have heard the honorable member for Batman denouncing every form of defence. The facts are that divisions of opinion may exist on both sides as to what will happen in the international sphere in the future. There is no harm in facing up to the facts and I believe in doing so. I am sure that this Government will face up to the facts as they exist to-day. There is no denying that honorable members supporting this Government have advocated certain definite measures which the Government has not been prepared to adopt, but it is only reasonable to expect that they will express their opinions; in fact, the Government would think very little of them if they failed to do so. </para>

                        <para>- There is complete and absolute unity among honorable members on this side in regard to the proposals which the Government has placed before this chamber. The people of Australia have to choose between this Government&#39;s policy and a set of contradictory propositions put up by the Opposition, and I contend that if this alternative were tested before the people tomorrow the Government would win as it did at the general election, for the simple reason that the electors of Australia have no faith in either the intention, or. the capacity, of the Opposition, if it were elected to power, to implement a defence policy. On the other hand, the people of Australia have complete confidence in the defence programme placed by the Government before the House, and I have no doubt that these proposals will be carried. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not suppose there is any question which runs across classes and partiesin Australia more than does this issue of military preparation. Divisions of opinion exist on all sides, and have been just as obvious on the Government side . in the course of this debate as on this side. All supporters of the Government apparently unite upon a policy of local security, but from some of them we gather that local security is to be obtained by fighting in Europe, whilst others seem to think that it is to be obtained by preparing to fight in Australia and not out of it. The Acting Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> made great play upon the advocacy of compulsory military training by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ogilvie.</inline> I point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ogilvie</inline> advocated such action as a proposed change in the Labour party&#39;s policy. He, did not propose a policy for Australia or for himself, but simply suggested, and apparently the Labour conference in Tasmania supported him, that the policy of the Australian Labour party should be changed so as to provide for compulsory military training. Remember, however, that that proposal is compulsory military training for the defence only of Australia and territories controlled by Australia.. To that extent it is perfectly consonant with the policy of the Labour party.Mr. Ogilvie opposes as much as anybody else the idea of raising forces for active service overseas. </para>

                <para class="block">Ogilvie is merely making a proposal for an alteration of the Labour party&#39;s platform by which he is bound. Before such an alteration can be made, he must get the support of representatives of other States at the Australian Labour party&#39;s interstate conference. On this issue the difference between the policy of the supporters of the Government, and of the members of the Labour party appears to be this: The defence policy of the Government and of its supporters is to be planned and operated in co-operation with Great Britain and other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations ; that is to say it is to fit into the mosaic of a general imperial scheme to be directed by the imperial authorities, the Australian authorities merely doing their part in effectuating the general scheme.. On the other hand the Labour party, and the Labour movement generally,believe that the defence policy of this country  should be one which, has regard to the possibility of Australia being attacked and should be designed solely for the purpose of warding off an attack. That is to say, the Australian Labour party&#39;s scheme of defence does not fit into the imperial or British scheme of defence at all, whereas the Commonwealth Government scheme does. If war should break out the actions of this Government would be determined by the imperial command. The policy of the Government may change from time to time, but it is constant in that it is framed in relation to Great Britain&#39;s policy. If the form of British policy should change, the Commonwealth Government&#39;s policy would change with it. Some have said that the present Government has abandoned the defence policy on which it went to the country, and has adopted a new policy. It has not done that. The substance of the defence policy on which it went to the country was that it would co-ordinate its defence measures with those of Great Britain. It is still doing that, although the form of the policy abroad may have changed. </para>

                        <para>- The policy has changed only superficially. The central feature of it remains the same, namely that it can be co-ordinated with the policy of Great Britain. The policy of the Labour party provides for the defence of Australia only - preparation to resist aggression - and it is not adopted out of ill will or hostility to the British people or even to the British Government; I think that we must distinguish between the two. Those who dislike the policy of the British Government do not necessarily dislike Great Britain. It would be as unfair to charge <inline font-weight="bold">Major Attlee</inline> with dislike of Australia because he dislikes the Australian Government&#39;s policy, as it is to charge the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> with hostility to Great Britain because he disapproves the policy of the British Government. </para>

                        <para>- He may have, and I would not blame him for it, but that docs not imply hostility to the British people. It is very obvious to-day that neither <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. De</inline> Valera nor any party in Eire is hostile towards the British people. The defence policy of the Australian Labour party is framed with the object of promoting the peace of the world. It is a sort of categorical imperative. The Labour party proposes that Australia should act in the matter of defence in such a way that its actions may become a rule of conduct for the rest of the world. The only preparations for war which can be consistent with the peace of the world, are those which are for the exclusive purpose of resisting invasion. If nations concentrate solely upon resisting invasion of their own country and do nothing more, it is obvious that they will not be suspected or feared ; consequently war will be unlikely. </para>

At the Perth Conference in 1918 a special provision was included in the platform to provide that action overseas could be taken with the consent of the Australian people., because it was represented that if New Zealand were attacked the Australian people would wish to assist them. </para>

                        <para>- By means of a referendum, as was proposed in the United States of America quite recently. If a nation makes preparations which are not strictly limited to its own defence against actual invasion, such preparations are bound to be misunderstood and misconstrued by other nations. The only way in which a peace-loving nation can prepare for defence, is by making preparations in such a form and with such restrictions that obviously its measures are intended solely for its own defence and cannot be used for any other purpose. That is why the Labour party, in framing the details of its defence policy, provided a scheme which cannot be used readily except for defence of Australia against aggression. That is why it regards as objectionable, the provision of large ships of war; these are equivocal weapons, because obviously, while these may be used for the defence of Australia, they may also be used for other purposes, including the general defence of the Empire. We should study closely the Australian position. In spite of what has been said by some honorable members, including the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron),</inline> it must be fairly obvious that Australia is not in greater clanger of invasion than it had been; in fact, the danger is less that it was some time ago. . We must realize that there are three great nations bordering the Pacific. If Australia were in danger of invasion, it would expect invasion from one of three nations. No one can seriously contend that Australia is in danger of being invaded by the United States of America. The other nations are Japan and Russia. Whatever one may think of Russia, one cannot escape the conclusion that that country is determined not to go to war except in the defence of its own territory. Russia will not go to war for the promotion of the Communist cause in other countries. The big schism in Russia to-day is owing to the difference of opinion between those who believe that Russia should fight only for the defence of Russia, and those who want that country to become the centre of a world revolutionary war. The Trotsky party has always believed that the only way socialism can become an accomplished order is by its spread to all countries and that advantage should be taken of war to bring about a world revolution. The Trotskyists want to make Russia the spearhead of a world-wide social war, but Stalin is against that policy. Russia abandoned the great Communist party of Germany, and recognized Hitler&#39;s accession to power. Undoubtedly it has abandoned the promotion of the Communist cause in China, and has been much criticized on that account. In the present conflict, China has not received any assistance from Russia beyond obtaining supplies of munitions. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but other nations are doing the same. Great Britain supplies munitions to any nation. In a totalitarian State, the Government has to accept responsibility for everything, but a democratic State may decline responsibility for the activities of private capitalists. The one thing that stands out crystal clear in the world to-day is that the Government of Russia will not fight except for the defence of its territory; not even for the support of communism in other countries will it draw the sword. It is clear that Russia has no aggressive intentions towards the rest of the wor*d and much clearer that it has no such intentions towards Australia. The position in respect of Japan is much better than it has ever been, because it is quite obvious that, whatever be the outcome of the Sino-Japanese conflict, Japan will be in a state of financial exhaustion similar to that in which it found itself at the termination of the Russo-Japanese war. If it wins, its full resources of men and money will be required to consolidate its conquest; if it fails, it can be, to a great extent, disregarded. . And what I am about to say regarding Other powers will also apply to Japan. Ear-flung empires are embarrassing to mother countries. Great Britain would be a stronger nation to-day if its Empire were not so scattered. No nation wants a far-flung empire like that of the British people. To-day, the expansionist nations are aiming at conquests near at home, so that they can have concentrated and easily-controlled territories, which will not involve them in overseas adventures or actions. That is what Japan, Italy and Germany are striving for. Italy and Germany have in view not the acquisition of remote overseas colonies. </para>

                <para class="block">Central Europe, probably spreading eventually to the East. In reply to the point raised by the honorable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Badman),</inline> it seems to me that a great deal of talk about the return of the former German colonies is intended for overseas consumption. It supplies the German Government with an argument. I do not believe that Germany desires a colonial empire; if it does, that empire will come, not by the retrocession of its former colonial possessions, but by the annexation of Holland and the acquisition of Dutch overseas possessions. &#34;Whatever may be the position in Europe, it seems perfectly clear that a war with Italy or with Germany would be a war fought out in Europe, and would not affect Australia. </para>

                        <para>- My own common sense, which also tells me that Great Britain would be more secure to-day if it did not possess a far-flung Empire. Now that the plane of warfare has shifted from the sea to the air, the nations desire empires comprising territories near home which can be controlled and policed from the air rather than from the sea. I believe that the change of the method of fighting from the&#39; sea to the air has altered tremendously the imperialistic ambitions of nations. Oversea colonies are quite a secondary consideration with Germany. If German ambitions with respect to the acquisition of territory develop, Germany will occupy most of Central Europe, and, similarly, if Italian ambitions extend further, Italy will establish a Mediterranean empire. </para>

                <para>Even if I believed there was a much greater danger of attack- than is actually the case, I should nevertheless endorse the policy of the Australian Labour party as the correct one for Australia, or any other country, to adopt. A great deal of the danger of war eventuating is undoubtedly due to preparations made for war. Nations cannot continually prepare for war without incurring that danger. In such nations there grows up a class of people habituated to the idea of war. They see in war all sorts of opportunities for capitalistic success and the conquest of new markets. Members of the  working  class see that if new markets can be gained by their masters a greater degree of employment can be provided, while administrative and military classes see in any war opportunities for advancement. A nation cannot continue preparing for war without having to fight some day; it cannot make such preparations without creating a state of fear among other nations. The only attitude consistent with peace is one that cannot be construed in any way as being in preparation for action overseas. In those circumstances the policy advocated by the Labour party is, I believe, the right one for this country. If Great Britain were, involved in any way at all it would be a tremendous disaster for Australia. </para>

                        <para>- No. If Great Britain were at war I am certain they would not regard Australia as not being at war, too. If, for instance, Great Britain were at war with Japan, the Japanese would probably attack Australia, irrespective of what Australia did. But that does not affect my position. I hold that whatever happens to Australia or to any nation in the long run, we must make a stand for world peace, and with that object in view, if it is necessary to make preparations for war, only such action should be taken as could not be construed as anything but preparation for the actual defence of our own territory. I do not believe that there are malevolent nations in the world or that the rulers of any nations are actually malevolent. In my opinion the greatest danger of war results from international misunderstandings. There is little danger of war between Great Britain and the United States of America, because both nations speak the same language and read the same books and there is a free interchange of ideas between the two. But there is a great danger of war between countries that do not possess the same institutions and do not understand one another&#39;s views. As I pointed out a moment ago, nations that prepare for war upon such a scale that they could wage a war overseas create fear in other countries. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. One factor that in my opinion may bring lis to the verge of war is the closed Empire policy for which we, as well as Great Britain, are responsible, and under which* an attempt is made to close the Empire&#39;s markets to other nations. This policy, which was adopted by Great Britain in 1931, is bringing war nearer. </para>

                        <para>- I would favour a commercial union with New Zealand and the United States of America, and considerable reductions of the tariff. I should be prepared to make many sacrifices to bring peace nearer, because I realize that there cannot be peace when nations cease to deal with one another. All these things are secondary to the necessity to maintain peace. There is in my mind a difference between a nation saying: &#34;We are going to keep our own markets as far as possible for ourselves, but we will trade with everybody else on an equal basis&#34; and saying &#34;We will keep our own markets as far as possible for ourselves and beyond that trade only with favored peoples &#34;. The latter is the more dangerous attitude and, as I say, I believe it is the closed Empire policy rather than Britain&#39;s unpreparedness that is making for war. Prior to the adoption of that policy by Great Britain in 1931 the British Empire had acquired a great deal of overseas territory without opposition on the part of other countries, because it was realized that when Great Britain took possession of, for instance, a portion of Africa or Asia, it did not exclude other nations from trading with the inhabitants on equal terms with British people, whereas if Germany, France or any other country assumed control of an undeveloped area a monopoly of trade would be established by that country. But Great Britain has abandoned its former policy with the result that the danger of war has been increased. </para>

                    <para>. - At the outset I desire to congratulate the Government, and the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> in particular, upon the enlarged national defence scheme placed before the House. To me it is admirable so far as it goes, but my complaint is that it goes neither far enough nor fast enough. I shall, however, deal with that point at a later stage. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I regret that the Minister for Defence has spent so little time in the House during this very important debate. Apart from debates during the Great War, this is the most important discussion on defence that has ever occurred in this Parliament, and it is most unfortunate that the Minister should not have been in a position to listen to the views - many, I admit, critical, but many also constructive - put forward by honorable members. I make that comment, however, in no chiding spirit. I assume that the Minister is not present because he is overwhelmed with the great burden he is carrying at the present time. That brings me to a very interesting point. In no other part of the world would the Minister for Defence be absent from Parliament during a debate of this nature, and I am impelled to ask whether the Minister is not carrying an impossible load, and to urge strongly upon the Government the desirability of giving immediate consideration to the -question of dividing the Defence Department into two sections, and creating another portfolio. The crisis through which we are passing at present demands, I think, such action, for which there is ample precedent. For many years there was in this country an Assistant Minister for Defence when the defence programme was more or less normal. There are Assistant Ministers in departments of much less significance, and the responsibilities of which are less onerous than are those of the Defence Department at the present time. There is, for instance, a Ministry for Commerce under the control of a Minister and two Assistant Ministers. Heaven alone knows what they do, but that is the position. Then the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> has acquired an assistant within the last six months, and altogether several departments are double-banked with portfolios, while the defence of Australia, which is of supreme importance at the present juncture, is dealt with by one Minister who is not able to remain in this chamber for more than a few minutes at a time during a vital debate, continuing over a number of days. </para>
                <para>I desire now to refer to the proposal to appoint for a term not clearly defined an Inspector-General of the Australian Military Forces, and to bring to Australia to occupy that post an officer of general rank in the United Kingdom. In past years there have been visits by a number of very highly placed and distinguished British officers who have dealt with defence matters as a whole. For example, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Salmond came to Australia some years ago to advise upon the Royal Australian Air Force, and important representatives of the British navy have visited this country also; but in each case their mission has been a brief and special one. They have been requested toreport to the Commonwealth Government upon our defence system, and to make recommendations with respect to it, and I trust that the Government will, if possible, confine the duties of the distinguished officer who is to come from Great Britain on this occasion in a similar manner. I make that request for a num-  ber of reasons, but particularly because I believe that the briefer the visit the better the man we shall get. There is not an unlimited number of officers of general rank of outstanding capacity in the British Army, and to bring one of these gentlemen to Australia for any long period would, in all probability, interfere very seriously with his status and promotion in the British Army. </para>
                <para>To me the speech of the Leader of the Opposition was incomprehensible ; throughout, it consisted of a series of contradictions, and it was quite contradictory of the previous responsible statements made by my honorable friend. As recently as the 26th March last the honorable gentleman said - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The defence programme outlined last night is a vastly different thing to the theories of collective security and external cooperation which hitherto have been the Prime Minister&#39;s preoccupation. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>And then he went on to say - &#39; 11 is is realism, lt faces the facts as they ;i fleet Australia and Australians. </para>
                <para>That was, apart from detail, one hundred per cent, endorsement of this scheme; it was a complete endorsement of its principle, its enlarged nature, and the increased expenditure. I admit that the honorable gentleman went on to say in the course of that statement that the Government had stolen the Opposition&#39;s defence scheme. If that charge is  true  why did the honorable gentleman occupy the best part of an hour yesterday in condemning the Government&#39;s scheme? He said that the scheme is his own, yet yesterday he literally kicked it to pieces. The honorable gentleman still stands for a policy of isolation, a defence policy running along independent lines; he says that it is our duty in the formulation of a defence policy to look after Australia only, just as it is the part of every other portion of the Empire to look after itself only. The honorable gentleman is against co-operation.. It is a. case of &#34; Each for himself, and the devil take the hindmost &#34;. If that policy were carried out in the present circumstances, Australia would probably be the country that the devil would take. The honorable gentleman is in favour of each of the component parts of the British Empire providing separately for its own de- fence. It must be obvious to the honorable gentleman that the certain way to court defeat is to allow an enemy such as we might . have to face - a powerful nation in itself, and not improbably a combination of powers - to dispose of the British countries one by one. When the Leader of the Opposition was in the midst of his speech yesterday some one asked a question about our export and import trade, and he made the remarkable statement that he advo- cated a policy for the defence of th is country by the Australian Navy confined to Australian waters; but he gave very little explanation of the confines of those waters. He then said - &#34;But things are allright in the. world ; they have substantially improved in the last few weeks ! &#34; He also said, in effect, &#34; There is a prospect for the future &#34; - indicating the near future - &#34; of such an alliance, beginning with the trade agreement between the United States of America and the United Kingdom, as would guarantee the trade routes of Australia in time of war &#34;. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable gentleman said that we should stand aloof and have nothing to do with the rest of the Empire in matters of defence, but, &#34; Please, United Kingdom, and I pray you, the United States of America, if we get into trouble, look after our trade routes &#34;. The honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> was a little more specific as to what he would do. He was quite clear that he would keep the Army at home, and quite clear, apparently, that he would keep the Air Force at home, but he said, &#34; I am in favour of allowing the Navy to go a little way from Australia &#34;. Did he mean to Rottnest Island, Thursday Island, Tasmania, or where? The remarks of these honorable gentlemen plainly indicate that the party opposite has no policy whatever in relation to defence, and that its purpose is merely to oppose for the sake of opposing. Such an attitude at this time is particularly deplorable. </para>

                        <para>- I shall come to that a little later. I should like first to say a few words upon the very important subject of the preservation of our trade routes, because this seems to me, and I am sure it must appear so to all who have pondered it, to be one of the most important aspects of our defence requirements. Our common aim is to make this country so unattractive, so formidable to an invader, that no nation would care to attack us; but to my. mind the very beginning of the safety of this country is the protection of our trade routes. If we chose a policy of isolation and a powerful aggressor came against us, our little Australian Navy, even after we have built it up by the expenditure of moneys provided for in the schedule to the bill, would be sent to the bottom, or shut up in our various harbours. At any rate it would be completely out of action in a fortnight. Then, suddenly, and completely, our export and import trade would be stopped. We would awaken some morning to find that we could not send away a single bale of wool, a quarter of beef, a carcase of lamb, a gallon of wine, or a pound of butter or any of the other export commodities of this country. That is not a matter of controversy, but of plain fact. The outcome need not be dwelt upon. We should then find ourselves immediately overwhelmed with surplus primary products; all prices within Australia would go down to a level insufficient to pay transport charges to the markets. At one sweep would be destroyed, not only the employment of the countryside, but also the purchasing power of the people, and, in turn, the great majority of our metropolitan and industrial workers, business men and employers of every sort, would be thrown idle. That would be the logical outcome of any policy of isolating the defence of this country rather than of co-operating in time of trouble with the Empire as a whole, and particularly with Great Britain. Let me say quite clearly that I shall resist in every possible way, as I am sure the Government itself would, any sort of conscription in this country for overseas service, either in peace or war. But the great citadelupon which all British protection in this part of the world rests is Singapore; upon that base naval might and effectiveness will be concentrated in time of war, and it is to the force based on Singapore that we must look for protection -against an invader. Certainly, upon the fate of Singapore will very largely depend whether an invader will come to Australia or not, and how far our trade routes will be kept open for normal business in time of war. That being so - and it is certainly so - how can we possibly have an effective policy without full co-operation with Singapore ? Why was the Singapore Naval Base established? It was created at the cost of millions of pounds of the British taxpayers&#39; money, with very little supplement from outside, not to defend London, but for the defence of the British Empire comprehensively, including Australia and British possessions in the Far East and in the south-eastern Pacific. Singapore stands virtually across the lines of communication of the one enemy which this country may anticipate. </para>

                <para>I turn now to discuss briefly the problem of Australia&#39;s Infantry Forces. I wish that I could be as positive as is the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn)</inline> that there is no danger in the near future. Unhappily I have not his certainty of mind. I do not suggest that invasion is imminent, but I am not unmindful of the fact that international law and international morality have apparently -been forgotten by the rulers of some great countries. During the last two or three years we have witnessed aggression in a most terrible form.  I applaud the Government&#39;s scheme, as far as it goes; but I emphasize that, without adequate infantry forces well equipped and sufficiently trained to go into immediate action, Australia cannot be considered safe. Eminent military authorities believe that if invasion does come to this country, which God forbid, it will come, not as a great army, but in a series of raids. Military strategy would probably suggest the landing of say, 10,000 troops at one point with feints, demonstrations or actual landings elsewhere. </para>
                <para>While I am in complete agreement that we must have these technical services  upon  which the Government proposes to incur heavy expenditure, it is, I believe, essential that we should have adequate infantry to meet the raids in strength where and when they may be made. Obviously an aggressor would not land forces in the north-west of Australia, where it would be easy to get ashore, because that portion of the Commonwealth would have no attraction for the enemy. The objective would be one or more of our vital industrial areas. If to-morrow we had a couple of months&#39; notice of impending danger of forces being landed simultaneously near Sydney and Melbourne or in Western Australia what strength would we have to resist them? Once they got ashore we could not expect to halt them with our air forces, and the vulnerability of modern naval units to attack from- the air has been very much exaggerated. This, at all events, is the opinion of British naval authorities. Therefore, if an invading force landed within striking distance of Newcastle, Sydney or Melbourne, our position would be extremely grave. Our present infantry strength is 35,000 militia, scattered all over Australia, whose training amounts to twelve half-days a year and six days in camp, &#34;less two days travelling to and from camp, so that their actual period of training is ten days a year. I have no wish to criticize the mcn. On. the contrary I warmly commend them for their public spirit. But the truth is that we have the greatest difficulty in getting sufficient numbers, and the physical standard of the units is not as high as it should be: it is not nearly up to the standard for acceptance during the Great &#34;War. Yet this is the force upon which we should have to depend to guard Australia against the possibility of two or three heavy and well-planned raids. </para>
                <para>It is interesting to see how the 35,000 militiamen are distributed in the various States of the Commonwealth. The distribution is, of course, very largely on a population basis. Thus, in the great State of New South Wales we have less than. 13,000 of these slightly trained men, and in Victoria we have 9,500. These men would, in ali probability, be confronted by war veterans or conscript trained forces. In Queensland, that part of the Commonwealth which an invader would obviously find very habitable, there are only 5,000 partly trained militia. South Australia has 3,000, and there are only 2,300 in Western Australia, which is so isolated from the rest of the Commonwealth, that rapid &#39;assistance could not be given. The State of Tasmania has a mere 1,200. If the members of our militia were comparable to the Australian Forces in France and Palestine in 1917 and 1918, the defence force, although being still totally inadequate, would be experienced fighters upon whom strong  reinforcements  could be rested with the certainty that they would very quickly reach a high standard of efficiency.1 The capacity of the present militia forces to absorb and train recruits must be very Low indeed. Months would elapse before we could produce men with sufficient training to go into the line against experienced troops without suffering appalling casualties. </para>
                <para>The position is even more serious than that. We have no system for the calling up of reinforcements in an emergency. This is an aspect which I wish particularly to stress. I urge the early reestablishment in this country of the area officer system, and I suggest that area officers should, wherever possible, be supplemented by industrial officers. These officers would be responsible for compiling a register of all men in the Commonwealth between the ages of IS and 50 years fit for service or wartime industry. The men should be classified accord ing to whether they are to be front line men or industrial workers. If they are highly skilled, then they would be in a reserve for industry. If they are classified to go into the front line, they should be allocated in such a way that their services would be available immediately the order for mobilization was given. Under existing conditions in Australia, if the order for mobilization were to be given to-day, there would be chaos. It is not difficult to visualize the disorganization that would occur in Sydney in the event of a sudden raid. </para>
                <para>I happened to be in France on holidays in 1914 when the war broke out, and I was amazed &#39;by the efficiency and expedition with which mobilization was carried out. The only notification that France was at war was a single typewritten line giving the date of mobilization, 1st August; yet within half-an-hour, the older men in the fifties began to pass down the streets on their way to the barracks, where they were equipped, and given such duties as fell within their capacity. By the tenth or twelfth day, mobilization&#39; had extended to the first reserves, or the near reserves, for whom the barracks were ready, so these men were able at once to enter the fighting services. We are not .a conscript country, and never want to be, but we should make adequate provision for our defence so that if war does come, our men may go into action in a businesslike way. </para>

                <para class="block">Like the Prime Minister, the Acting Minister for Commerce and many other honorable members I have a son of military age, so it would be foolish to suggest that I am in any way speaking in favour of war. </para>
                <para>I emphasize that a scheme for the systematic mobilization of Australian manhood should be drawn up by the Government, concurrently with the addition to the Air Force, the Navy and coast defences. It has been said that we have not the necessary equipment for larger numbers who might be enrolled for compulsory training. I strongly challenge that statement. The existing equipment for infantry, machine gun, artillery units and other arms is used only on twelve half-days and one &#34;week in every year) so the possibility of expansion of training is apparent. A battalion commander in Melbourne,7 to whom I spoke last week on this subject, informed me that with his existing equipment he could train five time the present number, provided more training days were made available. </para>
                <para>There is nothing warlike in my suggestion. It is purely sound defence. On what would a potential enemy take stock of this country? Would it be our 70 odd aeroplanes, or double that number, as proposed under the enlarged defence scheme? Would it be the cruisers of the Australian Navy or our coastal defences? No. All these things would count for little, if we were without an efficient infantry force. An enemy would measure our defence potentiality on our trained man-power, or man power in availability. If we were measured only on our very limited technical services and our 35,000 partly trained militia men our rating would be very low indeed. An enemy would know that if his forces could get ashore, resistance would be very slight. If, however, we had a proper system providing for the rapid mobilization of an effective defence force, we should be assessed as a far more formidable objective and probably be left to enjoy our peace. </para>
                <para>I submit that scheme with confidence to every member of the Opposition, and I put if forward as a commonsense one. I ask honorable members first to satisfy themselves as to conscription. Everybody must subscribe to the statement made yesterday by the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hawker)</inline> that one cannot visualize stripping this country of its manhood as was done in the Great War. It may be that we could send two or three divisions somewhere overseas, but they would be volunteers, and we could always be certain of getting volunteers; compulsory training is in no way associated with conscription for overseas service. </para>
                <para>What does recent history show as to the indispensability, of infantry ? Madrid; for a year or more, has stood against all the modern mechanism of war. Why? It has been practically bombed to bits, and ii is constantly under heavy gunfire, but it has stood so far because of its strongly entrenched and indomitable lines of infantry. I do not say that infantry will save Barcelona, yet, if there were sufficient infantrymen, they could save that city. Most of the professional army of Spain went to the Nationalists, and what a price Republican Spain has paid through not having a trained army ! Had it possessed the professional army, the story would have been entirely different. It started with untrained troops, and that is the reason why it has paid such a terrible price. </para>
                <para>The history of Gallipoli  tells  of a glorious landing and a magnificent achievement up to a point, but every good mind in. the Australian Imperial Force knows&#34; that if we had had there a division of Australians from France, as they were in 1917 or 1918, or a division of dismounted Australian Light Horse from Palestine, as they were in those years, they would have swept through irresistibly to the Narrows. The United States of America started in the war from scratch,&#34; where we should have to start to-morrow - without even a mobilization scheme - and quite a year went by before that country had any men in France. Take the SinoJapanese war. Why have the Chinese, temporarily, at least - I do not say permanently - checked the Japanese, despite all their armaments and modern mechanism ? It is because when this conflict began China had for years been engaging in a great deal of internal warfare. Probably a couple of million Chinese had been more or less in arms and had been handling rifles. The present Commander-in-Chief, Chiang-kai-shek, had really great forces in arms at the outset of the war. The Young Marshal, the Manchu, had a considerable army with which he was engaged against the so-called &#34; reds &#34;. These forces, once opponents, are now combined against the Japanese, and, in addition, there were armed bandits in the northern provinces practised in guerilla tactics, who have all thrown in. their lot with Chiangkaishek. Without modem equipment,. China, by attacks upon  communica- tions, and by being able to stand up to the enemy, has achieved the miracle of stopping one of the greatest powers in the world, despite the fact that that power is armed with all the latest equipment. </para>
                <para>As I see it, there is real danger to Australia; I do not say to-morrow, but in the years close ahead. It is in the power of this Government, and the Parliament as a whole, actually to remove that danger, to save this country from aggression, and to k&#171;ep our young men out of war. I have no doubt at all that, as the debate proceeds, and as the Government gives more consideration to its present defence scheme, it will remove the one great weakness in it, which is that, for at least some time ahead, it provides no infantry of immediate fighting account. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Henry Gullett)</inline> went to considerable pains to allay public fears that the Government might impose conscription upon this country, A careful survey of the speeches delivered by honorable gentlemen on the Ministerial side would at least provide matter for earnest thought, because it is evident that those honorable members would be prepared to impose upon the manhood of Australia a system of compulsory military service which would definitely require the bearing of arms, not only within the borders of this continent, but also overseas. The whole party history of honorable members opposite furnishes justification for my declaration. No matter bow extensive may be the defence programme of the Government, apparently it will never satisfy the desires of those who are incapable of appreciating the limitations of the resources of this country. The honorable member also said that the present defence proposals of the Government neither went far enough, nor could be put into operation rapidly enough, to suit him. One would imagine that we were actually engaged in the consideration of defence proposals following upon a declaration of hostilities. The panicstricken manner in which honorable members opposite have spoken on this subject makes it appear that they are incapable of reviewing the situation in a calm way. Their speeches have consisted in the main either of strictures upon members on this side of &#39;the chamber or of observations such as might be expected in time of actual war, and have not been in any sense helpful to the country. Both the honorable member for Henty this afternoon, and the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> last night rendered a grave disservice to Australia in seeking to show that there was substantial justification for the viewheld in certain other countries of the world that we were not developing this country, or populating it in a reasonable way. When our representatives subsequently attend international conferences of one kind and another, they may be confronted with reports of these and similar speeches. The deduction that we are not entitled to retain possession of this country should not be made possible by the utterances of members of this Parliament. 1 therefore seriously deprecate the speeches of the honorable members to whom I have referred. If any people in the world can be said to be really developing the country in which they live, it is the Australian people. The last 150 years have conclusively shown the marvellous colonization characteristics of our people and have undoubtedly justified our possession of this country. We have, in fact, made remarkable progress. </para>

He will, no doubt, recollect that he said that even with the increase of the Navy, foreshadowed  by  the Government, it would still not be difficult to bottle up all our vessels in certain harbours of this country. He will also recollect saying that, even if we were to double the number of our aircraft, the force would still be incapable of undertaking the service which it was intended to perform. In spite of these remarks, however, the honorable gentleman enendorsed the programme of the Government, and even went so far as to offer his congratulations to .the Minister for Defence. If anything more inconsistent is desired than the remarkable speech of the honorable member I do not know where it could be obtained. I would say to honorable gentlemen opposite who make extravagant statements- </para>

                <para>We have before us for consideration a bill which provides for a loan of &#163;10,300,000 for certain defence equipment. I strongly protest against such a measure being introduced without a great deal more explanation of it than has been furnished to us by the Government. The purpose of this bill, we are told, is to provide, in part, for the financing of a three-year defence programme involving an increased expenditure of &#163;43,000,000. That being so, the Government should have given us much more information than it has seen fit to provide. If it had not been for the timely rebuke of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> we should not have had the meagre information that is now before us. Even as it is, I challenge the propriety of some of the items which appear in the schedule that- has been tabled. </para>

The Government should undoubtedly have related the expenditure proposed in this bill to that contemplated in the remainder of the programme that is to be implemented next financial year, and in the following year. </para>

                        <para>- I have considered that statement and I do not regard it as in any sense the comprehensive survey to which we are entitled. The proposal of the Government to finance its defence programme out of loan funds is definitely unsound and out of harmony with the wishes of the general community. The Leader of the Opposition yesterday pointed out clearly to the House that defence equipment is a wasting asset; it is subjected to deterioration and obsolescence to a degree more marked than in any other public utility. That being so, surely it is our obligation, and not that of future generations, to provide for the expenditure upon this equipment. It should be provided for by either direct taxation or by utilizing those undoubted facilities that are possible to the nation through the Commonwealth Bank. I feel that it is reprehensible for the Commonwealth Government to try to place upon the shoulders of future generations the burdens that the present generation should rightly carry. Honorable gentlemen opposite would not be so enthusiastic about this enlarged defence programme if fresh taxes upon their special friends were inescapable. The method that is &#39;being adopted, however, not only avoids fresh taxation of the wealthy interests of this country and absentees, but also gives them a further opportunity to extract profit; because under this bill &#163;300,000 is set aside to meet expense involved in the flotation of the loan, which is, of course, a &#34; rake-off &#34; for them. And, after having obtained that &#34; rake-off &#34;, they will have the further opportunity to make profits in meeting the orders of the Government under the defence programme, as well as the constantly recurring interest bill which will ultimately aggregate this loan amount to double the figure set down. In a word, the Government is opening the way to exploitation of the people of this country by private banking interests and armament firms that have their affairs so closely interlocked, and, accordingly, I oppose the proposal now made, first, because it lays down a principle in the financing of defence expenditure which is not only unsound, but also definitely wrong; secondly, because no ministerial statement has been made to justify this enormous expenditure to cope with what is claimed to be a state of emergency; and thirdly, because I am emphatically opposed to the private manufacture of armaments in which exorbitant profits are made at the expense of the nation and, in particular, its social welfare. What state of emergency exists to-day that was not apparent six months ago? When six months ago the Government increased the rate of expenditure on the defence of this country we were told that the amount then- provided would meet all requirements. What has occurred &#39;since then to change the opinion of the Government? The Acting Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> endeavoured to explain that world conditions had deteriorated, and that the international situation gave cause for greater fear than was the case last year. But I do not think that any honorable member of this House, or members of the general public, will endorse his declaration. As a matter of fact, the position in Europe to-day1, and in the world generally, shows some appeasement compared with last year. It becomes all the more astounding that the Government should seek sanction for its programme provided for under this bill when one .considers the world -situation. Unless the Government is prepared to advance to this House some further justification for the programme that it has submitted, we are not warranted in making available to it means which will en able it to create a war hysteria in this country and deprive the people of the social benefit due to them. </para>

                <para>I seize this opportunity to declare that the Government will never implement the social insurance proposals to which it has committed itself. The Government will find a convenient excuse to shelve the scheme, or abandon it altogether. Of course, it will not accept responsibility for its action ; it will make some excuse such as that the States refuse to co-operate, and then it will use the money that should have been devoted to the inauguration of this important social service for the furtherance of its colossal &#39;defence schemes. &#39; </para>

                        <para>- It is stated in the bill that the sum of &#163;1,000,000 is to &#39;be devoted to paying the final instalment on the cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Sydney.</inline> The first instalment was paid from revenue, and Parliament was given to understand that all subsequent instalments would also be paid from revenue. Last year, however, the Government departed from that principle, and an instalment was paid out of the loan of &#163;2,500,000 which was raised overseas. At the time the Treasurer informed honorable members that this loan was to be used to meet non-recurring expenditure, and nothing was said at the time about part of it being used to pay&#39; the second last instalment on the cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Sydney.</inline> Now a further &#163;1,000,000 of loan money is to :be used to make the final payment on the cruiser. Thus the new loan of &#163;10,000,000 is not even to be expended wholly on the Government&#39;s new defence programme; part of it is to be used to pay for the old programme. The Treasurer tried to make us believe that the new loan is to be raised entirely in Australia, but when we remember what happened in regard to the instalments on the cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Sydney,</inline> we are justified in .believing that he will be quite capable of borrowing still more money overseas for defence purposes. Honorable members are entitled to receive more explicit information than has yet been vouchsafed to them. Of course, Government supporters may have been given additional information in the party room, but, on the information so far made public, Parliament would not bo justified in giving the Government authority to raise this loan for defence purposes, more particularly, if there is any danger that the money, in whole or in part, is to be raised abroad. Further borrowing overseas will lead the country buck to the calamitous conditions that prevailed some years ago. Such a policy does not deserve the endorsement of this Parliament or of the people. </para>

                        <para>The charge for telephone calls between Kew Zealand and Australia, which was fixed by agreement between the two Administrations, is &#163;2 5s. for three minutes&#39; conversation and 10s. for each additional minute. It will be appreciated that conversation from a mobile station Such as the <inline font-style="italic">Awatea</inline> is practicable in both directions immediately the vessel leaves port, and it is consequently anomalous to permit conversation from the ship at an amount substantially lower &#39;than the through rate. It has <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be remembered that the charge covers conversations to and from any point served by the telephone trunk network of Australia, and a tariff similar to that imposed by the New Zealand Administration would not only bc inconsistent with the agreement for the through &#34;service, but would be totally unprofitable. The department has no knowledge of the reasons which induced the New Zealand Administration to introduce a charge so much below the rate which is applied by them, in common wilh Australia, for through traffic. </para>
                        <para>The honorable member might be interested to know that the tariffs for through traffic, and also for ship traffic, are at present under review, and it is hoped that means may be found to reduce the charges, although there is no likelihood of the fees between the <inline font-style="italic">Awatea</inline> and Australia being reduced to the level of those which are now applied to traffic between the vessel and Now Zealand. </para>
