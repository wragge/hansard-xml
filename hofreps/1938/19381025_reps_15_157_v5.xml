The commission decided to accede to the request in this instance, as the talk had no relation to party politics and it was considered that it would be of exceptional national interest. The commission has indicated that it is not intended to seek the services of other prominent people to give talks on the international situation, additional to those which are broadcast in the regular international affairs and news commentary sessions by the commission's regular commentators. The commission is, however, prepared to give consideration to requests from persons occupying responsible public positions to give talks of a similar nature. </para>
