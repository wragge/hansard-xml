            <para>I was surprised to read in the press this morning in an &#34;official announcement&#34; attributed to you that, inter alia, &#34;It was proposed that a senior Cabinet group should deal with major matters of national significance and government policy. The remainder of the Cabinet would be divided into two subcommittees to be presided overby one of the three senior Cabinet Ministers &#34;. The names of the l.&#39;rime Minister, the Minister for Commerce, the Attorney-General, the Minister for External Affairs, the Treasurer, and the Minister for Civil Aviation, defence and other works, were mentioned as comprising the Cabinet group. </para>

                <para>had intended to question the wisdom of such action in putting government policy into the hands of a coterie as toeing a departure from the best democratic principles, and did suggest, after you had mentioned that Iwas to be a member of such a Cabinet group, that if expedition in attention to Cabinet matters wasthe objective, it could be attained by more ordered discussion. </para>

            <para>Immediately after the Cabinet meeting you sent for me and informed me that a mistake had been made and that I would not be one of the Ministers taking the responsibility for policy. </para>
            <para>I pointed out to you that to allow Australian tariff matters and the welfare of secondary industries to toe subordinatedto a group on which the Customs Minister was not represented was tomake this important branch of government, responsible as it is for the protection of Australian industries and the welfare of so many of its citizens, as well as for the collection of thebulk of Commonwealth revenue, merely an administrative department dominated by an inner group. </para>
            <para>In justice to these considerations and the preservation of a protective policy, which I have endeavoured to carry out -for nearly six years.I feel thatI could no longer hold the Trade and Customsportfolio under such conditions. </para>
            <para>As you arc aware I have alsobeenin disagreement with the Government&#39;s policy on Defence for some timepast, but, as you know,  did not wish to embarrass the Government by resigning during the period of the censure motion. </para>

            <para>Your statement that yon did not wish to embarrass the Government by resigning during the period of the censure motion is inexplicable to me. You did not resign when the censure motion was determined. You, in fact, accepted office in the new administration, and were duly sworn in.No now matter of policy has been decided by the Government since then, and your resignation can therefore be related only to the personal issues to which I have already referred. </para>

I pointed out how embarrassing the position was for me, as that was my first opportunity to inquire. I accepted the position, however, was sworn in, and worked in Cabinet to-day. The inner group policy I read of in the press and, arising out of this matter of principle, I left the Cabinet. I told the Prime Minister when I resigned that my resignation had nothing to do with the incident of yesterday.

              <para>- - 1 am speaking now to the motion. I regret exceedingly that the Prime Minister and the Government refused to give me, as Acting Leader of the Opposition, permission to make a statement, seeing that the Opposition considered it quite proper for the Prime Minister to make. a statement and for one of his chosen Ministers to speak also. Later the Prime Minister made a further statement, and one of his chosen Ministers also was permitted to do so. I offered no objection to that, because the Opposition felt that, as Leader of the Government, the Prime Minister was entitled to make the statement. I submit, as Acting Leader of the Opposition, with all respect to the Prime Minister and the Government, that I am entitled, in fair play, as the mouthpiece of the Opposition- </para>

              <para>- I cast no reflection on the House, because I do not know how it will vote on this motion, and I do not blame the House ; I blame the Prime Minister. It is necessary to suspend the Standing Orders to give the Opposition an opportunity to state its views regarding the proceedings to which we have listened this afternoon, and which reminded one of the proceedings in a divorce court action, or in a breach of promise case, with the bitter recriminations on both sides between the Prime Minister and his ex-Minister. Surely this Parliament is the place in which the Opposition ought to be permitted to state its views. The Prime Minister has had such an opportunity. Why should he stifle discussion on the part of the Opposition? </para>

            <para>- I second the motion. I do so because I think that there is a little sportsmanship in this Parliament. The Standing Orders lay down that a statement may be made only by leave. They also provide that leave can be refused, if there is one dissentient voice. 1 desire the opinion of this Parliament to be tested to determine whether one voice speaks for all honorable members of this House. The &#34; Opposition has been extremely fair in allowing the Prime Minister to make a statement by leave. </para>

Why can it not be handled in a calm and dispassionate way? After all, to-day&#39;s proceedings were without precedent in the history of this Parliament, and I think that the Acting Leader of the Opposition is entitled to say a word on the re-allocation of portfolios, the duties that have been entrusted to the various members, and also upon the other changes proposed. The changes are the result of controversy as to whether the Government is faithfully discharging its duties regarding defence.

            <para>- The resignation of the honorable member for Balaclava wass  tendered in circumstances that call fora reply from the Opposition. The Opposition feels, as he does, that certain things are likely to happen as the result of the change of Ministry, and the introduction of a new system of determining Government policy. Are we not all interested in secondary industries? Because the matter of employment is involved, the Opposition claims to be very deeply interested. I put it to the Prime Minister that he should reconsider his attitude. The Opposition has been very tolerant on many occasions. It has always given leave for the making of statements, and it has not hindered the business of the Government. I admit that, in this regard, things may be somewhat different from what they were a few years ago, but that is past. I ask the House at least to give the Acting Leader of the Opposition the right to speak. He represents 29 members of this Parliament, and half the electors of Australia. Therefore, he has the right to be heard on an important matter which may mean the end of this Government before very much longer. </para>

            <para>- I support the motion moved by. the Acting Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde).</inline> The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> has stated that it is unprecedented for the Opposition to seek to make a statement upon a statement by the Prime Minister announcing the allocation of the various offices under a new administration. I point out, however, that the statement of the Prime Minister went far beyond the mere announcing of the names and the offices.  His  statement disclosed a radical and unprecedented departure from the principle of Cabinet responsibility and represen- t at ive government as hitherto carried on in Australia, and in the various parts of Australia. That, surely, was a matter upon which, leave having been graciously given to the Prime Minister, leave might well have been given to the Acting Leader of the Opposition also. But the matter extended even beyond those ample limits, because we witnessed in the House something which, I think, isabsolutely unprecedented in our experience of parliamentary government: that was, that the names of the Ministers having been mentioned from the table by the Prime Minis ter, one Minister immediately rose in his place and repudiated the appointment which the Prime Minister had just announced, and repudiated it for reasons, and on grounds, to which I have already referred, namely, that it was a radical departure from the principles of repre sentative government as Ave understand them. </para>

Therefore, I hope that honorable members opposite will see the fairness and propriety of our Acting Leader at least being allowed to make a statement on behalf of the Opposition regarding how all this presents itself to us, who represent one half of the people of Australia. We have had an announcement of radical changes in the method of parliamentary government, a profession of rebellion on the part of a Minister, and four statements made by leave without a word of protest from the Opposition; we have had this family brawl continued in our presence and in yours, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> yet we, who represent so many of the people of Australia, are not allowed one spokesman to speak for those we represent. I can only express the hope that ministerial supporters will see the unfairness of such an arbitrary stand by the Prime Minister. </para>

              <para>- The motion should be supported because it is designed to give this Parliament, and the democracy it represents, an opportunity to hear the views of the honorable members as a whole. Until such time as the Acting Leader of the Opposition has been given the opportunity to make a statement it cannot be said that the right of this Parliament to determine and express its views upon a matter of tremendous importance has been observed. I wonder whether the Government has adopted its present attitude in order to protect the Prime Minister in a very discomforting situation. </para>

              <para>- I urge honorable members to realize that the Leader of the Opposition holds a very high arid distinguished office in the service of this Parliament. He is the Leader of His Majesty&#39;s Opposition, and he speaks for a very substantial number of the constituents of this great Commonwealth. He, or his deputy, has a .right, therefore, to be heard on so important a matter as that which is now before this Parliament. The democracy of Australia will condemn any action taken by this Government to deprive the Opposition of the opportunity to make its voice heard on this matter. However, if it cannot express its views here it certainly will make its voice heard elsewhere, and in doing so will give far more effective expression to its view than it could possibly achieve under the procedure of this Parliament. I hope we shall at least retain our name as a democratic Parliament, and not reveal this assembly as a Fascist council, a suggestion that is made far top readily in the attitude adopted by the Prime Minister, and those honorable members who object to giving leave to the Acting Leader of the Opposition to make a statement. </para>

            <para>. - The question now before the House is one of procedure, and that is my excuse for saying a few words upon it. As you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> have ruled - if I may say, with respect, quite rightly - we are not entitled to discuss on this motion any question of substance in relation to matters that arise in the House. We are entitled to discuss merely questions of procedure that arise out of them. As I understand it statements to the House by leave are designed to enable Ministers, or members, to convey information to the House in a. convenient form, whether by way of personal explanation or otherwise. As I understand it, that system was never designed, and is not designed, to enable a debate to be carried on. It may be that for some time we have got into the habit of having a statement from one side followed by a controversial statement from the other, but the position is that the Standing Orders of this House provide for many different ways of instituting and carrying on debates on matters of substance, and every one of those ways is at all times available to honorable members opposite, or to honorable members sitting on this side. The real question that arises here is whether such a debate should be carried on, not by one of the dozen means provided for its carrying on in the Standing Orders, but, in effect, by means of a series of statements by leave. I suggest, that it would be a very dangerous precedent, indeed, if we agree that we may have what is in substance a debate in the form of a series of statements. For that reason I suggest that the motion before the House should be rejected. </para>

            <para>- I support the motion moved by the Acting Leader of the Opposition. I am not at all influenced by the arguments submitted by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies).</inline> He said that the Standing Orders of this Parliament are so framed as to permit of statements being made by Ministers in a convenient form to the House as circumstances render them necessary, but I have yet to learn that they were designed for the purpose of allowing honorable members on one side only to be heard whilst other honorable members are stifled. I remind the Attorney-General that on very few occasions in this Parliament, has leave been refused to the Prime Minister <inline font-style="italic">or</inline> to the Leader of the Opposition to make a statement on any matter considered to be of urgent public importance. Everybody should recognize that the mere fact of leave having been refused to the Acting Leader of the Opposition to make a statement is serious enough in itself; but when we take into account that the object of the refusal is to prevent the Oppositionwhich in my opinion, at the moment, represents more than half the electors of the Commonwealth - from expressing the Opposition opinion at the right time with respect to a very serious alteration of the control of the parliamentary business of this country, it becomes very much more serious. </para>

I appeal to the democratic instincts of the Prime Minister and also of other honorable members opposite to give impartial consideration to my motion. I assure them that I moved it with the greatest reluctance, and only because no other way is open to the Opposition to express its view at this moment on a change of such a revolutionary nature as the placing of the affairs of the Commonwealth in the hands of a dictatorship of five. </para>

            <para>- The honorable mem bur&#39;s question contains a mis-statement. There has been no recommendation by the Administrator to me that additional hotel licences should be granted in the Northern  Territory.  Therefore, I have not, as the honorable member stated, disregarded such a recommendation. As I said earlier, in reply to a similar question by the honorable member, I abolished tinLand Board of the Northern Territory in accordance with a  recommendation  of the Payne-Fletcher Committee, and vested the authority, which previously reposed in it, in the Administrator. </para>

            <para>- What contribution does the Government make towards the inland aerial medical service, and what say has the Government in the control of moneys expended by that service? Further, is the Minister for the Interior aware that a receiving and broadcasting station for use in connexion with the aerial medical service was constructed at Broken Hill and was found so unsatisfactory that it had to be replaced by another station costing a considerable amount of money? </para>

              <para>- In reply to the first part of the honorable member&#39;s question, the Commonwealth grant to the Australian Aerial Medical Services is &#163;5,000. That grant is made by way of assistance to this honorary voluntary organization, which has established a group of aerial medical services that, on the completion of the Alice Springs project, will cover the whole of the inland districts of Australia. &#39;Services at present are being maintained at Cloncurry, Wyndham, Port Headland, Kalgoorlie and Broken Hill, and are in conjunction with the Government&#39;s own medical service operating from Katherine. The Government&#39;s annual contribution of &#163;5,000 to the Australian Aerial Medical Services represents a very meagre proportion of the annual cost of establishing and maintaining this very wonderful inland service. </para>

          <para>. - I support the amendment moved by the honorable member forFranklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Frost),</inline> who seeks the stipulation of a quota for Tasmania, in connexion with the export trade. The Minister is prepared &#34;to make some amendments empowering the newly constituted board to determine this question, subject to certain other factors. I do not profess to be sufficiently well versed in the matter to appreciate fully what those other factors involve, but I am disposed to accept the Minister&#39;s assurance that he feels that he has good reason for making this qualification. The honorable member for Franklin feels that from the point of view of the growers in Tasmania, it is undesirable that any qualification should be imposed and that an export quota should be guaranteed. The opposition to this amendment seems to be coming chiefly from the representatives of Western Australia. </para>

            <para>- Then it would be equally arbitrary in its application to all the States. I do not believe that the honorable member for Franklin wishes Tasmania to obtain an undue advantage over the other States. We must remember, however, that some of the States have special interests in particular industries. In Queensland there is the sugar industry, which is vital to the economic welfare of that State, and Queensland representatives naturally endeavour to ensure that the interests of that industry are safeguarded. Tasmania is in much the same position in regard to fruit,  and I  say that without under-estimating the importance of the industry to Victoria, or any other State. We should remember that Victoria has many industries. It is not dependent upon fruit-growing alone. </para>

            <para>- I am trying to look at this matter in a general way. It cannot be denied that Tasmania depends, largely, on its fruit-growing industry for its economic existence. Tasmania suffers under many disabilities, and it has, year after year, had to approach the Commonwealth for a grant to compensate it for the disabilities alleged&#39; to  be  due to federation. In that State, the applegrowing industry has  been  raised to  a very  high standard, and for that  we  must commend the growers and the Tasmanian Go- vernment.  We in this Parliament should do our best to support a State that is trying to develop an industry suitable to its conditions and in which a large capital outlay has been involved. There is a long period of waiting for the trees to come to maturity, the right types for export and for home consumption have to be selected, scientific investigation has to be made regarding the control of pests, &#38;c, and marketing arrangements have to be carefully organized. No one will deny that, in regard to all these matters, Tasmania has played its part well. </para>

            <para>- I do not blame the honorable member for taking up the attitude he does, but, as the representative of the consumers, I regard myself as unbiased on this question. We offer the home market to the growers, and we hope to get the fruit as cheaply as is consistent with providing the growers with a reasonable return. Western Australia, apparently, is setting out to develop an applegrowing industry, but it has not yet been developed to the same degree as in Tasmania. It cannot he overlooked that there is a definite limit to the quantity of fruit that can be absorbed by the export trade and by the home market. This problem revolves round the question of which so much is heard nowadays, namely, planning. We frequently hear mention of our wide, open spaces in Australia that are calling out for development, and of the need to establish irrigation schemes, with a view to increasing production. That sounds very well, but I always ask myself: What are we to do with the produce of these areas if they are developed? If there is no payable market for what is produced, then all our efforts are vain. If we set out to expand the apple and pear growing industry without having first a definite plan for disposing of its product, we shall be merely leading a large number of people in Western Australia and elsewhere up a blind alley. It takes many years for trees to come into full bearing. At the end of that time the growers will have no market for a large part of their produce, and they will be forced to approach the Commonwealth Government for a bounty or a subsidy. There is no alternative. Of course, I admit that it would be possible to increase the home consumption of fruit, but that is bound up with matters which lie outside the scope of this discussion. Just to touch upon it briefly, however, I may say that in every second home in the district which I represent more fruit would be eaton if the people had the means to buy it. I cannot ask that the fruit be made available at a price below the cost of production. If I fight for good conditions for the workers, that is, the consumers, f cannot forget that the growers are also entitled to a fair return. Unfortunately, far from bringing about conditions which would make for an increased consumption of fruit, we seem all the time to be tending in the opposite direction. </para>

        <para>It seems to me that Parliament should give first consideration to that State where the industry is already established. After all, we have an obligation to Tasmania, because this industry is the basis of its prosperity. It would be bad taste, to say the least of it, to do anything which would rob Tasmania of its rightful place in this regard. There must be a limit somewhere to the amount of fruit  produced,  because of the restricted market in our export trade. Honorable members will recall that after the war we set out on an orgy of closer settlement. The cry was to put the soldiers on the laud, to grow more wheat, to increase production. Well, production was increased, and then it was found that we could not sell the produce. We shall find ourselves in a similar difficulty if we encourage people in Western Australia or elsewhere to embark upon an industry in which there is no room for expansion. I am not convinced that there is much room for expansion in regard to exports. Practically all nations are now so arranging their economic development as to make themselves, as far as possible, independent of outside sources of supply. </para>
        <para>The honorable member for Franklin is not only seeking to advance the interests of his State, but he is also, in an indirect way, sounding a note of warning against the danger of unplanned development in this industry.

Both the honorable member for Franklin and the honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahoney)</inline> have told us that we should consider this matter from a broad, national point of view, but the honorable member for West Sydney asks us to help Tasmania, and claims. that that State has a right to this industry. 1 do not concede that. I contend that individual apple-growers in Tasmania have only the same rights as those of individual growers in any other part of Australia. </para>

            <para>- I am coming to that point. The honorable member for Franklin claims that the board should take into consideration only the exports of the previous three years.; but I contend that, in dealing with his amendment, we should also have in mind the amendment to be submitted by the Postmaster.General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron),</inline> which takes other factors into consideration. The honorable member for West Sydney ha.s mentioned the financial obligations of those already engaged in apple growing. 1 suggest that those things should be considered as well as climatic and seasonal difficulties. If the present amendment were carried these things could not be taken into consideration, because the export quotas would be determined entirely in accordance with average shipments during the previous three years. If Tasmania experienced an unfavorable season, and had a very small quantity of fruit available for export, that fact would be taken into consideration, if the Minister&#39;s suggested amendment were carried. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member makes that statement because he knows that growers in other States run a greater risk of bad seasons than do those in Tasmania. The amendment to be submitted by the Minister would enable consideration to be given to factors such as small crops in any of the States in the three years prior to the determination of the export quota. I suggest that this arrangement, although it might operate against  Tasmania  occasionally, would more frequently operate against the other States. I do not agree with the honorable member for West Sydney that orchardists in parts of Australia other than Tasmania, where apples can be grown well, should be prevented from growing them. </para>

            <para>- That ma) be a sound argument, but Australia has, at times in the past, produced more apples than could be profitably marketed. It is impossible accurately to forecast the crop in any year.- Tasmania might experience a total failure in one year, but there should be other sources of supply in the other States. Australia has a vast potential home market for apples, and more apples than at present could be marketed locally if the industry were organized on a proper basis. Tasmania would get as fair a deal under the Minister&#39;s proposed amendment as under that now before the committee. </para>

          <para>.- I am not in favour of the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Frost),</inline> although I am in sympathy with the Tasmanian growers in their desire to obtain a fixed quota as their share of the export trade, it would be rather dangerous to fix the quota on the basis of the previous three years&#39; production. It would be unfair for several reasons. Some honorable members have said that increased production should not be encouraged, and to some degree I concur in that opinion, but regard should be had for the fact that about seven years&#39; work is required to bring an apple orchard into production. </para>

            <para>- The minimum period is seven years, and another four or five years must elapse before an orchard can be brought into full production. Therefore, an orchardist must wait at least ten years before receiving the full benefit of his labour. The amendment would increase this period of waiting by another three years before the orchardist would receive benefit similar to that of those who happened to be engaged in the industry before him, by virtue of the fact that they had, perhaps, inherited an orchard from their grandfathers, or, for any other reason, had established themselves in the industry sooner than other growers. Those who were lucky enough to inherit properties would be in a far stronger position than the courageous individual who started out with next to nothing, and battled against tremendous odds. The interests of Tasmania would be fairly safeguarded under the clause, and the amendment to be submitted by the Minister would give the board power to take into considera tion the average yearly exports overseas of apples and pears from each State during the three years immediately preceding the year in which the basis was adopted. </para>

        <para>The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> has claimed that excess production of goods which are difficult to sell should be discouraged, but can he name any Australian primary product which could be safely grown on the score that adequate markets are available for it? If we adopted his attitude, the development of all our primary industries would be arrested. All that we can do with regard to apples and pears is to ensure a basis of equality in the various States, so that the orchardists capable of economically competing in the markets of the world may have every opportunity to do so. </para>

            <para>- I am always in favour of that. The time may arrive-^ and I believe it is rapidly approachingwhen primary producers other than apple- growers will experience limited world markets. It may be necessary for a restriction of export quotas of butter, meat, wheat and other commodities. If we now established the principle that vested interests, whether large or small, should be given priority because of  their  earlier entry into an industry, I think that we should be following a dangerous course. </para>

            <para>- I should deal with that matter, too, from a broad Australian point of view. I recently had an opportunity to visit the apple-producing areas in Western Australia, including the famous Kendenup estate, which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. De</inline> Garis endeavoured to establish. Many settlers spent much money and years of toil on that estate, and only now are the apple trees coming into full production. Should the orchardists in this locality be placed at a disadvantage compared with those in districts that have been established for a longer period? The growers in all of the States should be prepared to accept export quotas determined on the same basis. Western Australia is in a similar position to that of Tasmania in that it requires financial assistance from the Commonwealth from time to time, and, therefore, the claims of growers in that. State merit as much consideration as those of the orchardists in Tasmania. </para>

            <para>- I have no axe to grind in this matter - I do not grow an apple - but, because I am a fruit-grower, I demand that there shall be fair treatment of apple-growers in other parts of Australia, and that no preference shall be given to any particular State. As I have said, a few years ago New South Wales and Victoria lost from 70 per cent. to 80 per cent. of their apple crop. Should that condition again arise, with the result that the growers of New South Wales would be on a considerably reduced quota, while Tasmania was on a fixed quota, based on a high production, the position would be most unfair to New South Wales. </para>

          <para>.- The persistence of the representatives of Tasmania is induced by the desire on their part to take advantage of the applegrowers of the whole of the mainland of Australia. The last three years have been consistently good years in Tasmania, while on the mainland they have been lean years. The Tasmanians want to fix future exports on that basis, which is not a fair one. The honorable mem- ber for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahoney)</inline> has interjected asking whether other States, including Western Australia, exported their quota last year. They did not. Western Australia, in particular, was unable to do so because a . hailstorm destroyed over 400,000 cases of its apples. Is it not sufficient that those States which failed to fill their quota met with misfortune, without imposing on them the further misfortune of fixing a future quota on the basis of production during the last year and other years? Although we admit that Tasmania has been outstanding in the establishment of the apple trade with the United Kingdom, it must also be agreed that it has done very well out of its exports of apples. It has almost a monopoly of the apple market of Sydney. </para>

            <para>- Western Australia has no chance to compete on the Sydney market. The freight from Hobart to Sydney is10d. a case, whereas from Fremantle to Sydney it is 2s.11d. a case; consequently, Western Australia is at a disadvantage of 2s.1d. a case. Tasmania is already fairly well treated in having almost a monopoly of the Sydney market, which is the greatest of the State markets; and. admittedly, the local market is the most valuable. A fatal objection to the proposal of the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Frost)</inline> is that neither the last three years, nor any other three years, represent a fair average of the production of the States of Australia ; they are unduly favorable to Tasmania. </para>

          <para>.- A crucial portion of the clause is the phrase &#34; uniformly throughout the Commonwealth &#34;. With the retention of those words, it seems to be quite clear that the standard of the last three years&#39; production for export could not be applied, because the only effect of its application would be to arrive at a basis which did not apply uniformly throughout the Commonwealth. The object of applying that standard, suggested by the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Frost)</inline> and approvedof in some degree by the Government, is to obtain a  basis which would not apply uniformly throughout the Commonwealth. According to my view, if the words &#34; uniformly throughout the Commonwealth &#34; were deleted it would be possible to apply the standard suggested by the honorable member for Franklin, either in his absolute and inelastic form, or subject to the modifications proposed by the Minister. But if the standard is to apply uniformly throughout the Commonwealth I cannot see any sense in giving, in the form proposed by either the honorable member for Franklin or the Government, the direction that the board shall take into account the figures for the last three years preceding the year in which the basis is fixed. I cannot see how that would operate if a basis is to be fixed throughout the Commonwealth - either that a given number of tons or that a given proportion of the production of each State, has to be exported or sold. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member for Franklin proposes, first, to omit certain words, and then, if those words be omitted, to insert certain other words. I agree that the words which he proposes to omit should be omitted, because I think that the board should be free, if it thinks fit, to depart from the principle of uniformity, provided that it does not depart from that principle as between the States. Section 99 of the Constitution would prevent the board from giving preference to any one State over any other State, but it would not prevent the Commonwealth or its delegate from giving preference to one part of Australia as against another part of Australia, so long as that part was not taken as representing a State or part of a State. As I said in this committee last week, the position in <inline font-style="italic">Elliott&#39;scasewas</inline> that regulations made under the Transport Workers Act applied to some parts of the Commonwealth and not to others. Those regulations were attacked on the ground that they discriminated between States or parts of States. The High Court held that there was no such discrimination because it was between ports, which were not considered as parts of States; they were different regions or districts. I should say that Section 99 would prevent discrimination . between States as such, but that there is nothing to prevent discrimination between different parts of Australia. </para>

          <para>- As drawn, it goes beyond the constitutional limitation, because it will prevent any discrimination at all; it demands uniformity. If it insists on the basis of export being uniform throughout the Commonwealth, nothing can be considered or given effect which disturbs that uniformity. I am in favour of relieving the board from the injunction to make a basis which applies uniformly throughout the Commonwealth, but not of saying that the board must depart from the principle of uniformity. That seems to me to be the proposal of the honorable member for Franklin; that the board must do something, the only result of which will be lack of uniformity throughout Australia. I think that the board should bo free to do what it thinks fit, but that in deciding it should be bound to take into consideration what both the honorable member for Franklin and the Government believe should be considered - that is, the volume of exports in the three years preceding the fixing of the basis. The board will not be free to consider that if the words &#34; uniformly throughout the Commonwealth &#34; remain. With the deletion of those words, the new sub-clause 1a proposed by the Minister would be adequate; but that new sub-clause, read in conjunction with the preceding provision for the uniform application of a basis, would mean nothing at all. I am considering this matter not from any State viewpoint - I have not in mind Tasmania, New South Wales, or Western Australia - but in the interest of those who are making their living by the growing of apples. It is all very well to argue as though we shall have the regime of free competition co-existing with this scheme ; we shall not. This will supersede free competition; that is its only object. It postulates a smaller demand overseas for Australian apples, but no correlative increase of the Australian demand. It will disturb the regime of free competition. Are we to place those who come into the industry hereafter on the same basis as those who are living by it now? I think that those who are now living by the industry are entitled to more consideration than are  those who may hereafter come into it. I want the board to have some indication from Parliament that it must consider the matter upon some such lines. It is a fact that the industry is largely carried on in the State of Tasmania. I realize there are a lot of people in that State who have been accustomed to look to it for their livelihood. The board should be told that, everything being equal, it should give consideration to that matter, unless, in its opinion, it is not just or practicable to do so. I cannot vote for the amendment of the honorable member for Franklin, because it is rigid and inelastic. I believe that it would be unfair to the other States, and possibly also to the growers in his own State. But I should like the board to be relieved from th obligation to make a uniform basis, and to bo empowered and directed to give consideration to the matter to which I have referred, and to attach to it such weight as it thinks is just and practicable. </para>

As the honorable member for &#34;West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley),</inline> in supporting him, said, it would be only fair to safeguard the interests of a place in which the industry is in being. I think that the committee is largely in agreement with the honorable member for Franklin that the industry is of paramount importance to the people of Tasmania, and that it is surely easier for expansion to be slowed down in other parts than for a curtailment of what has been long established in his State. Nevertheless, I feel that this amendment is dangerous, and could work out very unfairly even to the State of Tasmania itself, in that if we adopted this rigid standard and any State should suffer a reduction of its export* in any one year, ii would be almost impossible for its quota to be again increased. Under the system of averaging, quotas can be reduced, but it is very difficult for any State to get its quota increased, except as the result of disaster in one or more of the other States. Suppose that a State ex ported 900,000 cases annually, and then in one year, as the result of a major disaster in the industry, its exports dropped to nil. For the purpose of simplicity I am stating an extreme case. That would mean that for two years that State would export 900,000 cases but nothing in the third year. If the amendment be adopted, its quota in the fourth year would be limited to 600,000 cases, or two-thirds of its average export. For the following year the quota would then be worked out on the basis of 900,000 cases, nil, and 600,000 cases, which would further reduce it to 500,000 cases. And for the next year tho quota would be based on annual exports of nil, 600,000, and 500,000 cases, which would decrease it to 366,000. In the following year there would bc a slight increase to 488,000. but for the next year it would fall again to 450,000, and in the sixth year, to 430.000. Exports would then be stabilized at approximately 450,000 cases, or about half of the original average. Should an extreme case of that kind arise, it is quite abvious that Parliament would have to amend this legislation further, and such a position could arise in. respect of any of the States if the amendment moved by the honorable member for Franklin be adopted. 1 admit that it is less likely to arise in respect of Tasmania, because that State enjoys the ideal climate for apple growing. For the last 10 years, or mort, it has experienced no major disaster in that industry. However, I do not think that any honorable member knows better than the honorable member for Franklin himself that of all industries the fruitgrowing industry is more likely to be visited by major disasters resulting in crops being completely lost, or, at least, reduced by half. I suggest, therefore, that it would be inimical to the interests of any State if we were to adopt a proposal of this kind. </para>

        <para>I appreciate the arguments that this proposal, if adopted, would curtail expansion of the fruit-growing industry in other States where it is as yet in its infancy. Such submissions are countered largely by the contentions of the honorable member for West Sydney that the industry, &#39; as it exists to-day, ought to be given preference over problematical production in future years, lint 1 rely completely on the argument that. the proposal embodied in the amendment is not sufficiently elastic, and would not achieve what I understand to be the real objective which the honorable member for Franklin has in mind. The <inline font-style="italic">status quo</inline> ought to be definitely taken into consideration, and I should favour an amendment which, whilst allowing the board freedom of initiative to take into consideration any development in the industry which might call for special attention, sought to instruct the board that it must pay attention to the <inline font-style="italic">status quo.</inline> The board, however, should be free to depart from hard and fast quotas. I regret that I must oppose the amendment because I realize the valuable work which the honorable member for Franklin has done in connexion with this measure, and the very broad-minded view which he has taken of it as a whole. However, I feel that his suggestion is dangerous. There is a very strong argument for stabilizing the industry until such time as we know that we can, in fact, increase our exports, or until such time as we have educated the people of Australia to a greater consumption. For these reasons I shall oppose the amendment in its present form. </para>

          <para>. -  I should not have addressed myself again to this measure, but for some remarks made by honorable members opposite which may have the effect of discrediting the apple-growers of Tasmania. It is a very poor argument to say that Tasmanian apples are grown from trees which are too old. The honorable member foi Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stacey)</inline> stated that Tasmanian apples were packed in old green boxes. These statements arc incorrect. I regret that such a parochial not&#169; has been introduced into this debate, when we are considering so important a matter as the stabilization of an industry which has proved beyond doubt that it is worth preserving. I appreciate the arguments which have been advanced from the point of view of Western Australia and of the other States which might fee&#93; th.it the amendment, if carried, would militate against the development of the fruit-growing industry, by bringing about unfair competition to the advantage of Tasmania. I point out, however, that this measure is designed to limit the export of apples. Its ultimate result must be to restrict the development of orchards throughout Australia, because if markets are limited, the quota must be correspondingly limited. In respect of fruitgrowing, Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria are more or less gambling with climatic conditions, and those States must accept the difficulties which are bound to arise as the result of droughts and the visitations of pests. Tasmania, on the contrary, enjoys an ideal climate. The soil and conditions generally are ideal for apple growing. Some honorable members have alluded to the enormous acreage under orchards in other parts of Australia, but we must remember that Tasmania achieves far greater results from its comparatively smaller areas. Furthermore, honorable members should not overlook the tremendous amount of work which bus been put into the industry in Tasmania in the clearing of scrub. In the Huon district, for instance, extensive forests had to be cleared in order to make way for orchards, and nothing like the same amount of work in that direction has had to be done in other parts of Australia. Some honorable members suggest that Tasmania stands to lose if the amendment moved by the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Frost)</inline> is adopted. Tasmania is prepared to face that eventuality. Above all, it is entitled to hold what it has already achieved in this industry. Judging by his remarks, the honorable member for &#34;Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> knows nothing about this industry. Honorable members should approach this matter from the point of view of doing something in the best interests of the primary producers of Australia as a whole. I admit, that some of them must find it hard to give a decision that will favour the small State of Tasmania. We may enjoy some advantage in being close to the Sydney market, but we are further away from the London market than Western Australia. Shipping provides our only means of transport to the mainland and, at times, that is interrupted. Western Australia has no similar disability to contend with. I believe that the amendment will be carried. I urge honorable members to give to the State of Tasmania that to which it is fully entitled for having pioneered an industry which has proved to be so valuable to Australia. </para>

In view of the fact that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> has gone so far to meet the honorable member, it is really difficult to understand how he could persist with his proposal. The Minister has given way to some extent, and the honorable; members should be satisfied. Had the Government made a proposition in the first place similar to that which the Minister has now made, I should have had a good deal to say about it. I think it is going too far. In the circumstances I cannot understand the honorable member for Franklin pressing his proposal. </para>

          <para>.-I wish to add a little more to what I have already said on this subject. I cannot support the amendment. It is a pity that the position of Tasmania has been over-stressed. Honorable members are showing a tendency to be a little too generous to that State. Tasmania has no inherent vested rights in the apple and pear industry. After all, it should be remembered that Victoria has 30,000 acres, and Tasmania has only 26,000 acres, under apples. We must face the facts of the situation. It has been said that Tasmania pioneered the apple exporting industry. The fact is that Victoria exported the first apples from Australia, &#39;and has ever since been active in the industry. Although Tasmania is separated from the mainland by Bass Strait it should not be assumed that it necessarily suffers some disadvantage in respect of mainland markets. Shipping freights from Launceston and Hobart to Sydney are lower than railway freights from Harcourt, an apple-growing area of Victoria, to Mildura, an appleconsuming area in Victoria. The Tasmanian growers are in the better position to take advantage of the Sydney market than are the growers in Victoria. Tasmania should not be given an undue preference in connexion with this industry. In the final analysis we must surely bear in mind the welfare of the growers of all the States. The major purpose of this measure and others similar to it is to help the individual grower, and, in some degree, the individual wage-earner in the industry. I do not think we should make a rigid rule in regard to quotas, for that might put the applegrowers of Western Australia, Queensland and Victoria in a most unfair position. The Tasmanian growers will have four representatives on this board, which is twice the number that any other State will have, and four times the number that some States will have. They should be able to watch the interests of Tasmania. I do not desire to rob the Tasmanian apple-growers of any inherent rights that they possess. All I ask of honorable members is that they shall give fair consideration to the claims of applegrowers irrespective of where they happen to live. </para>

          <para>.- I admire the enthusiasm of the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Frost)</inline> and acknowledge that he speaks with authority on this subject; but I regret that I cannot support his amendment. The honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn),</inline> who assured us that he did not look at the subject through State eyes, questioned whether the amendment of the honorable member for Franklin was constitutional. We must bear that in mind. I am not particularly concerned whether apples are grown on young or old trees. I am concerned, however, that only the best Australian apples shall be exported. Provided other conditions are satisfactory it does not make much difference whether apples are grown on young or old trees. Although I have no wish to discuss the subject from the State point of view, I remind honorable members of the occasion to which I referred in my second-reading speech, when about 100,000 cases of South Aus-  tralian apples intended for export were left on the wharf and had to he sold on a glutted market. We must not allow a similar state of affairs to occur. I shall vote against the amendment. </para>

          <para>.- Although considerable time has been given to the consideration of this clause, I am in duty bound to stress once again the claims of Tasmania. Notwithstanding the remarks of the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard),</inline> I assert that Tasmania pioneered our apple exporting industry. The first shipment of apples from that State was made in 1884, and from about 1887 regular consignments of apples have been sent from Tasmania to the British market. Tasmania has nurtured this industry and has done a great deal more than any other State to develop our apple export trade. We are proud of the fact. If the honorable member for Ballarat is interested in the beginning of things, let me remind him that Launceston is the mother of that wonderful city, Melbourne. It has been argued that Victoria has a greater acreage under apples than Tasmania. That is true, but Victoria has not been able always to supply its quota for the export trade, whereas Tasmaniahas rarely failed to do so. Experience has shown beyond question that Tasmania&#39;s production is much more reliable than that of Victoria or any other mainland State. I remember that on one occasion Tasmania had to provide 9,000 cases of apples to make up the Victorian quota. In fact, all through the years Tasmania has been a. far more reliable producer of apples than any other State. This being so, it should not now be placed at a disadvantage. The honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fairbairn)</inline> cited certain figures to show that a quota system might work to the disadvantage of Tasmania. Even if that is so, Tasmanian growers prefer to adhere to the quota system on a definite basis, and to take whatever risk is involved. In view of Tasmania&#39;s long connexion with the industry, the high quality of its products, and the reliability of its output, it would be grossly unfair if, at this stage, Tasmanian growers were penalized in order to suit the convenience of certain States with an expanding production. Unless extreme care is taken in dealing with this industry, Australia will be faced with all the difficulties of overproduction, and our growers will not be able to find a satisfactory market for their product. In these circumstances, I shall support the amendment. </para>

From experience of other Commonwealth marketing legislation, we know that it is possible for a man to be refused a licence to export produce. Under this bill, a person who was refused a licence would have no opportunity to appeal against the refusal.

            <para>- The right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> who, in his capacity as Minister for Commerce, has hitherto had the invaluable help of the honorable gentleman himself. That right honorable gentleman is not sympathetic towards the fruit-growers. Only last year, when I approachedthe right honorable Minister on behalf of the small fruit-growers, he turned them down with resultant ruin to thousand? of growers. He is the Minister who is to take the administration of this legislation in hand. Not only is too much power given to the board by this bill, but also the exporters are given no right of appeal from its decisions, and, for that reason, I trust that the Government will accept the amendment. It should not cause any trouble, because any person who did approach a magistrate&#39;s court, in pursuance of the amendment, with an appeal against the Minister&#39;s cancellation of his licence or refusal to grant him a licence, would have to bear the expense. If, however, he could show, to the satisfaction of the magistrate, that there had been victimization, he would receive the justice of a court of law and be enabled to retain his licence or to obtain a licence, whichever be the case, whereas the intention of the bill, as it is at present drafted, is that the last word shall rest with the Minister, who will be guided by the recommendations of the board. </para>

            <para>- Exporters have been victimized in the past, and it is possible for them to be victimized in the future. I say nothing now about the board, but it could happen that an exporter would come into conflict with it, and that, in retaliation, it would recommend to the Minister that his licence be cancelled. The Minister would act on the board&#39;s recommendation. That is what I seek to prevent. Such victimization could be preventable, if a man, who felt that he had been victimized, was able, at his own expense, to take his case to a magistrate, who would investigate the circumstances of the cancellation and, according to his findings, revoke the cancellation, or allow it to stay in force.I feel that a provision of the nature contained in my amendment was not intentionally omitted when this bill was being drafted; because the existing provisions make the Minister a dictator in whose power lies decision as to who shall send fruit abroad. I commend the amendment to the committee. </para>

          <para>.- Before coming to a decision as to what I shall do in respect of this amendment, I should like to have some more information as to what position might be reached in the event of an application being made to, say, a police magistrate, if a licence were refused, and as to what would be the extent of the magistrate&#39;s powers. For example, could a police magistrate restore a licence which had been cancelled, despite the fact that the exporter was completely unwilling to conform to the general export policy laid down by the board? The position, asI understand it, is that a licence would never be cancelled unless the exporter definitely refused to conform to the general principles laid down by the hoard in the interests of the industry as a whole, in which case recommendation would be made to the Minister by the board that the licence be cancelled, for the reason that the exporter would not conform to the general policy laid down by it. If the amendment were accepted, an appeal could be made to a police magistrate, who may know little or nothing about the industry, or the purpose for which the board was established, and he, using the powers which, presumably, he would have, might rule that the right to export be restored to a man who would not conform tothe policy to which all of his brother exporters were required to conform. 1 should like to know whether the appeal, would be merely to the magistrate to determine whether or not a man had been unjustly treated, in that, despite the fact that he was willing to conform to the general policy of the board, he had been refused a licence, or whether it would bo so broad as to enable the granting of a licence by the magistrate, over the head of the Minister, to a man who would not conform to the general export policy of the board. If I am not satisfied on this point, I cannot support the amendment. I appreciate what is in the mind of the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Frost),</inline> who desires to ensure that there shall be no possibility of victimization, but I can assure the honorable gentleman that to-day the Minister, on the recommendation of many other boards, has the same power as is given to him under this bill, and 1 have never heard in a great number of years of victimization of exporters in the exercise of those powers. I am afraid that if the amendment is agreed to in the form proposed the committee would be putting into the hands of police magistrates power to prevent the proposed board from carrying out the duties which Parliament in this bill is entrusting to it for the benefit of the apple and pear industry. </para>

          <para>.- This clause confers upon the board power to make regulations, and to deal with persons deemed to have infringed such regulations. The board will consist of representatives of all of the States. Doubtless, there will be considerable competition on behalf of local interests between the various States, and a division of opinion amongst the members of the board is to be expected. It is idle to assume that all the members of the board will hold similar views. The clause provides for certain contingencies when the board is not unanimous. A remarkable situation may arise in the fixing of quotas owing to differences of opinion amongst the members of the board. The board has power to make regulations to control the export of the commodities with which the bill deals. </para>

            <para>- It has the power to recommend the regulations to be promulgated. There is nothing in the bill to ensure that the decisions of the  board  shall be unanimous in inflicting penalties on exporters. In the event of there being a difference of opinion, I presume that the Minister will be bound to accept the decision of a simple majority. It is quite conceivable that there will be differences of opinion among exporters as to the authority to be exercised by the board; in that way conflict of opinion will arise. When an exporter is deemed by the board to have infringed the regulations the Minister may, on the recommendation of the board, suspend or cancel his licence, and so prevent him from carrying on his business. Although the board may not be unanimous in recommending a penalty, the Minister will have no option but to inflict such penalty. If the offender be an exporter, the position will be serious, but should he be a grower and also an exporter depending on the export market, he will be denied the right of any return from his business. There is no appeal against the decision of the board, because the clause clearly states that the hoard may make prohibitory recommendations to the Minister against an individual. An exporter can be registered only on the recommendation of the hoard. Should there be a division of opinion amongst the members of the hoard concerning a disqualification a similar difference of opinion may prevail to the detriment of the person when be lodges an appeal. The framers of this legislation apparently believe that there will bc occasions when the board is not unanimous in the matter of quotas. In such cases there can be an appeal to a court. </para>

            <para>- Whether the authority be a court or an arbitrator is beside the point. The fact is that there is an appeal to an outside authority. There is no appeal to an arbitrator when a disqualification is involved. When the board is not unanimous on the subject of quotas, an appeal can be made to an arbitrator, whose decision the board must accept. If an exporter is also a grower it is much more important that he should retain his right to export. When an appeal is made to the board, that body will not be likely to reverse its decision. In respect of all offences against the law there is some form of appeal, but in this instance there is to be no appeal except to the authority which imposes the penalty.

          <para>Any person who has applied for a licence under this section may, in the prescribed manner and subject to the conditions prescribed appeal to a police, stipendiary or special magistrate from the refusal or failure of the hoard to recommend that a licence be issued to him. Upon such appeal the police, stipendiary or special magistrate shall re-hear the application and decide upon the matter and the board shall give effect to any decision made by him in accordance with this subsection. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">There ought to be some form of appeal. The honorable member for Franklin, who is closely associated with the industry, has shown that in many instances it is not the board which deals with offenders, but inspectors who report to the board. It has been alleged that there is a certain degree of victimization, and even if victimization is not actually practised, the possibility of it is always present. The board on the recommendation of an inspector, may deprive an exporter of his legitimate livelihood, but should the exporter be also a grower, he may have to dispose of his property. I trust that the Minister will accept the amendment moved by the honorable member for Franklin to provide the right of appeal, particularly as that right is provided in connexion with the most trivial offences involving small fines or short terms of imprisonment. There seems ample justification for a right of appeal from the decision of the board to some independent authority to be provided. </para>

The honorable member said that in the event of an offence against the regulations the offending person would be tried and condemned by the board. That will not bc so. If a person offends against the export regulations he may be tried in a customs court or a police court. lie will not be tried by the board. The honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Frost)</inline> is asking the committee to insert a new sub-clause to provide that an applicant for a licence shall, in the event of his application being refused, have the right to appeal to a court. The Minister is the only person who can grant or deprive a man of a licence. The possession of a licence to export does not give a person the right, to export.

          <para>.- Whatever interpretation the Minister puts on this clause, the fact remains that the clause as it is now drafted provides that the mere <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit</inline> of the Minister may deprive a grower of his right to export. All that the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Frost)</inline> wants is that the grower in such circumstances should have the right to appeal to a police, stipendiary, or special magistrate.  I  am unable to understand the opposition of members of the Country party to this amendment. They should be wiling to do everything within their power to protect primary producers against unfair treatment. To give power to the board to withdraw a licence to export smacks of star chamber methods. The proposal is absurd and is opposed to elementary justice. I appeal to members of the Country party to realize that the amendment moved by the honorable member for Franklin does not ask too much. If tha clause is left as it stands at present, a combination of circumstances may arise in. which a number of interstate exporters may be able to frame-up a charge against a grower and be instrumental in having his licence withdrawn. It has been done before. The history of this* country contains many injustices inflicted on individuals by boards such as that proposed in this bill. If a grower has done something which, in the opinion of the Minister, warrants the withdrawal of his licence, he should, in common fairness, be given the right to appeal to a magistrate. We are content to allow magistrates to adjudicate in criminal cases, and there is no reason why a magistrate should not act as fairly and impartially in an appeal against the decision of the board to cancel a licence as he would in a criminal case. I appeal to the Minister to give this matter his very serious consideration. The Parliament of a democratic country should not, in any circumstances, deny elementary justice to any person. </para>

          <para>.- I have a good deal of sympathy for the amendment. What concerns me most is whether there is under this clause a right of appeal at all from the decision of tha board. As I read it. the Minister must act on the recommendation of the board. The recommendation of the board is  a  condition precedent to his so acting. Subclause 5 provides that where a licence has been suspended the Minister may in certain circumstances have it restored. The condition precedent to the restoration of the licence is that the person whose licence has been suspended or cancelled has given a satisfactory undertaking to comply with the prescribed conditions and restrictions. But the Minister may act only on report by the board that that undertaking has been given. If it came to a contest between the Minister and the board I do not think the Minister would have authority to overrule the board. The honorable member for Franklin has proposed, as a safeguard, a right of appeal to a magistrate. After all, magistrates are accustomed to determine such issues, and they are much more likely to  do justice to the question than is a Minister situated, perhaps, thousands of miles away from the scene of the inquiry. Under the Motor Traffic Acts of the various States, licences have to be obtained to drive a motor car. The issue of these licences is within the power of the police, but throughout the States there is a right of appeal to a stipendiary magistrate against the decision of the police. In Western Australia we have the Estate Agents Act which requires estate agents to be licensed. The authorities have the right to refuse an application; but in the event of a refusal, the applicant may appeal to a stipendiary magistrate. I think that the clause should clearly express a right of appeal either to the Minister or to a magistrate. As a matter of preference, I suggest that provision should be made for appeal to the latter. If a case involving the suspension or cancellation of a licence arose in Western Australia, the Minister would bo 2,000 miles away and would have no local representative to conduct the inquiry; he would have to rely on the local representatives of the board in that State to do so. I do not know how, in these circumstances, the Minister could have a proper inquiry made. It is obvious that he himself could not make the necessary personal investigation. I have no desire to oppose the Government on this matter, but I should like the Minister to look into it, in order to satisfy himself as to whether some provision for appeal should be made. If an appeal is to be allowed it is desirable that it should be to a magistrate rather than to the Minister. </para>

          <para>. - I am amazed at the attitude adopted by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> in regard to the very reasonable amendment moved by the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Frost).</inline> One would think that the Minister knew nothing about the trials and tribulations of primary producers. One might expect such hostility from the honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lane)</inline> and other honorable members who have no sympathy whatever for the primary producers in respect of the bureaucratic control sometimes practised by boards of this kind. We know that there are circumstances in which the members of the board may, for personal or others reasons, decide to recommend to the Minister the cancellation of a certain grower&#39;s licence. Surely there is no reason why the right of appeal to an impartial tribunal should not be given to the grower against such a decision of the board. In the consideration of this measure honorable members are indebted to the honorable member for Franklin for giving to us the benefit of his many years of practical experience as a fruit-grower. I feel sure that he will be able to give us some instances of victimization that have, occurred in the past, following outspoken criticism of the administration by a board. I do not want the matter left to the Minister. The right should be reserved to the grower to appeal to a  police or stipendiary magistrate against decisions of the board. I am satisfied that if that were done the grower would receive impartial consideration of his case. We may be perfectly satisfied as to the impartiality of the present Minister, but, it is quite possible that we shall not get the same sympathetic consideration from his successor. I cannot understand opposition to the amendment from members of the Country party. </para>

          <para>.- I was rather surprised to hear the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> talking as he did of appeals against the decision of the board. I am even surprised that the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Frost)</inline> should suggest that there should be an appeal from the decision of the board to a police, stipendiary or special magistrate. Consideration of this bill reveals that in order to appease the desires of the fruit-growers a board is to be appointed, on which representatives from practically every State will be appointed. Tasmania is to have four representatives, Victoria two, New South Wales one, Queensland one and Western Australia two. Provision has also been made for the appointment of representatives of exporters. Why does the honorable member for Franklin doubt the integrity of a board which is to be elected by the growers? It is presumed that the growers will elect fair-minded men of sound judgment. Nearly all primary producers are very fair minded, except -when they come to this Parliament asking for bounties. Before this bill was drafted the then Assistant Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> travelled through the States and sought the opinion of the growers, and it is presumed that the bill represents what the growers themselves want. -I am unable to understand why the honorable member for Franklin should doubt the ability of the board to test the credibility of witnesses who may appear before it. in connexion with some misdemeanour by a grower which has led to the cancellation of his licence. 1 see no reason for hampering the administration of the board in the manner suggested by the honorable member. The board itself is eminently suited to deal with infringements by growers. It has been said that when a licence has been suspended by the board the grower has the right of appeal to the Minister </para>

            <para>- The grower will know thai immediately his licence is cancelled or withdrawn by the board the Minister will be called upon to adjudicate in the matter. Apparently, the honorable member for Franklin is not willing to trust the Minister, or the board. In this matter, he and those who support him are not doing justice to the people engaged in the industry. He has told us that Tasmanian fruit-growers are well served by the existing board, which is responsible for marketing arrangements on the mainland, and for the export of surplus fruit. My chief complaint is that the best of the Tasmanian fruit is not sent to the Sydney market. I feel sure  that  growers  in  Western Australia will not approve of the amendment and I hope  that it will not  be carried. </para>

          <para>.- The object of the bill is to assist the apple and pear industry, and in order to do this it has been decided to set up a hoard comprising growers and exporters nf apples and pears. Fu less the proposed board be armed with the necessary powers it will not function properly, and it is essential that the grower? should have some protection against possible misunderstanding or victimization. The board, as has been pointed out. will not lightly cancel a grower&#39;s or nui exporter&#39;s licence, lt will do so only if it is convinced that there has been a contravention of the regulations. Under the amendment a police or stipendiary magistrate will be vested with more power than will be possessed by the board itself, and there is nothing to indicate on what ground the court may reverse the decision of the board. A police magistrate may have his own opinion on the board&#39;s policy. </para>

            <para>- That is so. I agree that some measure of protection is necessary for the grower or for the exporter who may lose his licence and, as a result, may suffer great monetary loss, if not actual 7&#39;u 111. Therefore, the Minister should determine whether or nut a licence should be restored. As the clause stands he has not that power. He may be convinced that a grower or exporter has been victimized, but unless the board recommends the restoration of a cancelled licence, the Minister will be powerless. I suggest further consideration of sub-clause  4  which should be amended in order to give the Minister wider authority. The elimination of the words &#34;on report by the board &#34; would meet the case, because the clause would then give the grower the privilege of a direct appeal to the Minister. I give notice of my intention  to  move  for the re-committal of  the clause at a later stage. </para>

Always, when marketing legislation relating to other primary industries has been under consideration, the strongest arguments against the appointment of boards has been that they might lead to political control, whereas the intention has been to give producer control to the industry concerned.

            <para>- I suppose that is always possible, because it is unthinkable that in a parliament constituted as is this one, a Minister must necessarily adopt the recommendation of a board. We have had a good deal of experience with respect to the refusal to grant a licence, to guideus in these matters, because there are five different export boards already similar in their constitution, with powers almost identical with those proposed in regard to this board. Two of them have been operating for fourteen years, and two others for some nine or ten years. In no case that has come to my knowledge has this power beenabused in any way. What right havewe to assume that the power will be abused in connexion with the apple and pear industry, when no wrong advantage has been taken of it in connexion with the dairying, dried fruits, canned fruits, wine and meat industries? </para>

            <para>- That relates to entirely different matters, which are dealt with under sub-clause 1. I cannot for the life of me see the necessity for this proposal. It seems to me that, in bringing it forward, the assumption has been drawn that an exporter may be unjustly prevented from obtaining a licence. I cannot imagine such a situation arising. I can only conceive of an exporter being refused a. licence after he had actually contravened the provisions of the act. If we are to give a police or stipendiary magistrate the power to override the stipulated conditions, we might as well not pass the bill, because its objects could be nullified by such action. I am entirely opposed to the amendment as drafted. </para>

I can recall a very interesting evening spent in this chamber during the last period of the session, in debating that very point.

            <para>- If the honorable member will refer to the debate on the national health and pensions insurance legislation, he will find several such instances cited.

        <para>The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> has made some very pertinent references to political control. I believe that every one who is in opposition to the Government in this matter will concede that one of the objects of this measure is some kind of uniform administration for the benefit of the apple and pear industry. If there is to be uniformity in the administration of the law, it stands to reason that there must be one authority to make decisions. Two authorities are provided for in the clause aa it. stands, first the Apple and Pear Export Board, and secondly, the Minister. The honorable member for Franklin has suggested that any dissatisfied person should have the right of appeal to different classes of magistrates in any State. If there were 24 appeals there might be decisions by eighteen different magistrates, on a variety of grounds, all of which might be wrong. I believe that the honorable members for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> and Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn)</inline> will concede that there is nothing infallible about the decisions of police and stipendiary magistrates in our courts of law; the higher courts are cluttered up with appeals from their decisions on what ought to be fairly simple matters for determination. </para>
        <para>Then there is the manner in which licences should be suspended or cancelled. I cannot understand why honorable mem bers who are in opposition to the Government can read sub-clauses 3, 4 and 5 without coming to one decision. Subclause 3 lays it down that if certain contraventions of the act or regulations take place a fine not exceeding &#163;100 may be imposed. That penalty can not be imposed by either the Minister or the board, but only by a court of law. Consequently, before there can be any question of the restoration of the licence, one of two things must happen - either, the offending exporter must have been convicted in a court of law of some offence against the act or regulations, or - as I have seen in several cases - the person concerned must have admitted to the authorities that he had been guilty of a breach of the act or regulations. I remember a couple of cases in which certain persons had admitted to the Commonwealth that they had offended against the regulations, as the result of which their licences were suspended for a period. There was no question of an appeal to law; they did not want to go into court and have their offence published to- the world. As drafted, this measure provides for a number of contingencies in a manner which will be for the benefit of the exporters; those provisions have not been mentioned by honorable members. As the honorable member for Gippsland has said, we should be well advised not to make alterations to the bill without knowing exactly what might happen. </para>

          <para>.- The Minister is only partly right in regard to convictions. Under the Commerce Act there is the right of appeal to a customs officer in the State, or to a court of law. A grower knows that when he has had convictions recorded against him by inspectors, he has very little chance of winning an appeal in a court of law. </para>

            <para>- If an inspector wishes to victimize a grower, he can do so. I have been associated with this trade for a number of years. At one annual fruit, conference in Hobart, in, I think, 1933 or 1.934, 1 had a good deal to say in criticism of the inspection of fruit, which at that time was fairly bad. When I  left the conference, seven or eight growers from the Huon fruit-growing district said to me, &#34; Change your brand &#34;. When I asked why I should do sothey replied, &#34; Change it next year, or you will get &#39; copped &#39; &#34;. I said, &#34; What do you mean &#34; ? and was told, &#34; They will have a conviction against you if you do not change your brand. We agree with e very word that you have said to-day, but you will be victimized next year &#34;.I said I do not care whether they victimize me or not, I am going through with it &#34;. In the following year I made about 40 shipments. In the first boat I shipped 100 bushels of Ripston Pippins. The packer had packed 107 bushels, and asked whether he would ship the lot. I. replied, &#34;No, we are restricted to 100 bushels; send only that quantity&#39;&#34;. That shipment was passed. On the following day I proposed to ship 93 bushels of another variety, and to make up the balance with the seven bushels of Ripston Pippins that had been left over, but the seven bushels were condemned. In the middle of the season I submitted 80 bushels of Cleopatras, and was told that they were of irregular size. I rang the inspector, who toldme there was not a blemish on the fruit but that some were larger than others. That was the second conviction. While on an election campaign, a further 93 bushels were packed, with an additional seven bushels of Democrats to make up the shipment, but the seven bushels were rejected. The authorities were determined that the three convictions which must precede a penalty should he recorded against me. When I returned home after the campaign I decided to have my case tried by the Collector of Customs. When that officer had heard the evidence of my grower and packers, ho said, &#34; It seems strange that you were convicted on that&#34;. The seven eases had not been touched ; they were still in the lorryman&#39;s sheds. They had been picked out of 200 bushels. I issued the challenge, &#34;I will drive you in my car to the orchard, and if you can find one apple affected with black spot in the 200 bushels I shall give the lot to charity&#34;. That challenge was not accepted, and I was fined &#163;1. If a grower stands on his rights, he does not always get justice. The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> has referred to a number of other boards. Those that he mentioned deal not with a perishable product but with an article that can be kept. Once fruit has been taken off the wharf, it cannot be reinspected. Other growers have told me that they have been harassed in the same manner. Last year, certain growers who had been convicted seven or eight times were not fined, although I had been. Other growers with seven or eight convictions were not even questioned. Yet it is contended that there is no risk of injustice. </para>

            <para>- The Department of Commerce has never had the power to cancel a licence in the past, but this measure provides statutory power for cancellation under certain conditions. Any man who criticizes the inspection of fruit can be victimized. There is sufficient power to enable the authorities to prevent a grower from exporting his fruit, and thus ruin him. I can produce letters from leading fruit brokers in Great Britain, informing me that I had obtained the best prices for my fruit. My averages have carried me through for the last 30 years. I have a good name on the English market, because I send only  good fruit there, yet I have been victimized by the officials. I trust that the committee will agree to the amendment, and thus give the grower an opportunity to prove the justice of his case. If it could be proved that a mau had been contravening the act by shipping bad fruit, he would not appeal, but if his conviction were merely for the purpose of victimization because he had aired his views at fruit conferences, or had aroused the antagonism of inspectors, he should have the opportunity to get redress. </para>

            <para>- He could be tried in a court, of law, the maximum penalty provided being &#163;100. The honorable member for Franklin asks the committee to do an extraordinary thing. He does not suggest that an exporter who is dissatisfied should have the right of appeal to a court of law against refusal of a licence, but he asks for the right of appeal to a police, stipendiary, or special magistrate against the refusal or failure of the board to recommend the issue to him of a licence, which is an entirely different thing. If a person had been refused a licence by the Minister, I could understand honorable members opposite arguing in favour of the right of appeal to another tribunal, but I cannot see justification for the right of appeal against the board&#39;s failure to recommend the granting of a licence. I am afraid that this is a matter which the committee will have to decide by vote. </para>

I repeat that a licence could not be originally issued without the authority of the board, and, having been taken away on the board&#39;s recommendation, it could not be re-issued without the board&#39;s authority. The amendment would make possible an appeal to override the decision of the board. Not one  member  who has spoken has disagreed with the view that there should be a right, of appeal; the difference of opinion is only as to the way in which that right should  bc  exercised. The honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lane)</inline> said that the exporter could appeal to the Minister. I point out that, according to sub-clauses 4 and 5, an appeal could be successful to the Minister only if the board had made a recommendation accordingly. </para>

The honorable member for Gippsland thought that, if the Minister had the right to veto a decision of the board, it would give rise to the suggestion of political interference; but, even if the Minister acted with the consent of the board, political control would be possible. The decision would ultimately come from the Minister, although as the result of a recommendation by the board. Regulations are made by the GovernorGeneral, yet, in practice, the Minister would act on the recommendation of the board in framing the regulations, and probably 90 per cent, of them would originate from the board. </para>

            <para>- Undoubtedly, a very large proportion of the regulations would be based on the board&#39;s recommendations to the Minister. The board would decide whether an offence sufficient to warrant a cancellation of a licence had been committed, and, in the event of an appeal against such a cancellation, the Minister would have no voice in the matter until the board had reversed its own previous decision. The honorable member for Gippsland regards it as unthinkable that a recommendation of the board would not be acceptable to the Minister, because the board is to be representative of the growers; but I think that the honorable member will admit that the all-important question of export  quotas  is of vastly greater moment to the growers in the various States than is the withdrawal of a single licence. And provision is made in sub-clause 6 for reference to an arbitrator where the board is not unanimous in its decision regarding quantities and quotas for export. This seems to undermine the idea that the board would be infallible. The only appeal provided in the bill for a person who may have been victimized is one from Caesar to Caesar, and I claim for the grower elementary justice. As the honorable member for Franklin pointed out, the holder of a licence might be a grower and an exporter who depended for his livelihood entirely on the production of fruit for export. If he were denied the right to export his produce, we might as well drive him off his orchard. Even a person who is fined 5s. in a police court or is ordered to be imprisoned until the rising of the court, for drunkenness or riotous behaviour, is not denied the right of appeal against his conviction. Therefore, in a matter in which a fruit exporter&#39;s whole livelihood is at stake, he should not be denied the right of appeal against the cancellation of his licence. Every honorable member who lias spoken admits the simple justice of this contention, and the honorable member for Franklin merely asks that an outside authority, with no axe to grind, such as a police, .stipendiary, or special magistrate, should be called in to adjudicate in the event of an appeal. Yet, on n far more important matter, that of quotas, an outside arbitrator is to be appointed. Surely, if it is right that in respect of the great body of growers the right of appeal should he recognized, the same measure of justice should not be denied to the individual grower who may fall foul of the board. </para>

          <para>.- I agree in large measure with the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> on this matter, and I give notice that I shall move an amendment providing that the suspension or cancellation of the licence for which provision is made in sub-clause 4 shall be after consultation with, and not on the recommendation of, the board. I maintain that the growers should not be required to go before a. magistrate. Probably they would have to employ a lawyer, and before they knew where, they were they would find themselves in an unholy mess. I have prosecuted before the courts for many years, and I know that you can get more justice outside courts than inside them. With all due respect to the legal fraternity, I believe that the method of round-table conferences away from lawyers and magistrates altogether is the better way. I do not propose to follow the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Frost)</inline> into all the details of his experiences with the export authorities. My opinion, however, is that if he packed fruit of the wrong size, contrary to the regulations, he deserved to be prosecuted. The grower is not the only person to be protected. The public also, and the good name of this country, must be protected. As for the other incidents which the honorable member related, I believe that if he reported to the proper authorities the inspector responsible they would very soon be able to learn whether the man was a fool or not. </para>

          <para>.- The scope of the amendment of the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Frost)</inline> seems to be over-estimated by some members of the committee. The bill provides, first, for the licensing of the grower who desires to export. Without a licence he cannot export. That licence is to be given to him by the Minister, or by the Minister&#39;s  Deputy,  on the recommendation of the board, and no principles are laid down for the guidance of the board. It is not told upon what principle it is to grant licences, and yet, apparently, there is no legal right in the grower to obtain a licence. Under the legislation relating to the waterside workers, it has been held by the High Court that the waterside worker has a right to be granted a licence, and, having been granted one, has the right to have it renewed. That ruling is based on the language of the act, but the language of this bill is different. It is not the intention of the Government, as expressed in this hill, to give every grower a legal right to obtain a licence. </para>

            <para>- Apparently so. In this bill, however, we have more than the word &#34;may&#34;.* The licence is to be granted on the recommendation of the board. Therefore, if the board does not recommend the granting of a licence the Minister cannot grant it, and the bill &#34; contains nothing to guide the board in the making of recommendations. The board may capriciously refuse to grant a licence, and the applicant will have no remedy. The only appeal which tha amendment of the honorable member for Franklin provides is an appeal against the refusal to grant a first application for a licence. If a grower applies for a licence, and the board refuses to recommend that it be granted, lie may appeal from the recommendation, and there will then be an examination of the facts. If a magistrate, after hearing the facts, recommends that a licence be granted, the magistrate&#39;s recommendation is to have the same effect as if the board had made the recommendation, and the Minister may act upon it. It is not suggested that there shall he an appeal from the Minister. The Minister does not investigate; he merely acts upon the recommendation of the board. </para>

        <para>So much for the first application, but there is a later stage. A man in possession of a licence may have that licence suspended or cancelled. In this regard, principles are laid down for the guidance of the board. The board will not recommend the suspension or cancellation of a licence unless it reports that the licensee has contravened or failed to comply with the prescribed conditions and restrictions. The board has to find certain things before it can recommend the suspension or cancellation of a licence. The honorable member&#39;s amendment does not propose an appeal from the cancellation or suspension of a licence. He may have intended it to provide for that, but it. does not, in fact, do so. All that it does is to provide for an appeal against the refusal of an original application for a licence. </para>

            <para>- That refers to the special power given to the Minister to issue a fresh licence to a man whose previous licence had, on the report of the hoard, been suspended or cancelled. That makes it clear to me that the original application is regarded as quite distinct from any later application. It seems undesirable to leave the grower at the mercy of the board in the first instance. He should have the right to continue in the business he was in before the passing of the act, and he will &#93;10t have that right as the clause now stands. The board should not be given unrestricted power to refuse a licence, without which a grower cannot carry on the business of exporting. It is not suggested that wo should disturb the power of the board to recommend the suspension or cancellation of a licence, because in that case the board must report certain facts against the grower. The Minister will have the report before him, and the Minister will probably be in a better position than a police magistrate would bc to examine the matter. I agree with those who say that they would rather trust to the discretion of the Minister than to  n  police magistrate, who would be unfamiliar with the matter. Some provision, however, should be made to protect the grower in the absence of an appeal against the refusal of the board to recommend a licence in the first instance. I am sure that it was never the intention of the Government to give to the board power arbitrarily to deprive any man of the right to carry on his liv ing, and to export his goods. 1 suggest to the Minister that if he is not satisfied with the clause as it is drawn, he should let it pass now, and have it revised later. He should give an undertaking to thi committee to have the matter reconsidered, and a suitable provision inserted, when the bill is before the Senate, to provide against the arbitrary refusal of the board to recommend the granting of a licence. </para>

            <para>- In any case, I cannot conceive of a board, consisting of sixteen representatives of whom eleven will represent the growers themselves, taking up the attitude which honorable members opposite suggest will be the natural outcome of entrusting anything to it. I am amazed at the stand taken up by the Opposition in respect of this clause. In the second-reading debate and in this committee, honorable members generally have eulogized the Government for bringing down this measure, many contending that this legislation should have been enacted years ago. Now. apparently, honorable members opposite wish to shear the board of the power to do the very things which they suggested  it should have done. With few exceptions, honorable members opposite, including the honorable member for Bourke, who were in Opposition some years ago when a similar bill was put through this Parliament, will remember that, in the debate which took place on that occasion, the question of  whether  or not an exporter should be licensed was not raised. 1 cannot recall any discussion as to whether there should be a right of appeal on the part of any one who was refused a licence. . On this point, I refer honorable members to the Meat Export Control Act 1935, section 17 of which provides - </para>

            <para>- Quite a number. I am of opinion that, if there had been any appeal against this board, honorable members opposite would have been very vocal on the subject before now.  But  that board has functioned satisfactorily. The Wine Export Control Board provides another case in point. As a lifelong  Rechabite  I, as Minister, have signed dozens of licences authorizing persons to export wine, but I have not heard of one case of an appeal or complaint against any decision by the Minister, although there have been some cases in which things were done which should not have been done. No complaint has been made in this House concerning the operations of the Wine Export Control Board. Neither do I know of any complaint having arisen in respect of the boards dealing with the export of dried fruits, canned fruits and dairy produce. Evidently, honorable members opposite are forgetting the date; apparently, they think to-day is last Saturday, the 5th November. </para>

          <para>.- There <inline font-style="italic">ave</inline> two answers to the Minister&#39;s contention. The first is that in respect of the meat export control legislation. No exception was taken to the absence of provision for appeal, whereas exception is now being taken in connexion with this bill, and having been taken on this  occasion  it should be considered. The second answer is that provisions of the. two measures on this point differ. It is not a condition of licence under the meat export control legislation that the hoard shall recommend the granting of a licence, whereas under this measure the Minister cannot license a person except, on the board&#39;s recommendation.

            <para>- What the Minister has told us may be the practice of the department, but it is not the provision of the section. The committee has been asked to decide whether or not there should be an appeal; I believe that there should be some form of appeal. I do not think that the Minister should be pinned down to say whether or not he will accept the amendment, but if he cannot see his way clear to accept it now I suggest that he should give an undertaking that the matter will be further considered and dealt with in the Senate. If after mature consideration the Government thinks that there should not be an appeal, that will be so much worse for the growers; if the bill is passed as drawn it will leave persons who desire to export fruit at the mercy of the board in a. way in which people who desire to export meat do not suffer. I should imagine that the number of persons desiring to export meat are very few ; probably they are confined to persons who are in business in a large way. On the other hand persons who will most likely desire to export fruit are in business in a small way, and are fairly numerous. </para>

        <para>Briefly, my amendment is designed to ensure that as far as is reasonably possible insurance cover of shipments of fruit under this legislation shall be effected by organizations operating in Australia, and there shall not be what will amount, in effect, to the export of capital to overseas organizations for the purpose of effecting this insurance. The principle underlying my amendment is fully in line with the policy not only of the Government, to give preference as far as practicable to Australian enterprises, but also of the Opposition. It is not intended that British organizations should be excluded, because many of these organizations are carrying on business in Australia. They will be able to continue to do business in the ordinary way. Neither is it intended that a lot of fresh business should be, received by insurance organizations. What is intended is that their existing business shall be protected as far as practicable.In the past some of the boards established under Commonwealth legislation have placed their insurance business outside the Commonwealth. The Dried Fruits Board is an exception : ithas retained its insurance business in Australia. It might be suggested that the reason why business has gone overseas is that the premium quoted has been somewhat lower. Probably that has been the case, butI point out that businesses operating in Australia are paying Australian wages and employing Australians as well as paying taxes to Australian governments. </para>

My reply to the interjection of the honorable member forRiverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nock)</inline> is that the Minister would have power to say finally where the insurance should be placed. If the local companies wished to impose an excessive rate the Minister would be able to permit the business to be given to overseas organizations. Business of this kind should go to the organizations operating in Australia if their premiums are satisfactory, and the Australian companies should have the oppotunity to compete for the business. </para>

          <para>. -  I shall be glad to hear the views of honorable members of the committee on this amendment. Personally I am not at all enthusiastic about the proposal. The export control boards already operating deal with insur ance at their discretion. That, I suggest, is proper. If these authorities are to be set up they should be given a reasonable measure of control. Several strong arguments may be advanced against the amendment. One is that many of the British insurance companies are operating in Australia and so will be in a position to tender for the business. As the honorable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nock)</inline> has suggested by interjection, the money to pay these insurance premiums will be provided by the fruit-growers, and they are, therefore, entitled to make the best arrangements possible. I have not heard any protests about the procedure adopted by our existing export control boards, although it varies. The Dried Fruits Export Control Board, as the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> has stated, does its insurance business mainly with companies operating in Australia. But the Dairy Export Control Board let a three-year contract last December, at a very low rate, to a company not operating in Australia. It must be remembered that wo are dealing with an export product, which will be consumed overseas, chiefly in Great Britain. In most cases these products are bought before they leave our coast and are carried abroad in British ships. The Government is not likely to <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> insulted if honorable members carry the proposal of the honorable member for Fawkner, but personally I cannot see that any particularly beneficial purpose will be served by inserting such a provision in the bill. </para>

            <para>-It would practically amount to that. The honorable member desires to eliminate outside competition. May I remind him that the British public is buying  5,000,000  bushels of Australian apples each year. The growing of this fruit provides a very much larger amount of employment throughout  this country than is provided by the insurance companies In those circumstances, the British insurance compa nies are untitled at least to the right to tender for the insurance business that the Apple and Pear Board may have to place. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.&#93;</inline> It would be entirely wrong for us to exclude the British insurance companies from any possibility of sharing in this insurance business. Moreover, it might lead to serious misunderstandings. The Australian primary producers value very highly their entree to the privileged British market. The British people spend about &#163;1,275,000 a year in buying Australian fruit, yet the honorable member for Fawkner desires virtually to exclude the British insurance companies from participation in the insurance business connected with the export of this fruit. To take such a course would be to damage seriously our prestige on the British market. If we expect the British people to buy our fruit we ought surely to be willing to give them a share, at a competitive rate, in the insurance business. We cannot properly compare our primary producing industries, which have to rely so largely upon the export market, with our manufacturing industries which do practically all their business on the Australian market. We should give the Apple and Pear Board a free hand to deal with such matters as insurance as it desires. If the premiums of the overseas companies are satisfactory the board should be in a position to place the business with them. If they are not satisfactory, of course the business will go to the companies operating in Australia. The Australian companies have not earned the right to any special consideration from us. It seems to me that the honorable member&#39;s amendment is. in effect, merely a devious method of securing additional business for the Australian insurance companies at the expense of the unfortunate fruit-growers. I am astonished that such an amendment should have been moved, and I hope that it will be defeated. The bill was designed to further the interests of the industry and to protect the fruit-growers, not to impose additional costs on the growers; yet that would be the effect of this amendment, if carried. </para>

            <para>- They now have the privilege of effecting their insurance wherever they like, and that freedom of choice should be retained. If a virtual monopoly be given to the Australian insurance companies, what guarantee is there that the premiums will remain at the existing rates? So long as we have an effective check on the abuses&#39; associated with monopolies, there is a fair guarantee that premiums will remain reasonable. All that the opponents of the amendment urge is that there shall be an open market in insurance. I am amazed that, in order to help the Australian insurance companies, an honorable member should ask us to incur the risk of antagonizing our best customers. To fasten the cost of this procedure on the growers of Australian apples and pears would be most iniquitous. I hope that the amendment: will be rejected. </para>

          <para>.- The fruit-growers of Tasmania have always been satisfied with the Australian insurance companies and have been able to obtain from them the cover they desire. Insurance is paid only in the event of loss of the vessel carrying the fruit, or loss of the fruit itself. Nothing is paid by way of compensation for fruit lost by rotting. Consequently the premiums are &#39;low. The honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> evidently considers that it is necessary that the consignments should be insured in Australia, but I cannot understand the argument of the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> that the people in Great Britain, whom he describes as our best customers, may wish the insurance to be effected there. Practically every insurance company operating in Australia is connected with a company operating in Great Britain. For instance, the Prudential Company, which operates in Australia, is associated with the British Prudential Company. Premium rates would not be any lower if the insurances were effected in Great Britain. Indeed, if attempts were made to effect insurances in Great Britain the companies there would probably advise growers to deal with their agents in Australia. I cannot see that any embarrassment would be caused by accepting the amendment, and therefore I shall support it. </para>

          <para>.- The proposal of the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> is merely a safeguard. It will not exclude any British company.  His  amendment reads - </para>

        <para class="block">The honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> said that if the amendment were carried British companies would be excluded, but that is not so. Insurance could still be effected with cither Australian or British companies approved by the Minister. All that is asked for is that if the board, for any reason whatever, desires to take out an insurance policy with a company other than one operating in Australia, the approval of the Minister must first be obtained. Many British insurance companies are operating in Australia. It is desirable to give every possible encouragement to insurance companies functioning in Australia, for they give employment in this country and assist Australia&#39;s finances. Overseas companies do not employ Australians, nor do many of them invest money in this country. There is no prohibition whatever in the proposal; it is merely a safeguard. Should special circumstances exist, no difficulty would be experienced in obtaining the approval of the Minister to effect the insurance with a company outside Australia. I hope that the amendment will be earned. </para>

          <para>.- I am astonished at the statement of the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> that the amendment merely provides a safeguard. Far from being a safeguard it is, in my opinion, a menace. At the present time the apple and fruit growing industry is in a most precarious position. Its export market is con fined almost entirely to the United Kingdom, and it is an open secret that tremendous pressure is being brought to bear upon the &#39; Government of that country to enter into a trade agreement with another country which produces large quantities of fruit. I do not know what the members of the trade delegation did when in England recently, but if they did their job properly they tried to preserve a market there for Australian apples and pears. <inline font-style="italic">lt</inline> would be disastrous to offer a gratuitous insult to the people from whom we are asking a favour. It has been suggested that it would be an act of patriotism to confine this business to companies operating in Australia, but actually the companies most concerned are English companies which believe that they would be able to gain an advantage over their competitors if they could get the ear of the Minister. It is unwise to do anything which might imperil an industry already in difficulties. This legislation has not by any means the unanimous support of the industry, for there are many growers of fruit who regard it as a form of nationalization of their industry. If  Ave  are to set up a board to deal with this industry,  Ave  should he prepared to trust  it in  the matter of insurance. As has been pointed out, the industry has been in difficulties for some years, and with rising costs, returns are small.. In fact, many growers have lost money during recent years. The suggestion that the hoard which is to control the industry should not have the power to effect savings by arranging wholesale insurances, merits the greatest indignation and condemnation by the industry. I realize that the honorable and learned member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> has been carried away by the fact that his amendment has been suggested to him as having some relation to the protective system of Australia, but  ho,\  &#34; knocking back &#34; one insurance company in Great Britain in favour of another can have anything to do with our protective system, I do not know. If there has been one proposition on  which  this committee has been unanimous, it is that everything should be done to give representation on the board to the  growers  It would not be right to take away the  board&#39;s  powers. The Dairy Produce Export Control Board has been able to effect a saving in insurance rates, and are we to prevent the Apple and Pear Board from doing likewise? The proposal is fantastic and most dangerous. </para>

          <para>.- The proposal contained in the amendment moved by the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt),</inline> which would force exporters to insure with Australian companies, is one of the most extraordinary that I have heard in my long experience in this Parliament. Those who are behind it cannot realize the value of our export trade, and what damage could be done to that trade by legislation which contained a provision of the sort provided for in the amendment. If the amendment were carried, the fact would soon be published in England that restrictions were being placed in Australia on British insurance businesses. Many of the companies which are concerned in the export of apples and pears are English companies and they would naturally wish to insure with their own people. Our export trade is difficult enough in the circumstances which exist to-day; acceptance of this amendment would increase the difficulties.From time to time the Commonwealth Government has come to the assistance of apple and  pear  exporters with bounties on export, because as the result of increased costs, the export trade has not been profitable; but it is essential that the trade should be developed, and any action likely to have repercussions in England against the sale of our fruit should be avoided. Not so long ago there was in England what amounted to a boycott of Australian butter.  There  must be no repetition of that, if we can avoid it. Nothing must be done which might result in the English people giving preference to American and other apples and pears over Australian fruit. Do honorable members realize that our trade in apples and pears with the United Kingdom is worth about &#163;1,500,000 per annum and that that money circulates in Australia and provides employment for 6,500 persons at an average income of &#163;200 a year, while the employment of those 6,500 persons provides occupations for at least 2,000 or 3,000 more? It would be madness to pass legis lation which contained provisions of the sort contained in the amendment. Anything that would tend to destroy our trade in apples or pears, or at any rate, increase the costs which the trade has to bear, should be discouraged. </para>

          <para>.- There is a good deal in what has been said by the honorable members for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony),</inline> Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> and Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fairbairn),</inline> in regard to this matter of preference to Australian insurance companies. It would be natural that Australian insurance companies should have preference provided there was no unreasonable margin over the rates of the English companies. The more business we have in government and the less government we have in business, the better for industry generally, and if, in order to assist industry, a board is brought into existence, the producers should be given control, and it is better that there should be as little governmental interference as possible either in chartering or insurance. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.&#93;</inline></para>

            <para>In  March of this year, it came to the notice of the Civil Aviation Board that ultra high frequency  receiving  equipment was being installed in the DC3 <inline font-style="italic">Ky illa.</inline> As the board&#39;s approval was necessary under the Air Navigation Regulations before radio could be installed, instructions were issued for this installation tobe suspended pending the necessary authority. On the 18th March, 1938. a request was received from the installing engineer to allow installation to proceed to enable certain tests to be undertaken in connexion with the installation of the beacon at Brisbane. This was approved by the hoard on the 21st March, 1938. Apparently, no action was taken to instal the equipment at that time as a further request was made on the11th May, 1938, to allow installation to be made on the 14th May, 1938. This also was approved  on  the 12th May, 1938, and it is believed such installation was made shortly afterwards. </para>

            <para>An application was made by the Government of New South Wales in 1 936 for assistance towards the cost of construction of the Sandy Hollow-Mary vale railway line, but Cabinet decided that, in view of other more urgent aspects of national defence, it would not be practicable for the Commonwealth Government to make a contribution towards the construction of the line. The position has not changed since 1936 and, although the railway line in question would he a valuable link in railway communication, it is not a strategic necessity for the concentration or maintenance of troops, as these operations can bo effected by existing lines in close proximity, even though a little longer time is involved. </para>
