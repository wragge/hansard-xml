                        <para>- Immediately after the signing of the armistice, all contracts made with the Imperial Government for the supply of Australian canned meats terminated. Having regard to the further fact that the present contract for the supply of frozen meat will expire three months after the termination of the war, will the. Minister for Trade and Customs tell the House what steps are being taken to enter into fresh contracts for the supply of both canned and frozen meat to meet the requirements of&#39; Great Britain and other countries, and at the same time to overcome the abnormal conditions at present existing in Australia? &#39; </para>

We have endeavoured, also, to obtain a share of the contracts for the supply of canned meat to other parts of Europe. The frozen meat contract has engaged the attention of the Government for some time. I hope to be able to make a further announcement in regard to the matter after we have had a chance of- consulting the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> with whom we have been, in communication. </para>

                            <para>- The contracts are to be completed. They were too advanced to permit of cancellation. Some of these vessels have been sold, and negotiations are in progress for the sale of the others. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Larkin</inline>  have had consultations in regard to this matter, and I think that six of the ships have been sold. I hope at an early date to be able to tell the House exactly the position. Necessarily there will be a considerable loss by the Commonwealth, for the honorable member must have read a cable which was published in the newspapers last week, and which set out that the American Government had sold sixty of their wooden ships for &#163;21 or &#163;22 per ton. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member asks me generally about the weirs. May I make a statement which will perhaps cover the present position ? The works authorized at the present time are the construction of the Mitta Mitta storage scheme at the head of the river; the Lake Victoria scheme for South Australia, at the lower portion; and also the Torrumbarry weir, which is well on its way. In addition, lock No. 1, at Blanchetown, is well advanced. The lock walls are up, and the work is in a fairly advanced stage. Authority has also been given to construct lock and weir No. 2 and lock and weir No. 3, in South Australia; and also lock and weir No. 9, which is immediately below  Wentworth.  near Frenchman&#39;s Creek. This will be the means of supplying the Lake Victoria scheme. Those are the works that have been authorized to date; but, in addition, surveyors are now engaged in doing the survey work immediately above lock No. 9, that is, below Wentworth, with a view to determining the lower part of the weir, in the neighbourhood of Curlwaa, Merbein, and Mildura. They are pressing forward as fast as they can with those surveys. The constructing authorities of Victoria and New South Wales have sent in a request to us to put money on the Estimates for this year for the commencement of the locking in the neighbourhood of what might be called the middle portion of the Murray River, that is, in the neighbourhood of Mildura. The site cannot be definitely fixed until the surveys in that particular area are completed, but these are being expedited. </para>

The suggestion of the late instructor was to train only officers; but I think much more is required, because there should be some place where we could train, not only officers, but men, for this purpose. </para>

Owing to the recent sale of 1,500,000 tons of wheat in London, the local price, on the basis of the London parity, has been raised from 5s. to 5s. 6d. per bushel. The Government should, at least, undertake to bring up the price received by the local growers to 5s. 6d. per bushel in respect of the quantity recently sold. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to address a question to the Acting Leader of the House, having reference to the triumphal progress across Australia of the Right Honorable W. M. Hughes, P.O.,&#39; K.C. I desire to ask him if his attention has been directed to a report, most damaging to the Government, and indeed, to this country - which, I may hasten to say, I have no doubt is quite incorrect - namely, that the right honorable gentleman has signified his intention of adopting and supporting a policy of &#34; direct action &#34; on the part of soldiers in anything; they may do, excepting only murder and bigamy? Having regard to the fact that this statement, on the face of it, is incredible, I ask the Acting Leader of the House whether he will be good enough to obtain an official statement of what the Prime Minister actually said; and, if there is any truth in the report, whether he will ascertain why this invidious distinction has been made in regard to bigamy? </para>

                        <para>- It would be a source of gratification to the Prime Minister to know that every action he is taking is so sympathetically and so &#39; considerately watched by the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> ; and, in order that the honorable member may have first-&#39;hand knowledge of what the Prime Minister said, I ask him to place his question on the notice-paper on the first day on which the right honorable gentleman attends the House. I am sure he will get an answer most satisfying and convincing. However, I can only conclude that the honorable member is actuated . by jealousy. He has probably read in this morning&#39;s press the report of the demonstration which was accorded to the Prime Minister on his arrival at Kalgoorlie. </para>

                            remarked on Friday last that the most debatable principle in the Bill, and the one to which I would offer most strenuous opposition, is contained in clause 3, My objection Ho that clause is that it panders to the party-predominant spirit, and enables a Government to use its political powers for the purpose of admitting or rejecting immigrants, according as their (political views may be pleasing or offensive to the party in power for the time being, shall read that clause in so far as it extends the operation of the policy of exclusion, and is therefore to my mind objectionable. It proposes to amend section 3 of the principal Act by inserting after paragraph
                            <inline font-style="italic">gc</inline>
                            the following paragraphs -

                    <para class="block">These provisions will enable any Government to invest itself with a. discretionary power to deport persons on merely political grounds. I remark first of all the attention which is devoted to anarchists. One might have supposed that the Government would not forbear at least  a  passing reference to the cloven hoof of the Socialist,, whose class has served this Government, and many of its predecessors on several hard-fought political battlefields, as comprising those who are destined to bring Australia to ruin. I notice, too, that there is not more than an oblique reference to the hydra-headed representative of &#34; direct action,&#34; and only an indirect reference, if, indeed, that, to the Industrial Workers of the World organization, which has also served the political purposes of this Government, and many of its predecessors. I am not unmindful of the fact that the Government, although it does not specifically mention these abhorrent influences, takes to itself abundant powers in the exercise of its discretion to exclude from this country any person whose political views are displeasing to it. </para>

                    <para>Our friend the anarchist has received a little passing attention in the Bill. I do not know why. For the last sixty years, I should, say we have not been without an anarchist in Australia. I think we have always had a few, and, although it may seem something of a paradox, I venture to say that the anarchist has been one of the most law-abiding- citizens we have had. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> , who has introduced this Bill is, I am. sure, sufficiently widely read on the subject to recall that probably the most influential anarchist that ever lived was the philosophic Proudhon, who based his philosophic and amiable anarchy upon the teachings of that right-thinking and well-known English writer on political ethics, Adam Smith, as well as upon those of Hegel. </para>
                    <para>I may say at once that I am not an anarchist, and do not believe that there is any anarchical movement in this country worth this special mention in the Bill ; but since I am challenged to say anything in defence of anarchy, I venture to tell the Minister who has set out in the Bill that an anarchist is not fit to associate with a respectable Government, that, on the whole, in the history of civilized countries, the record of anarchy has been -cleaner than the record of law. </para>

                            <para>- That might be done. I repeat that the records of anarchy in all civilized countries is cleaner than the record of law. It is true that in the name of anarchy - more often in the name of Nihilism and other &#34;isms&#34; associated in one way or another with anarchy - crimes of violence have taken place. Here and there crowned heads, and heads that hoped to be crowned&#39;, have been suddenly and unceremoniously struck off. Every one knows that, on general principles I am opposed to violence on moral grounds as well as on the ground of expediency. But it has to be said in favour of those who have been guilty of these crimes of violence, that&#34; if ever there was a justification for the exercise of violence it can be proved that in respect of the great majority of such crimes attributed to anarchists in connexion with ruling personages, the vices and the mischiefs which they sought to correct were of such a far-reaching character that, although there might have been a breach of law and order, there was at least a deliberate and sincere attempt to remove crushing abuses from people <inline font-style="italic">who</inline> had laboured under them only too long. I leave the condemned anarchist with the remark that I feel sure that the Minister in introducing him here was guilty of the mild offence of persiflage, aud if I may employ an overworked phrase of doubtful origin - also of camouflage. </para>

                    <para>I come now to another matter. The &#34; person &#34; to . be excluded in this case is one who advocates the overthrow of established government by force. Very curious consequences flow from this provision. The first and the most startling is that under it we must necessarily brand as an undesirable immigrant any person who came here five years ago advocating the overthrow &#39;by force of that &#39;highly organized Prussian despotism at the head of which was the Kaiser. Surely the Minister will not deny that that was an organized government, and even a civilized government. Surely after four- years of war he will not deny that some measures were justified for the purpose of overthrowing by force the Prussian system of government. If he does, then I remind him that the world has spent &#163;10,000,000,000 in a successful attempt to overthrow that highlyorganized form of government, which has been carried on in Prussia for so many years. Strange paradox as it may seem, even our returned soldiers might fairly be described as being undesirable immigrants within the meaning of this provision, being persons who had not only been favorable to the overthrow by force of an organized system of government, but who had taken a very active and . successful part in the overthrow of the organized government of the Kaiser. </para>
                    <para> Take the case of Russia. There we had a- country groaning under a military autocracy probably worse than that of Prussia which we have overthrown. Philosophic Radicals have been hunted out of that country for the last century or more for venturing, so it was said, to propound a policy for the overthrow by force of the established Government of Russia. Many of them, by the way, found am asylum in Britain. In due time the people of Russia uprose and overthrew that system of government by force. It is to our discredit - and this is a circumstance which we may pray speedily to forget - that we were associated in the early stages of the war with, the real head of the Russian military autocracy as our Ally. As the war progressed, however, other considerations led to the overthrow of that potentate and of the system of which for so many years he was the dishonoured head. Who will say that we are to close our doors to a man who comes here with no worse record than that he was favorable to the overthrow by arms or any other kind of force of one of the .most cruel military autocracies that has ever fastened itself upon an enslaved people? </para>
                    <para>I make one passing reference to Ireland, the country from which my own  ancestors came, and to which reference was made last week by the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine).</inline> I have said that I do not believe in a policy of bloodshed, however good the cause might be. But when we look at the history of Ireland, and recognise that for over 100 years she has laboured under a rule necessarily alien to her, that she has been afflicted by the fact that succeeding Governments have extended to her the promise of self-government within the Empire, and have wilfully, or in a spirit of cowardice, departed from that promise, I am inclined to think that if ever there was justification for the exercise of force in any country then Ireland, so long -as she is denied the right of self-government within the Empire, is justified in driving out any invading army, including the armies of Britain, by force of arms. Consequently, it follows that persons who come here as adherents to that principle should not be excluded from citizenship within the Commonwealth. It is very curious that the Government should set their faces so strongly against those who advocate a policy of force. Everybody knows that of all Australian Governments, the Commonwealth Government, through its head arid its members, are the great protagonists of force. Only a little while ago they laid themselves out to forcibly deport a large portion of our Australian population for military service on foreign soil. That was their theory of government. They attempted to seize large bodies of Australian manhood, and to send them abroad to fight. Yet Ministers now (profess to be so afraid of a policy of force that they would exclude from Australia any person who is favorable to the overthrow of organized government by means of force. </para>
                    <para>I come now to that part of the clause under which it is proposed to exclude our late enemies - (Germans, Austrians, Bulgarians, and Turks. In this particular provision the Ministry seek to give expression to that surplus of bitterness and vindictiveness to which we were unable to give expression during four horrible years of bloody conflict. In it they show their disbelief in, and  contempt  -for, the League of Nations. So far as we can do so, this provision is intended to make the world unsafe for Democracy, and not boo pleasant a place for anybody else. By this clause we &#34; do our hit &#34; to promote war and the bitterness of war after </para>
                    <para class="block">Peace. It was in connexion with this provision that the Minister for Home and Territories called upon the philosophy of the German poet, Schiller. I thank him for the inspiration which he has given me, because when I read this provision and think of Schiller, I naturally think that this philosopher accurately described the attitude of the present Government towards our late enemies when he spoke of the condemned soul in Tartarus, who &#34; yelled his wild curse from jaws that never close.&#34; In this clause the Government, after the  Avar  is over, yell their wild curse of hate from jaws which never close. This may possibly have been in the mind of Schiller when, in speaking of another kind of bigot, he said - </para>

                    <para class="block">I do not like to suggest what may happen to anybody in a future state, and in the true spirit of Christian charity I hope that the members of the Government will not get their deserts there. But if there be a particularly dark, dank and noisome, and offensive corner in Erebus, I suppose it will be reserved for the international and sectarian bigots. Presumably, in the leisure of eternity they will yell at each other their wild curses of hate from jaws that never close. The international bigot cannot lay aside his hate and prejudice after the war any more than can the sectarian bigot. For these reasons I shall vote against this provision. I should be untrue to the pledges which I gave to the electors of my constituency, and quite untrue to my own conscience, if I were to approve of it in any way. </para>
                    <para>I come now to the last portion of the clause, which refers  to  &#34; any person who has been deported in pursuance of any Act.&#34; I ask the Minister whether the term &#34; deported &#34; covers repatriation, because I remember that not very long ago the Government gave their patronage  and  support to one df the most officious and pernicious officials who ever imposed his unpleasant influence upon this country - I allude to the so-called Consul-General for Italy. From Ids safe retreat he used his influence to interfere with the .peace, comfort, and happiness of mam.y men who had a better right to remain in this country than he had, and by means of his secret service he pursued law-abiding people who had strong claims on our protection throughout the length and breadth of Australia. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> arid his colleagues lent him their aid, and endeavoured to cloak his discreditable conduct in seeking to deport Italians to take part in a war with which they had nothing to do. Many of these Italians were deported, and many of them may wish to return to their homes here. I hope that they will do so. But is it intended in this clause that we shall follow up the rank injustice which we did these people by assisting the Italian Consul-General in his ignoble task? Do the Government propose to say that, because these persons were deported for military service, they must now be regarded as prohibited immigrants, who cannot be allowed to land here save under very exceptional circumstances? Or is it intended that we shall do the best we can to undo the wrong to which we subjected them by declaring that our ports are now open to them? The Italian &#39;Consul-General&#34; is, at present, a fugitive from justice, who is seeking to escape the consequences of an action brought against him by a better man than himself. &#34;Will the Government permit the Italians who were deported at the instance of this officer to be brought back to the Australian  home3  from which they were driven? I shall vote against the clause. </para>

                            <para>. - In his second-reading speech upon this Bill, the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler)</inline> said, there were two brands of anarchists in the world. I find, upon consulting <inline font-style="italic">Webster,</inline> that the interpretation placed upon a certain class of anarchist is practically that which was alleged by the honorable member. <inline font-style="italic">Webster</inline> says that the anarchist &#34; stands for society made orderly by good manners rather than by law.&#34; Those who share his views believe that &#34;he produces according to his power, and should receive according to his needs.&#34; In other words, the honorable member for Perth said there are anarchists who believe that some  daly,  through the advocacy of their principles, the world will become so good that no law will be required to keep people in order. That means that the millennium will be established upon earth. I d&#39;o not know what interpretation a Court would he likely to put upon the  term &#34; anarchist.&#34; No doubt, the Minister in charge of the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> will enlighten us in regard- to that aspect of the matter before the clause which is now under discussion is passed-. I cannot conceive of this particular provision being the outcome of deliberation on the part of the honorable gentleman. It seems to me to be altogether foreign to him. In perusing it, I could not help being reminded of the old biblical saying, &#34; The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hand is the hand of Esau.&#34; I am of opinion that the essence of this Bill was communicated from 12,000 miles across the ocean, and that, unfortunately, it has fallen to the lot of the most amiable member of the Cabinet to introduce it. The honorable gentleman advanced arguments to show that the provisions of the measure are less strict than are some of the regulations which have been framed in other countries. I intend to deal with that aspect of the matter first. But I would very much have liked to hear the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> express his views upon paragraph <inline font-style="italic">gf</inline> of this clause, which reads - </para>

                            <para>- I may have mistaken the honorable member&#39;s meaning, but why not take the cue from the British Government? I guarantee, that very few, if any. of the restrictions in this Bill will be imposed by the British Parliament. If we are to have competition from foreigners, I would much rather that those foreigners came to Australia and worked under Australian conditions and laws, than that we should allow the products of their labour in other countries to come here unhindered. I have the following extract on that point: - &#187; </para>

                    <para>British Syndicate&#39;s Proposals. - Dutch news- . papers announce an agreement between an important British syndicate and aDtch com- puny, the object being the wholesale purchase of German metal products for immediate export to England. </para>
                    <para class="block">Those are wealthy people, and that would be allowed. It appears that there will be one law for the rich and another for the poor. Great Britain is going to deal with all alien enemies, as they are called in this Bill, in a much more decent fashion than we propose.  President  Wilson has announced that the United States of America is in favour of complete liberty of commercial action. As soon as he set foot on American soil, after the signing of the Armistice, he advised the American people to get into trade relationships with Germany, and do&#39; business with Germans as soon as ever they could, and this, although at the Peace Conference he appeared as one of the principal opponents of the German nation. Personally, I would not allow the products of any other country to enter here which we could manufacture and produce for ourselves, whether they came from Germany or any other nation, until we had firmly established our own industries. We can allow now under certain conditions Chinese, Japanese, Indians, Poles, Servians, Greeks, Montenegrins, Swedes, Norwegians, Dutchmen, Swiss, Spanish, Portuguese, Jugoslavs, and quite a number of others to come in.Ifthere is going to be any discrimination as to who shall enter Australia, and as to the kind of competition to which our workmen are to be subjected, it is better that they should he subject to the competition within our own borders of men who have worked under decent conditions than to the competition of those who have been the victims practically of abject slavery. Simply because we happen to have been at war with four other sets of people, they are net to enter, whether they are decent and law-abiding or not. To give an illustration of what has been occurring all over Australia, a co-operative company was formed in my electorate to manufacture porcelain, and there was only one man in the company, and he a German, who was in possession of the secret process. He signed an agreement with the company to teach it to young Australians, and allow them to undertake its manufacture. I do not think that man was deported. I believe he has since married a Victorian girl. I have seen some of the work which has passed through his hands; and seeing that we are such large importers of porcelain, it is most desirable to allow peaceable citizens like that man to teach Australian workmen an industry of which previously they had little or no knowledge. The time may come when, in order to start new industries, it will be necessary to obtain the services of those in other parts of the world who possess secret processes, and who were perhaps our enemies previously. Will any opportunity be given under this Bill to introduce that new element into our industries? The Bill can be administered in many ways that would be detrimental to the best interests of Australia, and perhaps deprive us of the opportunity of establishing industries for which we have the raw material, but have not the secret process. I do not believe any other country is going to do what we propose in this Bill, which is nothing more or less than an election placard. It is disgraceful that a deliberative assembly such as this should be called upon to place on the statute-book a measure which can be truly described in those terms. We have laws in Australia by which we can deal with every man who commits certain offences. The Bill excludes any person who says anything against &#34; all forms of law.&#34; There are certain laws on our statute-book to which I decidedly object. </para>

                    <para class="block">Has anybody anything to say against that beautiful hymn? It is absolutely flouted by this measure. No matter what the Minister may say, in Great Britain and America they are allowing the fires of war and hate to burn out as fast as they can. I object to the Government trying, for political purposes only, to fan into flame those hateful moods in which we have found ourselves during the last five years. The Government expect the Bill to make the seats of their party more sure, and I know that on the Ministerial side men will be found voting with the &#34;Ayes&#34; who practically despise every word of the measure, although they will not have the courage to get up and oppose it. I shall vote against the clause, because I believe it is nothing more or less than an election placard, introduced for the purpose of trying to obtain votes. The honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> and others, however, will find themselves bitterly disappointed if they think that this election placard is going to do them any good. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member may be sure that it would not be used as an election placard unless it was intended to appeal to the masses of the people. When they are informed that the object of the Bill is to crush the doctrine of force and of the destruction of property, and the revolt against organized government, the honorable member is perfectly right in suggesting that it will at once meet with their approval. I hope that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> will stand by the clause. No fair reading of the provision justifies the remarks made by honorable members on the other side in condemning it. They assume that it is capable of political . abuse and dishonest interpretation, but what does it provide? &#34;Any anarchist or person who advocates the overthrow by force or violence of the established government of the Commonwealth or of any State,&#34; &#38;c, may be refused admission to the Commonwealth. Objection has been taken by the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> to the use of the word &#39;&#39; anarchist.&#34; It is perfectly true, as he says, that there are philosophic, harmless anarchists, but such people will not come within the scope of the clause. No one can be a prohibited immigrant unless it is absolutely clear that he is an &#34; anarchist or person who advocates the overthrow by force or violence of the established government of the Commonwealth,&#34; &#38;c. Can the honorable member  for  Batman reasonably take exception to the refusal of admission to that particular class of person ? Perhaps the provision would be equally effective without the word &#34; anarchist.&#34; </para>

                                <para>- Probably not, but Parliament is justified in indicating to the Courts the character of the person  referred to in the clause, and, therefore, we state that admission is to be refused to the &#39;anarchist as known to us and recognised by us, not to the man who is a calm, inoffensive individual, but to the one whose  vapourings  we are accustomed to hear, and who is bent, not only on the destruction of government, but also on the destruction of property and the upheaval of society. Under the clause, persons who are animated by the German doctrine of violence and force, a doctrine which has been humbled to the dust by the triumph of right over might in the recent war, are undesirable individuals, and as such they will not be permitted to enter Australia. </para>

No words in the English language could be clearer. It also provides that admission will be refused to any person who &#34; advocates the assassination of public officials or who advocates or teaches the unlawful destruction of property,&#34; such as took place at Broken Hill the other day and in Sydney a little while back. There is no doubt as to the character of the persons who are to be excluded. &#34; Any person who is a member of, or affiliated with, any organization which entertains and teaches any of the doctrines and practices &#34; which I have just enumerated will be refused admission. There is but one interpretation of those plain words, and that is, that these enemies of society are to be prevented from landing on our shores. Are they a desirable class to have in our community? </para>

                                <para>- -There is no direct existing law to exclude them from the Commonwealth, and we are now seeking to make good the deficiency. No reasonable or fair-minded man can say that the class of persons I have enumerated are welcome, and the Government, following precedent, are taking this opportunity of making provision to exclude them from the Commonwealth. In view of the experience the world has gained during the last few years, they are entitled to the full support of honorable members. </para>

                        <para>The honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> said he felt that those persons who are now engaged in rebelling against the present form of government in Ireland would come within this exclusion. If the honorable member is referring to the Sinn Fein movement, I sincerely hope that the paragraph will exclude them. The Sinn Feiner is notoriously an enemy of the Empire, which he hates with a deadly hate. Rebellion and sedition are his instruments, and at this moment he is vigorously engaged in the creation of a Republic whose object is to hit at the very heart of the Empire and destroy it. The Sinn Fein organization has been found guilty of conspiring with the enemy for the purpose of defeating the Allied cause and dealing a blow at the Mother Country. Such individuals we seek to exclude from the Commonwealth. </para>
                        <para>The honorable member for Batman also protested very strongly against the proposal to prohibit the landing within the next five years of &#34; any person who in the opinion of an officer is of German, Austro-German, Bulgarian, or Hungarian parentage and nationality, or is a Turk of Ottoman race.&#34; I have no desire to encourage vindictiveness or hatred against any particular people or nation, but the Commonwealth is justified in adopting every reasonable precaution which is being exercised in this regard by other nations. We cannot forget&#34; what the  Avar  conclusively exposed - the most infamous and dishonorable traits of German character - it proved that he is capable of the vilest atrocities and of every breach of honour and faith when his interests demand it. The German nation has not yet shown itself worthy of admission to the League of Nations. The Allied nations have not included in their League Germany, Austria, or the other enemy nations. They have first to prove that they&#39; are worthy of admission, and that they have given over their dishonorable and hideous practices. And  Ave  say that  when  they are prepared to show themselves as honorable men and traders, and when they exhibit signs of penitence we may be justified - the Bill says at the  end of five years - in reviewing our objection to admitting such people to the Commomwealth. </para>
                        <para>Mr.Fenton.  -  How does the honorable member account for the fact that trade is proceeding between Germany and Great Britain ? </para>

The provision in the Bill before us does not go as far as legislation introduced,  in  America proposes in regard to exclusions. Canada  is  following the example of America, and Great Britain, by regulation, is protecting herself in a similar way. When these countries deem that it is necessary to protect themselves  in  this way Australia is justified  in  taking similar action. </para>

                                <para>- I do not care what his political opinions are; if he has been guilty of inciting to murder or the di struction of property, or otherwise comes within the terms of that Act, he is an undesirable, and should be deported. All that, the Bill provides in that regard is that, this particular class of criminal who has been excluded under an. existing Statute, shall not be permitted to re-enter the Commonwealth. The Bill is wisely conceived; it follows American ^precedent, and seeks to exclude from Australia well-known and recognised criminals - - individuals who are bent upon murder, . the destruction of property, and every other violence which . their ingenuity cam. suggest. Individuals of that class are not suitable citizens for this well-ordered and. well-governed Commonwealth, and; their presence amongst &#62;us would not assist in: the enhancement of contentment and prosperity. Therefore, I regard this clause as well designed and calculated to at least purge Australia of an undesirable class of persons. </para>

Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">gd</inline> gives the Government wide power to prevent the immigration into; and to deport from, Australia persons who advocate certain political views. There is a good deal in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George?s statement that the country is suffering from shell-shock. This Parliament and the present Government, in common with citizens throughout the Empire, are suffering severely from that affliction. They may not be aware, of the fact, but when we return to normal conditions, and are able to calmly survey what we have done in moments of hysteria, we shall realize that we have gone too far: _ I do not apprehend any  danger from the class of persons referred to in that paragraph. As a matter of fact, they have been in our midst for years, and Australia has benefited by the fact that we had a few such extremists amongst us. </para>

                                <para>- I am speaking of the men against whom paragraph <inline font-style="italic">gd</inline> is directed. Why have they made no progress with their particular gospel? Because in this country we have a fairly high standard of public education. Those who are dissatisfied with the existing condition of things, and are looking for an improved form of government, go to hear the anarchists and others who are described as being against all forms of government. There is one such individual in Victoria whom I heard many years ago, and who is still going strong. </para>

Our young men have sufficient intelligence to realize at once that what these would-be revolutionists are proposing is rubbish, and that it leads nowhere. The result of years and years of such propaganda has been to merely keep our people in the proper political path. The Victorian agitator to whom I have been referring has never done any harm with all his years of preaching. </para>

                                <para>- It will be very difficult to ascertain who is coming to Australia from other parts. The law as it exists to-day provides that undesirable persons may be deported to the countries of their origin. That law has been in operation, but to what extent we do not know; some persons may have been wrongly deported. But the law empowering us to deport undesirables exists. What, then, is the necessity for including paragraph <inline font-style="italic">gd</inline> in this Bill? Who is to decide whether an intending immigrant is an undesirable? Nobody can say. Persons will be admitted because they are considered, when they arrive, to be likely to become good citizens, but if, two or three- years later, they do anything to which exception is taken by the powers that be, they can be deported. &#39; They may say something against the existing system of government; they may be against . any form of government. If they conscientiously hold those views they will hurt nobody. For years we have endured in our midst people holding similar views, and they have never injured the country; rather have they helped to keep us in -the straight path. I think that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">gd</inline> goes too far, and I shall vote against it. </para>

                        <para>But I find myself in a difficulty. Whilst I regard paragraph <inline font-style="italic">gd</inline> as unnecessary, believing that we have all the power that is necessary to deal with any person who is a menace to . the best interests -of the . country, I aw in favour . of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">ge,</inline> which prohibits for a period of five years the immigration of any person of German, Austro-German, Bulgarian or Hungarian parentage and nationality, or who is a Turk of Ottoman &#39;race. I regard that prohibition as quite proper. Whilst these people as individuals may not have been responsible for originating the war which placed this country and other parts of the world in their present unfortunate position, the fact remains that they are citizens of countries the Governments of which were responsible. That responsibility descends unto them. Now that peace is restored, it is argued by some honorable members that we should take our former enemies by the hand. I wish for peace on earth. I hope that the war just concluded was the last. But whilst we are prepared to make friends with our former enemies, I, at any rate, am not ready to allow them to enter 1his country within the next few years. Why should we permit them to leave their own country, which has been industrially devastated by reason of their own acts, order to enter this country where employment is scarce, and possibly get employment even before we can repatriate our own soldiers ? Many of our returned men will be out of employment for years. Does anybody imagine that within the next two or three years we can absorb into civil life all of the men who have been engaged in the war? It will take us a long time to get back to normal conditions, so far as even the soldiers are concerned, and we have then to make provision for our growing girls and boys. Our former enemies are responsible for the position we are in to-day, and will continue to be in for years ahead; therefore, why should we allow them to come here and probably get employment in preference to our own people? They ought to pay some penalty for the crime which has been committed by the Governments of the countries to which they belong. My difficulty is that, instead of paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">yd</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">ge</inline> being proposed as separate clauses, they are contained in the one clause, so that a person holding my views must vote for or against both. I regard paragraph <inline font-style="italic">gd</inline> as repugnant, and not in the interests of the country. I feel sure that honorable members who support it to-day will live to feel disgust with their attitude. There is no need to go to this extreme. Under the existing law we can punish by imprisonment, or even by the extreme penalty, anybody who is guilty of a crime against the community. Having already this power, what good can we do by passing such legislation as paragraph <inline font-style="italic">gd</inline> now, when the world is in a slate of excitement in consequence of the war, and the peoples are suffering from hysteria or shell-shock 1 </para>

                        <para>The Minister would be well advised in omitting the clause. If he will not do that, then he should deal with each of its provisions separately, so that honorable members would be at liberty to vote for those of which they approved and against those of which they disapproved.. We are fond of talking of the liberties won for us by our forefathers, but we seem, nowadays, to be throwing them to the winds. We do not seem to be able to intelligently reason out these matters.

We should have some such- power to safeguard the interests of our returned soldiers and the people of Australia generally. It is our duty to find suitable employment for our returned soldiers&#39; before we allow Germans to come here. They must pay some penalty for the action of their country in imposing great hardships upon civilization by bringing about the great war. They should remain in their own country and seek to restore it once more to a state of high production. After we have absorbed our own people, who have been fighting for us, and normal conditions have been re-established in Australia, they might be allowed to come in.

                            <para>.- I do not agree that this measure is anything in the  nature of an electioneering placard. On the contrary, it seems to me that its introduction is due to a very grim and - urgent necessity which affects, not only Australia, but the whole of the civilized world. Under the plea of political action, determined efforts are being made by criminals to overturn civilization, and Australia, in common with other civilized countries, is compelled to take the necessary steps to deal with such individuals. I am heartily in accord with the objects of the Bill in that direction, and feel that in some respects it does not go far enough. At the same time, having listened carefully to the explanations of the legal members, and having given all weight to the assurance of the Minister in charge of the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn),</inline> I am not yet quite satisfied that it does not, in one regard, go further than is intended. I have heard no satisfactory explanation as to why the word &#34; anarchist &#34; should be included in this clause, and I am not sure that there is any justification for the inclusion of the words &#34;or of any State.&#34; There are some States that are scarcely civilized, some that have no Government, and some that are ruled by tyrants. Why should not the inhabitants of such countries have a right to do their best to bring about a better condition of affairs? Is Australia going to shut out such people if they seek to visit some friend they may have here ? Are we going to pass a measure that will exclude men like Kossuth and Garibaldi? </para>

As I pointed out when speaking to the motion for the second reading of the Bill, some anarchists, whose political creed is disapproval of compulsion in any form, have done very good work in the cause of humanity. If this clause will have associated with it the option mentioned by the Minister, then the very objection that I had to it will b e removed. At the same time, I would suggest that it might well be amended by the omission of the word &#34;anarchist&#34; and the words &#34;or of any State.&#34; Such an amendment would simplify its administration. </para>

Section 3 of the principal Act, which is to be amended by this clause, has made more enemies for Australia, by reason of its camouflaged intention, than has any other provision we have passed. Four hundred million Chinese, 70,000,000 Japanese, and 350,000,000 Hindoos come within the section, the dictation test for which it provides being a mere subterfuge.

Such of them as came here could be controlled by means of factory and other laws; but if we allowed their products to come into Australia without restriction, the position would be very serious. If the clause be agreed to as it stands, then all persons of Teutonic blood will hold a bad opinion of Australia.

                                <para>- Perhaps it would be better if I reserved my remarks upon this phase of the question until the debate upon the motion for the third reading of the Bill. The clause under consideration will inevitably create more friction by reason of the fact that it will affect the millions of people of central Europe as well as those of Asia. The honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> was justly perturbed in regard to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">tff</inline> of the Bill, which refers to &#34; any person who has been deported in pursuance of any Act.&#34; I join with him in saying that the Italian Consul-General is a disgrace to the name of manhood. As I personally sent that message to him, I have no hesitation in - repeating it here. From motives of spite and spleen, he caused the deportation of a man who had  been acting Consul for Italy in this country - a very much better man than himself - and his efforts in this direction were materially aided by the Commonwealth Government. That gentleman is returning to Australia, and would have  sued the Italian Consul-General, but that the latter packed his baggage and fled the country under the cloud of disgrace. I would like an assurance from the Minister that this clause will not apply to any of those Italians who, under international law, were obliged to render military service in Italy at the behest of the Consul-General. </para>

                            <para>. - The Bill before us is akin to some of the measures which we recently passed, and certainly cannot be regarded as other than panic legislation. Under this measure it is proposed that we shall do things which we would not do if we were back to our normal state of judicial sanity. We are asked to do things simply because we have hanging round about us that feeling of hatred and opposition to European Powers which is the product of the war. I have no hesitation in saying that Australia must take up a very definite attitude in regard to her immigration problems. But our attitude should not be affected by the attitude of any other country. We have our own problems of development to attack, and simply be-&#39; cause the Mother Country or any other country adopts a certain attitude in regard to Germans, Austrians, Bulgarians, or Turks, is not a sufficient reason why we should follow their example. Their problems and difficulties are not ours. There is a wide gulf between the necessities of our case and the necessities which confront them. We are now practically In the position which, the United States of America occupied many years ago when the population of its vast spaces was a  matter of extreme urgency. We have therefore to approach the question of immigration from, an entirely different stand-point from that from which the more settled countries of the world have to approach it. We have either to assimilate the people who desire to come here, to accept them as part and parcel of the Commonwealth, with duties and responsibilities devolving upon them as citizens of this country, or we have to reject them altogether. We have to exercise a very wide discretion, and in some respects a very difficult and delicate discrimination, in determining whom we shall accept as citizens of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>During the war we have so abrogated many privileges that citizenship in the Commonwealth to-day is worth nothing compared with what it was worth previously. This Bill merely seeks to perpetuate what I have always recognised as an unfortunate position in regard to our late enemies. Under the proposed new paragraph <inline font-style="italic">gd,</inline> which is intended to exclude &#34; any anarchist or person who advocates the overthrow by force or violence of the established government of the Commonwealth, or of any State, or of any other civilized country,&#34; every Australian soldier might be regarded as a prohibited immigrant. Every Australian soldier left this country sworn to overturn by violence the established governments of Germany and Austria. Under this Bill,, therefore, every one of them would be a prohibited immigrant. </para>

                                <para>- It is not hair splitting. It is an obvious interpretation of the words of the clause. Germany, Austria, and Turkey rank as &#34; civilized countries.&#34; We may not think very much of their civilization, and personally I am prepared to extend the warm hand of friendship to any man who has assisted to overthrow by violence the governments of those countries. Our proudest achievement to-day is that our Australian soldiers did overthrow the Hohenzollern government. </para>

                                <para>- Conditions have nothing whatever to do with the matter. We are dealing with principles,&#39; and it is quite conceivable that within our own lifetime the present system of government may have so far outlived its usefulness that we should render a real service to humanity by displacing it in favour of something else. I do not know of any other way in which some governments can be overcome except by violence. We talk about what has happened in Russia, but I take off my hat to anybody who took action to overthrow the despotic <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of the late Czar. The greatest service rendered during the war was the abolition of the Russian form of government. There is no greater stain on the pages of history, and no more bloody record in connexion with government, than that of the Czars and their Governments in Russia. If it was by revolution, by force and violence, that that <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> was overturned, what other method was available? I know of no other means than force or violence to overturn an organized system of government in Russia or any similar other country. In British communities we can change the form of government by constitutional means, which is a proper, correct, and sensible course; but where there is no constitutional means available, where it is impossible for the people, because of the entire absence of any rights to free themselves from tyranny, what other method is there? There are a few systems of government left in the world yet that need to be overturned. The British Government and their Allies during the war said to the German people, &#34; Turn out the  Hohenzollerns,  become anarchists or revolutionaries, and establish a Government of your own in Germany. If you do, we are with you.&#34; When Kerensky overturned the Czar&#39;s Government in Russia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> sent him ringing messages of cheer and congratulation. I wish we could have an opportunity to send a message of congratulation to the people of Turkey on having risen in revolt to overturn by force and violence the Turkish Empire of to-day. There are tyrannies now in existence that can be overturned only by force and violence, yet this little community, in its smug, self-satisfied pride, as interpreted by this Bill, is to say - &#34; We want nothing to do with any man, however patriotic, humanitarian, or progressive, if he is going to take violent means to overturn a corrupt and tyrannical system of government.&#34; That is not the opinion of Australia. For many centuries Great Britain has been looked upon as the friend of the oppressed, and an asylum for the political refugees of the world, who have been compelled in many countries to seek by devious means to accomplish their purpose. </para>

                                <para>- Because some of the best men and noblest women the world has seen have had no constitutional means available, and took the only other means open to them, and have been gloriously successful in overthrowing the established governments of the countries in which they live. From what did the France of the present day spring ? On what was the present Constitution of the United States of America founded ? America got its start because George Washington and those with him took the forcible and violent method, the only one available to them, to detach their country from the British Empire. These things are services to humanity, but under this clause we shut out any man or woman who dares make any effort to overcome a corrupt or tyrannical form of government. </para>

                                <para>- The Bill ought to be withdrawn until a new Parliament assembles, when the war atmosphere has cleared from our minds. I confess I approach this Bill with a prejudiced view. I do not think there is a single member here who can approach it without having at the back of his mind a prejudice against our late enemies. We are, therefore, not in that state of mind which is necessary to consider so important a question . </para>

                                <para>- Very much against them; but I approach an Immigration Bill from another stand-point altogether. Australia has an immense territory, vastly rich, and a population of only 5,000,000. We are faced with a load of debt and heavy commitments, which demand that we shall do our very. best as Australians to meet our obligations. I agree with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> that our only remedy is to produce, produce, produce. In order to produce, we must have population. Where are we to get it ? </para>

                                <para>- My argument &#34;s that we must have population. The question of what is the right kind is quite another matter. It is evident that British communities, and especially the British Isles, cannot provide us with a steady stream of immigration. We are passing a Bill which will determine the people that we are willing to admit, and the kind that we will keep out. We must, in approaching that subject, bear in mind always the needs and the best interests of Australia. We are asked to say by the second part of. this clause that no man or woman who is in favour of constitutional government and against corrupt governments is a satisfactory or acceptable immigrant. I absolutely dissent from that doctrine. </para>

He will find that in every country the most progressive, farseeing, useful political builders up of constitutional government have been those who by force and violence sought to overturn the established governments of the countries they belonged to. Yet we are going to say at this time of day that such people must not come into this country. </para>

                        <para>The honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> had a good deal to say about the Sinn Feiners. So far as I can understand them, they are Irishmen who seek to establish a system of government in Ireland. Whether we agree or not with the kind of government they propose to establish, the fact remains that what is in their minds, be it right or wrong, is the establishment of a particular form of government in their own country. </para>

They think there should be a special form of government in Ireland in substitution for the present form of government, but we. are asked to -make them prohibited immigrants.

                                <para>- I was commenting on the attitude of the honorable member for Kooyong. With his one-sided and narrow views, he sees only Ireland, and, in his prejudice against Irishmen, in the same way that he would deal with Irishmen he would deal with other men who, rightly or wrongly, believe in doing for their country what the Irishmen axe doing for Ireland. A few years ago a gentleman, who was afterwards a member of the British Cabinet - I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Carson - deliberately drilled soldiers, in defiance of the law, in order to secure a certain result in Ireland. Under this Bill he would be a prohibited immigrant. </para>

It is not our business to judge as to whether any existing system of government is the right one or the wrong one; it is a matter for the people of the country concerned; yet the Bill will enable an officer of the Commonwealth to say that a person, who is against the existing system of government in his country is a prohibited immigrant so far as Australia is concerned. There are systems of government in the world to-day it would be a blessing to humanity to overthrow. There arc systems of government which are so corrupt, so tyrannical, and so autocratic that the sooner they are overthrown the better, and I am prepared to join with any persons who are willing to overthrow them by violence, or by any other means available. </para>

It is peculiar that the Government which brings forward this proposal to debar Bulgarians, Germans, Austro-Germans, and Turks from entering &#39;the - Commonwealth for five years is the same Government which let Bulgarians out of internment camps in Australia so that they could take the place of Britishers in Broken Hill when this country, in common with the rest of the Empire, was at war. Not for the sake of protecting Australia from Bulgarians, but for the sake of finding wage earners for the mineowners of Broken Hill, these Bulgarians were let out of internment in order to take the place of men., employed in the mines, so that, in turn, the latter would be forced out of employment, and compelled to go away to fight for the liberty and freedom they were denied in Australia.. </para>

                                <para>- I have no opposition to offer to any one who belongs to the working class who seeks to enter Australia, and is prepared to abide by the conditions the majority of the people of the country have laid down. As I said in my former speech, the objection taken to these Germans and Austrians will not eventuate in inflicting any hardship upon the wealthy people of those countries who seek to push trade. We are informed by cable that certain persons have left . Great Britain for the purpose of insuring that the Germans shall be forced to trade with the Empire, and all who pay attention to the march of events know that it is trade that counts. All these fine sentiments we hear expressed from time to time in various Parliaments go for nought when trade interests are at stake. The provision that any person who advocates the overthrow by force or violence of the established government of the Commonwealth is only tacked on to the clause in order to secure the passage of the paragraph <inline font-style="italic">ge,</inline> and insure that persons of those countries where re-action has taken place against autocracy shall be prohibited from entering Australia. We were told previous to the introduction of this Bill, on all the platforms throughout Australia and throughout the world, that we were not quarrelling with the German people, the Austrian people, or the Bulgarian people. </para>

                                <para>- I suggest that the reason is that in Germany and Austria, as in Russia, the interests of the ruling classes are menaced by the revolt of the people, and the growth of the social idea amongst them, and honorable members opposite desire to keep out Germans and Austrians because they imagine that as a result of the war there is a spirit of antagonism to those people based purely on the fact of their having been born in enemy countries. And honorable members hope to safeguard their own vested interests and privileges by playing upon that prejudice of the people. The very persons who talk so much about the liberty of this country have deliberately disfranchised Australian-born citizens. There are twenty-eight &#39;native-born Australians in Holdsworthy Internment Camp. The grandfather of one internee came to Australia in 1830, but the grandson has been behind the barbed wire for three and a half years. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member was well behind it. Thousands of native-born Australians have been disfranchised. Honorable members have said that they propose to exclude enemy nationals, although they had no quarrel with them as a people; the quarrel was with the ruling classes of which they were the tools. Now honorable members have dropped that argument just as the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> who, during&#39; the war, resented any imputation that the struggle was a commercial war, says now, &#34; Nobody denies that it was a war waged for commercial supremacy.&#34; Why is the prohibition against Germans, Austrians, and Bulgarians limited to a period of five years ? If there is any logical reason why those people should not be allowed into this country because of their nationality, will it not continue equally for all time? </para>

                                <para>- I would make them amenable to the laws of the country. The effect of this Bill is that only persons whose political complexion is satisfactory to the Government of the day will be allowed to enter Australia from the countries of our former enemies. It seems queer that the Government should not be so much concerned about the exclusion of German manufactures as they are about the exclusion of German people. Even the pencils which we use in this building seem to have had the maker&#39;s name scraped off them, so that we may not be contaminated by the knowledge that they were made in Germany. I am surprised that the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> should so far forget his principles as to use, for his assistance in getting the Bill through the Committee, a pencil manufactured in an enemy country. </para>

                            <para>. - By his amendment, the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> is proposing an extension of the clause. Honorable members have raised a question as to the meaning of the word &#39;&#39;anarchist.&#34; That word is coupled with the phrase &#34; or person who advocates the overthrow by force or violence,&#34; &#38;c. The interpretation I place on that phraseology is that the subsequent words explain the meaning of &#34; anarchist.&#34; If that word were separated from the other words, the phrase would not be grammatically correct. The insertion of the word &#34; profiteer &#34; would destroy the continuity of sense that now exists in the paragraph as framed, and a common-sense reading of the paragraph then would be that a profiteer was a man who advocated the overthrow of governments by force or violence. Would it not be better to allow profiteering to be dealt with on different lines and in a separate measure? That subject is quite foreign to the purpose of this Bill. The reference to organized government does not refer to any particular government, but to any kind of government. </para>

                        <para class="block">That quotation refers to immigration throughout the world, and it shows the incidental necessity of respecting all forms of organized government. In regard to the portion of the clause which deals with the exclusion of Germans, Austrians, Bulgarians, and Turks, I remind honorable members that the exclusion is only a temporary one. It is not an eternal prohibition. There may be a poor person whom the Minister administering the Act thinks he may safely allow to enter the country, and he is given power to do that. The Bill is not proposing an absolute prohibition of the subjects of any nation after the war. </para>

                                <para>- I am speaking of the profiteer in our midst. Such a man is a real danger to the community, and to the safety of the realm. We could have no greater enemy than a man who is trying to starve the people into subjection, and to compel them to pay whatever price he chooses to ask for his wares. Here is an opportunity for the Government to deal with profiteers - the real enemies in our midst. Like the Prime Minister, I would gaol such men. Honorable members opposite would exclude the Bolsheviks. It is the profiteers that breed Bolshevism. If we go to a division on this amendment, we 6hall be able to ascertain whether the Government and- &#39;their supporters are really prepared to deal with the profiteer. It is useless to legislate for the exclusion of men likely to create dissension when we allow those who are actually causing discontent here to go scot-free. </para>

                            <para>. - I did not think it would; be necessary for me to speak to this question. So far, I have not taken part in the discussion upon the Bill, either in the House or in Committee. I cannot agree with those of my party who oppose the Bill. It is absolutely necessary to prevent the importation, and to facilitate the exportation, of any person whose opinions differ from those&#39; of the Government.. I thoroughly indorse &#62; the proposal&#39;, of the Government to prohibit- the immigration into Australia of .any one with whose views they disagree. I desire, however, to make the Bill as perfect as possible. We are suffering at present from social unrest caused by agitators, certain classes of anarchists, revolutionaries, and others with absurd ideas which they bring from abroad, and which we could not tolerate in a free country. We should not only prohibit the entrance of such people into the Commonwealth; we should absolutely prohibit the importation of any idea, whether expressed by word of mouth or in writing, that is likely to produce unrest in the community. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper has declared that profiteering is the fundamental cause of unrest in Australia. The profiteer, therefore, is one of our greatest enemies, and we should not allow him to enter the country. Honorable members dare not vote against a proposal to prohibit the entrance into Australia of the germ of unrest. Not one of them dare disagree with the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> and must therefore support this amendment. We ought to be prepared to keep out&#39; every- discordant germ. We need to build up harmony. What we want is peace, perfect peace - a peace that ends only in the grave. It is this consideration that has led me to submit my amendment, and I cannot understand why any one should object to it. If it be agreed to, - 1 shall move further amendments, making it quite clear that what we desire -&#39;s to shut out profiteers and all who are engaged in spreading the  germ  of unrest. We want to shut out every insidious policy destructive of the peace and harmony of the country. </para>

                            <para>.- I &#34;was speaking previously of &#39;the position of Germany with regard to the League of Nations. From the -beginning of the recent war, and right through it, it was continually emphasized that we had no feelings of hatred towards the German people as such, and that our opposition was entirely to their attempts at military domination. It was said that our quarrel with the German people was simply because they were the supporters of a system which we opposed, and determined to overthrow, if we could. During the war the German people were invited to overthrow that system of government themselves and establish a constitutional form of government in Germany. Both things have taken place. The Prussian system of militarism has been overthrown, and the German people have established a constitutional form of government. </para>

                                <para>- They established a constitutional form of government prior to the armistice, and their action was the direct reason for the armistice. Both those tilings having been accomplished, what further argument have we against the Germans, Austrians, Hungarians, Bulgarians, or Turks? I see no reason for the insertion of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">ge,</inline> because I do not think any of those people will, feel, at all attracted towards Australia for several years to come, or that they will be welcome visitors to Australia. I do not think Australia wants immigrants from those countries, or that they would get a very comforting reception if they attempted to come. Why insert this provision to keep them out, seeing that at any time we- may want them to junction with us to preserve the peace of the world? The admission of the Germanic nations to the League of Nations may occur at any moment. It is within the province of the League to admit them. I foresee, not the end of war - I wish I could - but a considerable extension of the war area; so much so, , that I dread the possibilities of a great war, which, I think, will eventuate between Europe and Asia. It is, therefore, essential that the European nations who uphold to some extent the same standard of civilization should be in hearty co-operation with each other. The Germans are our enemies to-day; a very few years ago they were our most intimate friends; and British statesmen explicitly stated that the best policy for Great Britain was a close alliance with Germany. At &#39;that time France was our enemy; to-day she is our friend. Who shall say who will be our enemy to-morrow, or our friend the day after? But here we are declaring that, for five&#39; years at least, and for an indefinite period thereafter, &#34; the Jews will have no dealings with the Samaritans.&#34; That is a policy of exclusion, and a discrimination in nationalities to which I refuse to subscribe. I have no love- for the German system of government. Even the present one does not approach my ideals. I have less love for the system that was overthrown. I have not a good word to say for the methods adopted by Germany during the war. It would have been a world calamity if Germany had, in any sense, succeeded in the war; but now the war is over, many reasons exist why we should forget as soon as possible the &#39;things that divided us, and unite for the service of humanity. In those circumstances, it is an abrogation of all the ideals that Great Britain has always stood for that we should shut the doors of Australia to people from the countries enumerated in the clause. </para>

                        <para>The fact that during this war we have practically shorn of all value the citizenship given in Australia to people of other nationalities than our own, is detrimental Ito our reputation, and will have a serious effect upon our future development. We have made naturalization in Australia of no value whatever. No nation has any guarantee that, if its subjects come here to settle, and accomplish all the necessary requirements in regard ito residence and citizenship, the citizenship we grant to them will be worth anything, because at any moment it may be abandoned or repudiated. We took up during the war the position that the moment any country is at war with &#39;Great Britain we are necessarily at enmity, not only with the people living in that country, but with every person who, by any stretch of the imagination, can -be connected in nationality with that country. That is a proposition which, in time of war, Ave may be willing to accept; but to make it a permanent plank in our immigration system will not stand the test either of  humanity or of reason, and is opposed to the best interests of Australia. In repudiating citizenship, and in depriving of citizenship those who, at our own invitation came here and accepted its responsibilities, who displayed loyal and constitutional adherence to our customs and our laws, we have, by that very act, declared those people to be enemy subjects. Even though there was no record against them, and no charge had been laid against them, many of them have been deprived of their citizenship, and made responsible for acts committed without their knowledge or approval, after they had openly denounced the German aggression that brought about the war. Is our citizenship to be of no value? Are we willing to placard to the world that no man or woman who comes here from any country other than a British Dominion can depend upon his citizen rights for one moment? That is practically what it means. Probably, as the result of what I am saying, I maybe branded as a pro-German. That is nothing new. A man who is afraid to be called names  is afraid to do anything, and will never accomplish much. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> at Fremantle the other day said, &#34; We have to open the doors of Australia, and provide for the settlement in Australia, first of our own people, secondly of the service men from the British Dominions, and thirdly of the peoples of other countries.&#34; Yet, before he gets back to his parliamentary duties, his own Government say, &#34; No ; there are some we will not have on any consideration.&#34; </para>
                        <para>Under the existing law, there is a very clear and effective bar against the introduction of any one who is thought undesirable. Section 3 provides for the application of the dictation test, which can be, and has been, used to prevent undesirable immigrants from entering Australia. Section 16 provides that the Governor-General may make regulations for carrying out the Act, and empowering officers to determine whether any person is a prohibited immigrant. </para>
                        <para>Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">ge</inline> of this clause provides that &#34; any person who, in the opinion of an officer, is of German, Austro-German, Bulgarian, or Hungarian parentage and nationality, or is a Turk of Ottoman race,&#34; may be prohibited. . Some irresponsible individual, not a member of the </para>
                        <para class="block">Government, is to have the power to say who is or who is not of this class, or who may or may not be admitted. Under the Act power is given to the Minister to appoint an officer to whom we are, under this paragraph, giving specific power to determine the matter. During the war serious difficulties occurred through certain officers taking upon themselves the responsibility of saying, despite documentary proof to the contrary, that certain persons were of German or Austrian nationality, when, as a matter of fact, they were neither the one nor the other. In this regard we are opening the door to a very serious possibility of national trouble. If we are going to prohibit Germans, Austro-Germans, Bulgarians, Hungarians, or Turkish people from entering, what about the other nations which were so closely in touch with the Germans and their Allies? Take, for instance, the people of Sweden and the people of Holland, who made no disavowal of the fact that they were trading with our enemies? The people of Sweden and Norway possess attractive characteristics, which make them acceptable immigrants in a country like Australia, but it would be quite easy to put up the argument that they are undesirable immigrants because of their connexion with Germany during the war. The provision in the Bill is either too narrow or too wide - too narrow because it excludes people who are equally culpable with the Germans because of the assistance they rendered to Germany during the war; too wide because it includes people who were not responsible for the war, and were only the victims of circumstances. </para>

In any case, it is unnecessary, because the Act already provides ample safeguards preventing the entry of any undesirable person . to Australia. There are nationalities in Europe to whom I have a greater dislike than I have to the central nations. There are certain elements in the southern European nations which make them much less attractive to me. We declare to ourselves that for the next five years we shall have nothing to do with particular peoples, because they are undesirable immigrants, yet we may have much more to fear from other nations. </para>

The influences at work in those countries which brought about the war have been displaced, and the peoples of those countries have, at the invitation of Great Britain and her Allies, taken such action as has - rehabilitated them with the other nations of the world. When we get down to hard facts, we realize that the people who were actually responsibly for the war, and who during the war were the leaders of their nations, have disappeared, I hope never to return. </para>

                        <para>In Australia we should seek not only to heal our own divisions, but also to find out the best in every nation of the world, in order to attract to Australia the best brains and the best workers that every country can furnish. The proposal in the Bill will not only serve to create a bad feeling against us in other p&#39;arts of the world, but will also cause a feeling of unrest and insecurity among the people of foreign birth already in Australia. What guarantee can be given to those people? None whatever. The war is far from being settled. To-morrow we may be involved in a conflict affecting not only the people in the country with whom we are at war, but also persons of that nationality who are already resident in Australia; and it may be necessary for us to amend the Immigration Act to exclude the people of Italy, or Poland, or the Balkan States, or Russia. We never know where to stop when we commence on this kind of thing. The Bill accentuates trouble, and seeks to bring about what we are anxious to avoid. It is all the more unnecessary, when we remember that there are two specific provisions in the Act which give ample power to keep out undesirables from any country, and that that power has been sufficient in the past. I am opposed  to making any discrimination against another country. Each nation has its good points as well as its bad points, and our immigration laws should be wide enough to enable us to take the best that any country can give us, while reserving to ourselves the right to reject anything we think may be inimical to Australia. The adoption of that standard would give no offence to any nation, because there would be_ no discrimination. It is only discrimination which causes trouble. I am not anxious to have an influx of Germans into Australia. I would be the first to give the Minister power to prevent it if such a danger threatened,, just as I would be the first to object to the influx of Japanese or other undesirable immigrants. Discriminations cause misunderstandings with other nations, and will cause no end of disturbance to the minds of people of other nationalities already resident in Australia. </para>

                                <para>- No; there is a better method. The honorable member knows that&#39; we have officers on duty in London, whose business it is to block people from emigrating to Australia whom they think are undesirable immigrants.  When the State Governments have sent their emissaries to Germany and other countries for the purpose of inducing people to emigrate to Australia, they have carried with them the  terms  under which persons were permitted to do so. No one would be foolish enough to attempt to emigrate to Australia without a reasonable assurance that he would be admitted to the country. Every one knows that a country must have immigration laws. We want people in Australia. We must get population to develop the country, and  Ave  should leave our door open wide enough to admit of the best we can get, and the most useful immigrants obtainable from any country; but at the same time we should hold in our hands the key of the door, so that we may close . it and lock it effectively against those whom we consider to be unsuitable and unworthy. </para>

                                <para>- I think a Court would decide that this provision applies to any Act that has been passed or may be passed. It is a notorious fact that people have been deported from Australia during recent, years for various reasons, but in my opinion, in many cases, these people should never have been deported. Nothing could be publicly alleged against them. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. A large number of men were deported under the false pretence that they were I.W.W.-ites. Had they been given the opportunity of stating their case and being heard in their defence they would never have been deported by any Court or jury. They were deported to serve political purposes. The Act was, in fact, passed to serve political purposes. </para>

                                <para>- It was useful at the last elections. It caused a lot of noise, and frightened many people, but the people will not always be in  such  a nervous state as they were then. They desire sensible, reasonable, and honest government. By firing off that  blunderbuss  at the last election the Government were able to frighten many people to. such an extent that they voted in a- way which was not in the best interests of the country. But they are fast, recovering their sanity. The Democracy of Australia is the most intelligent in the world, and at the coming elections the electors will require intelligent arguments and facts, and a genuine redemption- of promises, not mere noise and bluster. This clause provides that a person who has been deported shall not be admitted to the Commonwealth at any time. Suppose we find later that a mistake has been made regarding the guilt of any person who has been deported, and  who has been compelled to leave his wife and family in Australia. Are we unwilling to retrieve such a mistake? Under this clause we cannot do so. We are shutting, locking, and doubly bolting the door against him. </para>

May I suggest to the Minister that if he intends that phrase to mean what he- says it does mean, he might make the language a great deal clearer. </para>

What were they deported, in pursuance of? Were they deported in pursuance of some arbitrary power which we always suspected was being operated by the Government, or were they deported under the War Precautions Act, and a regulation made thereunder which invested the Consul-General for Italy with certain powers? As a matter of fact, they were deported in pursuance of an Act, and, therefore, technically, they come within the meaning of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">gg.</inline></para>

                            <para>Any person, not being  a  natural-born British subject born&#39; in Australia who is convicted of an offence under either of the last two preceding sections, shall be liable, in addition to the punishment imposed upon him for the offence, and either during or upon the expiration of his term of imprisonment, to be deported from the Commonwealth pursuant to any order of the Attorney-General. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para>A peculiarity about that section is that a British subject, a person born in England, Scotland, or Ireland, is not immune; the exemption is restricted to a natural-born British subject born in Australia. Suppose that an Englishman has been guilty of the crime of instigating to the injury of property. That does not strike me as being a very heinous offence. For that he may suffer imprisonment for a period up to six months, and then be deported. May I suggest that, after he has served his sentence for a comparatively mild offence, and having been deported, he should not be still further penalized by this Bill if he should ever attempt to return to Australia. In the circumstances, I cannot withdraw or modify any of my objections to this clause. </para>
                        <para>I was pleased to hear the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson)</inline> speak in such a manly and courageous way regarding paragraph <inline font-style="italic">ge.</inline> No matter on which side of the House we sit, we have nothing to gain politically, but we have a great deal to lose, by appearing to advocate the case of aliens, particularly those against whom our passions have been aroused during the war. If any honorable member wishes to interject that my passions have not been aroused against them, I answer that the fact remains that those to whom I am responsible - the electors - have to judge whether in this regard I faithfully represent them. It appears to. me that when, according to the boast which we make, we have imposed upon Germany the terms which we declare to be just and proper, and when we have extracted from the German people the very last ounce of what we declared they should give and do as a penalty for their part in the war, to propose now, when the joybells of peace are ringing throughout the world, to perpetuate by a policy of &#39; unfriendliness and exclusion, the feelings of hatred which were generated, perhaps necessarily, during the war, is a poor compliment to the Australian Democracy, who will not for a moment sanction or applaud such an attitude. </para>
                        <para>Surely honorable members opposite will lend their support to the amendment moved by the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey).</inline> That proposal does not abrogate any part of the clause as it stands, but adds to the persons excluded a class of person who to-day is being held up in Australia as the nation&#39;s greatest enemy. Therefore &#39; I cannot understand the comparative levity, and even hilarity, with which honorable members opposite treat the suggestion that we should brand the country&#39;s spoliators with a proper designation, and in proper company, in the clause now under consideration. While I must not be taken in accepting the honorable member&#39;s amendment as being satisfied, I certainly would accept it as an instalment or right, and in the hope that the whole Bill might be modified afterwards by further amendments to more nearly give effect to the democratic aspirations of the Australian people. </para>

At the same time, I think there is a misunderstanding as to what is intended. Under the principal Act we have absolute power to prevent any of the persons dealt with in this clause from entering Australia. We have power to apply the dictation test to any person desiring to enter the Commonwealth. Even a British subject could be called upon to submit to it. We do not wish, however, to do that. We want to proceed with a certain amount of reason, and to administer the Act according to the import which Parliament gave to it when placing it on the statute-book. I was not only a member of the Federal Convention, but I have been a member of this Parliament from its inception, and I remember that in 1901, when the Immigration Bill was first introduced, there was a great deal of doubt as to whether we should not specify the particular . classes to&#39; be affected by the dictation clause. </para>

                                <para>- The suggestion came from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain.</inline> There was much correspondence between the Imperial Government and the Dominions as to whether we should apply as a precautionary measure, and not because of any  disrespect to the standing of the nations affected, the principle of colour, as had previously been done, or whether we should adopt some other means of limiting the immigration of Asiatic races. Out of respect to Japan, India, and certain other countries, we thought it better not to specify any particular race under the Act. By refraining from doing that we thought that we should avoid any misapprehension. Power was therefore taken to apply, within the limits of reason, the prohibition against certain races. I repeat now what I said then, that there was no derogation from the dignity of those races by the imposition of such a prohibitive clause. They are in relation to their standing equally as civilized as we are. There is not a race which could borrow the civilization of another and effectively apply it to the same extent that it could apply its own. It could apply the great principles of morality and Christianity, and all those tenets which rule the League of Nations; but civilization, like all the peculiarities of human beings, is affected by its surroundings. There are biological conditions which make the mixture of races undesirable, although from the point of view of their own physical perfection, the one race might be equally as good as the other. </para>

                        <para>It will thus be recognised that no disrespect was implied by taking the power, where the necessity arose, to prevent the excessive immigration into Australia of certain races. Some of our Allies understand that perfectly well. The honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> suggested the desirableness of having, perhaps, reciprocity with Japan as regards the application of these provisions. Such an arrangement might be arrived at. It has received consideration in the past, and, to some extent, the principle has been applied by some of the Dominions. </para>
                        <para>We really have power under the principal Act tn do exactly what we are proposing to do under this clause. The dictation test, however, is not intended to apply to certain races. Instead of availing ourselves of the dictation test, we say here that for a period only incidental to the war, and which we put down as five years, we shall stop the immigration of certain persons who are specifically mentioned. Instead of taking power under the principal Act, we direct what the Minister shall do. He need not apply the dictation test. It would be quite wrong for him to do so in these cases. We say to the Minister, &#34; You can stop the coming in of this class of persons without submitting them to the dictation test.&#34; That is why this specific provision is made. We also do not wish to be unjust or to depart one iota from the splendid moral spirit implied in the preamble to the League of Nations. The Minister is given power to allow the entrance into Australia of those who he thinks should come in.  </para>
                        <para>The honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson)</inline> has spoken of the possible impairment of confidence in our administration on the part of other races. Surely in administration the principles of the League of Nations will be applied subject to the necessity of protecting ourselves for a time against the incursion into this community of enemy subjects. Such an incursion might possibly impair what it is desired to obtain by the League of Nations. Let me make this quotation from the preamble to the League of Nations - </para>

                            <para>The high contracting parties in order to promote international co-operation and to achieve international peace and security, by the acceptance of obligations not to resort to war, by the prescription of open, just, and honorable relations between nations, by the firm establishment of the understandings of international law as the actual rule of conduct among Governments, and by the maintenance of justice and a scrupulous respect for all treaty obligations in the dealings of organized peoples with one another, agree to the covenant of the League of Nations. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">I do not think it will be said that this provision, covering a period of five years, can impair the splendid spirit expressed by that clause. I therefore ask honorable members to recognise that this is not a radical alteration of the existing law, but simply a direction to the Administration as to how they shall act, taking into account the significance of the principle itself as applied since 1901. </para>
                        <para>As to German immigration, I would point out that before the war, judging by their own administrative practice, Germans did not wish to come here. I was Minister for External Affairs .at that time, and then, as now, in charge of immigration. I made inquiries as to the possibility of getting emigrants from European countries. I found that, on the whole, the farmers and agricultural labourers of Great Britain were not prepared to leave the Old Country, because, happily, the wretched conditions and pay of the past were gradually disappearing. For a generation before the agricultural labourers of the Old Country were almost at the starvation limit ; but, gradually, the upper classes recognised that it was necessary to apply the tenets of morality to these men, particularly in relation to their wages. Their wages were gradually raised, and they preferred to remain where they were. In many cases where we sought on Fair days to obtain farm labourers to come to Australia, we failed. In connexion with a Fair held in one town, about two years before the war, we secured 129 emigrants, but a year later we could get only four, the reason being that farm labourers were becoming better off.We had, therefore, to endeavour to obtain emigrants from other countries. We looked for emigrants from the Scandinavian countries as well as from the northern part of Italy and some parts of Russia. Germany was not much considered, because, as a matter of fact, Germany, I understand, had prohibition, or was against its people coming out. In these circumstances Germans could not be materially affected by any such temporary check as is applied by this provision. It is not a permanent provision, but will apply for a few years, until, I dare say, Germany comes into the League of Nations. This is merely a proposal to apply for a time, and to an extent, a practice that was considered necessary during the war. No enemy subject could come in during the war period, and, as a matter of fact, no British subject of enemy origin could leave Australia. A naturalized German, for instance, was not allowed to leave the Commonwealth. From the beginning to the end of the war I do not think that a dozen such persons left Australia. It was only recently that the Imperial Government gave  permission to allow some to leave here in exceptional circumstances. It will thus be seen that power is now being taken to apply for a period that may be necessary as incidental to the settlement of the war, provisions that were applied during the war, in order to prevent any possible injury from excessive immigration. </para>
                        <para>The honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> has very properly asked for the significance of this, clause. If. honorable members inquire into its meaning, they will recognise that the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> has taken quite a mistaken view of it in moving the insertion of the word &#34; profiteer.&#34; Any amendment of the clause ought to have direct relation to its purport. What is the purport of this clause ? It is not to deal with a particular class of person, but with all persons who, according to its context, aim at the destruction by force of organized government. The honorable member is moving to deal with profiteers. That is a matter for specific legislation. </para>
                        <para>To silence the suggestion that this is a mere election move, I would direct attention to analogous provisions in the legislation of other countries. The power we are taking was provided for in the United States -of America, two years ago, and as far back as 1911 in the case of  Canada.  Under the United States Act, anarchists or persons who believe in or advocate the overthrow by force or violence of the government of the United States of America, or of all forms of law, &#34;or who disbelieve in&#34; - those are words that we have nob in this Bill - or are opposed to organized government, or who advocate the assassination of public officials, are prohibited immigrants. Under the Canadian Act, those who believe in the destruction of constitutional government, and tha constitutional provisions of government, are specifically mentioned. The honorable member for Batman referred to the inclusion of the word &#34; anarchist&#34; in the proposed new paragraph. I believe that a Court of justice looking at it would say that &#34; anarchist &#34; meant a man of the class subsequently described as one who advocates the overthrow by force or violence of established government, or who is opposed to any form of organized government. It surely does not cover a man of the stamp of Kropotkin, who was a philosopher who tried to inoculate his followers with high-class ideals. </para>

                                <para>- I am not going to discuss them. There are different opinions as to the principles in which they believe. Tolstoi might have been regarded as having a desire to apply Christian principles as far as possible to keep people to-  get her, and he thought the machinery of government should, be reduced to a  minimum  Some people called him an anarchist, but he would not have come within the meaning of this clause. A Bolshevist - ; I seldom use the word - or, at all events, a man who wishes, to destroy established government by force or- bloodshed, is a class of anarchist who would come under this prohibition.  </para>

At the same time, we, in Australia, are going along altogether different lines. The Minister quotes from American and Canadian legislation and regulations, but I ask him what that country, just across the English Channel, is doing? It is doing its level best to get into association with Germany. There is a race between American and British commercial men for the German trade, and, as I have shown, the British Government is helping British business men in the struggle. I suppose the- Australian fruit-growers will soon again want to sell their fruit to Germany, where they obtained very good prices previously.. American buyers are to-day going through Australia purchasing hides and skins to re-sell to Germany.

We are all in agreement with paragraph c, because it will prevent the admission of degenerates. We are apt to under estimate the cost to the country of admitting this class of people.

In the early days of America the better class of people migrated to its shores, but of late years the people of northern and central Europe have found it to their advantage to stay in their own countries. The conditions there were, if anything, on a par with those offering in America, and the United States, receiving, as it has of late years, until the outbreak of the war, on the average, over 1,000,000 immigrants a year, has not drawn upon the best of Europe, but has drawn upon the worst. We do not want the worst. It is far better for us to depend entirely upon our natural increase than to draw upon the worst of Europe. Nor do we want anarchists - those persons desirous of overthrowing existing systems of government. We have in our midst a few people who do not stand for law and order, and who would overthrow any semblance of law in order to gain their own ends; and if by means of this Bill we can keep others of this class out of Australia, it will be an advantage to the country. The provision which will keep out people of the central European Powers and the nations arrayed against us in the war is a fair one, although it is only to last for a period of five years. The honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson)</inline> says that it is not in agreement with the League of Nations ; but I would remind him that the Central Powers are not to be admitted to that League at present. If ever the time comes when they are admitted, it will be time enough for us to review this provision. </para>

                        <para>- It would not be the first Act repealed by this Parliament. This provision is subject to repeal at any time, and if ever the people of the Central Powers show that they are worthy of admission to the League of Nations, then it will be open to this Parliament to repeal it, and admit them to Australia. I look upon paragraph <inline font-style="italic">gf</inline> as merely a further means of enabling us to identify the persons who are specifically mentioned in the preceding paragraphs. Although it has been asserted by the Opposition that a number of people have been deported who should never have been deported, I have yet to learn that any person of the class referred to in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">gg</inline> has not got his just deserts. </para>

                        <para>- I felt that my kind, words, like bread cast upon the waters, would come back to me, not after many days, but at once. I feel that it is absolutely necessary to improve the clause to the utmost of our ability. I desire to move an amendment that will make clear the intention of the Bill, and to which no honorable member will object. This clause contains a proposition to exclude everybody who is opposed to the interests of Australia. With that proposal I quite agree. The honorable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bayley)</inline> staggered me. He is an illustration of the gentlemen who in this country sing &#34; Rule Britannia&#34; and wrap themselves in the flag, but are speechless unless they can get arguments and illustrations from Germany. The first thing the honorable member did was to quote a professor of Bonn, where, I understand, that other great Britisher, Lord Milner, was bom1. As another argument why this Bill should be agreed to, the honorable member quoted the antecedents of &#34; Jukes.&#34; I quite admit that the antecedents of the dukes are deplorable. He referred to a number of &#34; Jukes &#34; whose offspring included 847 prostitutes and 140 thieves. There are dukes to-day who have not produced prostitutes and&#39; thieves, but who are the descendants of such, and to them our blessed Empire has its obligations. </para>

                <para>I quite agree with the proposal to exclude from Australia persons whose presence would be detrimental to the interests of the Commonwealth. There are some persons who say - I do not know with what truth - that what the Government intend by this Bill is nothing. If that is their object, it is my. anxiety to assist them. As the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> stated the -other day in a leading article - and the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> is my bible, as it is that of ; honorable members opposite - the sublime art of politics is the accomplishment &#39; of nothing. And some people say that this Bill is introduced, for two purposes. They say that the Government have nothing to do, and therefore they wish to fill up the statute-book -with something that means nothing,, inasmuch as this measure proposes nothing that cannot be accomplished by powers conferred by existing legislation!: If that is- so, I, as a politician, am also anxious &#39;to perfect myself iri the art of saying- much and accomplishing nothing. By means: of this and other similar Bills, the Government are able to avoid dealing with the important, problems that do affect the interests of the country: They are able- to carry on the outward and visible forms of Parliament by discussing the <inline font-style="italic">pros</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">cons</inline> of something which, when reduced to legislation, accomplishes nothing of value. There are- other persons who say that the- real purpose of this measure is political camouflage, and that it is only intended, to provide something- for discussion. If that is the truth, one might, in his own interests, sit down and say nothing. But it is said that a measure of this kind is introduced for political purposes. I will not say that that is the case, because I cannot conceive of a Government such as that now in office doing anything of that kind. What the Government want is opposition to the Bill. Some honorable members on this side have been ready to assist them in that respect. I am not. I would rather support the Bill. But as it is not calculated to accomplish even the purposes which it professes to carry out, as it is lacking in definition, and as it contains words that mean nothing, surely it is the duty of members of Parliament to transform into something that which means nothing, if only to make a show of earning the money we are paid and are pleased to get. The clause refers to civilized nations, and draws a clear line of demarcation between one State and another. It refers to the established governments of the Commonwealth &#34; or any State.&#34; What is a State? Do the Government mean to say that they are opposed to the advocacy of violence or force against Kaiserdom? </para>

                <para>Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">gd</inline> would exclude persons such as many of Australia&#39;s pioneers, who, apparently, ought never to have come to this country. After the revolution of 1848, and the discovery of the Victorian gold-fields, something like 250,000 men came to this State within a period of four years. They came from every country in the world. There were the Chartists of England, members of the Young Irish party, the crofters of Scotland, the Communists of France, and the anarchists of Spain and Italy. They came to what they regarded as a comparatively free country. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Stawell, who, being an Englishman, and not a supporter of either the yellow dog or the green flag, must be believed, said that those individuals were drawn from the slums of all the great cities of Europe. It was <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Hotham, then a Governor of Victoria, who wrote to the British Government that it was evident that the people of Victoria were determined to realize in the country of their adoption all those principles which were scouted by the educated and wealthy classes of Britain. We can deplore the fact that there was no&#39; such law in existence then as this proposed Bill. We call those men the fathers of our country. We feel pride in the fact that they left the country of their birth and founded a new and better world in the southern seas. We boast that the young men of to-day are the descendants of those early immigrants. But the wealthy classes designated them as the scum of the cities of Europe. What a pity we had not this Bill on the statute-book then ! With such a law in existence the only persons eligible to enter the country would have been those who had been exiled from Britain for criminal offences, to which they were often driven by their poverty. </para>
                <para>As you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> know, I am an anarchist, Bolshevik, revolutionist, direct action i st, and everything that is bad. I get my salary; I am a parasite like the others. I say to my electors, &#34;You might as well pay the money to me as to anybody else.&#34; But between ourselves, I honestly do not believe that the working classes or anybody else in this country will ever get anything out of the process of legislation. None of us intends to do anything in this Parliament - I do not - except to get as much for ourselves as we can. I think it would be a grand thing if, after long years, we were to have a &#34; burst up&#34; of some kind, and if instead of having a bayonet poked into me, I could poke it into somebody else, and if instead of being forever without property, I could have the benefit of somebody else&#39;s property before I died. But where can I find anybody in the community who wants violence? If honorable members look everywhere they cannot find such a person. We find men violent, but only in words; extreme, but only in words; and words will not hurt anybody. It was one of the traditions of England that crime consisted, not in words, but in deeds. Even in the bloodiest days of English history - in the days of &#34; bloody Castlereagh,&#34; in the &#34; hungry forties &#34; when rr1 ill ions of Englishmen were walking from city to city in search for work - it was admitted that a man might be violent in words without the authorities being concerned. It was the man who was violent in deeds about whom they- concerned themselves. When men performed deeds against the Constitution they paid the penalty. </para>
                <para>This Bill is mere camouflage, a delusion and a sham. There is no country in the world where the working-class agitators are such a mild-mannered lot as they are in Australia. No honorable member can point to a man of violence. I have looked for such a man. I have looked for comradeship, but I have found it not. Amongst all our working-class agitators there is not a man who really means anything when you put up a proposition. </para>

                        <para>- Wherein lies the reflection? The point that I make is that there is not sufficient comradeship amongst these men, with the result that they are not able to transmute feeling into action. There is only one thing that will have that result. Make a man hungry. A man walks on his belly, and when he is hungry he will act. We are likely to have many hungry people here, because the Government seem to have no means of meeting the country&#39;s needs. </para>

Shake up the whole lot of us, Opposition and Government supporters combined, and you cannot find any diversity of opinion amongst us, except with regard to superficialities. We are going shortly to have an election. Some of us will lose our seats; some will come back. I hope to heaven that I shall be among the latter. Those who come back to power will have to &#34; carry the baby,&#34; and a heavy baby it will be. It will not be the baby of Bolshevism, but something worse. Bolshevism is at least a clearly understandable policy, whereas the present Government have nothing before them but the chaos of indefinite policies. Agitators and advocates of violence do not exist. It is mere camouflage to suggest that we have such people. Our agitators are not hungry enough to think of action. The power of this Parliament will depend upon the growth of public opinion - upon the action of men who have definite opinions. </para>

                <para>In this Bill the Government do not really touch the fundamental evil of this country, which lies in the fact that our debts are piling up, and that no attempt is being made to pay them. The manufacturer and every one else passes on the burden to the consumer of his products. The biggest enemies of our country are not touched by this Bill. They are travelling to Asiatic countries in the hope of securing lines of Asiatic goods with which to flood our markets. They talk about their God, their country, and their King, but their only concern is how to make 5 per cent, where they made before only <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> per cent. They denounce Germany to-day, and to-morrow they are attempting to open up traffic with her. They have no regard for either their flag, their country, or- their King, irrespective of his antecedents and his relationship to the Kaiser. What they are troubled about is whether they are going to make bigger profits by flooding the market with Japanese and German goods. To the extent that they succeed will trouble be caused. They are laying the foundations of future trouble and of Japan&#39;s economic power in Australia. </para>
                <para>The Government do not really mean anything in putting this provision before us. I do not desire to be offensive. I try  to please people, and to win votes. Politically, the Opposition has not long to live. The man who is to strike off our political heads will be here in a few days, and it is absolutely necessary before his return that I should advertise myself. I do not suppose the newspapers will report me, and, therefore, as soon as <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> issues a report of my speech, I shall have it circulated amongst my constituents to let them know I am doing something for my &#163;600 a year. For that reason, and not to test the sincerity of the Government, because I do not doubt their sincerity for one moment, I intend to submit a further amendment. This amendment, I am sure, will not meet with the support of some of the Conservatives on this side, but will, I am convinced, receive the indorsement of such revolutionaries as the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best),</inline> the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett),</inline> and the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falkiner).</inline> I can appeal to such men to give me their whole-hearted support in the proposal I am about to make. They love their country, and want to protect it, and therefore I claim their help.I do not suggest for one moment that honorable members opposite are in favour of the profiteer or have any personal interest in profiteering. I believe they are like the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> who tells us that he is going to shoot the profiteers. He was going to shoot them five years ago; he was going to shoot them in 1915, and again in 1916 and 1917, but the profiteers are still alive. We now learn that he is going to destroy them at any time between now and the date of the next general election. After the next general election the profiteers will be all right for another three years. </para>

                    <para>.- I am sorry that all my energy has been wasted. I have many other valuable suggestions to offer, but, as I am not producing any results, it seems to he useless to go on. I intended to move that after the word &#34; State,&#34; in proposed new paragraph <inline font-style="italic">gd,</inline> the following words be inserted: - &#34; always provided that it shall not be an offence against the provisions of this Act to advocate the overthrow by force or violence of the barbarian States of Germany, Bulgaria, or Turkey.&#34; I am convinced, however, that the members sitting behind the Government would not support this, because they would even sustain and uphold the Prussian State, and impose the same penalties here on a man who advocated its overthrow as on one who advocated the overthrow of any other State. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Civilized countries are mentioned, but the Government do not specify what a civilized country or a barbarian country is. The clause is all flim-flam. It consists merely of words, by which the Government do not mean anything. If they had any serious intention in this legislation I would have moved to insert after the words &#34; civilized country &#34; the following words : - &#39; &#39; being such a country as is hereafter specified, but not including Germany.&#34; I am satisfied, however, that members opposite will all vote to include Germany in the scope of their protection, because all they desire is to protect the capitalistic State, which is more important to them than anything else. Under the provisions of this Bill, his sublime Majesty the Kaiser, when he leaves Holland, will be able to enter Australia, because he will not be included within the meaning of the term &#34; anarchist.&#34; It is not often that I occupy the&#39; time of the House, and I feel that 1 have taken up sufficient time this evening. When the &#39;&#39; king-pin &#34; comes back, possibly we may be able to get a word in, possibly not, because I see that he is going to smite everybody hip and thigh. I have, therefore, thought it wise to get in my word this evening. I apologize to the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> for occupying so much of his attention. I have, in the interests of my &#39;constituents, to approach various Ministers for certain things, and I desire to keep in the good graces of Ministers accordingly. It is not out of personal animosity towards the Minister that 1 have spoken on this Bill. There is nobody on the Ministerial bench that I love, revere, or respect more than I do the honorable gentleman who is now occupying the chair at the table - except, it may be, .some other Minister who may occupy it at some other time. </para>

                    <para>.- 1 foreshadowed early in the evening my intention to put on record my protest against this Bill, which I consider quite unnecessary, and pointed out that we already had sufficient legislation to deal with any person who does anything inimical to the best interests of this country. I agree with the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> that the Bill is quite unnecessary, but it may do some injury to certain persons already here. There are anarchists who have been here for years doing constant propaganda work. They have never hurt this country one iota, because the rising generation, having sufficient education, decide for themselves which is the best policy for the country, . and have not followed their advice. These men conscientiously believe in their principles, and are opposed to every form of government. The Bill provides that they can be deported if they are opposed to the form of government in existence here. That is altogether wrong. Who is to tell whether persons coming here from other parts of the world are undesirable? It is impossible for the Government of the day to ascertain whether persons arriving here on vessels come within that category or not. If the Government cannot find o.ut, those persons have to be admitted, so that this Bill counts for nothing in that respect. Subsequently, if within a certain period they are found to have given utterance to something objectionable, although probably little notice is taken of their remarks, the Government can deport them under the authority of this Bill. Perhaps by that time they may have married Australian women and had children. They will be deported and the Australian wives and families left here, or forced to go away with them. In doing this the Government will be doing nothing that will help this country in any way. History shows that right down through the ages men have been punished for misdeeds. When they have committed an act against the law, they have had to &#39;suffer the penalty provided. I do not want to take away from any man the right to express his opinion. Once we restrict the liberties of the people to that extent this country will not make the progress that it should enjoy. The people should have the right to express their views so long as they do it in a proper way; but if some officer considers that a certain statement made by an individual is against organized society, that individual can be sent out  of the country at once, irrespective of what ties he has. That seems to be hasty legislation, or what Lloyd George would describe as &#34; shell-shock &#34; legislation. </para>

                        <para>- We cannot reasonably consider anything to-day. I do not know where we are drifting. There is a great deal in what the honorable member for Bourke has said about many measures being introduced and passed for window-dressing or political-placard purposes. They should not be entertained in a deliberative assembly, yet they are passed without a scintilla of justification. There is, however, one provision in this measure which may be justified, and will get my support. I do not think we ought at present to permit enemy subjects to come here, who, if not directly responsible, have been residents of enemy countries, and in many cases may have taken up arms against our own people. We were compelled to go into the war, and those people should not be allowed to come here just because they have sufficient money to pay their passages. They should be debarred at least until we have repatriated the whole of our own men and found employment for all our people. The Germans and Austrians will probably find things very hard in their own countries after the war. The taxation there will be very heavy, and the wages, perhaps, low. They may say, to themselves, &#34; If we can get to Australia, which is a land flowing with milk and honey, we may find, employment and participate in what is going there, instead- of remaining in our own country to pay the penalty  imposed on us for bringing on the war that brought so much misery to the world.&#34; 1 could see some force in that proposition-, but this clause prevents me from voting according to my convictions. I must either vote for- the clause: with all its imperfections, debarring certain people from coming here on the slightest pretext, and deporting others for very little reason, or vote against it, because it does this, although at the same time it contains some very necessary provisions debarring certain undesirable persons from coming to Australia. In order to make my position clear and register my protest against the provision which prevents people from coming to Australia who, for the reasons already thoroughly threshed out this evening, ought to be made welcome here, I move - </para>

                    <para>.- I support the amendment. I made my position perfectly clear on Friday last. I agree with the honorable member for Hunter. <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> that there are many people in the world to-day who cannot reason as they did before the war. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George has said, the community is suffering from shell-shock. Our Government are running amok with this kind of legislation. They are putting political placards in their, windows for the purpose of distracting the attention of the people from other important matters. At the same  time, they will not tell the people that German travellers, agents, or tourists will be permitted to enter the Commonwealth, while men of the Garibaldi or George Washington type may be excluded. Irish patriots, such as the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> is, would have been kept out of Australia if this provision had been the law. This legislation is only political hypocrisy. The Minister is anxious to get the clause through, but other amendments have been foreshadowed. The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler)</inline> has given notice of an amendment to deport any person who does not happen to be a native of the Commonwealth. </para>

If we vote- for the clause as it stands, the provision will last for all eternity, until a new set of Ministers comes into power and advises the Governor-General to issue a proclamation terminating it. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that the same thing will apply to this class of legislation as has applied to previous proposals. Honorable members who opposed the legislation put forward by honorable members of the Opposition when we were in power are now falling over themselves to say that it was the right thing to pass. When we proposed an amendment of the Constitution in 1911, they said that we were wrong. Now they find that it would have been the right thing to do. Honorable members who are voting for this provision to-day will  find,  later on, that it is wrong.  However,  it is hopeless for any honorable member of the Opposition to propose an amendment. On no single occasion since this Parliament began has an amendment from this side of  the  House been accepted. Honorable members on the Government side slavishly follow  Ministers.  Every one of them, with the exception of the honorable member  for  Wernwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lynch),</inline> voted for the bachelor tax, yet the Government did not have the courage to carry it out. I shall vote against every part of this Bill. I think it is only fair to point out that, owing to an unfortunate accident, the honorable member, for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> was unable to continue the debate on the second reading on Friday. I trust that the people of Australia will come to their senses, and realize that this class of legislation will not be to their advantage, and that it will tend to keep out some of the best men we could get in Australia. </para>

                <para>Mr.GLYNN (Angas - Minister for Home and Territories) &#91;10.5&#93;.  -  I am sure that the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> would not attempt to mislead honorable members, but sometimes an honorable member&#39;s words are put before the public in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and give a wrong conception of what has actually taken place here. He has said that honorable members on this side of the House did not have the pluck to vote against the bachelor tax. He forgets, the occasion. I happened to be assisting Lord Forrest, the Treasurer at that time, and we both had amendments prepared for the purpose of modifying, if not knocking out, the bachelor tax. As a matter of fact, there was a blunder in the Senate. The honorable member for Yarra may laugh, but jocularity does not carry the sense one whit further. It is an absolute fact that there was an amendment to limit the bachelor tax; but it was insisted that the Bill should pass as it was brought in. However, I assured honorable members, sitting behind the Government that the matter would be attended to. We were not in a position to do it at the time. It would have meant knocking out that particular part of the Bill, and I asked the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> not to press his amendment, which would accomplish far more than he intended. The assurance given was carried out, because subsequently the Government did not put in force the provision of the Bill enforcing the bachelor tax, and at the end of the year a measure was brought in repealing it. </para>

                    <para>. - In supporting the amendment of the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> I propose to confine my remarks to two points. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> has admitted that there is sufficient power in the present Act to include every person, so that it is unnecessary to have this provision in the Bill. Discretion lies in the hands of the Ministry to exclude any person from this country as an undesirable immigrant. That is my first point. </para>

                <para>A very few years ago, under the Ministerial sanction of the honorable gentleman at the table <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn),</inline> the Commonwealth issued some very interesting advertising matter&#39; which was distributed through the High Commissioner&#39;s office in London, telling the people of Europe what an admirable place Australia was to come to. These invitations were open and free, not to the people of any particular country, but to the people of Europe, and they were couched in most attractive language, depicting the alluring conditions under which people could live in Australia, At that time, we were told that it was essential to get population here, but that, at the same time, an Immigration Act was necessary to prevent certain undesirables from coming to this country. No one complained about that ; but how are we going to issue any similar invitations in the future in the fact of the provision &#39;in the Bill which the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> seeks to have omitted? When an intending immigrant in the British Isles is asked to fill up his papers, he will be asked questions as to his age, his birthplace, his trade or calling, and, in addition, he will be asked, &#34; Are you an anarchist? Have you advocated the overthrow by force or violence of any established government ? &#34; There are in Great Britain to-day many men who are of the most revolutionary type. Revolution broad, open, and distinct is preached in the streets of the cities of the Old Country. . . </para>

In their attempts to exhibit their loyalty and patriotism, and the wonderful development of British institutions in Australia, honorable members are overreaching themselves, and the Mother Country is laughing at them. A few months ago, they were drawing most invidious distinctions about the loyalty of the people of Australia, because they did not follow the example of the Mother Country by accepting conscription, and now when it suits their book, they are talking the other way, and saying that the people of the Mother Country are not worthy of being immigrants to Australia. </para>

                        <para>- It was the&#39; class who were previously considered in the same category as those to whom the honorable member is now referring, who developed Australia. It was the men who were considered revolutionists, the scum of Europe, the useless characters, who were deported, and who made this country what it is to-day. We say that Australia requires population, but before people can get a chance to enter the country they must disavow any leanings towards a change in the system of government. It is a fact that, not only in British communities, but throughout the world, there is a recognition that the present form of government is nearing its end; that it has almost entirely outlived its usefulness. A change in the system of government is coming. I believe that the British people have the best system of government that the world knows to-day, but I am not prepared to say that it is the best that can be devised. But before we allow anybody to come into Australia, he or she must be certified to be not in favour of a change of government by force or violence. Of course, the decision as to whether a person is an advocate of such methods rests with an officer of the Government. Suppose that some individual in the Old Country, who is a pronounced revolutionist, and believes in a republican form of government - there  are millions of such men who openly proclaimed their doctrines during the war - wishes to emigrate to Australia, and knows of this provision in our legislation, do honorable members think that he will deliberately sign himself as being a republican or a revolutionist? It is not at all likely. It means, therefore, that our immigration in future can only be drawn from one small section of people in Great Britain, and that section has not yet supplied us with population, in great numbers to fill up our empty spaces. </para>

                        <para>- No; I say the majority of emigrants from Great Britain are not of the class that can be described as very loyal to the established forms of government. The bulk of the emigrants in the past have been of the class who, to-day, in Great . Britain, are republicans and revolutionists. What I have said of Great Britain in that respect applies with much greater force to the other countries of Europe. It is a well-known fact that Spain, Portugal, Italy, and France are seething with revolution and discontent. Spain to-day is the hot-bed of revolution, and I have no hesitation in saying that the Government of that country could be revolutionized with advantage. Italy is seething . with revolution. Portugal is continually having upheavals of the same character. France is a declared Tepublic. The people of those countries can come to Australia without hindrance, as compared with the embargo placed upon Germans, Austro-Germans, and Bulgarians, who are notoriously in favour of monarchical rule. But how can we say to people of Spain, Portugal, and Italy that they may enter Australia so long as they are not anarchists, when we know that the majority of the inhabitants of those countries are anarchists by conviction, and are only kept in restraint by the fact that the wealthy and militarist classes retain control of the reins of Government? What a disparagement this law will be to Australia. Before a man may enter our country he must declare himself to be in favour of a certain form of government, which can only mean the form favoured by the. Minister administering the Act for the time being. It will be only another step to compel an immigrant to declare his religious beliefs. Wo are narrowing down our immigrants to such a small and useless class that the Bill will defeat the purposes at which it professes to aim. </para>

                        <para>- They must pass an immigration officer at this end, but, whereas his investigation . of them is a formality, in the case of the poorer immigrant it becomes an inquisitorial investigation into the whole&#39; of his antecedents. Are we to take up the attitude that only, one class, and only persons holding one political belief, will be acceptable to Australia? The overturning of governments is a matter of political opinion. I have no personal desire to overturn any established government by force or violence, and I have no reason for such a  course, because I am living in a country where, by constitutional means, we can secure any form of government we desire. But if I were in Spain&#39;, Portugal/ Italy, or Germany, where responsible government does not exist, I should be a revolutionist. I should be prepared to overturn such Governments bv force or violence, or by any other method, and for that reason I would not be an acceptable immigrant to Australia. The Bill will go further than the Government wish it to, and the trouble will be that, although we ho,pe that good sense will, prevail in the administration, the door will be open for the operation of this law for political purposes. This sort of legislation is a bad advertisement for Australia&#39;. It will mean that neither in our own British communities nor in any other country will there be a good word for Australia, since every foolish objection that could possibly be urged against people coming to this country . to- help it to advance is raised in this Bill. . </para>
