Further, I desire to ask the honorable gentleman whether there is any obstacle in the way of the Commonwealth Government taking similar action having regard to the fact that our Constitution is practically the same as that of the United States of America, and will he promise that a proportionate number of profiteers will be arrested in Australia within the next few weeks ? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member held office as Minister for Trade and Customs at a time when profiteering, if it exists, was as rampant as it is to-day, and he must therefore know the exact position as to our power to deal with it. I cannot say whether or not the cable message is correct, but I would remind the honorable member that the United States of America, although comprising a very largo area of country, consists of a large number of very small States between which trade in all classes of commodities ' has taken place. On the other hand, in Australia we have only six States, each covering a very wide area. I should say, speaking offhand, that whatever legislation is in existence in the United States of America to-day in regard to profiteering has reference to Inter-State trade and commerce. I shall have inquiries made to ascertain what power the  United  States of America Government is exercising. I am not aware of any power enabling the Commonwealth to invade the domain of Intra-State trade and commerce in order  to  take action of the kind suggested by the honorable member. </para>

Tymms and Kidman to build the North-South railway? In the course of that statement the honorable gentleman said that a survey through the Macdonnell Ranges to Alice Springs was made in 1889, and that as far (back as 1883 sanction had been given by the South Australian Government for the construction of the Palmerston-Pine Creek railway, a distance of 146 miles, and for the construction of the Port AugustaOodnadatta railway, of 178 miles? He stated, further, that in 1895 the proposed railway was the subject of a report by a special Commission, and that the first transcontinental work was the overland telegraph line constructed in 1871 ? If the Government have yet passed beyond the reminiscent stage, will the honorable gentleman state what view they take of the offer of Messrs. Tymms and Kidman to construct the railway ? </para>

                        <para>- It is quite correct that it is impossible to get sleeping accommodation on the trains between Adelaide and Melbourne. Trains run only three times a week, and it is not possible to provide the requisite sleeping accommodation, and at the same time carry all the passengers. As to the Postmaster-General, I think that, in view of the excessive labours of his office, he is entitled to every comfort when travelling. From what I know of the honorable gentleman, if it were possible to go to any part of Australia to carry out his duties, he would unflinchingly do so. </para>

                        <para>- In reference to the many alterations that have been made in the form of the application cards for electoral enrolment, it is necessary for an applicant to state that he or she is over the age of twenty-one. It 16 also made necessary for every woman to write her name and the year of her birth on the front of the card. I hardly think that is necessary; but, in any case, will the Minister for Home and Territories say why one signature -should not be sufficient instead of compelling people to sign the card on both sides ? </para>

                        <para>- May I remind the Postmaster-General of the deputation which he received on behalf of certain postal electricians who have lost their employment, and of a letter which has been sent by his Department intimating that the amended Public Service Act, giving preference to returned soldiers, deprives those men of their claims? In the light of that letter, I wish to learn from the Postmaster -General whether we can get an answer as soon as possible with reference to the other points raised, namely, that junior mechanics have been placed in these positions, and that steps have not been taken by the Government to give effect to the very definite promise made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew</inline> Fisher, when he was Prime Minister, that the claims of these men would not be prejudiced ? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has already received a reply setting out the opinion given by the Crown Law officers upon the promise made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> and its bearing upon the law subsequently enacted, which gave predominance to the claims of returned soldiers over those of mechanics who had passed examinations prior to the war. It is not true that junior mechanics have been placed in the positions vacated by the men to whom the honorable member has referred. There have been two junior mechanics appointed, but they were junior mechanics when they enlisted and went to the war. and their places had to be kept open for them. I am honestly endeavouring to carry out the policy of the Government. </para>

Messrs. Reid and Company were, therefore, informed on the 23rd July last that, owing to the failure of the Department to make the necessary demand within the prescribed time, no action would be taken to recover the amount, but the officer responsible for the neglect would be called upon to make good the shortage. </para>

                        <para>Before the introduction of the present regulations of restriction, the whole matter was considered at a conference of the Tramway and Electric Power managements with the Board, but the effect of expert opinion was that no economy of fuel could be effected by such a proposition, as it would be necessary to maintain the pressure of steam to meet recurrent load. It was, therefore, decided that the only effective way of saving fuel was to cut off tram services entirely in the evenings, and let the steam down. The hour of 7 p.m. was fixed, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, and was concurred in by the various tramway managements. </para>

Any further compensation is, therefore, not contemplated. In the case of munition workers, the Commonwealth recognises claims up to £20 for loss of tools, if such loss occurs whilst the tools are in the custody of the Commonwealth. Claims by munition and war workers up to £10 for loss of personal effects due to enemy action are also recognised, provided that in both cases satisfactory evidence of loss is submitted. This applies only to men who proceeded to England under . agreement with the Commonwealth. No information is available regarding any contemplated action by the Imperial Government. </para>

The general purport of the immigration law is to restrict the immigration of certain races, of persons mentally, physically, or morally weak, or who have been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for twelve months or more for certain crimes, or convicted of crimes of moral turpitude, irrespective of sentence, unless five years have elapsed since the expiration of the sentence in respect of such crimes.

                    <para>In this Bill we propose to deal with a new class, and the prevention of immigration and deportation come in as the chief matters to be considered. Speaking generally, aliens have no right to land in British territory unless, so far as the Commonwealth Act is concerned, they have been domiciled in the Commonwealth. That was first laid down in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Musgrove</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Ah Toy,</inline> reported in <inline font-style="italic">Appeals to the Privy Council</inline> in 1891 - </para>
                    <para>He can only do so if he can establish that an alien has a legal right, enforceable by action, to enter British territory. No authority exists for the proposition that an alien has any such right. Circumstances may occur in which the refusal to permit an alien to land might be such an interference with international comity as would properly give rise to diplomatic remonstrance from the country of which he was a native, but it is quite another thing to assert that an alien excluded from any part of  Her  Majesty's Dominions by the Executive Government there, can maintain an action in a British Court, and raise such questions as were argued before their Lordships on the present appeal - whether the proper officer for giving or refusing access to the country has been duly authorized by his own colonial Government, whether the colonial Government has received sufficient delegated authority from the Crown to exercise the authority which the Crown had a right to exercise through the colonial Government if properly communicated to it, and whether the Crown has the right without parliamentary authority to exclude an alien. Their Lordships cannot assent to the proposition that an alien refused permission to enter British territory can, in an action in a British Court, compel the decision of such matters as these, involving delicate and difficult constitutional questions affecting the respective rights of the Crown and Parliament, and the relations of this country to her self-governing colonies. </para>
                    <para class="block">Summarized, that judgment meant that an alien could be prevented from entering British territory, and had no legal remedy for such action; but I may say an alien who was domiciled here, but had gone abroad, was not prevented under our Act from returning; whether he is prevented by the Executive power referred to in the case I have quoted is a matter into which I do not wish to enter at this stage. In the case of <inline font-style="italic">Potter v. Minahan,</inline> reported in <inline font-style="italic">Seventh Commonwealth Law Reports,</inline> the High Court decided that - </para>
                    <para>A person whose permanent home is in Australia, and who, therefore, is a member of an Australian community, is not, on arriving in Australia from abroad, an immigrant in respect of whose entry the Parliament of the Commonwealth can legislate under power conferred by section 51, xxvii., of the Constitution, to make laws with respect to immigration, and, therefore, such a person is not an immigrant within the meaning of the Immigration Restriction Act 1901-05. </para>
                    <para class="block">That means, then, that a domiciled alien or other person is not an " immigrant." The report of the judgment goes on to state that - </para>
                    <para>Many definitions of domicile have been given, but they all embody the idea which is expressed in English by the word " home " - that is, permanent home. </para>
                    <para>The High Court, in <inline font-style="italic">Robtelmes</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Brenan,</inline> decided that it was an attribute of sovereignty that every State is entitled to decide what aliens shall or shall not become members of its community. The right of a nation to expel or deport foreigners from the country is as unqualified and undeniable as is the right to prevent them from entering the country, whether they are alien friends or enemies. Chief Justice Griffith said, in the case I have just mentioned - </para>
                    <para>I doubt whether the Executive authority of Australia or of any State could deport an alien, except under the conditions authorized by some Statute; but it is not necessary to discuss that question now. lt was fully considered by this Court in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Brown</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Lizars</inline></para>
                    <para>That case practically decided that deportations should not take place except under statutory authority. </para>
                    <para>I thought it well that honorable members should know what seems to me to be the law on the subject. It will be seen that even under the existing Immigration Act deportation is expressly provided for, but that it can take place only where there has been an evasion of the law. That is the principle of this Bill. Section 7 of the principal Act provides that- </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Every prohibited immigrant entering or found within the Commonwealth in contravention or evasion of this Act, shall be guilty of an offence against this Act, and shall be liable, upon summary conviction, to imprisonment for not more than six months, and, in addition to or substitution of such imprisonment, shall be liable, pursuant to any order of the Minister, to be deported from the Commonwealth. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That, then, is a general power to deport, irrespective of time, a prohibited immigrant who has come in by evasion of the law. There is another power to deport under section 5, but subject to a time limitation of two, to be changed ' now to three, years. Under that section, where an immigrant is found within the Commonwealth, and where it cannot be absolutely proved whether he has evaded the law or not; then within two years of his entry into the Commonwealth he may be called upon to undergo the dictation test. </para>

                    <para class="block">I want to show that this Bill makes no fundamental alteration of the law as it stands. The question of extent is another matter. As regards that, I may say that justice and, so far as safety permits, liberality should be applied to the administration of laws affecting international relations. Although sovereignty may empower, it does not morally justify, unreasonable exclusion - the absolute separation of somewhat kindred races whose bloods, in a paraphrase of the poet's words, " of colour, weight, and heat, that blended all together would quite confound distinction, yet" would then " stand off in differences so mighty." </para>
                    <para>Community leads to some understanding and knowledge, which diminish doubts, anxieties, and fears, such as have had so much to do with international troubles in the past. In a world of isolated groups sequestered from all mutual relations, the spread of Christianity would have had a poor chance. " Go and teach all nations," the august command, obedience to which transformed so much of the world, according to Newman, would not have been effective without some openings for intercourse, and at least temporary migration. In administration, then, there must be vision and tolerance in so far as circumstances can safely justify them. That is the significance of the preamble to the covenant of the League of Nations. As a matter of fact, the need for such tolerance is recognised, in accordance with the very best British traditions, by some of the leading newspapers in the Old Country, where extremists, perhaps, have made suggestions which the British community as a whole, whilst taking the power, should not recognise in administration. I find, for instance, in the last copy of the <inline font-style="italic">Athenceum</inline> to reach me, reference to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mail,</inline> by a writer named Boyd Cable, in which he urged the suppression, within the United Kingdom, of German art. In keeping with the finer, and yet absolutely patriotic, spirit of the British, there is an article by the editor containing these words - </para>

                    <para class="block">I do not want to tire the House by going further into this article, but it breathes a spirit which, although, perhaps, strangely expressed, must be recognised according to the best traditions .of British administration. Doubtless the references in the article are to great Democrats, some of whom may still remain, although, unfortunately, their spirit did not animate our enemy during the last war. My reference is to such historic names as Schiller, Beethoven, and Goethe. Schiller wrote the celebrated Triumphant Hymn to Democracy, or Joy, which Beethoven, whose works the writer of the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mail</inline> would shut out, set to the noblest music that ever lifted man's thoughts to the eternal. To Schiller I need not refer, because I think really all his dramatic versions were taken from cosmopolitan history.  His  greater subjects, such as Joan of Arc, had absolutely no relation to the Prussian spirit. Civilization in less dangerous days depended upon comparative freedom of relations. Athens, the city of mind, capital of a little State, perfect in secular culture and, as far as the days of serfdom would permit, democratic in organization, was a small corner of the earth to which, as Newman tells us, the pilgrim student came as to a shrine, where he might take his fill of gazing on the emblems and coruscations  of invisible, unoriginate  perfection. It was the centre in which some of the very best people in the then world congregated. Yet its national traditions and emotions were unaffected by the gathering there for education of the world clans of those days. " Greek patriotism," it has been well said, " fused the emotions' of the school and family, of inheritance and early training, of ' religion . and politics - all the best of boyhood with all the best of manhood - into one passionate whole." We must remember also that the mixture of the races depends upon the extent to which national individuality can be preserved without impairment. Community of traditions and sentiment must within reason be attained and preserved, and our object in taking power under this Bill is to protect, so far as for a time circumstances may require, our individuality as a nation against outside deterioration. We are anxious to see that the aftermath of the war has no deleterious effect on our victory, but at the same time the Act must be administered according to the best and safest traditions of British constitutional government. I may be wrong, but in common justice to one's feelings of temperance, I give utterance to these impressions. </para>
                    <para>Australia seems less affected by foreign and mixed immigration than is any other Dominion. There are many races in Canada. I find, for instance, that immigration into Canada latterly has been largely from the United States. In the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> of 11th June last reference is made to a pamphlet issued by the Canadian Government, in which it is stated, that the British immigration to Canada in 1914 totalled 142,622; those coming from the United States totalled 107,530, and from other countries 134,726. In these circumstances, Canada naturally has to be careful, apart altogether from the war, in dealing with her foreign immigration. I visited on one occasion a big Canadian city, Winnipeg, where I found that no less than fourteen newspapers, printed in different languages, were published. According to a recent statement in the <inline font-style="italic">Times -</inline></para>

They could not, of course, close the door altogether to people from foreign lands, but they could, and should, choose whom they should have; and they could do what ought to have been done in the past, but had not - they could give such people every assistance to become good Canadian citizens. </para>

                        <para>Canada has closed down all her immigration offices on the continent of Europe; she proposes to maintain in force, and it is so provided in the Bill, the war measure absolutely excluding Germans, Austrians, Bulgarians, and Turks; she intends to restrict in the future the migration of foreigners to Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, where the majority of the foreign-born population is concentrated and the problem of British character is very acute; she is maintaining severe restrictions against Asiatics on the Pacific slope. There is evidence to show that other Dominions are also becoming alive to the necessity for discrimination with a view to preserving their true British stock and character, and that, above all, their desire and aim are to attract the right type of immigrant from the British Isles. </para>

                            <para>- The law to which I am referring has been in operation since 1904, when an arrangement was entered into with India andi Japan to enable merchants, students, or tourist travellers to come in on obtaining passports from their own Governments on the lines prescribed. This dispensed with the dictation test, and permitted these classes to come in for twelve months. After twelve months, however, an application had to be made for a further extension, which was often given for four or five years, and sometimes a little longer. This arrangement was extended to apply to Burmese, Cingalese, Egyptians, Hong Kong Chinese, and also, under special conditions, to China-born Chinese.  In regard to Indians, in April, 1917, and again in 1918, the Imperial War Conference passed resolutions - indeed, the resolutions passed last year confirmed that of 1917 - which, in effect, asked that we should modify the arrangement by allowing those classes to come in for a certain time without asking at the end of a year for an exemption. This was purely a matter of dignity, and, on the recommendations made, a new arrangement was drawn up, which, so far as I can see, has been fairly accepted by the Indian Government. </para>

                    <para>The principal Act in Canada is that of 1911, and the most important sections are 38 and 41, to which I merely give the reference. According to press cuttings received in the last eight or ten days from London, a new Immigration Bill was introduced into the Canadian House of Commons on the 7th April last. This measure, says the <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> extends the time during which immigrants may be deported from three to five years, and greatly enlarges the list of the prohibited classes. A literary test is provided, and all those who advocated the overthrow of constitutional government will be barred, also, those who conspired against the Crown. Any aliens who have been interned in, or expelled from, Canada will be unable to enter. The Canadian Bill also provides for continuance of the war measure absolutely excluding Germans, Austrians, Bulgarians, and Turks. Asiatic labour, skilled and unskilled, is to be debarred. </para>
                    <para>It will be seen that the Bill before the House is not exceptional, and is, in fact, a little milder than others adopted by some of the Dominions. The United States of America also has gone beyond us, and for war reasons. The United States Immigration Act of 1917 deals with the immigration of certain classes, and the deportation of those classes. Section 3 provides for the exclusion, amongst others, of - anarchists, or persons who believe in or advocate the overthrow, by force or violence, of the Government of the United States, or of all forms of law, or who disbelieve in or are opposed to organized government, or who advocate the assassination of public officials, or who advocate or teach the unlawful destruction of property; </para>

                    <para class="block">That is the American section, and if honorable members compare it with the clauses of the Bill before them, they will see that the latter are actually more temperate. </para>

                            <para>- I am not sure. South Africa is in rather a peculiar position, because there many laws have to be amended- to bring them in consonance with British laws. As a matter of fact, however, in South Africa, the Government, some years ago, did exercise powers without an Act of Parliament, but had subsequently to obtain the sanction of the Imperial Government to the deportations they had effected. In regard to America, we have had to impose checks on the exercise of their powers to deport. The American Government claimed the right to deport some persons to Australia, and in one or two cases the men were stopped. We have taken the precaution of providing that no one shall land in Australia without a. passport, and those deported from America will not be allowed to land here unless their passports are vised by the British authorities, who have been asked to make proper inquiries. The United States law provides for deportation - to the country whence they came, or to the country of which such aliens are subjects or citizens, or the country in which they resided prior to entering the country from which they entered the United States. </para>

                            <para>- That is a matter for administration.What that provision really covers is the man who is opposed to organized government, and who wants to substitute force for reason. I am sure that views of that sort are not consistent with those held by honorable members on either side of the House. </para>

To show what was done in administration by the United States of America, as far back as 1894 men were sent from here whose entrance into the States was objected to on the ground that they had been criminals pardoned for their offences. There is, therefore, nothing very exceptional as regards principle or practice in what we propose. </para>

                            <para>- It is provided that, before the Minister can have authority to deport, he must have a Board of inquiry to give the man an opportunity of being heard. That is a far more temperate and moderate provision than has been enacted elsewhere. Even the Canadian Act provides that an ordinary officer may be a Board for this purpose. I do not know that it is fair that a man should be constituted a Board to inquire into his own action, or the action of one of his colleagues. </para>

                            <para>- It ought not to be a Star Chamber. The rules of administration are not drawn up yet, but I think I can interpret the sense of the Cabinet as meaning that the man is to be allowed every opportunity of pointing out how he stands, and of replying, and probably the hearing will be open. I cannot see any justification even for excluding counsel. In fact, what the man ought to be given is the same opportunity of having his case explained or his defence put before the Board as would be afforded to him by a Court of Justice. </para>

                            <para>- It is. and the provision seems, on the whole, reasonable in the circumstances. The Bill, which amends the Immigration Act, deals with immigrants, and does not give a general power to deport any one. The power of deportation is taken in relation to the classes whose immigration is prohibited, the chief of which comprises those whose efforts would be directed towards the destruction of organized government. I submit the Bill to the generous consideration of the House. </para>

                        <para>. - I hoped that I would not be called upon to address myself to this question to-day. I thought, after the adverse criticisms from the Ministerial side, that the Minister in charge of the Bill, and the Government, would read the signs of the times, and note that there is considerable dissension among their own followers regarding the introduction of a measure of this character, which may mean, at a time when every penny counts, the expenditure of many thousands of pounds with probably very little advantage accruing in return. However, as the Government have not withdrawn the Bill, we have perforce to resume its discussion. Without wishing to be too drastic or harsh, I would much rather be engaged in discussing something else that might be for the real benefit of the people in whose interests we are supposed to legislate. My belief is that the measure will result, not only in the duplication, but in the triplication, of activity, and, in fact, in more than its triplication, because nearly every State, in some sphere or other, has already covered, or is covering, the ground that is proposed to be traversed by the Institute of Science and Industry. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>If the Commonwealth is to launch out on the lines of this Bill, it is essential to precede it with a measure to settle once and for all, not only the Constitution of the Commonwealth, but the Constitution of every State in the Commonwealth. Without the adoption by the people of an amendment of the Constitution, giving this Parliament those powers that every National Parliament ought to enjoy, I can see that not only in this measure, but in others, we are going simply to follow slavishly along the track that has already been blazed, and more than blazed, by the State authorities. We ought to know where we are before we incur further expenditure on proposals of this nature. The present Ministry will be handed down to history as the Ministry of departmental constructors. They are establishing new Departments here, there, and everywhere, and new Departments under the auspices of government as carried on in Australia cannot be built up without a huge expenditure of money. This new Department, which has not been given statutory authority, has been struggling along now for some time, because it is four years since the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> indicated to the people of the Commonwealth that he, or his Government, intended to establish a Federal Institute of Science and Industry. At the latter part of 1915 a Committee was established by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> and held one meeting under his presidency. On that occasion his promise to his followers was that the Institute- of Science and Industry he sought to establish would not be controlled by faddists, theorists, or university professors, but would be an intensely practical concern, which would be useful to . the people of Australia. Since then we have dragged on for four years, and I would like to hear the Prime Minister indulging this afternoon in a retrospect of what the Institute in its embryo stage has so far accomplished. It would not be a very entertaining narrative. As a matter of fact, it would be a displeasing one, not only to the honorable gentleman himself, but also to the people of the country. However, we should know where we stand before entering upon a departure of this kind, involving a considerable expenditure of money, and bringing about the establishment of new Departments to do practically the same work as the States are now doing. As a first step, the Constitution should be amended to place Australia in the position that Canada &gt;or South Africa occupies. Only then will the necessary work of scientific investigation be carried, out by one authority for the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. The proposal now before us simply means adding a " seventh " wheel to the coach. In each of the six States there is already a wheel at work on scientific research, particularly in regard to agriculture. In introducing the Bill, the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> eulogized the efforts of some of the scientists employed in State institutions, and spoke of the benefits they had conferred on the people generally. The experiments conducted at the various agricultural colleges of the States in regard to the breeding of wheat have resulted in increased production, even in what may be termed the arid areas of the Commonwealth. </para>

It is hoped to achieve this result by both direct and indirect -means; directly, by the employment, of salaried investigators to assist iii specific researches, as well as 'by financial grants to institutions for improved equipment; indirectly, by proving to the public the value of industrial  scientific research, thus increasing the demand for trained specialists and improving their status and .the emoluments open to them. . . . </para>

                            <para>- There is a splendid technical school in Maryborough, in the honorable member's electorate. The old School of Mines has been enlarged to include all the subjects taught in up-to-date technical schools. I simply draw attention to this fact in order to point out that already the same set of .taxpayers have spent considerable sums of money in doing the class of work now proposed to be done under Federal control. I object to this proposed duplication of expenditure. No doubt there will be. need for " cooperation " and " co-ordination," words which have been freely used during this debate, but in the States there are already technical .colleges at which a lad who is serving his apprenticeship may attend night school. Every State Department encourages .its bright young officers to improve themselves in the lines in which they are working, or in other avenues, and gives them every opportunity to get into touch with the experts in . engineering and other subjects attached to the Working Men's College and similar technical institutions. Money which is spent on .education, technical, ordinary, or university, is money well spent, but, unfortunately, the universities of Australia are not open to the sons and daughters of the poorer sections of the community. </para>

                            <para>- Possibly the road may have been made easier in ,New South Wales in recent years, but even if reforms have been brought about, the facilities for giving a university training to the sons and daughters of the poorer section of the community are not what they ought to be in a democratic country. I would like to see the barriers wiped away, so that wherever a genius is discovered, that lad or lass may be given the -opportunity to pass from the higher schools to a university. The present  Speaker  of the Legislative Assembly in Victoria, who .at one time worked at my trade, succeeded in winning a couple of scholarships, and was able to attend a university. Here and there we can pick out men who have been able to climb to the top of the educational tree, but great numbers of young people are debarred in most of the States from doing so. However, notwithstanding the disabilities attaching to our higher educational system in the various States, particularly- Victoria, I contend there is no need to duplicate, educational institutions simply to enable Federal control to be exercised over them. </para>

In conversation with me three or four years ago he said, " I regret that I have not in this laboratory equipment with which I could test the tensile strength of steel." No doubt the Broken Hill' Proprietary Company has the machinery and experts for carrying out that work. But a comparatively poor manufacturer who undertakes a contract, the specifications of which provide for the use of steel of a specified strength, cannot afford to pay experts as the big corporations can do. What a fine thing it would be if he could go to a Commonwealth laboratory controlled by a man like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson,</inline> and have the tests made for him. Big names and magniloquent language will not bring assistance to primary industry. What is needed is the practical touch and the immediate help. </para>

                    <para>At the outbreak of war the Government were urged, as one of the first actions that should be taken to help the country through the coming struggle, to mobilize chemists and analysts. Australia to-day is particularly lacking in commercial chemists and analysts. Those manufacturing firms that are endeavouring to place upon the market certain goods which were formerly supplied by enemy countries complain, " Our great disability in the effort to supplant Germans and others in Australia to-day is that we have not the properly equipped and trained commercial chemists." The present and past Governments would have been wise if they had paid attention to that deficiency. Chemistry has played a marvellous part in the establishment and carrying on of the industries of Germany. The honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> referred to the aniline dyes, which, he said, had been originally invented in Great Britain, and pilfered by Germany. I question that statement. I know that twenty-six years of chemical investigation preceded the production of synthetic dyes in Germany. Several of the great commercial concerns combined in setting chemists <inline font-style="italic">ta</inline> work upon this problem, and after twenty-six years they discovered the secret of aniline dye manufacture. Since that day Germany has had command of the world's dye markets.

Then a synthetic dye was invented in Great Britain, which for some years dominated the trade in that article. Later, German chemists discovered an improved method of manufacturing synthetic dyes, and left the British people, as we deserved to be left, in a very bad position. </para>

The members of that Commission were mainly practical farmers. I had the pleasure of meeting some of them, and was struck, not only with their Scotch accent, but also with their practical outlook. One paragraph of their report stated - </para>

                        <para>Research. - In comparison with research work carried out in Scotland, where the subject has not received the attention which it deserves, the extensive arrangements which are made, the encouragements which are given to experiment, and investigation in Australia, are gratifying and surprising. Pleasant also is the universal enthusiasm discovered in the directors of experiment stations, and, indeed, in all connected with the work of development. It appeared to us, however, that a considerable amount of overlapping was going on, that in general there was a want of co-ordination and co-operation, that the policy of allowing each State to attempt to attack the solution of each agricultural problem by itself was not the most economical. </para>

                    <para class="block">I admit that the paragraph goes on to draw attention to an overlapping of State activities and suggests that it would be better if the Commonwealth undertook the whole of the work under one organization and authority. I repeat that if the Commonwealth Parliament were in a position to assume entire control of the application of science to industry I would support such action, but the Commonwealth is not able to do that. By reason of the constitutional limitations placed upon the Commonwealth authority the proposed Institute will become merely the seventh authority to carry on scientific and industrial research in Australia. I see no chance of avoiding that; therefore, I hope that the Government will see fit to withdraw the Bill for the time being. </para>

The pork butcher of Chicago rendered his name imperishable by endowing some scientific or learned institute with a new library, or a much needed laboratory. So it is hoped that the wealthy pastoralists, mine-owners, or merchant princes of Australia will show their appreciation of the land from which their wealth has been derived by helping present and future generations to render themselves more efficient antagonists in the economic struggle to come. </para>

                    <para class="block">In other words, we must teach ourselves; and unless we have a natural aptitude for the work, it is useless for us to go to teachers for instruction. The Commonwealth has not control of education; but when our Constitutions are cast into the melting-pot, I hope they will emerge in such a form as will give the National Parliament supreme power, with the right to delegate certain matters to minor provincial councils. When that is done, we shall, doubtless, have charge of education, in connexion with which we ought to do in Australia what is being done in other countries. Japan, which is going to be a very keen competitor of ours, adopted western methods, comparatively speaking, only a few years ago, and in doing so availed herself of her educational system with marked results. The master of every school was instructed that any Japanese lad displaying certain qualities should be specially taught, with a view to the development of those qualities, and sent on from class to class until he reached the top of the tree in the particular profession, trade or calling for which he was adapted, and so with every Japanese lass. There is no such following up of our geniuses by the Education Departments of Australia. Here and there a genius may have rich parents or an interested teacher to guide him in the course that he should follow to achieve success. But, unfortunately, one of the troubles of society in Australia to-day is that we have too many round pegs in square holes. We have many people performing duties for which they are totally unfit, whereas in other walks of" life they would prove eminently useful. I do not know that the Institute of Science and Industry, for which this Bill provides, will help us to steer clear of such a system. Until we know where we are in this regard, why should we agree to establish an Institute to work on lines similar to those pursued by various institutions in the States? We have no money to burn, and we should know exactly what is to be done under this Bill. </para>
                    <para>The sugar industry of Australia owes the position that it occupies to-day to the introduction of scientists and other experts by the rich company which controls it.

That may also be said of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. When the Broken Hill mines were first opened up the intention was to mine for silver. </para>

Great developments have taken' place as the result of the application of science to the industry.

'It seems' to me that we should first of all endeavour to secure an amendment of the' Constitution to enable- us' to deal with matters that should properly be the subject of Commonwealth legislation'; that we should' then build up a Tariff that' would protect our industries, and that, having done that, we might establish an Institute of Science and Industry on proper' lines. </para>

The Advisory Committee say that it is most important that we should train our artisans. My contention is that we should first of all establish a scientific Tariff to protect our industries. </para>

                    <para>We already have in the' States various institutions for technical training. I think, honorable members would be- surprised to hear how many institutions- in which technical training is given are' already established in- the several States. I do not complain' of. expenditure,- but I regard this as unnecessary ; and, certainly, the same set of taxpayers -who will have to foot the bill are objecting to being thus overloaded. According to the report to which I have already referred, the expenditure in connexion with the Institute up to 30th June, 1917, was £3,593, and I suppose that it has very much increased in the intervening two years. If this expenditure was placed on the Estimates it must have been hidden away in some small corner and left unexplained by the Government; indeed, of recent years we have had no opportunity of looking into the finances, and when we do we shall be appalled. Yet we have honorable members glibly supporting a Bill of this kind, which must involve a much larger expenditure than we can foresee. </para>
                    <para>The telephone, there is not the slightest doubt, is going to play an important part in the life of Australia, which is a country of great distances. At the present time we cannot be said to have an up-to-date telephone system. I am not now referring to the cities only, but more particularly to the out-back districts of the country, where it is highly necessary that the people should be placed in communication with their markets, with medical men, and so forth. Some time ago I had the temerity to ask the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Webster)</inline> whether his Department were elaborating any extensive scheme of telephone extension in the country districts, and the honorable gentleman expressed surprise that such' a question should be asked in these times. We are complaining of the rush of people to the cities, and of the few advantages enjoyed by the country people, and proper telephone extensions would tend to make country life more bearable. I feel so strongly on this matter that I should be prepared to support the expenditure of £500,000 in the direction I have indicated. During the war work has been done in the Government workshops that was never done there before. I have personally inspected telephone appliances in steel, copper, and more delicate material still, and I can say that from every point of view they are not only as good, but in many cases superior, to imported articles. I have appealed to the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Webster)</inline> to give a chance to our own trained artisans, of whom many have attended technical colleges, and one, at any rate, of whom I know effected a valuable improvement in certain appliances. And yet that man is to-day walking the streets unemployed, although his invention was the means of saving money to the Postal Department. Not .long ago I asked the Postmaster-General whether he was prepared to have a number of common battery machines manufactured in Australia. The honorable gentleman's reply was peculiar, but I am satisfied that he will not be able to satisfactorily gainsay what has been asserted in opposition to his attitude. As was proved during war time, this telephonic material can be manufactured in our own workshops; but as soon as -peace is declared we find the Postal Department sending their orders abroad. No one can deny that all work of this kind should be encouraged, but the men who were making the appliances during the war have been put on the streets by the Government, the work now being executed by artisans in other parts of the world. I think a little " science and industry " in the Postal Department would not be amiss. Reform, like charity, should begin at home; we should reform ourselves before we try to reform the world. </para>
                    <para>This Bill is not one that ought to be accepted by the House at such a time as this; and I feel convinced that its supporters will at some time confess that they are wrong. We ought to weigh well every proposition, especially one like this, involving the expenditure of large sums of money. I am certain that the people of the country generally will not indorse this legislation. There are great Government workshops at Newport, at Islington, Ipswich, and Clyde, and every appliance we need ought, as far as possible, to be manufactured there. We all recognise that the inventor is very much wedded to his ideas, and apt to be regarded as a nuisance, but inventors ought to be encouraged. The combined harvester and other agricultural implements had their origin in Australia; but it is not every inventor that can command the capital to carry out his ideas. Many men of brains have had to take their ideas abroad in order to find  appreciation. In one case I can remember, in. pre-war days, two young Victorian engineers, who had an invention to dispose of, were given the cold-shoulder, not only by Australian manufacturers, but by British manufacturers. They took themselves to Germany, and there they found a firm ready and willing to give them every assistance. A special part of a workshop was set aside for them in which to carry on their experiments, and they were  given  high salaried positions. Their invention turned out a huge success, as I am informed by a man who has personally inspected the results. If I had my way every inventor who could satisfy a committee that his invention was on the right lines, would be given room in the Government workshops, and assisted in every way to perfect his ideas. There are a thousand and one ways in which, without the expenditure of large sums on an Institute of Science and Industry, assistance could be given to both our primary and secondary industries. I am surprised that the Government are not keeping a tighter hand on the purse-strings, for they must recognise that the character of the men at the head of this Institute indicates exceptional expenditure. </para>

The reports of the Institute may make very nice reading, but the hard pressed taxpayer will say, " To Hong Kong with your grandiloquent language; who is going to foot .the bill?" The Institute will move along at a snail's pace, and only long days hence can the primary or secondary industries receive any benefit. I regret that the Bill is to be proceeded with.

                    <para>If we want to establish one authority to carry out research work throughout the Commonwealth, there should be granted to this Parliament, precedent  to  that, the power to do so, and to tell the States to keep within their proper spheres. As it is now, with the States enjoying greater powers than we as a National Parliament exercise, they will continue their expensive work ; investigation, research, and technical training will all go on in the six States; on top of all this the Federal Government will establish another Bureau, and the same set of taxpayers will have to pay for it all.

Some of the members even on this side of the chamber seem' to have lost sight of the actual provisions of the Bill. It provides for the election of three directors, one  of  whom need not necessarily be a scientist, but the other two are to be scientists. They are to be appointed for five years. The Governor-General appoints one of them to be  chairman,  and the Cabinet recommends the salaries. They are to be paid certain travelling expenses, and, in case, of incapacity, the Minister has power to suspend. A Board of Inquiry of three is appointed, and makes a recommendation to the Minister, and on that recommendation the Government will act. That means that it will remove the suspension cr discharge the officer. The directors have to give the whole of their time to the work. In each State an Advisory Council is appointed, and receives simply travelling expenses and fees. The most important part of the Bill, which seems to be lost sight of by honorable members on the other side, is that defining the  powers and functions of the directors. This is clause 13, which provides - </para>

                    <para>This is a Bill which will bring to life an institution that will be very far-reaching and have a considerable influence on the welfare of Australia. I do not want to approach the question from a party point of view. I thought with pleasure when I saw the Bill that it was outside the realm of party politics, and that we could look at it through national eyes, in the light of what has been done in other parts of the Empire and of the world, particularly during the last four or five years of this gigantic war, and so profit by the experience of other countries. There is no doubt that at present scientific research in Australia suffers from the scarcity of trained men and of apparatus. We have too few laboratories, and too few trained men to- fill them. I have been rather fortunate in the last three or four years in having the opportunity to see what is being- done in other parts of the world to fill the gap between science and industry. I had the pleasure of seeing at Teddington, near London, the National physical laboratory, which absolutely opened one's eyes to the possibilities and potentialities of this movement, and to what a nation is absolutely losing by failing to grapple with these scientific and industrial questions.This Institute, when brought to life under this Bill, is going to fill the gap in the. same way as the national, physical laboratories in the Old Country are doing. </para>

                    <para>There are many problems which are common to the whole of Australia, or to the greater part of it, and it would appear that time and money would be saved by placing some of the work of research in the hands of a Federal Department. For example, every State is afflicted with various stock diseases. In Queensland, there is "tick fever"; and in another, " dry bible " ; in another, there is "coast disease"; and so on. A strong and well-equipped Federal Department would seem more likely to cope with such diseases than the weaker and less well-equipped States Departments. The prickly pear, again, is not a State monopoly, but may, through time, spread over most of the country; and here again is an argument for Federal control, which would not absorb or limit the energies of the State Departments, but concern itself with a broader and a wider field. </para>

It has been alleged by honorable members opposite that the Universities are academic and unpractical institutions, but what we shall see here, when the Institute is established, is a closer association between it and the Universities. It will work in close co-operation with the Universities, just as similar institutes in the Old Country are doing. The Universities are permanent training bodies. Their duties are primarily those of teaching and training. The primary duties of the Institute will be connected with research. The Institute will employ graduates; it will not make them. The graduate who has gone through the Universities will, in this body, finish, or perhaps start, his career. He will launch out where he can make some money for himself - an opportunity which is denied to the scientist in Australia to-day. If the Institute is successful, it will impart a great stimulus to the science side of our Universities, and I think we shall find that we have the co-operation of the Universities, as well as the co-operation of the States themselves. </para>

We find, however, that conferences have been held on all these different subjects, a great many of them in Victoria; and I fail to discover that any of the States, or the scientists  of  any of the States, are opposed in any particular relation to the measure now before us. I admit that, perhaps a little less than a year ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan,</inline> the Premier of Queensland, circularized all the members of this august body to oppose this Bill, for the reason that we were trenching on State rights; but I am inclined to think that, with the opportunity of further experience, and of broadening his views, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> has withdrawn that circular, because he sees that the objection he had at that time to the prospective operations of the Institute of Science and Industry, particularly his idea that in the matter of the cattle tick, it was going to undo, instead of assisting, all the work that had been done in Queensland, was unfounded. I quite admit that the cattle tick was a problem which almost wholly and solely interested the State of  Queensland, and that it was only the northern part of New South Wales, in the Lismore district, that had a visitation of the pest. </para>

                        - that is, along the fringe bounded by the coastal range, the cattle tick will meander gracefully, in time, right down to the south. Queensland was rather afraid that we were going to spoil the work done by her Bureau in that matter; but she now sees, I think, eye to eye with us.  Her  people recognise that to deal with the pest is a matter of national importance. . They know that scientists in America have been able to cleanse certain areas in a certain time, and thus to push the tick gradually back. It seems to me that when a pest such as the cattle tick is likely to cross the boundaries of one particular State, it is time for the national laboratory and national scientists to step in and cope with it. It is generally recognised that Australia has been absolutely neglectful of the scientific education of her young people.

                        One cannot pick up a publication written by a man of letters of to-day without seeing that the shortcomings of the British Empire from both an industrial and a military point of view have been due to the nation's shortsightedness in educational matters. Many young men seeking a profession in life choose law or medicine, but if it were possible to hold out inducements to our youths and girls to continue their studies at the Universities in the science classes, with the possibility of securing preferment afterwards in remunerative occupations, we should find them freely taking up a course of training which would be of the greatest benefit to the whole community. When Professor David, who accompanied the Shackleton expedition to the Antarctic regions, and who has done a tremendous amount of geological and metallurgical work in New South Wales, was entertained on his return from the Front, he said that science had played a far more important part in the war than . any one would imagine from the small hints that had been dropped from time to time.

"It is up to each one of us, as scientific men," he proceeded, "to see that the importance of science for national existence, whether in peace or in war, is properly appreciated by the public, and that scientific research finds its proper place in the history of this great Commonwealth." </para>

Formerly the youth of this country fought shy of science. There was no opportunity of making a living as a chemist or biologist. The proposed Institute will convince producers and manufacturers that science will pay. If it succeeds the Universities will have more students. We know that it is only education and training that fit a man for his life's work. The Universities and schools look to the States for financial assistance. If this Institute ceased to exist to-morrow not one penny of the money spent upon it would be available for the States. Recently in connexion with an investigation into the kaolin deposits and clays of Bendigo, an advertisement was inserted in the newspapers asking for the services of a clay expert, but there was not a sufficiently trained man in Australia. Recently, also, in Western Australia experts were required in a particular line, but they could not be obtained. There is such a dearth of trained men in Australia that some of our industries, if they are not already languishing, soon will be. </para>

                    <para>I believe in the proposal to establish research scholarships, but our experience in Australia of such scholarships is that the men of genius who have won them, and gone further afield, have remained abroad where their scientific attainments have obtained recognition. I hope that such provision will be made that Australia will not lose the services of those who gain travelling research scholarships! </para>
                    <para>The most important work of an Institute of this kind is the establishment of laboratories in which practical tests will be carried out. It is suggested that the cost of running the Institute will be about £15,000 or £20,000 per annum. I do not object to that expenditure provided the Commonwealth gets the value that other countries seem to get from expenditure in this direction. I recommend to honorable members opposite, and to those honorable members on this side who do not see eye to eye with the Ministry in regard to this Bill, two reports of the Committee of the Privy Council for Scientific and Industrial Research for the years 1916-17 and 1917-18.

This development on a semi-manufacturing 'scale is, indeed, one of the most difficult parts of research, resulting in a new product, and the importance of it is shown by the fact that all the large industrial research laboratories, however concerned they may be with the theory of the subject, have, as parts of the laboratory, and under the direction of the research staff, experimental manufacturing plants which duplicate many of the processes employed in the factory itself. </para>

As a general rule, I do not applaud the commencement of Government institutions without parliamentary authority, but the step having already been taken, the Institute having been established, and its necessity having been demonstrated,  it is now useless to cut its throat simply because some one did something a few years ago that should not have been done. The Leader of the Opposition has also twitted the Government with the expenditure on the journals printed by the Institute Advisory Council, but I recommend those publications to the close perusal of every honorable member. I go further, and recommend the publishers to be prepared to lose a little more money on them, by reducing the price to 6d., so that every person in the community may become .acquainted with the work which is being done by the Advisory Council. </para>

I take it that the Government will see they are properly advised in making appointments. However, we ought not to be pernicketty  in regard to the salaries or fees to be paid. Let us get the best scientists and the very best brains available, and pay them well. If we can give the University graduates the assurance, that they will have ample opportunity of preferment; if we get the very best apparatus that money can buy; and if we send to the other side of the world and bring back those Australian students who have been doing most excellent work for the Empire during the war, and are now completing their -studies abroad - if we bring them back to  help us in developing our secondary and primary industries - any expenditure in this direction will be money well spent. Honorable members say that in passing this Bill we are entrenching on the rights of the States. I fail to see how some of the complex questions which are common to the whole of Australia can be handled by the States treating them separately unless they go over the same ground-work. These aTe problems which should be solved by a central body, as is done in the United States of America, Canada, Great Britain, and elsewhere. </para>
                    <para>Only by realizing what is done in other countries can one see in proper perspective the need for a physical laboratory, and the part it is playing in the world's work. It was an eye-opener to me to see what was being done in scientific industry i-n. the Old Country. The lack of a National physical laboratory in Australia to-day is a crime. I am not speaking of a small academic retort in a scientist's room at the University. "What we require is a .physical laboratory at which we shall be able to make practical tests in the mass, demonstrate to the manufacturer what can be done, and ask him to apply those demonstrated processes to his industry. In order to apply science to industry, -we must have a. staff of trained scientists, .and if we wish to hold our place in the race of nations we must be at least abreast, and, if possible, ahead of, our competitors in scientific investigations and the practical application of its results. We must offer greater rewards to science. The laws of nature must be the same in the works as in the laboratory; principles which apply to the one must apply to the other. There must be no divergence between practice and theory. The tests of alloys, -to be effective, must be made on the same scale as in the works. .Small .pieces of metal cool too quickly, and differ in many other respects from larger masses. So, too, in regard to mechanical treatment; the forging, rolling, and even casting must be carried on with an experimental plant rather than, in the ordinary laboratory. Impurities, and the rate of cooling, also, must be studied. </para>
                    <para>We know that in the past Great Britain has been slow to realize the need for scientific advice. What is required now is scientific control, and the sooner we realize that the better. It is "necessary that we should create in. Australia, amongst those who control our industries, an adequate appreciation of science and its possibilities. We must make industry attractive. We must set up a National laboratory, with apparatus and experimental plant, involving the permanent employment of skilled labour and scientific supervision. One physical laboratory, for Australia should be able to sup- ply an equipment which cannot be reproduced, in a number of colleges. Surely we ought to be able to set up one National laboratory that will investigate and solve all the problems that beset Australia. In such a laboratory appliances could be used which it would not be safe to place in the hands of a student; to handle them we" must have trained men. The National laboratory would work in close touch with the- universities and colleges, co-ordinating and supplementing their activities. Before the war; not one, but many such laboratories were established by Germany. Two of the most famous were those at Charlottenburg and Gross Licherfelde. Famous also are the Federal laboratories at Zurich, in Switzerland. In the United States of America, there are: Bureaux of Standards, and in. France the National laboratory. I. hope to see- the establishment in Australia o£ a National physical laboratory. </para>

                        - I have no. parochial sympathies in regard, to such a. project as a National laboratory. Establish it where you like. Let its organization be such that private firms may utilize it. paying fees for the work done for them.. In. the greatest physical laboratory in England,. I,, as an Australian, was delighted to find that the most important branch of the metallurgical work was under the control, of a young Melbourne doctor of science, who had won a travelling scholarship.  His  work, included the testing of guns, weighing in some instances over 80 tons when, completed ; the testing of. aeroplanes,, measuring 60 feet across the wings ; laboratory tests of the tensility  of metals, the alternating stress of metals, and the breaking strain of different steels, so that when the parts were put info motor cars, aeroplanes, and guns, the makers knew exactly what strain they would stand. The only test they were subject to was the test in the mass in a practical laboratory, worked out on a model scaling 4 or 5 feet to an inch. When the formulas and plans were approved, they were passed on to the operatives in the factories. I' mention this work' as showing that, whilst we in Australia have yet to recognise- science, other parts of the world, have been quick to appreciate and take advantage of its potentialities. It would be the greatest delight of my life to see a. National physical laboratory established in Australia, let the cost be £10,000, £20,000, or £100,000. One honorable member stated the other day that he would spend £500,000- on- telephone extensions. No doubt, telephones are necessary; but let us put our money into a National reproductive work, from which we shall get real value, and which will determine the place that Australia is to occupy in the race of nations1.

                    <para>My hope is that when this Institute is established, it will include a properly-equipped laboratory, which will undertake, amongst other things, a study of aeronautics. Aero-planes' cannot be built under Australian climatic conditions upon models and plans designed and tested in the Old Country. We must have facilities for testing electrical machinery, and for the testing and standardization of all forms of electricity meters1,, the standardization of thermometers, and the testing, of gauges. One of the most important " things in connexion with metal manufacture is the testing of. gauges. Gauges of the- diameter and calibre of cylinders in engineering works must be exact enough <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> register within one ten-thousandth part of an inch. I should like to know what was the experience of Australian manufacturers during the war in. connexion with the making of munitions, and,, particularly shell cases. </para>

                            <para>- I saw the women graduates of English Universities and other scientists testing gauges for different munitions. Shell gauges, for instance, were tested to within- one ten-thousandth, part of an inch in order to insure perfect fitting in the guns. The gauges were then sent to the different private munition works. When I saw that testing, work in progress, I wondered what would happen if Australia made munitions and sent them to the Old Country. I do not think- it is possible, without a proper laboratory and! a standardization branch, for us in Australia to be self-contained, and to produce munitions for use with our own big guns. </para>

                            <para>- The testing of these gauges took place at the National physical laboratory, and without such a laboratory and trained scientists, it would be impossible to make shells to fit the guns with the requisite precision. Australia hopes to engage in shipbuilding on a large scale, and we must have a laboratory at which we can make our own models, which must undergo practical tests. It is a mistake to imagine that without such models and tests we can design, build, and launch ships. This National laboratory will carry on experiments in physical metallurgy and the production of tungsten steel, and will make analyses of iron, steel, and non-ferreous alloys, and chemical glassware and porcelain. </para>

                    <para>The British Government has set apart £1,000,000 for a department of scientific and industrial research. Returning to the Orient, we find that Japan has voted for one year £500,000 for a similar purpose. France is allocating many hundreds of thousands of pounds for scientific research, and Canada, with a population of 7,000,000, less than double that of Australia, has promised to make available £1,000,000 for this work. Activities in this connexion are world wide. In India, Chili, and other parts of the world, Bureaux of Science and Industry have been set up, and particularly for standardization, because they are regarded as necessary to insure the industrial survival of nations, and because it is realized that those countries which do not give industry the aid of science straight away, will be late in the hunt. One of the results of the war has been to teach Britain that she can be, to a large extent, self-contained. Before, the war all her supplies of potash came from Germany. Now England gets all the potash she requires from a new electrolytic process. Optical glasses, for which we were formerly dependent upon the factories of Jena, in Germany, are now manufactured in England. English magnetos have supplanted the German product, and, the Mother Country is now independent of foreign countries in regard to tungsten steel, which is used in the manufacture of filaments for electric lamps; thorium, which comprises 90 per cent, of the constituents of incandescent gas- burners; hard porcelain; thymol, a valuable anti-septic which the Germans produced from oil of an Indian seed ; aspirin, and salicylic acid. Germany formerly had the monopoly of the production of aniline dyes, which originally were an English invention. English chemists have now made the Old Country self-contained in that respect. I mention these facts as illustrating what science can do for a country. </para>
                    <para>The production of Australia in 1916 represented a value of £270,427,000, comprising: Agriculture, £60,207,000; pastoral, £89,940,000; dairy, poultry, and bee farming, £26,949,000; forestry and fisheries, £5,505,000; mining, £23,621,000; and manufactures, £64,305,000. The purpose of the creation of an Institute of Science and Industry is to show how this production can be increased. If that is not to be its duty, its establishment will be a waste of time, money, and energy. But we know from . the history of other nations that production can be increased by the application of science to industry. Honorable members have asked what has this Institute done to justify its existence during the last three or four years. What has it done, for instance, in regard to the prickly pear? In Queensland there are 20,000,000 acres overrun with this pest, and that area is increased to the extent of 1,000,000 acres every  year. Queensland has introduced the cochineal bug to cope with it, and by this means, as well as by gas spraying and other schemes propounded ,by the Institute, it is hoped to keep the pest in check. Prickly pear is found chiefly in Queensland, but it also occurs in New South Wales. The discovery of a means of eradicating it is a national matter, and the Commonwealth must subsidize this Institute, and arrange for it to work with the State scientists in devising means for the extermination of the pest. We know what the Institute has done also in regard to improvements in the tanning _ of leather, engineering standardization, paper pulp, and the treatment of weevil in wheat. What Professor Lefroy has done in regard to the last-named evil speaks for itself, and the same scientific remedies will deal with weevil in maize. Much has been done in Australia to promote the cultivation of wheat. The late William Farrar, of New South Wales, by hybridizations, evolved different types of dry-country wheat, as the result of which we have been able to carry on wheat-growing in different parts of Australia where before it was thought to be quite impossible. </para>

In 1916 a committee of experts estimated that Queensland had lost £7,000,000 as the result of the direct ravages of the tick, exclusive of the losses due to loss of condition of other stock and the reduced production of milk as the result of the pest. There is also much room for investigation with regard to bitter pit, fruit fly, and the codlin moth; also lung worm in sheep, nodules in cattle, and blow-fly in sheep. The ravages of the fruit fly have been responsible for a loss of some millions of pounds to our fruit-growers. Professor Lefroy, who recently visited Australia to investigate the blow-fly trouble, has told us that the parasite controlling blowfly in sheep in England has been discovered, and that the control of the Australian blow-fly can be definitely guaranteed. It is estimated that we suffer a loss of £3,000,000 a year because of this pest. The blow-fly maggot was first discovered in the Riverina district in 1897, and honorable members are familiar with the ravages caused by it. The spread of the pest has been largely brought about by the improvement made in the weight of our sheep, and in the fineness of the yolk. One of the penalties of improving cur breed of sheep has been the creation of a better harbor for the blow-fly. </para>
                    <para>While dealing with the necessity for scientific research in relation to the sheep-growing industry, I would point out that statistics of recent years do not show that we are improving to any extent, except in so far as the price and quality of the wool are concerned. </para>

                            <para>.- There is much room for scientific research by the Institute of Science and Industry in regard to coal. There is a loss of £200,000,000 yearly in Great Britain by the consumption of raw instead of carbonized coal. That sum represents the value of the byproducts wasted. It is estimated that £20,000,000 is the yearly loss through failure to- save the benzol from; which toluene, one of the three constituent parts of the high explosive T.N.T. is made. The wastages' from coal include sulphate of ammonia, the base for high explosives ; aniline' dyes and paints, antiseptics, and drugs'. In Australia, we must make full scientific use of our' coal by-products. In England these are the prices' of coal' - 1913- -10s.1d. per ton. 1915 - 12s. 5d. per ton. 1916' - 15s. 7d. per ton. </para>

                    <para>Kiau-Chau, in China, on the Shantung Peninsula, formerly held by Germany, are now Japanese. Japan is not so much against a' White Australia, but she is up against western interference with her eastern plans. Labour' unrest in England makes capitalists wary, hence investments in China and the East with its. cheap labour. Australia must combat this- competition, because' she is a country of high wages'; and science and cheaper production must be our: remedy. There is English and American capital invested in factories' in China, where, by means of sweating and cheap labour, goods are produced,, and Australia is flooded, with these goods; and the Tariff, will not prevent this sort of thing. This is really a floating of the White Australia policy, and is perhaps, worse than if; the coolies were brought here. As a matter of fact, there is a boom in. foreign investment in China and other foreign countries greater than was the case after, the Napoleonic wars. The Japanese have gained control over the Tayeh  iron mines, in central China, where there are- enormous quantities of. easily- worked ores. These, of. course, are very valuable to Japan, in which, country there is hardly any ore; and in the twenty-one- demands that Japan presented to China in 1915 was included recognition of control over those mines. When we see such developments in the East - cheap labour and enormous production- we must ask ourselves the question as to what is to be the future of Australia ? Science applied to industry is the answer. The Hanyang iron works, on the river, are run as an adjunct to these mines. I regret that time does not permit of my dealing with many other aspects of this question, which is one of supreme importance to Australia. Perhaps I might be permitted to conclude, in the words of Shakespeare - </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is in favour of it, and that is' only to be expected, for' he, himself, and his col- league, the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> were members of the Government in 1916 when the Institute was proposed. Both of these honorable members are fully acquainted with the details, and both, as I say, were members of the Government which was pledged to the hilt to see that the Institute was brought into existence. We, therefore, ask why the Leader of the Opposition has submitted this amendment ? Let us see what the amendment is. In the first place, it declares that before the Government proceeds with this Bill, they ought to inform the House as to the approximate cost of the Institute- That is a strange contention when we remember that the Leader of the Opposition and the honorable member for Capricornia were members of the Government during January, 1916, and from then to about September or October of 1916, and that the honorable member for Capricornia, although Treasurer at that time, never in that period, on any of his Estimates, indicated what was to be the cost of the Institute. A meeting was held during the month of January, 1916, to which I shall refer later on, and the proposal for the Institute was launched. During the financial year 1916-1.7 the Advisory Council, which was a body created for the purpose of doing work prior to the establishment of the Institute, expended ?3,593; in 1917-18, it expended ?7,174; and in 1918-19, ?8,939. </para>

                            <para>- Obviously the honorable member and his colleagues will say it, because they were responsible all along for it. I have shown that while they were in the Government money was spent. I have shown the sums of money spent in each successive year. Honorable members put to me, later on, the question of what the cost of the Department wa3 going to be. That was a very reasonable question to put. As was pointed out by the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> during the debate, the detailed expenditure obviously must be shown in the Appropriation Bill; but as a guide to honorable members as to what was in the mind of the Minister in charge of the Department when the last Estimates were passed, I refer honorable members to these two items:' On page 165 of the Estimates, £20,000 was put down for salaries, contingencies, and expenses in connexion with investigation; and at page 290 of the Works Estimates, £3,000 was put down for the establishing and equipping of laboratories, experimental stations, &amp;c. Honorable members asked me last year when that item was before the House, "If we pass it, will it commit us to the Bill that is before Parliament ? " The honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> will remember putting that question. My reply was, " No ; the question of the Institute in its permanent form will have to come before Parliament in a separate Bill." We are now acting absolutely in accordance with the policy as then declared. It is utterly impossible at this stage to attempt to tell the House what the cost of this Department is going to be. All I can do is to give an indication of what sums of money the Minister who will administer the Institute thinks he will require during the first year, when he is making his commencement and laying the foundations. </para>

                            <para>- It cannot cost more than Parliament permits. In connexion, with the creation of the Commonwealth Departments, a Bill was generally brought down establishing the particular Department, and then the Estimates followed, showing the appropriations that would be necessary to carry it out. Parliament, therefore, has the power of appropriation. </para>

                            <para>- I quite admit the force of the remark of the honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Atkinson).</inline> It is quite right, also, for the Leader of the Opposition to say, " Come over here," because he and his Government were the men responsible for introducing that system. When the honorable member for Capricornia was Treasurer,' he could not always bring his Estimates down and get them through within the financial year to which they applied. Now that the war is over, let us hope that we shall revert to the normal condition of affairs. </para>

                            <para>- The Bill provides for the making of arrangements for it to be done, and I shall presently show the House what hae been done. This work will really be supplementary to State activities, except so far as the States themselves desire to abandon activities. The desire is to cover a field that cannot be effectively covered by the States. Honorable members will see presently from one or two quotations which I shall make that there are some States which cannot possibly cover the ground effectively. If Tasmania is left unaided, will the honorable member for Wilmot (Mx. Atkinson) tell me what appropriation it can make out of its revenues to establish a proper scientific research department to investigate, for instance, the question of mining? </para>

                        Taylor belongs to our Meteorological Department, and is a man of very high repute. I have given the names of the representative body that was asked to consider the establishment of an Institute of Science and Industry. From that body an Advisory Committee was constituted to formulate proposals to the Government to. establish a Commonwealth Bureau of Science and Industry. It was a most representative Committee, and presented a series of recommendations, the first of which was that a Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry should be established by Act of Parliament. The functions of the Institute were then set forth, and, generally speaking, the main points were very much the same as those incorporated in. the Bill now before us. The recommendations included the following -

It was then approved- by the Government in power at the time.

                            <para>- I am not aware that it has ever been confined in that way. I have shown that when the scheme for the Institute of Science and Industry was first formulated, the whole of the then State Governments were asked to send their representatives. There' were also present the representatives of the Universities and of different State institutions. They formulated the scheme for this Institute, and the Bill is based on their report. An Advisory Council was also constituted as they proposed, and it has done a good deal of work. It was never anticipated that it would continue in existence for so- long, because it was thought that the Institute would be established much sooner. </para>

                    <para>At this Conference the following were present: - The then Acting Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> as President; the State Ministers of Agriculture,  Hon.  F. W. Hagelthorn, Victoria;  Hon.  C. Goode, South Australia; and  Hon.  W.

                    <para>As a result of the first meeting of the Advisory Council, in order that each State should have not less than three representatives on the Council, in addition to Ministers of Agriculture, who are <inline font-style="italic">ex officio</inline> members, the Commonwealth Government asked certain of the State Governments to nominate representatives as follows : - Queensland, two additional members; South Australia, three additional members; Western Australia, two additional members; Tasmania, two additional members. These additional members were duly nominated and appointed by the Commonwealth Government, sp that representative State Committees were brought into existence in each State. </para>
                    <para>In May, 1918, a Premiers' Conference was held in New South Wales, which was attended by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> and myself. The New South Wales Premier waa critical, and had suggested the following motion for the consideration of the Conference: - </para>
                    <para>That the Commonwealth Government be requested to cease the .procedure at present being carried out whereby unnecessary expenditure is being incurred in the assumption of functions 'by the Commonwealth Bureau of Science and Industry, which are at present being efficiently performed by the States. </para>
                    <para class="block">On page 70 of the official report of the proceedings at that Conference, honorable members will see the speech delivered by the Acting Prime Minister, who presented a complete report showing the intentions and the scheme of organization of the proposed Institute of Science and Industry, and fully explained the position. It will interest honorable members if I refer them to a few of the opinions expressed by the Premiers of the various States. This was the view taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Peake,</inline> Premier of South Australia, as reported on page 73 of the <inline font-style="italic">Debates -</inline></para>
                    <para>In <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> view, this is one of the big questions which we might very well feel satisfied belong rather to the Commonwealth than to the States, because no scientific discovery will be purely a State affair. It is simply a question of whether the Commonwealth can show us that we are going to have increased efficiency without duplication of the cost of the State Departments. If it can show us, then I for one will heartily support the Commonwealth taking over the whole of the departments of scientific research, because I think they would do the work much better. </para>
                    <para class="block">When introducing the Bill, I divided the work of scientific investigation into three classes - administrative, educational, and research - and pointed out that the Commonwealth Institute was primarily and practically intended for research and investigation only. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Peake</inline> went on to say, page 76 - </para>
                    <para>I would like to put another view from the stand-point of the States. I do not think any State stands more strongly for State rights than does South Australia; but we regard science as on an entirely different footing from practical administrative work. Science has no boundaries, and the operations of a scientific bureau could very well .be spread <inline font-style="italic">.over</inline> the whole of Australia, both from the point of view of more effective work and from the stand-point of economy. What is the use of five or six different State Departments pursuing inquiries on different lines when, possibly, one body could much more effectively perform the work of investigation and research? </para>
                    <para class="block">Later on he added - </para>
                    <para>I think that there must necessarily be greater strength in the scientific methods of the Commonwealth than in those of the States. T.he greater scientific knowledge which money will enable' the Commonwealth to obtain will strengthen every department, and I think that in this case the Commonwealth can very well take over all scientific investigation on behalf of the general community. </para>

                    <para>I think no very great harm can come of this departure, provided the Commonwealth Bureau exercises a reasonable amount of discretion - that is to say, that any matters which are being investigated by a State Bureau should not bo undertaken by the Commonwealth, matters peculiar to the State in which the Bureau exists. If those are left to the States, I can quite imagine there are many questions that can well be investigated by the Commonwealth. In matters that are common to all the States, it appears to me the Commonwealth Bureau can effect very essential service to the whole Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>No doubt the question of scientific research is more important at the present moment than, perhaps, at any previous time in Australia. There are many diseases in stock that arc common to the whole of Australia, and I am of opinion that better research work could be done by one central body. There are not many men in the world who are experts in these matters. They are very difficult to obtain. If one State were able to get the services of the most experienced man to go into research work, the other States would be unable to avail themselves of his services. </para>
                        <para>Although I am very jealous of the sovereign rights of the States, at the same time, I think this research work could be better done through one central body. I should be prepared to fall in with any arrangement that might have that object in view, seeing that it is in the interests of my own State that it should be done. There are ' many difficult problems which we shall have to deal with in Australia in the future, and they could be better dealt with by one central body. </para>

                        <para>I confess to_ a large measure of sympathy with the President's views as an expression of an abstract principle. It is, perhaps, possible that the Commonwealth, in the exercise of this right, might logically take over certain other matters which are specifically State functions, but I do not fear that. I think we might reasonably welcome this institution as capable of doing something which, unfortunately, the States have not succeeded in doing.

In this regard the States have complete sovereign power within their own jurisdiction, just as the Commonwealth has. In fact, the Bill recognises it. The intention of the Constitution is that the States shall exercise their powers, and the Commonwealth shall exercise its own, but that where a common purpose can be effected, both shall work together for the mutual good of the people of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- One result will be a great benefit to the State of Tasmania.. I wish to show now that since the Executive Committee were appointed, they have been working on lines of cooperation with the States. In July and August, 1916, members of the Executive Committee visited New South Wales and Queensland to explain to the State Ministers the policy of the Institute, and to secure their assistance and co-operation. In both States the Ministers who were interviewed expressed their sympathy with the work, and promised their support. At a later date a meeting was held with the Victorian Minister of Agriculture, with similar results. Honorable members have drawn attention to some reports published by the Advisory Council, which, they allege, contain nothing new and represent merely a compilation of previous information upon certain subjects. The way in which the Executive Committee work is this : Special committees are appointed to deal with particular subjects. Before making further investigations, they compile information of existing knowledge and past achievements. These compilations become the starting point for future investigation. </para>

In June, 1918, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gellatly</inline> again visited each of the six States with a view to securing the co-operation of their Governments in the work of the Institute. He carried letters of introduction from the Acting Prime . Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> to the State Premiers, and explained to them the proposed working of the Institute. When he was in Queensland the State Government agreed to co-operate with the Institute on the subject of the eradication of prickly pear.

It so happens that the two States which will particularly benefit from expenditure upon the investigation of the prickly pear pest are Queensland and New South Wales. The honorable member did not object to an investigation by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McAlpine</inline> into bitter pit, a problem that does not concern some of the States. A truly national institution will not be bothered about State boundaries.

The New South Wales 'Government have agreed to provide £1,000 per annum for five years to be used in co-operative work with the Institute in investigating the white ant, blow-fly, and other pests. In addition, the New South Wales Forestry Commissioners have agreed to co-operate with the Institute on a pound per pound basis in carrying out research work into forest products, the work to be controlled by a joint committee, and to be carried out at the Sydney University. The New South Wales Education Department is also co-operating with the Institute in connexion with the investigations into tanning matters which are being carried out at the Tanning School, Redfern; and also into yeasts and bread-making, which are being carried out at the model bakery at the Technical College. The Director of Agriculture in New South Wales and several State officials are members of the Advisory Committee of that State. Work is also being done on investigations into worm nodule in cattle in co-operation -with the New South Wales Department of Public Health and the Sydney University. Officials of the Australian Museum in Sydney, a semi-State institution, are cooperating in investigating marine biological problems; and experimental work in regard to the electrical sterilization of milk <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> being carried out at the tramway workshops in Sydney. </para>

I remember that some years ago the Queensland Government had in their service one of the best scientists in Australia; but instead of being able to devote the whole of his energies to the solution of one problem at a time he was expected to give attention' to many different problems, find, of course, he could deal with none of them completely.

It is not so much a question of the amount as of the wisdom that will be shown in making the expenditure. The Institute is not going to be a success unless we can secure the services of the best men to tackle the problems with which it will have to deal. The Executive must have a free hand in determining the selections to be made and the salaries to be paid. Given capable scientists, we must not stint them in so far as laboratories, apparatus, and materials are concerned. </para>

                    <para>The important point we have to remember is, as mentioned recently by a State Premier, that highly-trained investigators are difficult to obtain. We hope that in time "we shall be able to secure such men from our own Universities. They are the training grounds, and in our laboratories our men will serve their apprenticeship. I hope that in days to come we shall have, perhaps at the Seat of Government, a post-graduate University. There are post-graduate classes in the United States of America, to encourage men to develop the higher branches of science. We, however, have not yet reached that stage. We are a young community attempting to people a continent, and are face to face with all the pests and difficulties of first settlement. We are facing these practical problems in a practical way. We are anxious in the fight to apply the highest principles of science to aiding the man engaged in industry. The object of this Institute is entirely practical. It is facing, and will face, practical problems, with a view to applying science to industry. Surely Australia is not to be the only nation that has come out of the war without learning the value of the application of science to industry. Every country is realizing the necessity for the extension of these institutions, and their greater utilization in the direction of helping its industries. I hope Australia will not lag behind. As an Australian, I am jealous of the reputation of my country. I want to see Australia taking its part in scientific investigation. A number of young Australians have gone abroad and have secured employment in the highest branches of scientific research. Names of such men who are occupying high positions in the scientific world of the British Empire to-day could, if necessary, be given. My desire is that they shall be employed in our own laboratories, and making here contributions to the scientific knowledge of the world. </para>
                    <para>The Leader of the Opposition spoke rather hurriedly when he said we had not been co-operating with the States. We have been co-operating with them, and desire to continue that co-operation. Most of the scientists of the States with whom I have come in contact are anxious that this reform should be brought about. I hope that before Parliament is prorogued this Institute will have become established in Australia, and that it will prove one of the most beneficial institutions in the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>.- We can safely say that in the debate that has taken' place upon this measure ' we have, been undergoing a lesson in the kindergarten of Australian science. The speech made by the Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> in introducing this Bill, I regret to say, was, from my point of view, lacking in that material information with which the House should be furnished when it is asked to launch a measure so wide in its scope and so full of possibilities as this will be. This question of the establishment of an Institute of Science and Industry has been before us in one form or another for many months, and I do not hesitate to say, without any personal disregard for the Minister who' introduced it, that up to the present I am, dissatisfied with the sketch that has been made of the great national work to be undertaken by it. It is quite wrong for the Minister, in a restive way, and with some show of irritation to charge honorable members, and particularly those who sit on this side of the House, with a callous disregard for the teachings of science, and the value of science as applied to industry. We all honour the world's great and eminent scientists. Scientists, however, do not grow on every tree. We cannot pluck them as we pass, and have the great problems of our country submitted to an Institute of this description, believing that when it reports upon them the last word will have been said, or that we shall have scientific discoveries that will remove all the ' ills to which the animal and plant life of . this planet are heirs. </para>

                    <para>I want, quite early in my remarks, to say that I have been keenly interested in the application of research work to our primary industries. The' Acting Attorney-General will do me the credit of saying that when the Bureau of Agriculture Bill was before us he probably had not a more ardent supporter in this Chamber than I was. </para>

                            <para>- But when the Government come down with this new-fangled notion of immediately harnessing science to industry - when they introduce a Bill which is really another blank cheque, . to be passed on by the Government to a board of directors, just as was done in connexion with repatriation - I feel that' I have cause to complain. In connexion  with, the work of repatriation, the Govern- \ ment passed on a blank cheque to the ' Commission, over which Parliament certainly had control, although it had no voice in the allocation of the money.. It had power only to stop an expenditure to which we were already committed, and so to hold up the whole scheme. It is not in this way that I am prepared to support the Government in the establishment of a Bureau of Science' and Industry. </para>

                    <para>I desire to deal with the principles embodied in this measure. On the very day that the Acting Attorney-General moved the second reading of the Bill' those of us who represent country interests were faced by the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Webster),</inline> who, with his back to the wall, said that he was unable to secure another pound to provide postal and telephone facilities that are actually required to enable people to carry on existing industries, and to meet actual necessities from day to day. The honorable gentleman said that he could not promise that the Treasurer would provide any more money to help us in that direction. On the other hand, the Minister came down with this Bill, which is in the nature of a blank cheque to be filled in, and expended upon an investigation of scientific blessings yet undiscovered. It provides for an expenditure without limit, and, in the main, without any parliamentary supervision. I regard the financial aspect and the possibilities of this Bill with some alarm. I am not prepared to vote for such a blank cheque. We are confronted with a staggering debt of £750,000,000, with its attendant gigantic interest bill. We have staring us in the face the fact that within a few years the whole of the debts of the States and the Commonwealth will have to be converted at a high rate of interest, which will mean the levying of still greater imposts. We have gigantic obligations in respect of pensions, and the work of repatriation, for which many millions, of pounds will have to be found. There is also to be considered the daily increasing cost of government. In these circumstances, £ am not prepared to sign another blank cheque to be handed over to a board of directors, who will certainly be under the guidance of a responsible Minister, but of whose research and investigations a Minister who is a layman can know but little. If the Minister holds up these scientists in the investigation of any problem, what will be said? If honorable members scan the four issues of <inline font-style="italic">Science and Industry,</inline> the official journal of the Institute, they will find that practically .every subject under the sun may come within the scope of the Institute and be the subject of its investigations. Of course, we can only hope that sane, practical, common-sense men will not waste the nation's money in fruitless research after illusory and impossible remedies. I ask honorable members to scan the whole of the subjects dealt with in the four issues of <inline font-style="italic">Science and Industry.</inline> If we are going to submit the whole of the difficulties that face the industries of the country to scientific research, the public purse will be affected to an extent to which I am not prepared to consent without some further safeguard against a body over which Parliament has no control. I do not wish to reflect on the ability of Australian scientists, but I wish to make it clear that I think the Government might have gone on more practical lines. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> in, as it were, another second-reading speech, has mended his hand a good deal since his first speech, and has now given us much more information. I do not believe, however, that practical co-operation exists between the Commonwealth and the States in connexion with scientific research. I invite the Minister to read the debates going on at the present time in the Victorian Legislature on the Dairy Produce Bill. He will there find the keenest resentment expressed by the State Government at the attempt by the Commonwealth Government to take absolute  control of the whole of the dairying industry of the Commonwealth, irrespective of the varying conditions of the States, and of the investigations by State dairying supervisors and scientists. The proposals of the Government are of such a character that" if they are carried out they will take out of the hands of the States the whole control of the dairy output of the country. This, in itself, shows an absolute lack of any arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States in these matters. </para>

                    <para>I beg to offer a suggestion to the Minister. The harnessing of science to industry in the proposal before us may in that regard be judged by the machinery provided. There is the Board of Trade, the Department of Commerce and Industry, and the Institute of Science and Industry; and these bodies are, no doubt, intended to represent the system under which science is to be applied to industry. My suggestion to the Minister is to withdraw the measure and take counsel with the States. He must remember that, with regard to primary industries, there are already in existence in the States Departments of Agriculture with responsible Ministers, directors, superintendents, and scientists for research. For instance, in Victoria there is investigation going on in wheat-breeding, and the Commonwealth Government cannot improve on it except by transferring the officer in charge to a Commonwealth Department. To tempt State officers with higher salaries to join the Commonwealth Service is not a likely way to produce harmony. </para>
                    <para>I am sorry that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> should, apparently, take up the attitude that everybody who speaks against the Bill is opposed to the blessings of science, and takes a dark and gloomy view of the future of the country.. That is a fallacious, and, if I may say so, a silly attitude. Men who believe they are doing their duty in analyzing this measure should not be regarded as objecting to science in industry. </para>

For scientific research, I am in favour of the most liberal endowments; but I repeat that in the States at the present time every branch of agriculture has its particular experts and scientists. In addition, there are the unrewarded scientists who work practically in the field; and as one who is closely associated with primary industries, and who takes the greatest interest in them, I say that in the fields we have some of the best scientists of to-day. The knowledge these men have gained is not lost to the country. </para>

                    <para>I was much interested in the speech of the honorable member for New England (Lt.-Colonel Abbott), which, from the point of view of secondary industries, was an excellent one. He referred .to the application of modern methods, particularly to armaments, and showed us the quickened activity that has been brought about by scientific research. But does the Minister think that in this young country we can apply those methods to all our secondary industries? If we try to do so, we shall have all sorts of wild-cat schemes, and men rushing to get the Institute credentials. We ought* to. proceed along careful, well-thought-out lines, and therefore, I suggest to the Minister that the Government should confer afresh with the State Departments. I can say from firsthand knowledge that the Victorian Government has not been! consulted in connexion with many  fields of research connected with primary inudustry. If this Institute commences on lines which the States have already followed, it will only he going over elementary ' investigations already made. Let whatever is . done be practical. The Government should call a halt, and see, at any rate, if the field of primary production cannot be left to the States. Under the Federal Constitution the lands and the land laws are left to the State Government, on which there is the greater obligation to deal with the difficulties and troubles in primary life. The soil, for instance, is a subject for investigation as wide as the continent, and there are also the underground water supply, the timber resources, and the metal resources, apart altogether from animal and plant life. </para>
                    <para>With regard to secondary industries the States have done very little; and here a fruitful field is offered to the Commonwealth. In each of the States there are universities and schools; and if the Government think that there is not now sufficient investigation, let those universities and schools be liberally endowed. But does the Minister think that those who are engaged in secondary industries have not their own scientists? With the Colonial Sugar Refining Company there are twenty-one chemists, who have studied every side of the sugar industry. <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> Institute of Science and Industry would ever be able to achieve the results that have been achieved in connexion with that company. </para>

                            <para>- Does the honorable member assume that there can be no scientific discovery except under Act of Parliament? The great scientists are mostly unrewarded men, who are able to devote their lives to the investigation of particular subjects. I understand that it is the desire of the Minister to adjourn this debate now, with a view to introducing other business, and I ask leave to continue my remarks at a later hour of the day. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not wish to delay the passage of this motion, but I think this is the proper time to point out that there have been certain irregularities in connexion with similar motions in the past, and an absence of that authority which is necessary after the report of the Public Works Committee has been brought before the House. This Committee was instituted in 1913 with the object of giving the House an opportunity to check expenditure on public works. It was appointed as a Committee of this Parliament to be altogether independent of the Government. Its duty was to make independent investigations aud present independent reports to the House, which had then to decide whether certain public works shall be carried out. That has not been the result. In order to doubly safeguard the position, the Act provides that it is necessary to bring down a motion, and to submit to the House estimates of the probable cost of the work proposed to be remitted to the Committee, and that after the Committee has presented its report the House shall, by resolution, instruct the Government whether the work should be carried out or not. So far as I can ascertain, the most important part, that is,  the instruction by the House to the Government whether the works shall be carried out or not, has rarely been asked for by the Government. </para>

                            <para>- On reading up the debates that took place here when the Public Works Committee Act was passed. I find it was specifically stated that the Bill was introduced to provide a check on the public expenditure of the Commonwealth, so that no Department should be able to start a work and have it very nearly completed before the House was asked to vote the necessary money. It was felt that the House should be placed in possession of particulars showing the necessity, or otherwise, for the expenditure of money on public works, by means of a Committee that would be the servant of Parliament and not the servant of the Government. Section 15 of the Act provides :  - </para>

                    <para>No public work of any kind whatsoever (except such works as have already been authorized by Parliament, or which are authorized during the present session, and except works for the Naval or Military defence of the Commonwealth exempted by Order in Council from the operation of the Act), the estimated cost of completing which exceeds Twenty-five thousand pounds, and whether such work is a continuation, completion, repair, re-construction, extension, or a new work, shall be commenced unless sanctioned as in this section provided. </para>
                    <para class="block">It is provided that the Committee shall make the investigation with all convenient despatch, and, further, that after the receipt of the report of the Committee, " the House of Representatives shall by resolution declare either that it is expedient to carry out the proposed work, or that it is not expedient to carry it out." In only one instance has the Government complied with that provision. It is time to remind the House that it is likely to lose its grip on the expenditure on important public works. </para>

                            <para>- I think it was the last work recommended by the Committee. I was not in favour, as a member of the Committee, of the Cabinet remitting the question now under discussion to the Committee. This House should jealously preserve its right to instruct the Committee to make investigations. It is the duty of Parliament, and not the duty of the Government, to remit questions to the Committee. I hope in future the House will see that any work referred to the Committee is so referred by the House, and that no investigation shall be undertaken by the Committee on the instruction of the Cabinet. I know there is a possibility of an amendment of the Act being asked for to give the Cabinet authority to remit important works to the Committee for investigation, but I hope the House will never sanction anything of the kind. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad the honorable member has reminded me of that. From my investigations as a member of the Committee I have come to the conclusion that very few, if any, of the public works carried out for the Defence Department should not be brought strictly under the purview of the Committee. No public works of any importance for the Naval or Military Departments can be carried out without State secrets connected with them being imparted to responsible members of the Naval and Military Boards, and it is a reflection on Parliament, and on the members of its Committee, to say that the House cannot trust them to investigate important naval or military works. It might not be advisable to publish the full evidence, but Parliament certainly ought to have a knowledge of the details of the policy which ultimately it has to finance. </para>

                    <para>I hope that in future the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act will be strictly adhered to, firstly, by obtaining the authority of Parliament to remit to the Committee every work that comes within the purview of the Act, and, secondly, when the report of the Committee is presented, by the authority of Parliament being sought for the carrying out of the work. I trust, also, that the disposition shown in the past by the Government to exempt what they consider to be important naval and military works from the investigation of the Committee, will be very sparingly shown, if shown at all. The present practice means that the Cabinet overrules the right and privilege of this Parliament to control the expenditure of public money. It is difficult enough for the House to check the ordinary expenditure of the public Departments. The tendency is for that expenditure to grow, unless the House has the opportunity of discussing the Estimates before a great part of the money is expended, Parliament, however, can do something towards checking unnecessary expenditure on public works, and the Public Works Committee Act was passed to insure that that expenditure should be brought directly under the purview of Parliament. The Public Works Committee was created as the buffer between the Parliament and the Departments in regard to public works expenditure, and the Committee should be responsible only to the Parliament that has created it. I am glad that the Minister has seen fit to accept the amendment of the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton).</inline> It will give the Committee a freer hand in investigating this important work. In that sense, I am pleased that this debate has taken place. I trust that in future the House will make a little closer investigation into the question of whether the Committee is carrying out its duties as they should be carried out, and preserve its rights and privileges in the directions I have indicated. </para>

                <para>It does not require very much argument to convince honorable members of the soundness of the principles underlying this brief measure. The proposition is merely to bestow upon the Commonwealth the same power and right to control wireless telephony as it has in connexion with wireless telegraphy. When the principal Act was passed, wireless telephony was not in vogue. It has since become a reality, and the Commonwealth Government now seeks to acquire the right to control that particular facility in the interests of Australia as a whole. </para>

                        <para>.- I am anxious to safeguard the Government in every possible way, and have no objection to the Bill going through. It is right that control should be exercised over wireless telephones as well as over wireless telegraphs, but I should like to know whether the litigation with the Australian Wireless Limited has been settled, and what  ls  the exact position of those persons in the community whose little experimental plants were necessarily dismantled on the outbreak of war. I understand that these small plants can receive messages, but cannot send them, but many young Australians are interested in them and have been experimenting in wireless telegraphy in order to discover improvements if it is possible to do so. I think it well to allow the youth of the community to conduct experiments in, this connexion if they could be permitted to do so with perfect safety to the community. </para>

                        <para>. - Small wireless stations, although they may not have the power to make themselves felt in the big commercial stations, are in a position to .pick up every message sent out from the latter. In my opinion, wireless telegraphy will be more and more used in place of metallic lines, and, consequently, these small stations, if they are permitted, will learn everything that is taking place in business matters. The utmost secrecy is observed on land lines. </para>

A report from the Northern Territory was handed into the, wireless station in the Territory, and, in my opinion, the Germans picked up the message, because subsequent events seemed to indicate that they knew as much about it as the man who had sent it. If small wireless stations are licensed all over Australia, there will be nothing to prevent the people who establish them deriving considerable advantage from learning of commercial transactions about which they should know nothing. The Post.MasterGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Webster)</inline> should have explained clearly to what extent he proposed to go in this direction. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; and it shows how far-reaching this business is. When I was connected with the Post and Telegraph Department a young official was seriously dealt with for divulging the contents of a message. I may be beating the air now, because of the limited information given by the Postmaster-General. Had I known that, this Bill was coming forward to-night I would have been better prepared, but I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> who said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne,</inline> the expert who was brought out from England to report on the Australian wireless system, reported that it was a Telefunken-Marconi combination, and that the Australian Shaw wireless was 30 per cent, more efficient We know that the Tele.funken system is the German one, and that the Germans will still have their power stations. The Postmaster-General should have told us how far these people would be permitted to equip wireless plants all over Australia, because, if permission to operate plants is given to one school, it must be given to another. It is quite an easy matter to fit up a local system within a building for the training of operators; in fact, complete wireless plants are offered for sale in the windows of various establishments, and wireless operators are being trained everywhere. It is quite a fascinating occupation. One has the ear to pick up sound reading and can very quickly and easily hear what messages are being received or despatched. It is simply a question of becoming accustomed to sound reading  as against sight reading. Operators are required all over Australia ; in fact, all over the world. There will be a great demand for them on vessels, and my opinion is that the Government should exercise some control over their training. The man who is wrongly trained is nothing but a nuisance to a carefully trained operator. One can easily make a mistake in sound reading. Many so-called sound readers are simply guessers. Some men who were brought from Great Britain to Western Australia in the gold boom claimed to be good sound readers, but messages sent at twenty words a minute very soon stuck them up, whereas Australian-trained operators were quite capable of taking messages sent at forty words, a minute. A poor operator on a quadruplex line is a great nuisance to good operators, because he is constantly breaking in, and asking the man at the other end to repeat something he has already sent over the line. At sea the lives of people are dependent on the wireless operator; and it is the Government's duty to see that no poorly trained man is appointed on any vessel. The Postmaster-General who introduced this important Bill with half-a-dozen words is a man who usually goes into details, and claims to have a thorough grasp of the work of every section of the Department under his control. I am very disappointed that he did not give us a complete statement as to the control the Government will exercise under the Bill. </para>

No doubt he is the repository of a considerable amount of information upon this matter, but I would like to have had some more information from him in reference to the position of those persons who were conducting private experimental stations prior to the war. These gentlemen have rendered splendid service on transports and other vessels. I have in mind one man who was engaged as a wireless operator on transports during practically the whole of the four and a half years of war. He sailed on all seas, and rendered excellent service, and I am glad that the Government- have decided to include these wireless operators amongst those who deserve recognition for having done their little bit in connexion with the war. I expected the Postmaster-General to inform the House of the latest developments in wireless telephony, which, I believe, will be of great advantage to Australia. If the equipment does not cost more than that required in connexion with the present system of telephony, the wireless system should mean much to this country of great distances. I should like the Minister to inform the House of what measure of success has attended wireless telephony in other countries, and the possibility of its general adoption throughout Australia. </para>

Before wireless telegraphy was transferred to the Navy Department the business was still in . its infancy, and involved the Department in a loss of between £3,000 and £4,000 per annum.

                        <para>.- The Postmaster-General referred honorable members to the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> for a statement of the . position of persons whose licences were revoked at the beginning of the war. Section 6, sub-section 2, of the Act deals with wireless appliances on ships, and the Navigation Act requires that certain passenger ships shall be equipped with wireless telegraphy. That is quite right; I would go further, and make, wireless equipment compulsory on the smaller boats, in connexion with which the danger is greater than in connexion with the up-to-date . passenger boats. I agree with the honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith)</inline> that the control of wireless telegraphy should never have been removed from the Postmaster-General's Department, into which it naturally fits. It may have been necessary, while the war was in progress, to place wireless telegraphy under the control of the Navy Department . as a Defence measure, but now that we are at peace the control should revert to the Postal Department. </para>

                            <para>- It will be quite easy to restore wireless telegraphy to the control of. the- Postal Department, because the amending Act of 1915' struck out thewords'. Postmaster-Generalfrom- the original Act, and substituted " the  Minister for the time being administering the Act." That means the Minister to whom the Prime Minister . gives the administration of the Wireless Telegraphy Act. Therefore that administration can be restored to the Postmaster-General by the Prime Minister. Sometimes the land lines are congested,' and some of 'the work must be done by wireless. At the present time there is a  good deal of wireless communication between the land  stations  and transports. The Applecross Station, Perth, is being kept busy with messages from1 relatives to returning soldiers on transports. If we were to restore the control of this service to the Postal Department we should save the trouble of adjusting the revenue from this source between that Department and the Navy Department. In regard to the objection of the Postmaster-General to the restoration of this service to his Department, I have never considered that the Postal Department was established for profit earning. It is meant to be a convenience to the people of Australia. I am glad to hear that the Naval Board is considering what shall be done in regard to the issue of licences. </para>
