                            <para>- This question should have been addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation. It is well known that the sustenance allowance was carefully considered, that it is made for a specific purpose, and that it is thoroughly appreciated by all. who participate in it. As to the general work of the Department in finding employment for returned soldiers, recent statistics show that it is exceedingly efficient. As honorable members are aware, trade and industry throughout Australia have been dislocated by the influenza epidemic and the occurrence of strikes. The records recently quoted by the Minister show that, notwithstanding these drawbacks, the Department has been most effectively and efficiently administered in the direction of finding employment for our returned men. </para>

                        <para>- There was no question of sale or loan of these birds to the Defence Department, the proposal, as stated to the various pigeon-breeders and societies, being to give the pigeon-breeders an opportunity of making practical use of their special talents, to assist in connexion with the war. As the birds were a gift to the Imperial Government for war purposes, it is not proposed to ask for their return. </para>

                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline>
                        asked, with reference -to the running of the trams in Melbourne, whether it would be possible to make the stoppage, considered necessary, between the hours of 11 a.m. and 4 p.m., and allow the trams to continue running at night time for the convenience of the public, as this would not consume any more coal, and the fires could be banked up. I have now to say that this matter has received the consideration, of the Central Coal Board. The present regulations were drawn np at a conference of the tramway and electric power managements with the Board. It was at the time suggested that a reduction of running might be effected during the day, but. those competent to speak on this subject stated that no economy of fuel could he effected by such a proposition, as it would be necessary to maintain pressure of steam to meet recurrent load, and it was therefore decided that the only effective way of saving fuel was to cut off tram services entirely in the evenings and let the steam down. The hour of 7 p.m. was fixed, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, and was concurred in by the various tramway managements.

                        <para>. - I wish to bring under the notice of the House a matter affecting not only myself, but the good name of the Commonwealth in its treatment of soldiers and officers. When I returned to Australia I did what I thought was a good turn to those who were concerned in the dispute on the troopship <inline font-style="italic">Somali,</inline> but I was charged with inciting to mutiny, and, under a dragnet clause that is part of the regulations of the British Amy, with conduct to the prejudice of good order and military discipline. I was guilty of neither of those offences. The evidence has not yet been laid on the table of the Library, or I might make pointed reference to it in order to prove my statement in that regard. During the trial not one individual was brought forward who said he was influenced in any way into being mutinous by anything I said to ham. Some of the evidence brought against me was secured by means of the civil police, who went throughout Victoria to obtain it. Two witnesses were brought from country districts to Melbourne for the purpose. Their evidence was of such a character that one of them was treated as hostile and cross-questioned by the representative of the Crown. The evidence of the other was not very weighty, but both of them came down under the impression, which they made no secret of, that they were coming to Melbourne to give evidence on my behalf. That was the kind of witness brought down to give evidence against me so far as the ',' digger " was concerned. As regards officers, all the evidence on which I was convicted was given by sergeant-majors, and any man who knows what a sergeant-major is need not be told that he is the go-between between the tyranny of the officer and the victim to which it is to be applied. Not one of them gave conclusive evidence that I had done anything to incite the men to mutiny. If I had the evidence here, I could quote passages which prove that the sergeant-major of the ship, who was the brigade sergeant-major on the voyage, swore that he stood within 10 feet of me when I made the utterance complained of. The other sergeant-major said he was coming from the hospital along the hurricane deck, and that he stood alongside the other officer. That was an absolute impossibility, because the well deck was in between the hospital and the place where I addressed the troops. That point, however, was taken no notice of. That is a sample of the evidence given against me by the officers who came forward to swear that I incited to mutiny. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I assure honorable members that if I had been the bloodthirsty individual they make me out to be, and had wanted to create a real mutiny on the vessel on that voyage, it would not have taken more than five minutes to do so. I did not want a mutiny. I simply wanted the " diggers " to get the treatment to which they were entitled as men who had gone overseas and suffered greatly on behalf of the Empire. The conditions under which they came home were none too nice, and the food that was put up was absolutely refused by them on several occasions. It is strange that such arrangements should be made by the Military Department for feeding the troops, seeing that the Red Cross Society sent on board to us at different times Australian jam in Australian tins as a gift.' We often had cakes, confectionery, and fruit distributed to us by the Red Cross Society of Australia, but from the contractors with whom the Department arranged to supply -the transport we had jam: that I saw taken on board, made in Sumatra, and put up in kerosene tins. I saw that jam put out for the troops, and just as religiously emptied through the port-hole. I do not want to stress those points, but one gentleman has made a statement that the food was good, and that his troops did not object to it. If that gentleman was a member of the House I could challenge his statement, inasmuch as it was his own light horsemen, who, on one occasion, would not eat the morning stew until it was inspected by the officers. They carried it straight up as it was, without touching it, so that there should be no question about its quality. It was called " Hello " stew, because you said "Hello" every time you saw a bit of meat in it, it was so thin. However, the troops put u,p with that sort of thing and got along fairly well. They also put up with the inconvenience of sleeping between decks on a troopship. That, also, is none too nice when you get 1100 men between decks and' their hammocks are slung so close that they touch one another. The men strip before turning in, and the vapors from the human body distribute themselves between' those decks. The portholes at times have to be closed, and consequently the air often becomes very foetid. In the ship, the basins in the lavatory were only a span apart. I spanned them to make sure of the distance between them, and there were sixty odd in one lavatory. . After rising in the morning, having your bath, and doing your toilet, you had to take your breakfast in the very same place that you had slept in, before there had been time to ventilate it. The conditions were bad enough even when we were travelling, when the wind-chutes tended to clear the atmosphere between decks after a certain period. </para>
                    <para>That is the sort of life the " digger " leads when he comes across the sea in a transport. » I come now to the question of the alleged offence for which I claim that I unjustly paid the penalty. Not only was I robbed of my liberty for a certain time, but it cost me a fair sum out of pocket. I consider that I have been very harshly dealt with in the view taken of my action on that occasion. When we arrived at Colombo, we had one case of sickness aboard. We carried twenty-six Cingalese who had offered their services to the Empire, but who were not required on account of the Armistice being signed, and they were brought back to their homes on our ship. It was one of these men that was sick, and he was taken ashore at Colombo. That is the only suspicious case of influenza that we had throughout the trip. We left Colombo, and had a good run down to Western Australia. There we were informed that influenza was prevalent in Australia, and that the troops who disembarked in Western Australia would have to go through a period of quarantine for the protection of the people on shore. So far, good. I do not think any of the Western Australians complained about having to do that period of quarantine. The remainder of the troops' were told that inhalation chambers would be provided on the boat for use on the voyage to Adelaide, and that if the inhalation process was undergone properly we would not have to undergo quarantine when we reached port. It took  us approximately, six days, and we went through the inhalation process religiously every morning. Every man was up at the period fixed for him, and went through the process. The evidence given by the officer commanding the troops, notwithstanding what may be said regarding a few high temperatures,' showed that when the health officers came aboard at the Semaphore they pronounced the ship clean. It was stated in the newspapers next day by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Hone,</inline> the quarantine officer, that the <inline font-style="italic">Somali</inline> was a clean ship. We were paraded at 9 o'clock on the morning of our arrival there, and the usual order given when troops are to disembark was issued, that we were to bring up any kit bags we had with us, and stow them on the starboard deck. Hammocks were to be handed in, and half-an-hour after lunch our mess utensils were also to be handed in. We were to be paid prior to disembarkation. All these orders were carried out; the troops paraded on the mess deck, and had their temperatures taken, and everything went " as merry as a marriage bell " ; but we were there until 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and no word came as to what we were to do. At 4 o'clock some one came along and said that I had better go down and get a hammock, because every one down below was grabbing a hammock. I went below and secured one, and then I returned to the deck to get my kit bag. There had been a stack of kit bags, about 10 feet high, but when I got on deck they were strewn over the place, and men were trampling on one another's bags in an endeavour to find their own. That annoyed me considerably. I knew that my wife and daughter, the latter with a baby in arms, were expecting me, and I was not too pleased to think that they had been waiting on the wharf from 9 o'clock in the morning without knowing what was going to happen to the troops on the boat. Consequently, I paraded before <inline font-weight="bold">Major Arnall.</inline> I did not go direct to the ship's captain, as <inline font-weight="bold">.Major Chanter</inline> says I did. I did not do that on any occasion. I spoke to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Arnall</inline> and pointed to the kit bags strewn about the deck. I said, " We have paraded according to your orders, and now look at the kit bags being trodden on." I had not been allowed to remain in England long enough to purchase souvenirs to bring home to my people, and it did not affect me whether my bag was trampled on or not; but I realized that others might have souvenirs in their kit bags. I said, " This is not the way to treat men who have done so much in the interests of their country.. I Have been told to get my hammock. Are we to stay on board to-night?" He said, " The health officers came on board this morning and inspected the ship, and have gone away, but as to what is to take place I am just as ignorant as you are." I said, " I feel very wild about it." Then I explained how my wife and daughter were waiting for me on shore, and he said, " If I were in your position I would feel as you do," candidly admitting that the attitude I took up was the one he would have taken up in the same circumstances. We did not know what was to be done to us until we received the newspapers on the following morning, and they contained the information that the <inline font-style="italic">Somali</inline> had arrived, and had been declared a clean ship, but that she was to go into quarantine for seven days. I asked permission to write a letter to the <inline font-style="italic">Register,</inline> and the Officer Commanding said that as the censorship restrictions had been lifted I could do so. Thereupon I wrote a letter to the <inline font-style="italic">Register,</inline> pointing out the position as we found it. I stated that there were 1,100 men between decks on the vessel, that she was a still ship, and did not have the wind chutes that were provided on the voyage out, and, that there was nothing to prevent an outbreak of influenza going right through the vessel. I added that men who had risked their lives in France were now obliged to run a greater risk of death by remaining on the vessel in such circumstances. During the day a lot of the troops came to me, and asked what I thought it best to do. I did not advise them in any way, but I did something off my own bat. I prepared a telegram, jointly signed by South Australians, to Brigadier-'General Antill, but I would not allow any man to be coerced into signing it, nor would I allow any one to sign it who had not first read it. I then paraded before the Officer Commanding, and asked him if he would get the South Australian officers to sign it. He said that he could not do so, as he thought he had done all that was necessary by appealing to the shore authorities against the quarantining of the vessel. Thereupon I asked permission to send the telegram to Brigadier-General Antill.' The Officer Commanding said that I could do what I liked in that respect. I drafted the telegram on a cigarette wrapper which was lying on the deck at the time, and this was the wording of the 'message which was forwarded to Brigadier-General Antill - </para>
                    <para>Undersigned soldiers 4th Military District desire your intervention for immediate release from quarantine. Authorities acknowledge clean ship. Contend that further detention between decks of still ship liable to breed outbreak rather than prevent same. - Yates. </para>
                    <para class="block">There were seventy-two South Australians on the <inline font-style="italic">Somali,</inline> and sixty-six of them voluntarily signed the telegram, only one man refusing to do so. Time being the essence of the contract, I sent it without the other signatures, but subsequently those South Australians who had not signed it came to me and expressed their regret that they had not had the opportunity of doing so. There was nothing in the message contrary to military discipline. It simply stated that we resented unnecessary quarantining in our own port, without our relatives and friends being given the opportunity of learning what was to be done with us. After despatching the message I mingled myself with the crowd, who were engaged in catching sharks. A shark was caught, and I have one of its teeth. The men gave it to me, mounted in gold, as a tribute to the work I had done for them. In the evening some of the troops from the other States began to display impatience at the delay, and they asked me to draft a 'petition to Brigadier-General Antill. I said, "What for?" They said, " We want you to draw up a .petition similar to the one you sent to the Brigadier." I was not anxious to mix myself up in anything that would be likely to lead .people to believe I was seeking to foment trouble. I said to them, "I appreciate your position, but I am sorry I cannot help you. I have done what I thought was best, by sending a telegram on behalf of the men who are in their own home 'port. Anything that you want to do you can do off your own bat. I take my share pf the responsibility attaching to anything I do myself, but I do not propose to do anything beyond what I 'have already done." They turned from me rather crestfallen, and one man said, " We thought that you would write it out for us." I said, " Oh, if you simply want me to draft your petition, get me a piece of paper and I will do so." At this time lights were out, and I had to go into the second saloon to get the necessary light. I drafted a petition for these men, and had nothing more to do with it. On </para>
                    <para>Ifr. Yates. the next day when I was on the mess deck I saw the men signing it. It was signed by 718 of them, and was sent ashore - by whom I .do not know. I had nothing to do with it after preparing it, although I am aware that the men went to the Officer Commanding for permission to send the petition ashore. </para>
                    <para>Nothing else happened on board the <inline font-style="italic">Somali</inline> until Friday morning, when we were again paraded. As on the Tuesday morning our kit-bags were put on deck, our hammocks and our mess utensils were handed in, and we were notified that we were to be paraded for disembarkation at 10 o'clock in the morning. Tuesday morning's performance was repeated. The kit-bags were walked over, we had to draw our hammocks again, and again I paraded before the Officer Commanding and told 'him that the position, was intolerable. I asked whether it was a fair thing to .parade us twice and go through the same (performance as we had on Tuesday. The South Australian troops asked me to intercede on their behalf and get release for them from the ship. I told .them that if they wished me to act on their behalf I would speak for them if they had a representative number of South Australians. They asked at what time they should assemble. I said, "Any time you like, but let me know when everyone <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> there." They made the time 4 o'clock in the afternoon. As there was not a representative gathering of the men, I refused to approach the Officer Commanding in their behalf, but decided to interview Mm on my own account. I felt that I was aggrieved, and had a right to speak to him regarding the treatment of the men. I was again paraded before him in the ordinary official way. I did not go up to him and give him a tap on the shoulder. I went to the orderly room, and asked the runner to tell the Officer Commanding that I wished! to speak to- him. If, in so doing, I transgressed any military rule, the fault was not mine. I could have been told that there was a more proper method of approaching the Officer Commanding. The court martial admitted that there was no lack of discipline in my action in interviewing the Officer Commanding, and that gives the lie direct to the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Major Chanter</inline> that I went to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Arnall's</inline> office. I spoke to the Officer Commanding regarding the treatment the men were receiving, and he informed me that he had paraded the men on that day because somebody had called out from a tug-boat on the previous night, " Get ready to go off to-morrow morning." He had no right to take action on such an instruction, because, as was afterwards proved, it was not authoritative. He told me that he considered the position unfortunate, but that he had done his best to get the men ashore. This conversation took place on the deck outside the Officer Commanding's office. The men standing near knew what I was speaking about, and as I left the Officer Commanding, they clamoured about me with a request to be told what I had said, and what he had replied. I told them that the interview had been a personal one, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Arnall</inline> knew no more than we did. The men had to remain on board. Thereupon they resolved to hold a meeting on the poop-deck, and I was requested to explain the position to them. I did so. </para>
                    <para>Then came a proposal that we should allow <inline font-weight="bold">Major Arnall</inline> from 2.30 till 5 o'clock to acquaint the shore authorities by wireless that unless we were released from quarantine we would seize the boat and go ashore. Previously a proposal had been made that the rafts and other loose deck fittings should be cast into the gulf as a demonstration of the chagrin of the troops, but as that action would not get the men ashore, somebody moved that an ultimatum be given to the Officer Commanding that unless he assented to the request of the men, they would take action on their own account. I said to them, "Before you do this, give the Officer Commanding an opportunity to communicate with the shore authorities." They decided to do that, and asked me to interview him. I said, "Am I to tell him what you propose?" and they replied "Yes." I told them that I would act only as one of them, and not. in my capacity as a member of Parliament, as I had no more authority than any other private on the boat. I also stipulated that, in preferring their request to the Officer Commanding, I should be accompanied by one man from each State represented on the ship. We were paraded before the Officer Commanding. I introduced the deputation, and explained the demands of the men. When I had finished speaking, in order to prove to the Officer Commanding that this was not a one-man show, I made every member of the deputation express his views. </para>

                            <para>- I spoke as one of the deputation, and was listened to by the Officer Commanding. All he did was to request that the ultimatum should be extended until 6 o'clock, and promise that he would do as the deputation requested. The names of the five men who with me comprised the deputation were not taken, and in that respect I consider that I was treated unjustly. The Officer Commanding did not tell us that we were taking a course in contravention of the regulations ; he did not tell us that we were liable to be placed under arrest, and that he would take such action if we persisted in our attitude. </para>

                            <para>- The reason was that they "had the wind up." During the afternoon I was summoned to the captain's cabin; <inline font-weight="bold">Major Chanter</inline> said that I went there on my own initiative. Captain Warner and <inline font-weight="bold">Major Arnall</inline> were present and entertained me for about an hour in impressing upon me the seriousness of my action in leading the men. I assured them that I was not leading the men, but was only acting as their spokesman. Captain Warner tried to influence me by telling me that he knew I would not have attained to the position of a member of the Commonwealth Parliament if I had not some influence over bodies of men; if I used my authority with them the men would be more reasonable. I replied, " If the purpose of that talk is to induce me to squib on those men, cut it out. If you have anything to suggest I will convey your proposals to them." He then proceeded to explain to me what would be the position if the men smashed the boats or took any action of that kind. He pointed out what would happen if we attempted to smash any of the boats or the ship. He actually sympathized with us in our position. He said to me, " Look here, Yates, I am as. good a Labour man as you are. ' There was a time in the history of the Peninsular and Oriental Company when we, as officers, made all sorts of representations to the board of management in regard to our, working conditions, but they would not listen to us." The  chairman  of directors, he said - I think he spoke of a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arkwright</inline> - was obdurate, and would not listen to their requests, with the result that they had to take direct action. He said, " We all walked off the ships, and in that way we soon brought the directors to their bearings." Officers of the Peninsular and Oriental Company to-day are getting fair treatment as the result of taking action of the kind which the captain urged me to advise the men not to take.  His  efforts in that direction were futile so far as I was concerned. At 6 o'clock I was sought for by a runner, who brought me again before the captain. The captain then showed me a wireless message, setting out that if we observed the regulations until the following morning we would be ,put ashore. He allowed me to show that message to the men. When I read it, they cheered me. An hour later I was again sent for by the captain, and was told that a mistake had occurred. As it had been found impossible to decipher one word of the message, they had asked that it should be repeated, and it was now found that the correct message was to the effect that we would be taken off on the following Monday, the day on which we were due for release. I took that message to the men, and they became "ropey." Steam was being got up, and the ship was on the move. It was then that I tried to prevent the men from taking drastic action. The captain had told me that he was ordered by the Navy Office to cruise round the Gulf, and I said to the men, " Look here, chaps, you will have a clean ship and plenty of fresh air. We may go to Port Wakefield, or across the Gulf to Edithburg, or to Kangaroo Island, so that things will not be too bad. You have put up your fight, and I would advise you now to ' grin and bear it.'

                    <para>The men, however, were not ta be influenced by me. It was moved that the master of the ship be given an hour in which to send a wireless message to the authorities ashore, that we must return to the anchorage, otherwise they would take charge of the ship, and themselves return her to it. I pointed out that it was all very well to make that threat, but it would be necessary for them to have a man who could navigate a ship to take charge. It was said that the cap- tain, in such circumstances, would be entitled to protect his bridge, even to the extent of using firearms. Some one in the crowd then interjected, " That is all right. If he has a ' squirt,' so have we." I mention this to show what was the temper of the men at the time. Another man jumped up, and said that he had a mate's certificate, and could take the bridge. I pointed out that while that was all very well, he would still have to find men to work the engines and do the firing. The man who had said that he was possessed of a mate's certificate then asked whether there were any engineers amongst the men, and two certificated engineers volunteered for service, as well as five A.B.'s and four or five firemen. This man then said, "This is good enough for me, Yates. I can take the ship back to her anchorage." I replied, " If you think you are competent to do so, well and good; but I would point out that you are proposing to take a very serious step. Unless that step is taken on the authority of the men as a whole, I will have nothing to do with it. You must whip up all the men, so that I may know whether or not the majority are in favour of what you propose." As many as possible were then brought up on deck. I refused to allow the question to be decided on the voices. A show of hands was then taken, and it was such as to lead me to take the action I did. </para>
                    <para>Again, however, I would not be the leader of the movement. I said, " If I am going to take this resolution to the Officer Commanding, or the captain, I must be accompanied by the same men that went with me on the last occasion. Four out of the five agreed to go with me; the fifth backed out, saying that he would have nothing to do with a proposal to take charge of the ship, but another man promptly took his place. We then waited on the captain. We did not threaten the Officer Commanding that we would take charge of the ship. He was " out of the joke." It was a matter between the captain and the men. We went to the captain, and that was the only occasion on which we approached his cabin without being sent for; but permission was obtained through the ship's orderly. We gave him the resolution, and he was not unsympathetic. When </para>
                    <para class="block">I told him the men were desperate, he said, "If you go on with this proposal, we will not attempt to stop you. It would be useless, since you outnumber us by fifty to one." There was no opposition on the part of either the military or ship's officers. They recognised that the position was serious. </para>

                    <para>I am bringing this matter before the House in order to focus public attention on the treatment meted out to these men. When our soldiers went away they were heroes, but when they fell into the clutches of officers with an abnormal regard for discipline, their treatment was such as to justify action of the kind of which I have been speaking. I am telling a plain, unvarnished tale. I challenge contradiction. I have not embellished the facts in any way in order to put my own position in a more favorable light. </para>
                    <para>When we waited on the captain with the final resolution carried by the men, he again offered to send a wireless message to the shore authorities asking for permission to return to the anchorage. He was making that offer when the first or second officer came in and said, " <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, there</inline> is a tug boat signalling us to stop." The captain told him to slow down the ship, and promised to be on deck a minute or two later. By the time that our interview with him had concluded the ship had stopped. .The " diggers " meantime had been doing a little signalling on their own account. They had gone to the tail light, put a hat over it, and having read the signal from the tug boat calling on us to stop, had signalled in reply, " Are you prepared to fight?" </para>

After leaving the captain's cabin I returned to the rear of the ship where I usually sat with a chum, and I did not kn'ow what was happening until I was sent for. The crowd of boys who lined the ship's decks opened up to let me through, and I found myself in the presence of

                        until I got this message at 7 o'clock, this evening, whereupon I came straight off in the tug ." The " message " to which he referred was the petition which we had sent to Antill some days before.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Hone</inline>
                        quickly reasoned out the matter with us, and even discussed the ways and means of taking off the men. After he had given his decision I went to the rear part of the ship, and had to mount the rail of the hurricane-deck in order to address the men.

I had said to the " diggers," " I do not want you to take drastic action, but whatever happens I will be with you. If you insist upon taking the ship to the anchorage, although I urge you not to do so, I will be with you. I will not leave you in the lurch." I heard nothing more of the matter until one afternoon I was walking down King William-street, and was met by one of the " diggers," who told me that I was " in for it " because of a statement made about me in the <inline font-style="italic">Register</inline> by <inline font-weight="bold">Major Chanter.</inline> I took an opportunity to see what <inline font-weight="bold">Major Chanter</inline> had said, and the next day I was arrested. I have asked a number of questions in regard to this gentleman, for I have seen a regulation under which he is culpable of going outside the military authorities and giving information to the press - information which subsequently cost me sixty days' liberty. If a private had done what <inline font-weight="bold">Major Chanter</inline> did he would have been punished, and I relate the circumstance to the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise),</inline> who knows well what he is doing when be gives camouflage replies to my questions.

I should not have minded if <inline font-weight="bold">Major Chanter</inline> had told the truth as to what I did any more than I minded meeting the consequences; but my complaint is that I did nothing more than represent a grievance on behalf of the men. </para>

Although I am out of uniform, my complaint is just as strong, and ought to be heard as readily as if I were still in uniform, I did all I was commanded to do ; I never fell foul of my officers in France, and numbers of others never did until the Armistice was signed, and there was a little lack of that discipline of which, when necessary, there had been such an admirable example.

I  know  that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Harry</inline> Arnall put in the press cutting from the <inline font-style="italic">Register</inline> as evidence. Apparently the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> has never inquired into the matter. When Friend told me that they had put in the press cutting, I said that what had happened served him right for making a statement to the press, and pointed out to him that I had refused to do so. The chief evidence against him was his own statement in the press, and it was not put in as evidence against me but as evidence against him. When I spoke about <inline font-weight="bold">Major Chanter</inline> having given a statement to the press the Assistant Minister said that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Chanter</inline> had no knowledge that he was giving information to the press, or that it would be published. But I waited on Captain Norman Malcolm, who saw <inline font-weight="bold">Major Chanter</inline> when the <inline font-style="italic">Somali</inline> came in, and took his statement. Captain Malcolm went with the Light Horse to Egypt, and was a troop comrade of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Chanter.</inline> Only last Monday, <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the railway station, I asked Captain Malcolm whether <inline font-weight="bold">Major Chanter,</inline> if he said he did not know the statement he made was going to be published, would  be saying what was untrue, and Captain Malcolm replied, "In my opinion, yes; we went away and had dinner, and I took the statement down in my notebook." Captain Malcolm is, I believe, employed on the press to do military work. If <inline font-weight="bold">Major Chanter</inline> says he did not know his friend, Captain Malcolm, took down the statement for publication, he is, in my opinion, telling a deliberate lie. </para>

                            C. Chanter, D.S.O., a Light Horse officer, who left Australia with the 9th Light Horse Regiment in February, 1915, and has latterly been attached to the 4th Light Horse Brigade, was one of the ship's complement, and he stated on Tuesday that the general conduct of the men -was excellent. They were a splendid lot of men, and quite amenable to reason, but a small section, who were led by Rp. Yates, adopted unusual methods of obtaining redress for their grievances. Instead of approaching the CO. of the boat through "their officers, they went to him direct, and delegates were appointed from the various units to meet the CO. in conference on any matter which they considered required attention.

                        <para>When the troops reached Colombo they were told, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Chanter,</inline> that any shore leave then received would be deducted from the period granted on their arrival in Australia. The result was that the men remained ' on the boat, and gave no trouble. Then when . they got to Fremantle they were not allowed" ashore owing to a reported outbreak of influenza. As a matter of fact, the only case resembling influenza was that of the ship's carpenter, who resumed work four days after the report of his sickness. Shore leave was consequently disallowed, and the men were given to understand that they would undergo a course of disinfection on their voyage to the Eastern States, where they would be immediately landed if there were no further outbreaks. Every day on the voyage to the Largs Bay anchorage the men were treated in fumigation rooms, and then, on their arrival, they were told that they would have to undergo seven days' quarantine before the boat continued on it3 voyage. This was naturally interpreted to mean that when the Somali reached Melbourne, Sydney, and Queensland, similar periods of quarantine would be enforced, and all the men felt they had a grievance, although only a few expressed it, and become militant. It was then that Rp. Yates proceeded to the commanding officer, and told him that if the men were not allowed on shore they would seize the ship's boats and land themselves. </para>

However, I can. rely, I think, on Gordon to take a fair view of what I said ; and I may add that when I was arrested I received, amongst other telegrams, one from him offering to give evidence on my behalf. Strange to say, one of the wires that came from Port Pirie was from Colin Gordon, " If want witnesses, call me." That is from the batman of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Chanter,</inline> who, in his statement, charges me with being a man who did not know military discipline, a man who incited to mutiny, and a man who was guilty of conduct to the prejudice of good order and military discipline. </para>

I am satisfied that if it had been left to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Arnall</inline> alone, I would not have been prosecuted. When the statement appeared in the papers, however, as one man told me in King William-street, I was a " gone coon," and it was certain that the military would take action. I was charged in company with one of the other men. It was urged against him that he was one of those who said, ' ' We have had a puncture or two before, and if it means another puncture, we can put up with it." That was urged against him in evidence, and was not contradicted. There is also his own statement that he did something. I did nothing. I made no statement to the press, and I let no one know of the action I took. Yet I was sentenced to sixty days. </para>

                    <para class="block">House, has no word come from him ? He has not even written to me to tell me that I have taken quite a wrong view of his statement, and that he had no intention of making it for publication. He must have known, assuming that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Norman</inline> Malcolm was not an incompetent reporter, that what he said would be urged against me, and that it would prejudice my case when I was tried. </para>
                    <para>I suggest to the Assistant Minister for Defence that I have not had a fair spin in this matter, that I have been unjustly treated, and that, in future, more care should be taken. Thank God, the war is over, and the drastic application of militarism to our people is at an end. There are, however, a lot of other cases which I hope the Minister will sympathetically consider. I believe a number of purely military offenders have been released; but there are also a number of civil cases of which I have instanced one. For example, two men fighting would constitute a civil case, which in civil life would entail a fine of perhaps 50s. As the case I mentioned secured the individual twelve months' imprisonment,I dare say if we went through the whole of the " crimes " which are still being expiated by members of the Australian Imperial Faroe, and which are considered civil offences, we should find that many of the penalties inflicted were far too severe. I trust that, after what I have said of my case, and the penally imposed upon me, these cases will be reviewed, and many men released by the Minister. </para>

                            <para>.- I am loth to intervene; but the statements made concerning a son of whom I feel proud are such as to warrant some reply from me. The honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates)</inline> has practically given him the lie, direct. Those who know the two men - the honorable member who has spoken, and my son, who gave his services to his country, not only for two years in the South African war, but for four years in the war just ended, and who came back after gaining by his own merit the award of the D.S.O. from the King - will admit that my son's word can fairly be put against the honorable member's word. I have these facts from my son direct, and I believe the Department has a written statement from him also. He tells me that, on the boat arriving at Adelaide, they were allowed to go on shore. He went on shore, and there met a brother officer with whom he had fought side by side in the various Egyptian campaigns. He lunched with him, and in the conversation at the table this friend said to him, " I hear there has been some trouble on the <inline font-style="italic">Somali."</inline> Then, in a conversational way, my son told him what had happened, but not all that the newspaper said, because some of it has been corrected, notwithstanding the statement just made by the honorable member for Adelaide. However, my son did tell his friend the facts of the case. I believe that conversation was telegraphed across to the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus.</inline> I am not aware that any report appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> nor do I think it did. But when it appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> one part was absolutely incorrect. That was the part regarding the captain of the ship. I was present when my son went into the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> office and pointed out to the sub-editor that that part was not correct. That was the part where it was said, as was just read by the honorable member for Adelaide, that when the captain of the ship was requested by the men to stop the ship, or they would take command of it, the captain brought the ship to a standstill. The honorable member for Adelaide admits that he was present on that occasion. </para>

As a matter of fact, my son did not do this, nor had he any such intention in his mind. The honorable member knows that on the day <inline font-weight="bold">Major Chanter</inline> lunched with Captain Malcolm there was no thought of any proceedings being taken against him, and I have yet to learn that the statement about which the honorable member has complained so much was even before the court martial. Whether he did it wilfully or not, the honorable member led us to understand that there were two statements before the court martial - one made by <inline font-weight="bold">Major Chanter</inline> and one made by Private Friend. Private Friend's statement might have been before the court martial, but <inline font-weight="bold">Major Chanter's</inline> was not. Therefore, my son did not in any way interfere with the honorable member's case. </para>

                            <para>Gunner Yates was the first  speaker.  He said that the men were tired of staying on board the ship in quarantine, and that arrangements would have to bo made by 5 o'clock that afternoon or they intended to take possession of the boats and go ashore...... I also told them that, if the worst came to the worst, I, as Officer Commanding troops, was held responsible for the discipline on the ship, and that I intended to do my duty.

                            <para>I said, "I hear there is talk of lowering the boats down and rowing yourselves ashore, and I understand that you are the spokesman for a body of men who intend to do this." and I said, "Now, you are a member of Parliament, I understand,' for Adelaide, and therefore you have got influence with the men; I know you have got influence with those men; you will understand you will be responsible for doing this, but I have to address you, as you are the spokesman for the men, and you will be held responsible for any actions that those men do. I am not going to allow you to lower the boats down, and I shall take all precautions that I can. Before you do this, let me advise you to think over seriously what it means to lower the boats down and row ashore. In the first place, you will have to deal with the naval, the military, and the civil authorities. The ship is in quarantine, and the authorities, to the best of their ability, are doing this to prevent this contagious disease spreading, and it is an irksome thing, but we have all got to put up with it." I pointed out the seriousness of it and the stupidity of it. </para>
                            <para>What did the accused say ? - The reply he made was that the men were very much irked at being kept on board; they understood, when they left Fremantle, that after seven days the ship would be free of quarantine, and they resented the quarantine authorities' action. . . </para>
                            <para>Were they paraded before you? - No. </para>
                            <para>Who spoke? - Yates spoke. I asked them what they had come there for, and then Yates said, " Well, Captain, we are very sorry, you are a victim of circumstances. Wo are not satisfied with the present state of tilings, and if you do not turn back we shall have to put somebody else in command, and, in other words, commandeer the ship."..... </para>
                            <para>What did you say to him? - I said to him, "You do not realize what that means; it is mutiny on the high seas; and I pointed out to him the seriousness of it. I said, " Supposing you do take charge of the ship, what are you going to do with her? You could not let that anchor down." </para>
                            <para>Did he say anything to you? - He said, "We have got a man with a master's certificate on board." I said, "Have you? You have got a man with a master's certificate who does not know the ship, and your orders will not be carried out unless they come through me, and it is a very foolish tiling to do." I expostulated with him on the seriousness of what he intended to do. </para>

                            <para>. If members of the Commonwealth Public Service feel that they are labouring under a grievance it would be an unfortunate position for them if they were debarred from having their cases brought before the House. I wish to draw "attention to the case of Alexander Henry, Sub-Collector of Customs in Adelaide. I take it that he must be a trustworthy officer because of the positions he has held, and I take it also that his services must have been of some value to the Departments in which he has served. Prior to the establishment of Federation he was employed by the. New South Wales Government, and in the earlier days of Federation he was stationed in the neighbourhood of Sydney. He was afterwards transferred to Bourke, from Bourke to Wilcannia, and then from Wilcannia to Broken Hill. Undoubtedly he was sent to some very salubrious places. Of course, officers of the Commonwealth Service cannot pick and choose where they are to work, but there are places such as the capital cities, the larger- inland towns, and some of the coastal towns, which are not unpleasant if one is appointed to carry out his official duties in them. On the other hand, the places where this gentleman was located are not localities one would choose for a holiday or places where one would seek employment if it could possibly be obtained elsewhere. The House should firmly insist that no officer should be subjected to injustice because of a prejudice against him on the part of any person in authority. Every man has his own peculiarities; none of us are perfect. But so long as an officer does his duty efficiently and respectfully to those in authority he has certain rights of which nobody should be able to deprive him. I shall not support anybody who does not treat with respect those who are placed in authority above him. But it would appe'ar that for some reasons best known to themselves former Comptrollers-General of Customs had a set against this man. I make no complaint of the closing- of the office at </para>

                        <para class="block">Broken Hill; I believe it was closed on the recommendation of the Comptroller, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mills.</inline> Henry states that in 1907 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lockyer</inline> forced him to go to Broken Hill, and compelled him to do the -work at a salary £45 per annum below the minimum fixed for the position of Sub-Collector of Customs at Broken Hill. That statement is either true or false; so far as I have been able to ascertain, it is perfectly true. I do not ask for the ordinary official reply to this complaint. Usually when a complaint is made the official answer is, "The regulations are against you." Very good. Regulations are made for the carrying on of the work of a Department. But when we insist that they be observed by those in subordinate positions we should likewise insist that they should not be broken by those in authority when it suits them to do so. This officer complains that at short notice he was transferred from Wilcannia to Broken Hill. That took place in the " boom " year, and he was unable to find hotel 'accommodation or suitable lodgings for himself and family. Some friends gave them a bedroom and lodging temporarily, and finally Henry was compelled to purchase a residence, -which, with additions,  cost £1,002. An officer of the Customs Department is obliged to go wherever he is sent, but a man appointed to the position of Sub-Collector at Broken Hill ought not to be left like a dog dying for lack of a kennel. I fully understand the conditions that obtained in Broken Hill during the " boom " days! For postal officials the Department, very rightly, provides substantial residential accommodation at Broken Hill and all other towns of importance. Why should the Customs Department evade the responsibility of providing proper accommodation for its officers? In this instance the Department did not care a cuss how its officer fared. The country expects members of Parliament to maintain with some dignity the positions they occupy, and it has a similar expectation of persons occupying responsible positions like that of Sub-Collector of Customs at an important centre. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry</inline> asserts that on the 31st March,  1917, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mills</inline> closed the Broken. Hill Customs House, and directed him, in order to suit the convenience of the Department, to take the recreation leave that was due to him. Permission to dis- pose of his furniture and residence was obtained, and they were submitted at auction, with the following result - Furniture, cost £179 13s. 10d., amount received £70, loss £109 13s.10d. ; residence, cost £1,0021s. 9d., amount received £586, loss £4161s. 9d., to which must be added £29 3s. for expenses in connexion with the sale. He claims also £450 on account of salary, representing an underpayment of £45 per annum for over nine years. I remember reading, when a young man, that Professor Huxley, in replying in the <inline font-style="italic">Nineteenth Century</inline> to a statement by Gladstone, said that an official statement was only another name for a lie. I should be sorry to say that of all official statements, but there are some of which that description is true. I do not ask for the issue raised in this ease to be dodged or obscured. Either it is true or false that this man was paid less than the regulations entitled him to, and that the regulation was broken by the Comptroller. If that allegation is true, this man was honestly entitled to the salary that he was refused. He states, further, that in 1904 he was next in seniority to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Inspector</inline> Banks, of New South Wales, who is now in receipt of £560 per annum, and also senior to any departmental officer in the State of South Australia. </para>

                                <para>- I cannot say offhand, but as Sub-Collector of Customs in Adelaide, where revenue to the amount of £350,000 was collected by the Department during the last financial year, he occupies one of the most important positions in South Australia. I make no complaint about his present position; I am asking that justice be done him in respect of past occurrences. When a member of the outside public has a grievance he sends a petition of right to the King, and the <inline font-style="italic">fiat</inline> goes forth to the Supreme Court of the State from which the petition came, " Let that right be done." When any member of the Public Service exercises his right to petition Parliament, by getting some honorable member to state his grievance, the allegation is not answered when the Minister in charge of the Department says, "This did not occur during my administration; it occurred some years ago. I am too busy to rake up these old matters." If an injustice has been done, it is never too late to make reparation. The Department of Trade and Customs seems to have no concern in the accommodation provided for its officers. That does not matter at large ports where accommodation is not difficult to find. But in places like Broken Hill and Wilcannia, the Department should find residences for its officials. Henry was sent from Wilcannia to Broken Hill at short notice, and was obliged to buy a residence and furniture. Later, altered circumstances made the closing of the Broken Hill office necessary in the interests of economy and good government. For that, neither the Sub-Collector nor the Department is to blame ; but it is hard on the officer that he should be asked to sacrifice the house and furniture which he had to buy at " boom " prices. He must have been a careful and economical man to withstand the eccentricities of the Department of Trade and Customs. </para>

That was the correct view to take. It should not be necessary to trouble honorable members with grievances of this kind, but, unfortunately, in this case both the Comptroller-General of Customs and the Public Service Commissioner continued to " sit tight." They take the view that the petition relates to something that occurred years ago, and that they are not going to bother their head's about it. And they will continue to take up that attitude until the Minister for Trade and Customs is strong enough to say that the matter must be settled on certain lines. </para>

I am sure that honorable members on both sides of the House will agree with me that this man has a substantial grievance.

If I had more of the wisdom of the serpent, when the honorable member asked me what I wished him to withdraw I should have referred him to my sworn declaration. How dare the honorable member make statements in this House as to what his son, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Chanter,</inline> said or did on an occasion when he was not present? He has said that the incident on the <inline font-style="italic">Somali</inline> amounted to mutiny. Rubbish! A man may say to another, "I will kill you;" but the threat is as nothing unless the threatened action follows. Threatened men live long. It is utterly wrong, I contend, to stamp the <inline font-style="italic">Somali</inline> incident as a mutiny. </para>

                                <para>- The Defence Department is rotten - lock, stock,  and  barrel. The Minister who controls it <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> lied in the Senate and in the witness-box concerning the Gunner Perry case. He lied when he said that the fence surrounding a certain hospital to which reference was made during that case was over 7 feet high. When he was giving evidence before the Court of Inquiry, I asked him, through <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Woolf,</inline> whether his statement to that effect, as reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> was not absurd. His reply was, "No; I know it is over 6 feet high."' As &amp; matter of fact, it is only 4 ft. 6 in. high. </para>

                        <para>We have seen £60,000 paid to a phantom regiment, and men imprisoned, in spite of the assurance by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> when Leader of the Government, that the civil law would be dominant as against the military law. I asked many questions on this point, and have never allowed any proposal to pass unless I was satisfied that the civil law would be the superior; indeed, I went so far as to refuse to take the pledge of the then Attorney-General, and insist on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> being brought into the House to assure us on the point. </para>
                        <para>I accuse the present Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> of trying to ruin, month after month, the Anzac hand-weaving trade. Some time ago, I brought fifty or sixty samples of cloth into the House, and some honorable members were so pleased with them that they purchased some. I have never yet met a member of Parliament, or a private person, who has tried this cloth and is not satisfied "with it. The industry,, however, has never had a "dog's chance." At first, if a soldier employed was in receipt of a pension, the amount of pension was deducted from the money he earned. I am sorry to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was not stating the truth, or perhaps it would he more polite to say that he was inaccurate, when he declared that none of the soldiers thus employed was injured. </para>
                        <para>That was when I asked the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. "Watt)</inline> why the Anzac soldiers, who were engaged making cloth, had not some of their products shown in the Queen's Hall along with the work of other soldiers. We all know that no soldier receives a pension unless he is proved unfit from a military point of view, either through severe illness, or, more likely, by reason of wounds. The method in the factory was that if a man was receiving 15s. per week as a pension, it was deducted from his wages, which were thus reduced to 27s. per week. If a man had not been injured, he was allowed to earn £2 2s. Certain yarn supplied was worse than shoddy. It is true that it is all wool, but, as I have shown on previous occasions, it is of very short staple. In company with a member of a State Legislature, I showed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> some samples, and he said that they were terrible, and their production must be stopped. This yarn was made up, and sent to Buckley and Nunn's, by whom, as it was not fit for the use of adults, it was made up into children's garments. </para>

                                <para>- I am giving the alleged reason. I desire to say nothing disparaging of Messrs. Buckley and Nunn, to whom I tender my thanks for coming forward at an awkward moment, and taking all the output they were allowed to sell. As the representative of Melbourne, however, I, do object to this firm only being allowed to obtain the wool. This tweed, manufactured at 7s. or 7s. 6d. per yard, would give those engaged <inline font-style="italic">£A</inline> to £4 10s. per man for weaving. The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> asked on one occasion why this cloth was not sold at 10s., and I repeat the question. If it were sold at 10s. 6d. per yard by the roll to warehousemen and tailors, it would give a profit of 33^ per cent. All others who purchased in suit lengths, which is more expensive than purchasing by the roll, might be charged is. or ls. (id. a yard extra. </para>

                        <para>The other day I mentioned the fact that  ai  number of gentlemen in this city were willing to put their money into this industry if they had a guarantee that good yarn would be supplied from the Government mills; but this suggestion, like all else connected with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> is hung up. Of all the contemptible things in connexion with the business the worst is an attempt to reduce the remuneration of the men. The usual way of paying weavers is so much per yard as the cloth leaves the loom, but the Department desires to pay the . men by the yard after the cloth has been shrunk, and cloth shrinks from \ to \ of a yard, according to the material. Thus the Government sought to save a paltry 6d. or so on the weaving. If the Government will guarantee that the Government mills at Geelong will supply good yarn, any one can make good wages at the trade. </para>

                        <para> If the business had been properly managed there would have been, not thirteen men, but 500 or 600 men earning good wages, and cloth for a suit could have been bought for 32s. 6d., and of a quality that is not sold in England under 21s. a yard. Honorable members may think I am drawing the long bow, but the Reverend S. H. Cox - who, by the way, is a relative of the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> - stated at Geelong that cloth from the Geelong mills went out at 8s. per yard, but, after going through the big warehouses in Melbourne, it was returned to Geelong to be sold at 21s. and 25s. per yard. This, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cox</inline> said, was not a question of the Tariff, but one for parliamentary action. That statement was made in the presence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smale,</inline> the manager of the mills, and his next officer, and they did not contradict it when in conversation with me 'afterwards. </para>

                        <para class="block">If a tailor is sufficiently energetic to ask for a roll of cloth, he should be charged the same price as the warehousemen are charged. Some time ago I made inquiries regarding "Blighty" tweeds, which are just the same as the Harris tweeds, though without the peat smell, and are sold in lengths of 7 and 8 yards. The 8- yard lengths are for women's overcoats, and the 7-yard lengths are for men's  suitings. Any one can go into the shop and purchase this cloth. The weavers are returned soldiers of the same calibre as our men, only they are British. They are given a splendid chance, and earn up to £4 10s. per week in Glasgow and Aberdeen. The only difference between that cloth and the cloth I am wearing is that the yarn is hand-turned by a spinning wheel, like that used by Marguerite in <inline font-style="italic">Faust.</inline> That is the only difference between the so-called Harris tweed, Or the present Blighty tweed, and the tweed our men make. In the latter case the yarn is spun by machinery. There is no reason why, instead of thirteen men. there should not be 500 or more employed at this work if the Government wish it to continue. Au educated gentleman at the Working Men's College assured me that any intelligent man could learn simple weaving work, such as this, in three weeks. Foy and Gibson do the dressing and fixing up at a cost of 4Jd. after the tweed has been woven, and I am glad to give them credit for all they have done. But for that firm the industry would have been killed through the inaction and opposition of the Repatriation Department, especially before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> took charge. When the State War Department were in control, they helped the industry greatly, and it was the lament of the men them employed that the officer in charge was removed when the Commonwealth took things over. </para>

                                <para>- I see the Minister will not give me a direct answer to my question. Any man who says that there is not more profiteering now than there was three years ago has not kept his eyes open, and does not use his brains. It is infamous that we are not doing something to stop the profiteering that is going on. There is not a man, woman, or child outside but is suffering. When the adjournment of the House was moved the other day, it was shown that the price of boots had been greatly increased. I have shown what has happened in regard to cloth after it is sold from the Geelong mills. There is an old song to the effect that " We walked right in and turned around and walked right out again." So this cloth is sent from the mills into the Flinders-lane warehouse, and then is sent out again to Geelong, and charged so many hundred per cent. more. We have read what is happening in regard to the price of hats. A statement was published this morning showing that over 1,000,000 carcasses are in cool storage in Melbourne, and that there has been an enormous increase in the price of meat since 1909. Women who used to buy good meat now have to buy bones and boil them down for soup. Honorable members should see the poor people being served with small portions of soup by the relief committee at the Trades Hall. There is soup there every day so long as funds are provided. It takes my mind back to the time when over 250,000 meals were served at the old Trades Hall following the <inline font-style="italic">debacle</inline> of the land boom. In those days people could get three loads of sheep's heads free, delivered at the door. To-day, owing to profiteering and other causes, which have brought about an increased price, meat cannot be obtained at a reasonable figure, although 1,000,000 carcasses are held in cold storage. What are the Government doing? What is the House doing? One can call from the house-tops, and nothing is done. It has been suggested to me that the Government intend to wait until their Leader comes back, when he will fight profiteering. I have fought him when I thought he was wrong, but if he does right in this matter he will have my full support and cordial approbation. Something must be done. Every day the Government delay they are doing themselves neither honour nor justice. </para>

                        <para>Take the case of bread, which is called the staff of life. The Conservatives in England at the latter end of the last century were somewhat astonished when Jonathan Hutchinson, the greatest surgeon of the day, advocated the nationalization of bread.  His  remarks, owing to the high position he held, caused a great deal of discussion in 1897 or 1898. We may have to come to that some day, because it seems infamous that so much should be charged for bread after the bountiful harvests with which God has blessed this country. Had there been a famine, one could have understood it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson,</inline> one of the brilliant scholars of the Melbourne. University, shows clearly in his book on <inline font-style="italic">The Trusts of Australia,</inline> that when flour was sold at £11 10s. per ton, which is higher than  the present price, bread was sold at 5½d. and 6id. per 4-lb loaf. If people buy a 1-lb. loaf, which goes under the name of fancy bread, they now pay 2½d., or at the rate of lOd. for 4 lbs. Rolls are charged ever so much more. All these fancy breads are so much fake or camouflage to rob the people. I have taken the trouble to ask members of the House who have had farming experience what is a fair pruce for wheat per bushel to give a return to the man on the land. I have also made inquiries in various States, and have been told that from 4s. to 4s. 3d. per bushel at the station will pay. From my experience of the miles of country I saw under wheat in Western Australia, that price will give the farmer a fighting show. </para>

                                <para>- Then I cannot go into that matter, but the honorable member is the first I have heard who is of that opinion. No one on this side would refuse the farmer who grows wheat a fair price. Let the price be fixed at whatever is a fair thing. Then let the price of gristing be fixed, say, at lOd. per bushel, or whatever is a fair amount. Then let the Government, if they want to stop profiteering, fix the price of flour at, say, £10 7s. 6d. or £10 15s. per ton, and let any miller be imprisoned who refuses to supply flour at the price fixed by the Government to any baker who wants it. The price of bread should then be fixed over the counter, allowing the baker to charge extra for delivery. If the Government will only adopt that common-sense method in regard to the two most important necessaries - meat and bread - much of the present difficulty would be overcome, because the profiteering in the staples of life would be done away with. The Government control sugar, and supply it at 3£d. per lb., but what kind of sugar is being supplied now ; and, if the Colonial Sugar Refining Company made the huge profit of £3,000,000, which they could camouflage by putting it into so-called capital, why did not the Government insist that they should reduce the price of sugar or supply proper white sugar ? </para>

' The autocratic rule we have had since the war has cursed the world makes rae all the more sure that there should be some greater check upon Parliament. I know that the majority on the Government bench are pledged to the referendum and initiative.

                            <para>.- The Victorian  Ministry  have appointed a Commission to inquire into profiteering, tut evidently they intend to allow it to perambulate in its own sweet way, and take its own time about submitting  recommendations.  I have noticed that some ©f the leaders in the State House question whether there is the profiteering in the community that some people talk about. I am a family man, and I speak on behalf of 99-J per cent, of the people who have to pay domestic bills when I say that, in order to eke out an existence, we are paying practically double, and sometimes more, than the price we paid in the prewar period. I intend to quote from the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission in their report on clothing. It cannot be said that the Inter-State Commissioners are Labour supporters. While the Government took drastic action in certain directions during the war, it is regrettable that they did not carry into effect the recommendations of the Commission, and it will be a lasting disgrace to this Parliament if honorable members do not insist that some step be taken to relieve the distress from which the country is now suffering. </para>

When the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> left Great Britain he said that profiteering bred Bolshevism, and in South Africa, on his way out to Australia, he said he would have to fight with tooth and claw both the profiteer and the Bolshevist; but, if it be true that the profiteer breeds Bolshevism, his first attack should be made upon the profiteer. Profiteering is one of the direst calamities that people can suffer, and any Government that will tackle in real earnest the question of the cost of living will have my whole-hearted support. I am afraid that Ministers and their supporters will be held back from attacking the profiteer because there is a general election looming in the near future, and it is well known that the people who have been indulging in profiteering are among those who contribute fairly heavily towards the election funds of what is known as the National party. If, on this occasion, these profiteers do not contribute to the funds of that party, it will be because they may have a lingering doubt that it will not serve them faithfully in the coming Parliament. </para>

                        <quote>
                            <para>Nothing in the present inquiry has been more striking than the reiterated emphasis of Australia's dependence upon importations. That the greatest wool-producing country in the world should occupy such a singular position in regard to woollen clothing is a continual challenge to the thought and interest of its citizens. In times of war the capacity to provide from its own resources an abundance of suitable clothing, alike for the soldier and for the citizen, is an object of capital importance, but it is in times of peace that tHe preparations must be made by which alone that object can be attained. </para>
                            <para>Although Australia is capable of producing practically every class of raw material necessary for the purpose of clothing its people, it is dependent upon importation for the greater portion of such material for the purpose of manufacture. W,e depend upon importations wholly for our supplies of cotton, linen, and silk goods, and in respect to woollens it is questionable whether we are in  a  position to clothe one-third of our people unaided by importations. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">That is an indictment against the Parliament which controls the affairs of the greatest wool-producing country in the world. I feel sorry for those who say that we in Australia live more cheaply than do people in other parts pf the world. But the cost of living should be less in a country which is overflowing with r,aw materials that ought to be turned into the finished- articles. There has not been the increase in New Zealand we have experienced in Australia. Even in South Africa, which is largely de-  pendent on importations, and has not the supply of raw material for manufactured foodstuffs or clothing, the people live more cheaply than do even the people of New Zealand. We ought not to hesitate one moment to bring about relief, especially when we have an unbiased recommendation from the Inter-State Commission. Here are some figures from their report - </para>

                        <para class="block">Even under the wai- conditions there was no necessity for such a rise in prices. I am not quoting from the speech of an orator on the Yarra-bank or a Trades Hall man. The inquiry was made by gifted men, who had ability to extract and analyze evidence, and they have given to Parliament information which he who runs may read. With such startling evidence before us, it is not for us to sit idle and say that we have no proof that profiteering is taking place in this country. The reports of the Inter-State Commission show that prices increased in some instances by 280 per cent, from 1914 to 1918. To-day any person who goes into a shop to purchase a pair of boots is told that the price has risen so much above that which he formerly paid, and that in a few weeks it will be considerably higher. The position in regard t,o clothing is the same. It has been stated that if a man wishes to clothe himself with an ordinary sac suit he will have to pay about £16 16s. in the near future. </para>

If the people had access to the information which they contain, there would be considerably greater protest  against  the profiteers than there is to-day. I have been informed that early in the war the Defence Department let a contract for military hats at 78s. per dozen. When the next contract was advertised, the manufacturers combined and tendered at 87s. per dozen. The Minister who controlled the Department at that time said, " You made the first lot for 78s. per dozen, and, so far as I have been able to ascertain, made a very good profit out of the Department in war time. If you are not prepared to accept this contract at the same price. I shall commandeer your hat mills, and the Department will make its own requirements." Faced with that alternative, the manufacturers tendered at the old price of 78s. per dozen. I do not know whether they have made attempts since to profiteer at the expense of the Defence Department. </para>

                        <para class="block">In these few words we have summed up the rapacity of some of the so-called respectable citizens of Australia. The comment applies to firms that were in affluent circumstances before the war broke out. Instead of charging exorbitant prices for the material for our soldiers, these firms, having done so well in this sunny land of ours, might well have said, " The country is at war. We shall be true to it, and, as patriotic men, be content to secure only a very limited profit." But no ; these men, whom we may be able to get at by  means of an amendment of the Constitution, have robbed the country by these exorbitant charges at a time of dire distress. If such men can be described as patriotic, respectable citizens, then the English language . has lost its original meaning. The indictments I have quoted, and which are laid at the door of some of the chief manufacturers of Australia, are not made by Labour men, but by an independent Commission, as the result of exhaustive evidence taken by it. The Government, meantime, is supinely looking on. Surely it would be worth while to take risks! </para>

                                <para>- I shall tell the honorable member. As I mentioned just now, a number of manufacturers had manufactured military hats for the Government for 78s. per dozen, but when further contracts were invited, they met and decided to put up the price to 87s. per dozen. When this higher price was put before the Minister, he said to these men, " The first contract at 78s. per dozen was carried out by some of yon men. If you are prepared to go on making these hats at that price you can have the contract. But if you insist upon the increased price, I will commandeer your mills, and the Government will manufacture the hats required for our military men." That is what I would do in all these cases. I would be prepared to do anything to put a stop to the people being robbed as they have been consistently robbed during the bitter period of the war. </para>

I do not believe that any thinking man would object to that being done in the interests of the general public. The "welsher" at Flemington is punished by the Victoria Racing Club ; the burglar is sent to gaol; but here we have men who have been robbing the people and the Government, and their supporters, who are supposed to be policing the country, do nothing to put down their profiteering. They actually laugh' at what is going on. </para>

If there is one question agitating the public mind to-day, it is the way in which the people are being robbed. Not one honorable member opposite dare excuse the actions of these firms. Profiteering is more rampant to-day than ever it was. The distress of the people is greater than ever, and the supineness, indifference, and utter callousness of the Government to all that is going on, in this respect, is worse than ever it was. With increasing distress and increased necessity to take action, there is but increased apathy on the part of the Government. </para>

                        <para>It is true, as the Prime Minister said in England, that profiteering breeds Bolshevism. If there is anything calculated to cause a spirit of rebellion to rise up in the hearts of law-abiding citizens, it is the belief that they are being robbed. I do not know how some people live. A workman has to pay 9s. and 10s. for a pair of boots for a child of two or three years, and if he requires woollen clothing for his children he has to pay the exorbitant prices demanded by the profiteers. Even a Tory like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bonar</inline> Law is prepared to do something to put down profiteering. He will not go as far as the miners desire by nationalizing the coal mines of Great Britain, but that is coming. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bonar</inline> Law, speaking in the House of Commons some twelve months ago, said that in two years the dividends paid on shipping shares, which had cost him £8,000, amounted to £7,000. I dare say that by now, on his capital outlay of £8,000, he has received dividends totalling £12,000. The British Government are making some effort to stop profiteering, whereas Australia, which should set an example to the world, is in this respect lagging far behind? The people will take us to account for this neglect, and rightly so. We cannot remain silent while they are being robbed by the profiteers. </para>
                        <para>I do not know how one-half of the people manage to live at the present time. Apart altogether from the industrial trouble, there is much distress. Even men whom I thought to be almost independent have been bitterly complaining to me of the difficulty of making ends meet owing to the increase in the cost of living. Men who have been for years in receipt of good salaries are coming to me from time to time, and are saying, " If the Federal Parliament cannot help us, is there not some Parliament that can relieve the situation?" If such men feel the pinch, what must be the position of those who are earning only £2 or £3 a week, and some less? </para>
                        <para>Is it right for this Parliament to remain idle? I know that the old parrot cry, " We have not the constitutional power to deal with' profiteering," will again be raised. But little has been done by the Government under its war powers during the last four or five years. The Labour party tried to secure an amendment of the Constitution, conferring much wider powers on the National Parliament. On the first occasion, its proposals were rejected by a majority of something like 250,000 votes; but on the second occasion, we were within an ace of carrying some of our amendments. Sub sequently further proposals to amend the Constitution were, made, but largely owing to the influence and promises made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> the referendum was not put to the people. To-day, I believe far more drastic propositions would be carried. I believe that the people would: even vote for Unification, if they were satisfied that the National Parliament would thus have full power to deal with the profiteers. If we have an election within the next month or so, the people will not rest content unless, ,at the same time, proposed amendments of the Constitution are submitted to them - amendments such as will not permit any encroachment on the part of the States upon the privileges of the National Legislature. My fear is that while we leave the State Constitutions as they are, we shall not have a free hand to deal with this question. </para>
                        <para>Section 51 of the Constitution covers what are known as the thirty-nine articles. Its opening provision is, " The Parliament shall have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth." Then follow the thirty-nine articles, setting out the subjects in respect of which we may legislate. I would submit to the people a proposal to strike out all but the opening clause of the section, so that the National Parliament would- be given the broad power to " make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth." </para>

If such an. amendment were made, we would be as free as are the Parliaments of the United Kingdom-, Canada, and South Africa, to discharge national duties in the interests of the whole df the people. I do not think that anything short of such an amendment would satisfy the people, or give us the power that we really require. Even the drastic amendments which the Labour party attempted to carry out would not put us in a position of absolute safety. In these days of high prices and distress, let us act like brothers to those who are suffering, and do all we can to relieve them. </para>

                                <para>- I intend to quote from the speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> when an amending Public Service Bill was before us. I may say at the outset that by a subsequent Act the rights that these men. understood they enjoyed have been taken away. I am sorry that the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Webster)</inline> is not present, but I cannot allow this opportunity to pass without calling attention to the matter. Certain telephone mechanics, prior to the war, had passed an examination qualifying them for permanent appointment. When the war broke out the Ministry of the day had had to revise their idea in regard to promotion in the Public Service. A large number of public servants were enlisting, and it was not considered right in their absence abroad to give promotion to those left behind. It was, therefore, decided by the Fisher Government, which was then in power, not to make appointments or promotions while the war lasted. But the promise was given that those who had been made eligible would become eligible for appointment for nine months after the conclusion of the war. If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George has said, the ratifications of peace will be exchanged by 1st September, those telephone mechanics, who qualified prior to the war, would be eligible for permanent appointment for nine months afterwards. I should like to quote from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the 1st September, 1915, page 6599, in reference to an amending Public Service Bill which was then before the House. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> in introducing that Bill, said - </para>

                            <para>. - The question raised by the honorable member is a fundamental one. All those who are ready to be examined, or who have successfully passed their examination, but have not joined the Defence Forces, will continue to be eligible for appointment to the Commonwealth service. They will retain the positions and emoluments they now enjoy, according to their ability, but they will not be permanently appointed to those positions until nine months after the close of the war. They will have practically all the rights and privileges that they would have had had they been statutorily appointed, with the exception that they will not be permanent officers until nine months after the close of the war. The object is to secure that those officers who have been away should not be prejudiced in their positions because of the fact that they' have been absent from the country. That is the whole object of the measure. To make it clear I will move - : </para>

                        <para>On whichever side of the House we sit we all have a high sense of justice, and whatever political opinions the men concerned may have, they relied on the promise of the then Prime Minister. If that gentleman's words mean anything they mean that these men were secure in their right to appointment within nine months after the conclusion of the war. But what has been the result ? Since then we have passed another amending Public Service Act, in which there is a clause giving preference to returned soldiers. That distinct promise was given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> and those men who do not object to preference to returned soldiers complain -that others who are not returned soldiers have been permanently appointed to positions while they themselves have been left out in the cold. The other day the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> was told, in reply to a question, that two returned soldiers had been appointed as junior mechanics, but I have the best of evidence for a belief that these were not returned soldiers, while between sixty and seventy appointments have been made of junior mechanics over those men who five years ago were promised that their rights would be conserved, but who to-day are walking the streets out of employment. Some married on the strength of the promise given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> and I believe that nearly all of them now have wives and families, and have incurred liabilities in order to establish homes for themselves. For six weeks now their services have been dispensed with. One of these men, I may say, is gifted with inventive genius, and gave to the Department an idea which, I believe, has been the means of saving money to the country. The head of the Department told this man that he understood he had an idea in regard to a certain instrument, and asked him to elaborate it. This the man did, with' advantage to the Department, and now he is out of employment, and his wife and family are suffering. I do not think I am committing any breach of confidence in saying that the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> when the matter was brought under 'his notice, realized that an injustice was being done; but I believe that legal opinion has been obtained by the Government to the effect that the later Public Service Amendment Act gives a prior right to returned soldiers. Even if that be so, I question whether if Parliament, when that Public Service Amendment Bill was before it, had had a full knowledge of the facts, it would have accepted the measure. I presume that  had this war not occurred, these men would have been appointed in the latter part of August, 1934, and would now be permanent employees; but because of our desire -to do justice to those who "went to the Front, these men have to waive their claims. They discharged their duties during the whole course of the war, and have proved themselves efficient. It is not fair for us to discharge technically-trained mechanics who have big family responsibilities, while, at the same time, sending abroad for equipment and material that can be made here. The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> said that the Postal Department is a big employing Department, where, surely, there was room for, at any rate, some of these men. It is heart-breaking to see fine fellows like these idle, while work to which they have been trained is sent abroad. These men have presented their case in the most reasonable. and moderate fashion, and, in spite of the legal opinion that I have referred to, I am sure that honorable members will not tolerate the injustice that is being done. I hope that honorable members will join in urging on the Government that if these men cannot be returned to their original positions, other employment may be found for them. Many of them have paid fees to technical colleges in order to qualify themselves for the service of the public, and they have spent four or five of. the best years of their life in public work only to be now turned adrift. The country cannot afford to lose men like these; and we should do our best to retain their services in some capacity. </para>
                        <para>I now wish to refer to the case of those men of smaller stature who enlisted and fought so well during the war. I take an interest in this matter, because I played some little part in getting the standard height for enlistment reduced to 5 ft. 3 in., and I know that quite a number of such men went to the Front, and, so far as I can gather, fought as well as, and, indeed, in some cases better than, their taller brethren. But now that the war is over they are not, I think, getting a fair deal. I do not know whether the responsibility lies with some 6-foot officer who believes that no one. can fight if he be under a certain height, but for certain appointments in this country there is still a stipulation as to inches. Some of these sturdy little nuggets are of the toughest constitutions, and the hardest workers; indeed, I knew a family, who could almost be described as one of dwarfs, but which was quite conspicuous in this respect. The 5-ft; 3-in. man who went to the Front did equally as well as those of greater stature, yet an advertisement of this nature appears calling for applications from the Instructional Staff in connexion with the Permanent Forces, stipulating that applicants must be at least 5 ft.7½ in. high, with a chest measurement of 35 inches. This debars even men of 5 ft. 7 in. in height from appointment to these permanent positions. We owe a debt to all those men who went to the Front, no matter what their height was, and no such barrier as this should be raised. The Assistant Minister ' <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise),</inline> in reply to my question, said that the Department desired to keep these officers up to a certain height. Some men or shorter stature have, since they returned from the Front, been temporarily occupying positions as instructors. They have been among the best instructors that we have in the Permanent Forces to-day; yet they are to have no chance of permanent appointment. This House should not tolerate treatment of that kind. </para>

In my opinion, blind persons ought to  be allowed to earn a maximum of £2 10s. per week, and still draw the pension. </para>

                                <para>- No doubt it would be necessary. Some years ago I pressed this question at every opportunity afforded to me, and the excuse advanced was that if these people were given the privilege of earning more money it would automatically add to the invalid pension list numbers of people already earning good wages. If that is the case, why cannot the law be amended to limit this privilege to the blind? They are great sufferers, but the majority of them are industrious, and it would not make much difference if the whole of the basketmaking and mat-making work were left to them, provided they could supply the requirements of the community. In any case, they ought to be given an opportunity to earn a living wage, and enjoy some of the comforts and privileges of which they are now deprived , and which are enjoyed by those who can walk abroad and see the glories of the world and the beauties of nature. The married blind who are living with their families have a great struggle if they are debarred from earning a fair and reasonable wage. The regulation to which I object might have the effect of pauperizing men. These people are most intelligent, and take a pleasure in their work; but if we deprive them of the opportunity of adding to their pensions, how gloomy their existence will be. Surely our draftsman can provide a clause to enable them to secure that which they richly deserve. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> knows of their sufferings, and I hope that before the termination of this session an amending Bill will be brought forward to give them, not generous treatment, but simply justice. </para>

She was informed that, although a mother would have been entitled to a brooch with bars, a sister was not entitled, as next-of-kin, to the bars. </para>

If the mother had lived, and had received a brooch with bars, there would have been nothing to prevent her handing it over to the sister. These are matters that irritate the public. This lady did not receive a courteous reply when she went to the Defence Department to make inquiries. The result was that she came away very much depressed, and her husband having sought my assistance, I endeavoured to get the bars attached to the brooch. I was informed by the Departmentthat a regulation prevented it being done. I hope that the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> will look into this matter, and that he will stretch a point to give the next-of-kin that to which she is entitled for the sacrifice made by her brother. Why should there be all this straw-splitting ? I hope that the regulation which prevents this lady from getting the bars attached to the brooch will be abolished, and that something will be done to prevent a repetition of this kind of thing, which is continually bringing the Defence Department into discredit. </para>

I could understand a regulation which would prevent a father and son from being employed in the same office, or branch of the Department; but one which prevents a son who returns from the war from securing employment in the Defence Department because his father is already employed in it is absurd. I hope the Assistant Minister will also look into this matter, and clear it up. If there is proper supervision and discipline in the Department, just as good work ought to be done by a father and son as could be done by them if they were perfect strangers to one another. </para>

                                <para>- At any rate, it is an outcome of the war. Widowed mothers are allowed pensions, but there are many widowed mothers who, while not fully dependent upon the earnings of their sons, have been able to establish a right to the pension, and hold the belief that in the future, as they become older and more dependent on others, their pensions will be increased. On the whole, the officers administering the War Pensions Act have treated them in a fairly sympathetic way, but there are so many anomalous cases that one fails to understand why these officers do not carry out the spirit of the Act For instance, the son of a widow in my constituency went to the Front. She married a second time, and her husband also went to the war. The son was killed; the husband returned, and, like many another soldier, was so upset in mind and habits that his wife found it necessary to live apart from him. That woman has been unable to establish her right to a pension as. a widowed mother because the Department says that she was not dependent upon her son when, at eighteen years of age, he left for the Front. If that young man had lived he would be now about twenty-two years of age, and in the ordinary course of events would be helping to maintain his mother. </para>

                                <para>- That can be said of the deceased son of every widowed mother. I am anxious to see this woman establish her claim to a pension as a widowed mother. Other widowed mothers who have no more claim than she has - many, indeed, have less - are in receipt of pensions. The Department is even paying pensions to dependent fathers in some cases. I have interested myself in this woman's case, and the reply of the Department is that as she was not dependent upon her son when he went away, she was not eligible for a pension. I bring the matter before the House because ordinary correspondence with the Department does not give these cases publicity or get them remedied.. The spirit of the Act is that widowed mothers are entitled to a pension, and I submit that this woman has not been treated as I think she ought to be. </para>

                        <para>Under the Defence. Act, service in the Army and Navy for home defence is compulsory . The operation of this section in connexion with the Navy causes injustices that ought to bring condemnation upon this Parliament. I blame, not the present Government, but rather the whole Parliament, for not having made provision to deal with cases such as this to which I wish to refer. Young fellows, after they are eighteen years of age, when, perhaps, they are indentured to a trade, are called up for service by proclamation. A lad who is called for service in the Navy may be sent to Queenscliff, Point Lonsdale, or to one of the islands to do garrison duty. After two or three months there he may be released ; then called up again for five or six months, and again returned to civil life. One young fellow was compulsorily called up for service with the Naval Forces, and was sent to England on a troopship. Honorable members may recollect that towards the end of 1915 there was some trouble with the seamen, and the then Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jensen)</inline> called up the young men in the Naval Militia, and  forced them to take a troopship to England. The man to whom I refer was on that vessel, and throughout the trip was subject to naval discipline. On returning to Australia he tried to enlist with the Australian Imperial Force, but because he was in the Naval Militia he was not accepted. He made another endeavour to get to the Front, but again was prevented. Then he was called up for duty on the <inline font-style="italic">Psyche.</inline> That boat cruised about the Australian coast for some time, and in December, 1918, after the war was over, the young fellow was discharged. He had lost three years of training at his trade, and is now thrown on the world without any occupation or a chance of availing himself of the opportunities that are given to the members of the Australian Imperial Force. Will any person say that it is just to make these young men suffer all their lives because they were compulsorily called up for service in defence of their country ? It is because of cases of this character that conscription is so generally hated by the community. If this young man had not, by reason of his residence in a certain locality, been obliged to train with the Naval Forces, he would have been a military trainee, and if he had not gone to the Front he would by now have been a journeyman and able to earn a decent livelihood. I have placed this case and others before the Acting Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton),</inline> who, although very sympathetic, has said that if he were to give the assistance that is asked he would be acting contrary to the Act. </para>

                        <para class="block">Is it right that we should treat in this fashion young men who rendered war service with the Navy ? They had no choice as to which branch of the service they would join; being resident in a certain place they were compelled to serve with the Naval Militia. The young man whose case I am particularly stressing performed his duties well, and has a record of good conduct. Now he is without a trade, and the Commonwealth says it has no responsibility towards him. It is the duty of the Government to order some inquiry into these cases. I should be quite content if the Acting Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> would investigate them, and see if something cannot be done to right the wrongs of these young men. There were cases of others who were indentured, and when they returned from naval service were over the apprenticeship age. For three years they have been absent from their trade. They are now asked to go back to the second-year work of an apprentice, and accept second-year pay. That was not the intention of Parliament when it passed the Defence Act. In one instance the firm to which a naval trainee was apprenticed had gone out of business when he was released from naval service, but the Department provided for him. Representing a maritime constituency, many such cases come under my notice, and I am continually approaching the Minister regarding them. He admits that I have no other course than to appeal to him for redress. It would not cost a great deal to make some reparation to these men. Any such action would be indorsed by Parliament and the people. I know that the Government are probably afraid of the possible far-reaching effects of any concession they might make in this direction. Men who have served on troopships or have been engaged in mine-sweeping, may ask to be similarly treated. Already the munition workers have made claims upon the Government for consideration. They did certain war work for the Empire, and took the risks of sea travelling. So did the men employed on troopships; one man I know was on three different vessels that were torpedoed. The munition workers get no reparation unless for immediate losses of tools or personal effects. The Government fear the possibility of having to compensate all persons who have assisted in the war. I would not say that the people whom I have enumerated are not entitled to the Repatriation benefits, but I do say that young men who were compulsorily serving in the Naval Militia, and who were not allowed to enlist in the Army, should receive consideration. I hope the Government will do something to alleviate the conditions of men who are without a trade, although they have reached an age at which they should be taking upon themselves the responsibilities of married life. </para>

It is admitted that the cook was in the habit of selling food to the nien at night. I believe that he' used to sell them chipped potatoes at ls. 6d. per plate. These potatoes must have come out of the ordinary supplies. Action was taken to put a stop to the practice, but the only result was that thereafter the men had to pay 2s. per plate for their chipped potatoes. It is admitted by the officers that that sort of thing had to be stopped. The pudding which was placed at the door of the Officer Commanding was unfit to eat. It was .placed there for that reason. I heard of these complaints by accident. I heard some of the men joking about the food supplies and saying that the stew served out was uneatable. I was told by the men. that the complaint was, not as <inline font-weight="bold">Major Wark</inline> reports, that there were not enough vegetables, but that there were no vegetables in it.

                        <para>I know of aim Officer Commanding troops on board a transport who dealt with such complaints in a way quite different from that adopted by <inline font-weight="bold">Major Wark.</inline> When a complaint was made to him that the food supplied to the men was insufficient he detailed a quartermaster to see that the meat was weighed out and that full weight was given. The quartermaster shortly after returned to the Officer Commanding and told him that the cook, with a knife in his hand, had chased him out of the galley. The cook objected to his intrusion. The Officer Commanding might have taken certain action in accordance with military discipline, but instead of doing so he appointed the champion boxer an. board ship as a temporary quartermaster and told him it was. hu duty to see that the meat supplies were properly weighed out. A quarter- of an hour later one of the officers waited on the Officer Commanding and said, " You will have to appoint another cook, sir." There was no more trouble on board that ship as far as food supplies were concerned. </para>

                        <para>I have said that it was a somewhat similar trouble on the troopship <inline font-style="italic">Somali</inline> which led to the honorable member for Adelaide (Gunner Yates) being sentenced (by a court martial. I shall never be satisfied until the Commonwealth compensates him for the indignity to which he was subjected, and reimburses him the amount withheld from his pay, as well as the cost to which he was put in having to defend himself before the court martial. I do not want to be personal in this matter, but I insist that justice shall be done. I sat out Gunner Yates' court martial for three days, and heard the evidence in chief. The only officer who seemed to be at all competent was the prosecuting officer, who, I understand, is a lawyer; but it was easy to see that he was disgusted with his job. Gunner Yates was accused of failing to make representations through the proper channels in regard to the complaints of the men on the <inline font-style="italic">Somali.</inline> As a matter of fact, the ordinary channels were availed of, but no redress could be secured. Gunner Yates' counsel at the court martial asked the captain of the ship, "Did you ever send for Yates?" He replied, " I think I sent for him once." Further cross-examined, however, he eventually admitted that he had sent for Gunner Yates on five different occasions. "Now," said the lawyer, "Why did you send for him ?" " I sent for him," said the captain, "because he was a representative man, and I thought he might have some influence with the men." The honorable member was punished because lie had some influence with the men, and prevented a mutiny. There were threatennings, but no mutiny actually took place. The man who should have been punished for the trouble that took place on the <inline font-style="italic">Somali</inline> was General Antill, State Commandant of South Australia. How the hell he came to be made a general, I do not know. For six days complaints were addressed to him in vain. While the ship was lying off shore - close to the city from which many of the boys came - they were not even able to obtain a piece of soap. They complained that lice were again appearing on their bodies. They had no comforts, but the officers' had. many. The man who was sentenced to a month's imprisonment, and went to gaol with Gunner Yates for participating in the trouble, is about the most inoffensive looking " pirate " I ever saw. He had devoted the whole of his time, both in the Old Country and aboard ship, to the Soldiers' Comforts Fund. He was sentenced to a month's imprisonment really for looking after the interests of the men. </para>
                        <para>A great deal has been said about <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Hone,</inline> the quarantine officer for South Australia. In Court it- was given in evidence on oath that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Hone,</inline> who was the cause of the men being kept on shore, did not know until <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> o'clock at night that there was trouble on the ship. This must have been the fault of somebody; and it was evident, from his demeanour, that the Officer Commanding did not like his job. I suppose he could not " give away " his superior officer - one of the conditions of the military life. The peculiar thing is that Gunner Yates went ashore while the ship came east. Certain things appeared in the newspapers, and, because of this, six days afterwards Gunner Yates was arrested, brought to Melbourne under guard, tried, and sentenced to 60 days. When sentence was passed, Gunner Yates was recommended to mercy because of the lack of discipline on the ship, but he completed his full sentence, a portion of it in Darlinghurst Gaol, where no soldier should have been sent under such a charge. I was through Darlinghurst Gaol five months ago, and I can certainly say that it is not a fit place in which to detain anybody, more especially a man who desires to keep clean. As a matter of fact, Gunner Yates stopped a riot, and did not cause one, and the officers who tried him ought to have appreciated the fact. There has been no attempt made to alter the treatment of the men on transports, find the officers have not exhibited that feeling they should to men who fought, were wounded, and risked death under them, and gave them the opportunity to obtain honour. All this, however, is nothing new. Many officers regard their men as a father does his son, but others are careless, or have a vindictive and superior feeling towards them. It all depends on the temperament of the officer, and if an officer's temperament interferes with his doing justice to his men he ought to be punished. </para>

                                <para>- When there are these exceptions, the Defence Department ought to do something. Five days after the <inline font-style="italic">Port Lyttleton</inline> arrived, I was at a welcome home to seventeen men, who had travelled on six different ships. Four of these men said that the food supply was good, while one said it was patchy, but after a row it was put right. In the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Port Lyttleton,</inline> however, the matter was never put right. </para>

There is not a permanent transport staff, but the services of officers returning to Australia are utilized. Some of these officers do their duty properly, and some do it badly, and if the men are neglected there is chaos and trouble. How can that be prevented? </para>

                                <para>- The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> told us that the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Heitmann),</inline> in his military capacity, had appointed men to take complaints. This, of course, was a most unmilitary  procedure, but it was done; and I can give the name of one - Private Brown, of the 59th Battalion. In reply to an inquiry by me, I was told that up to the present the Defence Department has not received any report from the Heitmann representatives. What I desire is that the Department should not wait for any report, but look into matters for itself. The trouble right through the Army and Navy is that in ease of trouble the men are punished, and not the officers. </para>

                        <para>I now wish to deal with the case of one- James Mathews. As honorable members are aware, I was summoned before a Court in Maryborough in 1917 for having made a false statement. The magistrate found me guilty of making a false statement, but discharged me because, in his opinion, I had good reason for believing the statement to be true. As a member of this House, and as a unit in the community, I have a right to produce evidence to prove my innocence, and I endeavoured to get certain papers placed on the Library table. That request was refused.- </para>

                                <para>- The war was on, and I kept quiet under the refusal. Now the war is over, however, I have again asked the Government that all the papers connected with their endeavour to secure and formula for steel for shrapnel shells in 1914, and also the papers connected with my own case shall be produced. In the case of the shrapnel shells I am informed that the Government do not consider it advisable to lay these papers on the table of the Library, and, as to my own case, that it is not the practice to lay on the table of the Library papers in relation to prosecutions instituted by the Commonwealth. This means that an innocent man can be arrested, tried, and gaoled without being allowed to produce evidence in proof of his innocence. I observe that a number of members are smiling, apparently at the idea of my being kept in the " booby hatch " for six months; but, in any case, I am going to take my liberty in my hands again. The prosecution of myself was initiated by the Defence Department under the War Precautions Act, and the information was signed by General Williams, State Commandant. I have, as I said, endeavoured to get evidence in the hands of the Department to prove my innocence, but it has been refused. The facts of the case as to the steel formula are that in 1915 manufacturers in my division, though political opponents, sent to me as their representative, and asked me to introduce them as a deputation to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> with a view to their manufacturing shrapnel in order to meet the great demand for ammunition -at the time. The deputation came to Parliament House, but when I saw <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> he said to' me that it was of no use his receiving them, because the Government could not get the formula from the British Government, as it was a secret formula. He promised, however, that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackay</inline> came from America he would bring the American formula with him, and that it would be given to our manufacturers here. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackay</inline> returned it was found that the American formula was useless ; as a . matter of fact, there are millions of shells in the United States and Canada to-day that were never sent across the seas because of their inferior quality of the steel. Then they applied again to the British Government, and could not get the information, because the firms which have the secret formula were manufacturing steel, and would not give it up to the Government. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)'</inline> told me so himself, and I made the statement publicly in this House, abd from dozens of platforms, but the Minister for Defence followed me to Maryborough, and he was asked if it was true.. He would not answer the question, and they would not let him go on until he had answered it. He came to Melbourne next day, and slipped a summons on me to appear at the Maryborough Court, while he went away to Western Australia. He was my witness, and he cleared out to another State, after summoning me to appear in Court. That is not a fair way to treat any man. I assure honorable members opposite that I abhor their politics, but I would not try to gaol one of them inno,cently ; and I think I ought to get the same treatment from my political opponents as I would concede to them. I would hound every one of them out of politi.cs to-morrow, and they would do the same to me. Of course, we all expect that, but I would not injure one of them . personally. If any man can come down so low as to try to injure another person by inflicting upon h'im a punishment when he knows that that person is innocent, the latter should get an opportunity from this House and Parliament- to prove his innocence. </para>

                                <para>- I was charged under the War Precautions Act with making a false statement. I could prove that it was not a fake statement if I could get the papers, but the Government will not give them up. The war is over, so what effect can the papers have on it now? I am not asking for the secret formula., but for the papers which show that the formula was refused. </para>

                                <para>- The Government will give no reasons. They simply say, "It is not considered advisable to lay these papers, on the table of the Library." These papers contain the evidence of my innocence. I suppose the magistrate who tried me, like all these men, looked upon me as a convict the moment I came into Court. In the ordinary parlance of the boy in the street, the moment I saw him, I felt I was a "gonner," and so I was until I got into the witness-box, and gave my evidence on oath. I know he believed me, but he would not say I was innocent by dismissing the case. He found that I had made a false statement, but he dismissed the case on the ground that I had very good reasons for believing that the statement was correct. Now that the war is over, I want the opportunity to prove that I was innocent. Why do the Government persist in refusing the papers ? The Government are getting too fond of gaoling their political opponents, and deporting those who disagree with them. I am not the only one the Government have tried to gaol, and afterwards refused the opportunity, which ought to be obtainable from' the Department, to prove his innocence. </para>

                                <para>- Still he is a Minister of the Crown, and as such is respected by many people. Nothing could be more Hunnish than for a Minister to endeavour to gaol a man for spite, and for the Government then to refuse him the right to prove his innocence. This Government will have to be careful. I have told them on several occasions that they are too fond of gaoling men. They think the way to stop political opposition is to imprison or deport their opponents. They had better stop it. It amounts to political corruption to down your political opponents by any means, fair or foul. </para>

If honorable members opposite went down to Melbourne Ports and talked there, they could not do Democracy any harm, and we would not gaol them. A man writes an article in condemnation of the present economic system, and the Government say, ' ' If this man goes on writing much longer like this he will convince some people. We will suppress his writings by bringing in an Act to make it criminal for him to write in this strain, and if he persists we will gaol him." A section of the community said they were going to fly the red flag. The Government issued an order that it was not to be flown, and began arresting people for flying it. It did no good, and had no more effect on the community than the flying of the red flag would have had if it had been allowed. The Government knew this, but they were vengeful and spiteful: It was the same feeling that caused me to be summoned at Maryborough in an endeavour to gaol me. I intend to go to Maryborough, and in the same place make the same statement again, and show the people of Maryborough that the Government will not let me have the evidence. We will see then if they will arrest me again. I shall take the chance. </para>

The great bulk of them have nothing to do with sea callings, and have been thrown out of employment because of the stopping of industries. Some of them may have taunted the Government. It may be merely chaff; but the pitiable part of it is that 99 per cent. of those who are suffering to-day have nothing to do with the seamen's strike. </para>

                                <para>- Possibly he did, but Ministers were only too willing to do it. That is my objection to the Government. The arch-fiend who started it was the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> but Ministers seem to be following in his footsteps with a very strong desire to gaol men on the slightest evidence. I hope that all this will be discontinued. People ought to be able to express themselves without the fear of gaol. They ought to be permitted to fly the red flag and tell the truth, as I did, without fear of prosecution. </para>

                            <para>. -  I wish to indorse the remarks of the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archibald)</inline> in- reference to the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry,</inline> of the Customs Department. That gentleman feels that he has a good claim against the Department in that he has not been paid the salary which was due to the position he held at Broken Hill for a number of years, and because, as a result of the Department moving him about from place to place, he suffered a loss of about £900 on the sale of his property and furniture. I am not concerned as to the amount of his loss ; I am concerned in his case because I happen to know that he is not a man who would bring forward a bogus claim. He has too good a sense of what is equitable, just, and businesslike to put forward a claim which has no foundation. The Public Service Commissioner and the Customs Department seem to have arrived at a deadlock about the matter. For the honour of Parliament we ought to have a more satisfactory answer than has yet been vouchsafed. </para>

The merits of officers' claims do not often reach the Minister's eye, and I am under the impression that this is one of those cases. The only reply we can get is that the Trade and Customs Department is of opinion that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry</inline> has suffered no injustice. That is no answer. Surely the Department can say something more. If some satisfaction is not given to this public servant, his case will have to be brought forward in a more forcible way. I shall back up the honorable member for Hindmarsh in any step he takes to see that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry</inline> gets justice. </para>

                                <para>- If the honorable member would remember, he would see that I suggested that, even if 'the Commonwealth had the constitutional power to do so, which I doubted, it should not attempt to force its inspectors on the States, but should approach them and seek to have the inspection machinery transferred to the Commonwealth. If that were done even now, it would ease a lot of misgiving which exists in the 'minds of the producers. They seem to think that they are not getting proper treatment when their produce is passing from one State to another. If their goods are rejected at the New South Wales border, they naturally imagine that the State of New South Wales is not giving them a fair deal bv rejecting their produce in order to preserve the local market for local growers. Of course there may be no foundation for that belief, but if the work of inspecting produce passing from one State to another is a Federal matter, that ground for suspicion is at once removed.I do not think anything has been done in this direction. If my memory serves me right, three years ago, the honorable member -for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> who was then Minister for Trade and Customs, informed me that, while the war was in progress, the Government did not intend to do anything to carry out the proposition which Parliament had indorsed. I am led to the conclusion that the Government at that time, and also the Government now in office, have not tried very hard to bring about this very desirable change. </para>

                        <para>Persons who are in receipt df the old-age pension are not permitted to augment the pension by earning more than 10s. a week, and with the present high cost of living, they find it very hard to exist. It would not be unfair to the community at large, or to other pensioners who are unable to augment their pensions, if those persons who are able to do so were permitted to earn more than the 10s. a week the regulations now permit them to earn. In fact, it would be in the public interest. I hope the Government will look into this question, and see if they cannot do something to meet many of these cases. I do not think that it will require great ingenuity on their part to tackle the matter and frame the necessary legislation. </para>
                        <para>During the course of this session we have heard a great deal about the high cost of living, and I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to refer to the subject. I have not been able to speak upon it before. The debate in which it has arisen has proceeded long enough to justify its being brought to a close, .but I have listened with a great deal of interest to the various speeches that have been made. I am afraid that many honorable members who have addressed the House upon the subject have spoken to it with very little point. It has been their practice to call attention to the high cost of living, and then break off, and accuse honorable members on the Ministerial side of not having done anything or of being unwilling to do anything to bring about a remedy. That is low-down politics. For instance, I object to the remarks made by the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> to-day, in which he accused honorable members on this side of the Chamber of being callous and indifferent to the sufferings of the people who are affected by the high cost of living. The attempt to relieve the present state of affairs is not a task attaching to one side more than the other, and it is useless to utter a tirade against Trusts and Combines or single traders unless an attempt is made to suggest a remedy. Honorable members opposite rely om the old stock remedy of the Labour party, and that is to nationalize everything. I do not object to the nationalization of certain things if the circumstances are favorable to it; but it is crude politics to say that the way to overcome the high price of commodities is to nationalize everything. The man who talks in that way cannot have studied the history of such: matters, and quite misses the mark. The last state of any country adopting a wholesale scheme of nationalization would be much worse than the present. However, there is no doubt that something must be done to remedy the existing state of affairs, and I agree with the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> that the regulation of profits would be a step in the right direction. I believe that the Prices Commission, if given the opportunity, could do something effective on those lines. I have come to the conclusion, from my attendance -at the Commission, that the Commissioners were beginning to realize that the fixation of prices was not of much use, but that something might be done in the direction of Regulating profits. </para>

                                <para>- I do not know. The Government claim that it is useless to accuse them of not attempting to meet the present conditions. They say that they have not constitutional power to do so. At the same time, until Peace is ratified, they have certain powers under the War Precautions Act, and they could have done a little in this direction if only for the purpose of giving the States a start. Most of the States are passing legislation in regard to the fixing of prices, but that is a very crude remedy. It means that the Prices Commission must always have its finger on the pulse of the trading community in order to see that the price fixed is a fair one. If a number of traders approach the Commission, and point out that they cannot sell their newly-purchased goods at the price previously fixed, they are allowed to charge a higher price. Then, of course, the public become dissatisfied, and there is a demand for . an increase in  wages. And so the thing goes on. The consumer is bled a little more with every turn of the wheel. </para>

                        <para>It is time the Federal Government tried to make an agreement with the States in regard to this matter, and that some body representative of all sections of political opinion was appointed to suggest some alteration of the Constitution to meet the circumstances of the case, so that the States might do their duty and the Commonwealth might supplement the action of the States in any way that was found necessary. As one who took a great interest in the past referenda, I believe that a procedure of that kind would be far quicker and more effective than the taking of another referendum. When a series of proposed amendments of the Constitution is submitted to the people, by referendum, the changes are so revolutionary that the people will not accept them. In the past we have asked the people for constitutional powers in excess of what were immediately necessary. Naturally, the people became frightened, and the State Parliaments opposed the transfer of those powers to the Commonwealth. </para>

A referendum should always be treated as a non-party matter, and it was only on the occasion of the second referendum that the Labour party introduced party feeling. If the partisan passions of the people are aroused, how can we get from them aalm, judicial pronouncement upon the issue at stake? </para>

                        <para>It would be better in the public interest if honorable members, instead of trying to make political capital out of the high cost of living, were to tell the people that high prices have ruled before, and that the present inflation is not likely to remain indefinitely. The records show that over many years prices have risen and fallen; that will occur again. I do not argue on that ground that nothing should be done to reduce the cost of living, because I foresee that some time must elapse before prices come down to normal. I urge the Federal Government to invite the States to a convention, to. discuss what alterations in the Constitution are really required. Then, if the States are satisfied, they can concede to the Commonwealth the necessary powers, thus avoiding the trouble, expense, and delay of a referendum. That would be the cheapest and most amicable way of settling the difficulty. The platform of the National Federation contains a plank for the amendment of the Constitution in that way. </para>

                        <para>In regard to the ups and downs of prices, honorable members will find by consulting the records that during the first half of the last century there was a fall of about 60 per cent, in prices. Between 1850 and 1875, prices recovered about 30 per cent. From 1873 to 1896, there was another fall of 40 per cent. ; and from 1896 to 1914 they rose approximately 35 per cent., and there has been a gradual rise ever since. It would be well if honorable members- would explain to the people a few of the causes of advancing prices. The increases are not all attributable to one cause. One of the chief factors at the present time is the inflation of the currency. The rise in wages has probably very little to do with the cost of production. There are American factories, the employees of which receive the best wages paid for that class of work in any part of the world; but owing to efficient management, and the large scope of the business, the unit of production cost is less than in Japanese factories, in which the workers are paid about 2s. Gd. per week. That shows that increased wages are only a small factor in the cost of production. My idea is that a' convention might result in a. reasonable alteration of the Constitution,, which would give the Commonwealth, all requisite powers to deal with trade and commerce without necessarily opening wide the doors for the use of other powers that this Parliament does not require at the present time. </para>

If we can get the necessary constitutional alterations, we can make a close and effective scrutiny of the affairs - of business men. If the profiteer is to be treated as a criminal, it will not matter how far we probe into his business affairs to discover whether or not he is fleecing the people. I should make as thorough as possible the examination of ' his business operations, and would give the Commonwealth power to investigate - his affairs at any time. If a man were found to be profiteering, he should receive drastic treatment. </para>

                                <para>- If a retailer had. his goods marked up at certain prices today and a month later had increased those prices to an, inordinate degree, although he had not incurred any additional outlay in respect pf them, I should certainly say that he was profiteering and should be dealt with accordingly. By limiting profits we would not curb legitimate trade to the extent that we should:  do by fixing prices. If  a  man has to pay more for his goods be will not supply the public unless be can obtain an enhanced price for them. </para>

                                <para>- It is largely responsible for high prices, while another contributing cause is the scarcity of commodities. The drought is serious enough at the present time, but if it develops I do not know what will be the price of fat stock. I believe it is possible to obtain store sheep in the Riverina for practically nothing, and if the drought continues, it is impossible to say what will be the. price of fat meat. It is idle to say that prices will not go up if the demand is large and the supply is short. </para>

                                <para>- Undoubtedly we do. Although Trusts and other like bodies may for a time confer such benefits on the community, the day inevitably arrives when many of them become so strong that they can actually control the raw products used by them as well as the price of the manufactured article to the consumer. When they reach that monopolistic stage they become an actual danger to the  community. Corporations have "neither souls to be damned nor Bodies to be kicked." and, like the tiger, when they taste blood, in the shape of high dividends, they want more of it. Their position is often so strong that they can keep up prices. We should be able, however, to control such organizations by the taxation or regulation of profits. " There are various means of control that have not yet been attempted in this country, but which are far more reasonable from a business standpoint than are many of the proposals for dealing with Trusts that have been made by honorable members opposite. A convention representing all sections of thought in Australia should be able to arrive at a satisfactory decision as to an amendment of the Constitution designed to meet our wants. </para>

                                <para>- It is never too late to mend. I am not so foolish as to believe that we shall find a panacea for every ill. But for a long time not only political economists, but all the great captains of industry - the enlightened thought of the world - have favoured cooperation, profit-sharing, and copartnery. The more enlightened of our captains of industry who do not look at business as a mere matter of £ s. d. ; who do not want to keep their employees in a rut, but are anxious to improve their position, believe in these principles. They have come to the conclusion that, where practicable, they ought to be applied. Such remedies follow natural lines. After all, they constitute an appeal to human selfishness, and enlightened selfishness is the mainspring of most economic action. There is such a thing as enlightened selfishness as well as mean and sordid selfishness, just as we can have lofty as well as petty ambitions, a lust for power, or any other  sui  al blesses of mind. Seeing that profit-sharing and co-partnery give a man some incentive to do his best, I think it is along those lines that some measure of success is likely to be secure'd in the alleviation of industrial trouble. This policy is being tried so widely, and with such success, that it only requires a few more instances of its adoption for it to gather great strength. If we can convert many of our employees from mere workers into partners- </para>

                                <para>- I know that my friends on the other side are always suspicious if one offers them anything. They seem to think that all who approach them are trying to inveigle them into some trap. It is true that co-partnership would not be a very good thing for those men who form the executive of unions, and do the agitating in industrial circles. But it would promote the interests of the country and of both employers and employed, while at the same time stimulating production. It would give the worker who attended to his own affairs something like a decent recompense, because the bigger the profits the more money he would have to handle at the end of the year. He would not only get his minimum wage, but a share of the profits, and if he cared to go in for the best form of co-partnership, and accept shares, there is no reason why in time he should not become a director. It would do what our friends opposite are crying out for - give the worker a fair share of the product of his labour. Unfortunately the Labour people claim that the worker shall have all the product, while the capitalist - the man of brains and the inventor - is given nothing. What rot it is to claim that only manual labour should be considered ! A man like Edison sees an opportunity that may be turned to profit, and- erects a factory in which he employs thousands of men. He may harness  ai  waterfall, and fill a great public want, and in the process make, perhaps, £100,000. In the course of years, however, he pays millions of pounds in wages; but in the present day he would be called a profiteer, and regarded as an enemy of society. It is all nonsense to say that the whole product of Labour belongs to the worker. It only means that fca© worker desires to be put in- the privileged position of a monopolist. On the other hand, if the management and the workers pull together, and regard the whole concern, not as the property of the capitalist, but of the people engaged, there is some chance of giving to the worker that fair share of the profit he is entitled to. If the worker at the end of the year be given a portion of the profits or shares in the business, there will be no need to raise prices because wages have gone up. The fund, which pays all concerned is, after all, what a business earns, and it would not be necessary to raise prices because the workers drew a minimum wage, plus a bonus, or so many shares. This is the' sort of scheme that will do away with much of the bitterness that at present exists, and much of which is due to ai want of knowledge by one class or the other. </para>

                        </continue><para>Hitherto some of these attempts, after an agreement has been arrived at, have miscarried, very often owing to the fact that employers have tried to take away surreptitiously what they profess to give. That difficulty could be easily got over, for there is no reason why every such agreement should not be registered, and approved by some public official. All that is required is the elimination of the mere political element and class bitterness in order to achieve tangible and beneficial results. This is a big subject with many phases, and I hope on another occasion to deal with it more thoroughly in detail. At present, I merely ask the Government to keep in mind the points I have placed before them. </para></speech>

                            <para>.- 1 offer no apology for taking a little time, even at this hour, to discuss the question of prices. The honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Atkinson)</inline> has chastised members on this side for constantly complaining about the high cost of living, and offering no remedy. So far as that is concerned, the Inter-State Commission was appointed, I believe, by a Labour Government, to inquire into the high cost of living, and it ha6 brought forward many reports which all go to show that in this country there are combinations in relation to almost every line of goods. Competition and the law of supply and demand, of which we formerly heard so much, have entirely disappeared. There is no such thing as competition to-day. The price of every commodity is arranged and fixed, and every hand through which a commodity passes claims a share of the profit. As a consequence, the cost of living has been increasing by leaps and bounds. During the war .people made very little complaint, because they were under the impression that this was part of the price we had to pay to secure victory. But it is many months since the Armistice was signed, and the people naturally expect the cost of living to fall. To-day, however, if we take the commo&gt;dities selected by the statisticians, not including clothing and other things, we find that  the increase in prices represents between 50 and 60 per cent., as against an increase of something, like 25 per cent, in wages. This means that the purchasing power of the people is reduced by at least 25 per cent., and that the sovereign to-day is not worth more than 15s. The conditions have been borne with patience. Working people have denied themselves many things during the last three or four years. Families have gone short qf clothing, and, generally, have not lived at the same standard as formerly. Those who were in a position to save prior to the war have had their savings eaten away, and those who lived from hand to mouth have simply had to deny themselves. All this tends to degeneracy so far as the race is concerned, and it is not in the interests of the country that such a state of things should be permitted one hour longer than can be avoided. If we have not the power now to fix prices, we had the power during the war; and in many directions we have never attempted to regulate them. Increases have been permitted without any restraint whatever, except, as I say, in a small way in some directions. We are now told that under the Constitution we can no longer deal even with these. I warn the Government that they cannot hoodwink the people all the time. If, when we had the power during the war, we did not regulate prices, what is the use of telling the people that we have not the power now ? No matter what party is in power, it is the duty of Parliament to protect the people from the plundering that is going on. The honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Atkinson)</inline> said that those who were guilty of this plundering should be treated as criminals, but nothing is being done to find out the guilty persons. We have introduced legislation interfering with the liberty of the subject in certain directions, but we have left those profiteering people to go scot-free. </para>

                        <para>The honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Atkinson)</inline> suggested that we should ask the States for certain powers, but we must not forget that we did do that after the second referendum, and the States agreed. The trouble is, however, that when put to the test the States did not keep faith with us. We must face the situation. We cannot leave it any longer. We must, as a Government or as a Parliament, take the matter into immediate consideration. It will not brook further delay. We ought to inform the State Governments of the position, and ask them if they are going to exercise these powers and deal with the profiteers at once. I do not approve of the appointment of committees and commissions. It is only killing time and intensifying the evil. We have sufficient evidence already from the Inter-State Commission to warrant the State or Federal Governments taking action. If we cannot do so, let us ask the States to give us the power to act on behalf of the whole of the people. After all, no one can expect six different State Governments to operate six different laws in regard to the cost of living. It must be controlled by one Parliament, and that the Federal. We should ask the States to give us the powers. If they will not, let us go to the people at once and ask them to amend the Constitution, and arm us with authority to act. If we go to them as a united party they will do what we want. It is no good going, as we did before, as a divided Parliament. The honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Sampson),</inline> who now advocates an amendment of the Constitution, opposed the proposals when they were before the people previously. Let us point out to the people that the powers are necessary; get those powers, and with the reports of the Inter-State Commission before us, deal with the profiteering evil at once. That is the solution of the difficulty; but talking is of no use. </para>
                        <para>There are one or two things that we have the power to deal with in some way without an amendment of the Constitution. -Take the question of the price of boots. I have in my possession a letter from a business man, who has been informed that the ordinary boots that the average working man wears, which he purchased wholesale for 13s. Id. in June last, are now 21s., and that it is further contemplated that another rise will take place within the next couple of weeks. Where are they going to ? The manufacturers put that increase down to the high price of hides. When I asked a question yesterday about the price of hides, the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming)</inline> said that the grazier  was getting only 30s. for the hide.' </para>

                                <para>- We have produced abundance of the staple commodities, and have exported considerably, but the fact remains that over 1,000,000 carcasses of sheep and lambs remain in cold storage. Ever since we perfected cold storage, the prices of tilings have. Been going up. We have been able to store the surplus, and the people have had to pay more. This matter is of immense importance to me, because I can see the effect it has on the working people outside. They cannot bear the strain. It is useless to say that the Commonwealth Parliament has no power to give them relief. This is the institution which is expected to control things in their interests, and if we are recreant to our duty, and do nothing to obtain the power we should have, the great mass of the people outside will take some action on their own account. Week after week we get no further ahead, and prices still soar. The price of rabbits, which are a pest in this country, and which we seek to exterminate, has suddenly advanced to such a figure that the cost of skins is likely to close the hat-making industry in which nearly 600 people are employed. </para>

                                <para>- Then the rabbit-trappers are very fortunate men; but that fact does not justify increasing prices to such a height that there is danger that an industry employing 600 men will have to cease operations. This is a matter of vital importance. People look to this Parliament to protect them and prevent them from being robbed. Evidence accumulates showing that in every commodity there are Rings, Combines, and Monopolies regulating prices to the detriment of the community, and the sooner we awake to the fact, and deal with the question in the proper way, so much the. better it will be for this Parliament. If we do not, there will be a discontent in the country which will lead to something worse. </para>
