                        <para>- The latest cable messages to hand from the Imperial Government lead us to believe that, as a result of representations by the Commonwealth and State Governments, a very large increase has been made in the allotment of refrigerated tonnage originally contemplated by the Imperial Government. I am unable at present to say exactly what that allotment of space is, but I feel sure that it will be sufficient to, at all events, remove the acute position that would otherwise have arisen. </para>

It is at present receiving the earnest consideration of the Government, but until a further conference takes place between the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and those of his colleagues, who have gone into the question, it is impossible to arrive at a decision.

                        <para> - In answer to a similar question, I intimated some little time ago that already there were being erected in Australia works which should be capable of drawing all the wire necessary for the purpose, and that it would then be a comparatively simple matter to galvanize the wire and weave it into netting. Since then, I understand, further negotiations have taken place, and it is proposed very shortly to erect, in addition to the works now carrying on the industry in Australia, a very large manufacturing establishment which, I think, will be able within a reasonably short time to provide all the wire netting that will be required in Australia. The price, I believe, will, be a reasonable one. It will be, at all events, very much less than those now ruling. </para>

Having made that general statement, I would like to say to my friend that the constant agitation in the House for the release of these men does not help matters at all, and I suggest, in the interests of the men themselves, as well as in the interests of the maintenance of discipline in the Navy, that honorable members should allow this matter to rest, with the assurance </para>

                            <para>- Order ! I have several times called for order. If the practice of continually interrupting Ministers when replying to questions asked without notice is persisted in, the opportunity for asking such questions will need to be restricted very considerably. Questions without notice are not usual in the House of Commons, except on matters of urgency, I understand, and our Standing Orders make no &#34; special provision for them, except that, when notices of motion are called on, questions may be asked relating to public affairs; but these should be of immediate importance. A ruling has been given by a distinguished Speaker of the House of Commons, that questions, if they are important, should always be placed on the business-paper. If they are not important, they should not be asked. In any case, when a Minister is requested to reply to a question he should have extended to him the courtesy of being heard without disorderly interruption. </para>

While in New South Wales recently, I was told that this Victorian Parliament was keeping back the payment of advances to New South Wales farmers. Will the Minister assure us that that is not so, and will he inform honorable members when the last payment of about 2 l/16d. per bushel is to be paid? </para>

So far as I am able to understand, the matter has not yet been considered by the House Committee, but I wish to enter my emphatic protest against a circular letter which has been sent by the Secretary of the House Committee to the members of the staff, in the following terms :  -

                <para>That letter was a gratuitous insult, not only to the honorable member for Fremantle and myself, but also to the members of the House staff who signed the. petition. Thewages being received now by the members of the House staff are no credit to this House. Other Parliaments have increased the wages of their staffs, and we should, at any rate, set a good example, and not be put in an inferior position. To tell the members of the staff that they are acting improperly because they choose to represent their case to members of the House is not only unfair and unreasonable, but insulting. Those officers are accused of using political influence, when, as a matter of fact, an honorable member from each side of the House was present at the interview with the  Speaker.  It was a mere effort to get for those men some reasonable consideration in regard to their remuneration. The  Speaker  met us with every courtesy; he was most considerate, and made every effort to explain the position of affairs. For that I express to him my gratitude; but the fact remains that these men are not having their complaints redressed. They are being kept at a low rate of wages, which is no credit to the House or to Parliament as a whole. I again urge the  Speaker  to give some reasonable consideration to this case. The men are deserving of generous treatment,, and it is not fair to hold against them any suggestion that in approaching honorable members they acted improperly and should be penalized. </para>

We thought that we had advanced beyond that state of affairs. Unfortunately, the view put forward by the Secretary of the House Committee was somewhat strengthened by the clear and unequivocal statement of the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> this morning, that no representations made on behalf of the boys on the <inline font-style="italic">Australia,</inline> who are suffering punishment on account of the trouble at Fremantle, will alter the attitude of the Department by a single hair&#39;s breadth. The adoption of that attitude towards employees cannot be tolerated. It is a survival of the old idea in regard to the method of approaching employers that, in a democratic community, is at variance with the general mind of the population. </para>

                    that the munition workers notified the inspection committee that everything possible had. been done to make them comfortable, and they did not expect any further discontent would arise. Further discontent did arise, and 1 ask that when that vessel reaches Australia immediate inquiries shall be made as to the reasons for the faulty conditions. The Australian public has had enough of this sort of thing. In the early days of the return of our soldiers from the Front one of the most painful experiences of honorable members was to listen to the complaints of soldiers regarding the bad accommodation on the transports. I am sure it- is not the desire of the Government that these conditions should exist, but somebody is responsible for them, and an effort should be made to sheet the responsibility home to the right quarter. The sole purpose of my question yesterday, and . of these remarks to-day, is to ask that before the men who are returning by the

                    are dispersed in Australia an inquiry of such a far-reaching character shall be made as will enable the blame to be placed on the officer responsible, so that he may be suitably punished. After all our soldiers have done overseas, of which honorable members on both sides express grateful appreciation, surely the least we can do is to guarantee them a reasonable and comfortable passage back to Australia !

                        <para>- That is so. It is but another illustration of the degeneracy of parliamentary institutions. Thing, have come to such a pass in this Parliament that honorable members may talk and talk, and be&#39; told that that is what they are paid for. The honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lister)</inline> rightly said the other day that there was far too much talk. The reason is that Ministers are so busy attending to departmental affairs outside the House that they have no time to attend to affairs in the House, and honorable members have to talk on the same subject over and over again until they manage -to get for a fleeting moment the attention of the Minister concerned. This House is the place in which questions should be. discussed, but in the absence of Ministers discussion seems futile. </para>

                <para>Almost since the commencement of the war I have been corresponding with the Defence Department in regard to the Instructional Staff. This was because of the embargo placed on the enlistment of those men, many of whom had seen years of active service, and were possessed of eminent qualifications. But for departmental reasons, to some extent, possibly, justifiable, these men were detained .here to train new recruits of no previous experience. In consequence these members of the Instructional Staff were penalized. Because of their not being allowed to go to the war they lost all chance of promotion and advancement. Further, they were retained at a salary not at all commensurate with their work, or with the salaries of the men they were training. However, as a result of my persistent . correspondence - at least I hope it had some little effect - an alteration was made in regard to conditions and emoluments. I wish honorable &#34;members to notice how absolutely farcical the whole thing has been. Now that the war is over, we have again to depend on the Instructional Staff to. play a most important part in our Defence system, in the way of training our future soldiers, and maintaining the reliability and efficiency of the Forces. These men, I submit, deserve much better consideration than they are receiving. </para>
                <para>For instance, a recently issued regulation provides that for warrant officers, Class I., the pay shall be &#163;255 instead of &#163;254, the old rate. In other cases, the salary has been raised from &#163;244 to &#163;245 - an increase of &#163;1 per year. Where the wage is &#163;234, it has not yet been decided whether it shall be &#163;230 or &#163;245. In other cases, again, the salary has been raised from &#163;222 to &#163;230, and from &#163;210 to &#163;230. In Class II., the wage has been raised from &#163;204 to &#163;210, from &#163;192 to &#163;200, from &#163;180 to &#163;200, and Acting Staff-Sergeant-Majors remain at &#163;156. There was an allowance of 9d. per day during the war, but that has now ceased; and while </para>
                <para>Borne  have benefited to the extent of &#163;20, others have only had an increase of &#163;1 per annum. Obviously this is farcical; the increases are no recognition of either the work of the men or of the facts of the &#39; case as they are to-day. Honorable members are sufficiently  aware  of the position of affairs economically in this country to know that men engaged in active work, who are expected to maintain a decent position, and to provide a home for a wife and family on &#163;156 to &#163;200 per annum, are being asked to accomplish an almost impossible task. </para>

                        <para>- No. Another objectionable feature is that no allowance is made for length of service. A new man may join, and, under the regulations, may in twelve months be enjoying the same rates of pay as a man who has been for seven years on the job. I have here a letter from a personal friend of my own iri Brisbane, who has been on the staff for that length of time. This man will not get an increase until April, 1921, and yet a man who joined this year may be paid the same rates, and enjoy the same status. This is no encouragement to men . who have spent years in making themselves efficient as warrant officers. Further, on the Instructional Staff at the present time there are a number of men who have seen active service abroad, and have very fine records of military experience. These men are naturally eminently qualified to fill positions on the Instructional Staff, and yet the regulation to which I have referred is the latest governing the matter.- I say, without hesitation, that the position of the staff is not worthy of the Department, and, if the facts were well known to honorable members, not commendable to Parliament. </para>

                <para>I wish now to refer to another matter that has had my attention for about four years. In regard to this I have bean quite unable, through correspondence and interviews with. Ministers, to accomplish anything, and now I am compelled to bring the matter before the House. Some time ago, it was announced that the 1914 decoration, known as the Gallipoli Star, was to be presented to members of the Forces who took , Dart in the Gallipoli campaign. So far so good ; not  a. word other than by way of commendation of such a proposal could be said. But, after some effort and agitation, it was decided that representations should be made to the Imperial authorities to include in the 1914 decoration men who were also engaged in the campaign of which Gallipoli was a particular incident, but only one incident. It was finally agreed by the Imperial authorities that the 1914 decoration should apply to a. large number of men who were engaged in various theatres of the war. According to the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of 10th January, 1919, these various, theatres of war were to include the Western European, the Balkan, the Gallipoli, the Egyptian, the Asiatic, and the Australasian. It is in connexion with the last mentioned that I wish to say a word or two. In 1914, there sailed from Australia what was known as the 3rd Battalion, Naval and Military Expeditionary Force, under General Pethebridge. These men were enlisted for service, and were sent to take charge of the Marshalls, the Carolines, the Ladrones, and other islands. As honorable members are aware, however, when this Force reached the islands they found that the Japanese had preceded them by five days, and were in possession. The Australian Force was then sent to Rabaul, and were invited, to volunteer for service in Egypt. Every man volunteered, but that order was countermanded, and the Force was sent to finish up the work in German New Guinea. For quite a considerable period this Force was occupied in this effective and useful work, for which they received considerable encomiums - useful work in the way of solidifying our occupancy. But honorable members will be surprised to learn that, although every other Force, and every other arm of the service engaged in the Pacific, received the 1914 decoration, this particular Force has been repeatedly denied any consideration. The officers in charge were mentioned for meritorious services, but so far as the men themselves, and the Force as a whole, are concerned, every effort to secure the same recognition as was paid to others, engaged in similar work elsewhere has been refused. The matter has gone so far that the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has been asked to recommend to the Imperial authorities that this Force shall receive the recognition which is their due. But the Minister refuses even to submit the matter to the Imperial authorities. Honorable &#39;members are well aware that the granting of these decorations is not a matter for Australian decision. The decision lies in the hands of the Imperial authorities. It seems to me that the case which could be put forward on behalf of the Force which acted under the late  Colonel- Pethebridge  is at least worthy of being presented to those authorities, with a view to affording them an opportunity of deciding whether the men composing it should receive this particular decoration. The argument advanced against the recognition of the Force is that it was not engaged in the theatre of war, because, after General Holmes had signed the armistice with the then Governor of German New Guinea, it i&#187; urged, the war there was over. Yet this Force was engaged for months in digging out nests of Germans, and of natives who had been armed by the Germans for the defence of this particular territory. I again  express the hope that either the Minister for the Navy or the Minister for Defence - because it was a combined Naval and Military Expeditionary Force which operated in German New Guinea - will submit this matter for the consideration of the Imperial authorities.  It is &#39; not  a&#39;  fair thing that these men should be excluded from participating in this decoration. I do not complain of those who have already received it, but why a discrimination should be made against the Force to which I refer is beyond my comprehension. </para>
                <para>I wish now to refer to a number of men who seem to be deserving of special consideration. The matter was brought under my notice by the Queensland Teachers Union, and it relates to the men who, before the war, were engaged in the particularly interesting and valuable work of training the youth of Australia. Large numbers of them enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force, and rendered very excellent service during the war. A number of these teachers, in common with the members of other professions, have come back to Australia suffering from wounds, from injuries to their eyes, and from shell-shock. One has merely to mention these facts, and to recollect the work  at  which they have to earn their livelihood, in order to realize how heavily they are handicapped by these disabilities. The statement presented to me by the Queensland Teachers Union is set out in&#39; a couple of paragraphs, the first of which  reads : - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>We refer especially to members of our union who, through injury to their eyesight - not involving blindness - to their nervous systems, or to other disabilities, sire forbidden by the medical authorities to devote themselves to study. These are chiefly young men who were at the commencement of promising careers as teachers, some of whom would, by passing the successive examinations required for promotion, eventually have risen to the top of their profession. They nobly risked this prospect in their country&#39;s cause. They have now returned, and are able to resume their work of actual teaching, but only in that grade to which they would have attained had they remained in the service of the Queensland Department of Public Instruction during the period of their absence at the war. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">In another paragraph they say: - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>We would respectfully suggest that, in cases in which the facts are medically established, your Government should supplement the departmental salaries of these young men by a pension sufficient to make up the difference between their actual salaries and the salaries attached to the successive grades to which they would probably have attained in the future, had they not received in the war those injuries to which we refer. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">The main trouble is that the doctors have forbidden a large number of these men to again take up their studies,  on  the ground that, owing  to  shell-shock and the injury  to  their nervous systems, they are unable to continue the hard studies which are necessary to equip them to discharge the duties of their profession - that is, if they are to become efficient and to secure that promotion which they naturally desire. So far, the Government have refused any special recognition to these men. Yet the latter are not asking anything, unreasonable. All that they ask is that for the time being the Government shall make up  to  them the difference between the salaries they are now receiving and the salaries which they would have been receiving&#39; had their studies not been interrupted. These men are doing a service of immense value to the future of </para>
                <para class="block">Australia, and one cannot but sympathize with them &#39;because of the disabilities under which they labour, owing to their experiences at the war.

                    <para>. - It is not often that I address honorable members from tile floor of this chamber, but a matter has been raised here this morning which seems to demand a reply from me. It has reference to the salaries which are being paid to the non-clerical members of the parliamentary staff. I am sorry that the subject has beer brought forward in this, way, because, at the very inception of the Commonwealth Parliament, owing to a general recognition of the evils which had been associated with the exercise of political influence in the Public Services of the States, steps were taken to prevent that evil&#39; from creeping into our Public Service. A Commissioner was appointed in order that our Public Service should be placed entirely outside the sphere of political patronage or influence. The same rule should, of course, and does, apply to the officers of this Parliament. The  Speaker  of the House of Representatives and the  President  of the Senate stand in the same relation to the employees of Parliament as the Public Service Commissioner stands in relation to the employees in the Public Service generally. When I was a private member, I know that from time to time different employees of the parliamentary establishment came to me with their grievances, and requested me to see <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> with a view to getting those grievances remedied. I always regarded the procedure as au objectionable one, because I held that the proper channel of communication between them and the  President  and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> was through the heads of their Departments. That is the procedure laid down by the Public Service regulation bearing  on this matter to-day, and it has, I understand, always been the procedure here since it was inaugurated by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Baker as Presiding Officers respectively of each House in the first Parliament. I have insisted upon the application of that regulation to parliamentary employees&#39; because, in my opinion, it would not be right to allow them to go over the heads of their own Departments, and to endeavour to see the Presiding Officer without first intimating their intention to the heads of those Departments, and without even informing them of the nature of the grievances of which they complained. This would be subversive of discipline and authority, and, moreover, the temporary Presiding Officers of Parliament could not in the nature of things be expected to have personal knowledge of the work and circumstances associated, therewith: of every individual employee of the establishment. Something was said, I think, about threats having been made of punitive action against the men who had  signed the letter. There is no justification in fact for that statement. .For the special bene-1 of the House I shall read a communication written in reply to a letter presented to me by two honorable members of this House, which simply points out the method of procedure. It is as follows : - </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>A letter addressed to the  President  and  Speaker,  signed by the non-clerical employees of both Houses of the Parliament, requesting increases of pay, was presented to me by two members of the House of Representatives. . The  President  and myself concur in the opinion that such a method of procedure, besides being a breach of regulations already laid down,- is highly improper, and we&#39; insist on observance &#60;5&#62;f the rule that any communications from employees of the establishment shall be made through the permanent head of the Department. The use of political influence iri any -form is strongly deprecated, and will&#34; not advance the cause of those having recourse to St. The Presiding Officers of the Parliament will give due consideration to representations when made through the proper channel, and these will be considered on their merits. i will be glad if you will inform the members 13f <inline font-style="italic">your</inline> staff of the views of the  President  and myself on the subject. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>I think honorable members will admit that that was a strictly correct attitude to adopt, and it is the attitude which Parliament adopted in regard to the whole of the Public Service. It was, moreover, the attitude which prompted the appointment of a Public Service Commissioner, in order to avoid this very kind of thing. </para>
                <para>So far as the employees of the establishment are concerned, personally, in view of the high cost of living, and long before anything was said by any one else to me on the subject, I felt that, perhaps, some increase might be made, or some recognition shown of the disabilities under which they are labouring. I had a conference, with the  President  of the Senate on the subject. I think it was in February or April - but it was before the Estimates were submitted. I discovered during my occupancy of the chair on a previous occasion that when I raised the salaries of a number of the lower-paid members of the establishment, in 1913, I invited a protest from another quarter. I found that whatever -was done in this&#39; branch of the Legislature touching matters of salary had a reflex action on the Senate staff. Why it should be so I do not know, because the work done on this side is, in my opinion, generally speaking, more arduous and strenuous than that performed on the Senate side. There are a great many more holidays in the Senate, the members of the staff there have a, smaller number of members to look after, and, generally speaking, the conditions on the whole are easier, while, on the whole, .they are not very badly done by  in either House. But so soon as the salaries of the staff employed in this Chamber were raised there was an immediate request for the salaries of those employed in the Senate to be raised similarly. </para>
                <para>I was not at the time aware that in the first Parliament the arrangement was arrived at between the officers of both Houses that no increase or alteration in salaries of employees of either House should be made without a consultation between the Presiding Officers, and a joint agreement being arrived at. In this case, I find there is not likely to be agreement in regard to a general increase, and I am hampered in carrying out what would be my own decision in this regard had I been free to act without reference to the effect of my decision upon the position of officers in another branch of the Legislature.  The difficulty is emphasized by the demand of the Treasurer that the Estimates must be reduced to the lowest possible limit. We have had our Estimates returned once or twice with a request that further reductions should he made, and it is rather unfortunate at a time when the country is overburdened with taxation, and the Treasurer is hard-pushed in the matter of finance, and requests are made to cut down expenses, that this time should be selected for making an application for increased salaries. At the same time, we have to realize that the cost of living has greatly increased of late, and I have naturally a very great feeling of sympathy, particularly with the lower-paid members of the staff. It is something to be thankful for that so far we have escaped the. necessity for reductions all round. </para>
                <para>With a view to arrive at a fair estimate of the position, I thought it desirable to see what was being paid for similar services in the State Parliament. Through the courtesy of the Clerks of the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly of Victoria I have been supplied with a statement of the salaries paid to the whole of their employees on the non-clerical staff. By comparison, I am bound to say that, although the amounts we pay are not by any means excessive, and perhaps inadequate, as I think some of them are in the present abnormal condition of prices, they are in nearly all, if not all, cases in excess of those paid in other Departments of the Public Service and those paid in the Parliament of Victoria for similar services. Moreover, there is a good deal more work expected from some of the employees in the State Parliainent. For instance, the work done by cleaners in this Parliament is done by doorkeepers in the State Parliament. They have neither cleaners nor charwomen on the State staff, and their remuneration is almost in all cases below the maximum and minimum rates paid in the Federal parliamentary service. I have not the time to quote all the rates from the comparative lists, although I have the information and reports before me. </para>
                <para>
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline>
                    and myself still have the matter under consideration. We have had several consultations concerning the matter, and it has not yet been finally determined. It is rather late, perhaps, to alter the Estimates ; this request should not have been made several weeks after the preparation of the Estimates. There must be same general approximation of the rates of remuneration paid for similar services throughout the whole Commonwealth service, otherwise we would have in our Parliament officers who were receiving a higher rate than men who were performing similar service, say, in the Prime Minister&#39;s Department. Our rates, whatever they may be, more than favorably compare with those paid in other Departments. I do not say our rates are high enough, but they are higher than those paid in other Departments, even taking into consideration the increases recently given in the State Public Service. It has been said, by interjection, that wages must be low in other Departments.  They are, in my judgment, in many cases too low. A general review of the whole position should, I think, be made, and I am not sure that it would not be good policy to place our parliamentary employees under the Public Service Commissioner.

                        <para>- I appreciate the point indicated by the honorable member. Perhaps, that is so. I realize that. As Public Service officers under the Commissioner they would be in touch with the association, and the Arbitration Court would be open to them. I am not sure that it is not open to them in any case. What I propose to do is to try to get over the difficulty in another way - and the  President,  I think, is agreeable to this course - by asking the Treasurer to place a sum upon the Estimates by way of a bonus, in the same manner as last year, only, perhaps, increasing the amount of bonus to a larger sum on this occasion. In that way, although the officers concerned will not be getting an increase in salary from month to month, they will receive a lump sum which will be equivalent to an increased rate of pay spread over the whole year. </para>

The honorable member, I think, was not present a few minutes ago when I stated that there must be some sort of general approximation with respect to the rates of pay throughout the whole of the Public Service - throughout all the various Departments. He may not have heard me remark, further, that in the Federal Parliament the rates paid do more than favorably compare with the rates of pay in other branches of the Commonwealth Public Service, or in the

On the contrary, I do not think they are; but I do not see how that can be remedied at present, except in the way I have just suggested. It is rather late to do anything at this stage, but something might be done by the Government to bring about a general revision of salaries paid to officers of the Commonwealth PublicService, in the lower grades particularly, if the present abnormal cost of living is maintained. I am not so much concerned with respect to the higher grades, because, in some cases, at any rate, I think that they are adequately paid; most are sufficiently paid. Some, I think, are not. I am more immediately concerned with the interests of those who receive salaries ranging from &#163;150 to about &#163;200 per annum. Those officers, the heads of families, must find the cost of living a very great and serious problem. I am fully in sympathy with them; but my own hands are to a large extent tied. I cannot do what I would desire, for reasons which I have already stated. I think I should state that some of the increases of salaries which have been enjoyed by the staff were granted during my previous occupancy of the Speakership. I increased the rates of remuneration, but I found myself unexpectedly in conflict with the situation regarding officers in the Senate. I did not consult with the  President,  as I had no knowledge of the arrangement in existence as between the Presiding Officers of both Houses, but because of the action which I had taken in raising salaries on this side, wages on that side were raised. That position is not satisfactory. The work of the officials upon this side is, of course, very much heavier than that of those employed in the Senate, and it does not appear to be altogether equitable that the rate of salary ruling in regard to the House of Representatives should be the same as that on the other side. To compensate, as far as possible, for disabilities in that respect, I have endeavoured to give to employees on this side as much time off as has been possible, whenever a reasonable opportunity has offered. It has been my endeavour to grant as many holidays as has been within my power. Apart from whether that has proved of any advantage, it does not, of course, get over the fact that the cost of living has greatly increased. To some extent, however, the &#39;added leave has provided recompense, I hope, in ether respects. </para>

I propose to make representations in the form which I have just indicated, and I need scarcely emphasize that my action will be taken quite apart from anything that may be said upon the floor of this Chamber. Indeed, as I said earlier, I considered the matter in consultation with the  President  of the Senate weeks before the meeting of the House. While I am prepared to listen, and to pay due heed to the views of honorable members, I am bound to assert that, quite irrespective of such expressions of opinion, whatever action I may see fit to take will be taken&#39; because I believe it to be right, and will not be in any sense due to any pressure which might be brought to bear upon me. If I do not believe a certain course of action to be proper I will not be persuaded to adopt that procedure. </para>

That, however, can only be done by recommending that an increase be granted in the form of a bonus ; that is, unless I can come to an arrangement with the Presiding Officer in the other Chamber, to adopt some other course. I have reason to think the  President  will be fully in agreement with me in regard to recommending a bonus of a rather more substantial nature than was granted last year. </para>

                    <para>.- The Committee appreciates ,the motive of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> in expressing himself as he has in regard to employees of this Parliament. I am personally able to state that they are a capable and obliging staff, and I feel strongly that some recognition should be given them in view of the increased cost of living. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has pointed out that it is scarcely possible now, in view of the fact that the Estimates were returned to the Treasury some months ago, to revise those Estimates; but he has indicated that a recommendation will be forwarded to the Treasurer that a lump sum be granted&#39; by way of  a  bonus. That is not very satisfactory, but, of course, it is far better than nothing at all. What was a fair salary four or five years ago is really inadequate for the support of a family to-day. I am glad that something is to be done to assist the members of the staff to cope with the increased cost of living. </para>

                <para>Honorable members are asked to agree to a Supply Bill covering a period of three months. I have raised my voice in Committee before, and shall .do so again, in protest against the delay, year  after year, in bringing the Budget before Parliament, and dealing with the Estimates. Honorable members were told, when the last Supply Bill was introduced, that it was the intention of the Government at a very early date in this financial year to <inline font-style="italic">place</inline> the position of the finances before Parliament. We are now well into the third month of the current financial period, and that promise has not been redeemed. We are asked to grant three months&#39; Supply, although we have not the slightest idea of the intentions of the Government with regard to the financial position, which, in my judgment, is appalling. It is admitted on all sides that the amount of taxation imposed upon the people has almost reached the limit, and yet our obligations are increasing, from week to week. Though the war is over, . certain obligations, such as the repatriation of our soldiers, war pensions, and housing schemes, arising out of the war, and involving the expenditure of millions of pounds, have to be provided for. It is possible, if rumour be true, that we may have an election before the financial position is disclosed to the people ; but I cannot bring myself to think that any Government would be so foolish as to commit suicide by appealing to the people before the finances of the country are properly adjusted. It is probable that the present may be considered a suitable time for this appeal; it is quite possible that the Government and their supporters believe they are on the rising tide of public favour, and that it would be just as well to go .to the people in the hope of being returned with power to carry on the government of the country for another three years; because if this appeal were delayed and the real position revealed to the people, the result, might  be different. How are we going to discharge our obligations? How is the load of taxation to be apportioned in the future? It is the clear duty of the Government to make all these things plain to the people, because it will be found that, if an appeal be made in the near future, there will be very searching inquiries into the true financial position of the Commonwealth. The people will want to know exactly how much money we owe, and how much wc are likely to owe within the next two or three years to discharge the heavy obligations, arising out of the war, to which I have already referred. Is it the intention of the Government to remove a great deal of the direct taxation which during the war was imposed upon the richer people of this country, and place heavier burdens on the masses of the people? What are the indications? The people who during the war did not raise much objection to direct taxation being imposed upon them are to-day holding meetings in different parts of the Commonwealth and agitating for relief. They are declaring that the direct taxation is too heavy to bear. We want to know exactly what the Government intend to do. So far as direct taxation is concerned, I believe we shall have to go further, and that we have not yet reached the limit of our possibilities. But we cannot place any additional burdens on the poorer people of the country. Those with the most wealth will have to bear the major portion of the war costs. It is very evident, from the statement made yesterday by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> that Australia will get very little, if anything, in the way of war indemnity or reparation, so apparently we shall have to bear the entire cost of the war ourselves. It is appalling that the Government should carry on the administration of the country month after month without taking Parliament and the people into their confidence. Never in the history of the Commonwealth was our financial position so unfortunate. It is just as well that I should place on record in <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard</inline> the Prime Minister&#39;s own words. In the course of his remarks yesterday he said - </para>

                <para class="block">What are we going to do to meet that debt? The Prime Minister has been talking, about increased production, and I say at once that the people of every country must produce more if they are to be in a flourishing position in the future. But while we are talking about production in Australia, it is unfortunately true that thousands, of men, who ought to be producing, are unemployed. What avenues of work are being opened u.p for them ?  I have heard it said that Australia is afflicted with the &#34; Go-slow &#34; policy, but I assert that in regard to production the Australian worker compares <inline font-style="italic">more</inline> than favorably with the worker in any other part of the world. </para>

                        <para>- Because we want to see successful&#39; factories established throughout the Commonwealth to absorb those thousands of unemployed to whom I have referred. This duty lies before the Government. The war has taught us that, in order to be secure, Australia must be a self-contained nation, and I am sur- . prised to know that there are one or two honorable members who, apparently, have not learned that lesson. We must provide for our own requirements, and we must encourage our industries by a protective Tariff. What are the Government doing in regard to this matter? The Tariff has been spoken of frequently, but I believe that after this three months&#39; Supply has been granted, we shall get the Estimates a little later, as well as the Bills for the amendment of the Constitution, and the Government will go to the country without doing anything in the way of Tariff reform. The Government, as I have said, believe that they are on the rising tide of public favour ; but mistakes have been made in the past, and they may be made again. It is folly on the part of the Government to rush to the country before they place their own house in order. There is plenty of work for this Parliament to do before we go before the people. Personally, I arn not much concerned at the prospect of an appeal, but I feel that we have a duty to discharge before we go again before the electors. We have a right to protect our people. Up to the present this has not been done. Three weeks ago I asked questions of the then Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> in regard to the continuous increase in the price of hoots, and I was informed that an inquiry would be made. Last week, again, I asked if the inquiry had been commenced, and the honorable gentleman said he had brought the matter under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene).</inline> To-day I asked the Minister for Trade and Customs what stage the inquiry had reached, because this matter of the ever-increasing price of boots is of vital importance to the people, and the Minister informed me that he had sent it on to the Inter-State Commission. It will take that body some time to make an inquiry and bring in a report, and the futility of the whole business lies in the fact that the Government can, or will, do nothing. We have reports already in regard to quite a number of other matters, and nothing has been done, because, so we have been informed, the Government have not power under the Constitution to take any action. I believe the Government have power to-day, as during the war. On the outbreak of hostilities a proclamation was issued declaring this country to be in a state of war, and the Government proceeded immediately to exercise certain powers of control. I contend that whatever powers the Government and the Parliament had during the actual period of the war must continue until the Peace Treaty is ratified. In these circumstances there can be no excuse for the failure of the Government to deal with the high cost of living. The facts in relation to these matters should carry weight. During the war period the price of boots, amongst other things, was regulated, and reasonable rates were maintained. But in May last, owing probably to influence brought to bear by those directly interested, the Government abolished the whole of their price-fixing machinery. Boot manufacturers and others were given a free hand, and the price of boots immediately went up. Ever since then prices have been increasing. Why did the Government relax this power, and thus give profiteers a free hand? Why did they not take measures to prevent profiteering? If they have lost the power which they were able to exercise during the war - and I claim that they have not - it is still open to them to control the export of hides, and pressure should be brought to bear in that direction to bring down the price of boots. The Government could say to dealers in hides, &#34; Until the people of Australia are able to obtain boots at the prices which ruled prior to May last we shall not permit the export of hides.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- Start where you like so long as the principle is applied all round. If the cost of living were reduced to what is was prior to the war, the working people of Australia would cheerfully contribute to the liquidation of the war debt. They are unable to do so to-day owing to the action of certain individuals who, by reason of their power and influence, have been able to secure to themselves practically the whole of the wealth of the community. The poorer classes are not even able to-day to pay their family bills. </para>

Statistics in regard to increases in house rents and the prices of foods show that the purchasing power of the sovereign to-day is 7s. 6d. less than it was in 1914. Honorable members opposite say that something should be done to bring down the cost of living, yet they continue to support a Government which will do nothing in that direction, and is endeavouring to make the people believe that without an amendment of the Constitution it can do nothing. On the two occasions that the Labour party, when in power, submitted amendments of the Constitution to the people, they met with the opposition of honorable members opposite, who say to-day that the Federal Parliament needs to be clothed with additional powers. </para>

It is quite possible that if the Government do bring forward Bills providing for the amendment of the Constitution, those measures will have to -be modified to meet the views of many of their supporters. I maintain that this Parliament could not have too much power. It is stated in this morning&#39;s newspapers that a witness, after giving evidence before  the Victorian State Commission yesterday  in regard to the price of boots, said that it would be impossible to fix, with any degree of satisfaction, the price of boots in any one State. It was, he declared, a Commonwealth matter; and I certainly agree with him that we must have uniformity throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

Very few of oar boys on returning to Australia have suitable civilian clothing Many of them find that they have grown out of the clothes they left behind, while others discover that their civilian clothing during their absence has become moth eaten. Two or three returned men told me recently that, being anxious to get into &#34; civvies &#34; as soon as possible, they thought of buying a suit or two in England, but prices there were so high that they determined not to make any purchases until they reached Australia. They were surprised to discover that clothing here was as dear as it was in England, and in some cases dearer. </para>

                        <para>- Although we produce the wool and everything else required for the manufacture of clothing. Manufacturers of clothing on the other side of the world have to depend upon us for their supplies of raw material, and yet they can sell, in many cases, at prices below those ruling here. Our soldiers, to whom - as the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> said, yesterday - we owe a debt that we can never discharge, find that the whole of their deferred pay,, amounting to &#163;20 or &#163;30 each, is absorbed in the purchase of new clothing outfits. In my district, they have to pay nine guineas or ten guineas for a tailored suit, and the prices of underclothing; boots, and everything else they require are also exceedingly high. This is not a fair position in which to place our returned men. They did not expect to find these prices ruling in Australia; and they prevail to-day only because of the ineptitude and inaction of the Government. Had the Parliament desired, it could have prevented these increases from the very outset of the war. As it was, we had regard to only one section of the community. We endeavoured, by the creation of Pools and the appointment of Boards, to protect and regulate various industries; but, unfortunately, interested persons were appointed to those Boards, and throughout this war they have carefully studied their own interests. They have made the most of the war period. I say, without the slightest hesitation, that many of those interested persons who during, the war prated of their loyalty, were at the same time taking every shilling they could out of the pockets of the people and the soldiers who were fighting for us abroad. The contributions which some of the wealthiest men in this country have made to patriotic efforts, and the amounts they have put into our war loans, are practically infinitesimaL Yet during the whole course of the war they have been reaping great benefits; every day they are amassing wealth; their bank accounts are growing. On. the other hand, the poor are becoming poorer, and are unable to provide necessaries for their families. These are questions which require immediate attention, but they get none. It is quite probable that at a very early date an effort will be made- to send honorable members to the people, but when the electors realize what little use we are making of the power we have to protect them, they will do the only thing it is possible for them to do in. the circumstances, and that is to bring about a change of Government. The newspapers are endeavouring to create a certain atmosphere for the purpose of securing an election which will return to power the party now in office, the proposal being to postpone the adjustment of the finances until after the elections. If the present party are returned to power, we shall find that the greatest load of taxation is placed on those who can ill-afford to bear it - on the poor, and even on those brave men who have returned to our shores, many of them maimed and many suffering from shell-shock. In my opinion, men who have served their country in the war have done their part, and should be relieved of all taxation, at any rate of income taxation. The income tax -was imposed for the purpose of liquidating the debt incurred in defending the country, and if our returned soldiers are called upon to pay it, they will be levied upon to pav back the very money which we borrowed in order to pay them for their services. The income tax should be ear-marked for the purpose of paying the debt on the war, and the men who went abroad to fight while we remained behind in perfect security should be exempted from paying it, and people who made an exceedingly great amount of wealth during the war should be called upon to contribute more than they are paying. The time has arrived when a return of the wealth held by the people of- Australia should be prepared, and all persons in the community should be called upon to pay according to their wealth. It is not fair to go on year after year accumulating a war debt without making some effort to reduce it. Our boys have played their part away from Australia. Our part has now to be played, and steps should be taken at once to meet the obligations incurred by the Commonwealth as the outcome of the war. In the six months or nine months before this Parliament expires, we ought to be able to accomplish a lot of good work, particularly in the direction of reducing the cost of living. </para>

                <para>We have established a scheme whereby soldiers can borrow up to &#163;700 for the purpose of building homes, but, ,as a matter of fact, a house which costs &#163;700 to-day could have been built for &#163;450 before the boys went to the war. We are asking these men to repay &#163;250- more than they are entitled to do, because profiteers have increased the prices of material during the progress of the war. These are the questions which are staring us in the face, and yet we burke them. Some honorable, member may say, &#34; What about the cost of labour ? &#34; According to the evidence given by builders before the Inter-State Commission, the sum of &#163;14 17s. represents the increase in the cost of a cottage due to the increased wages given to .the labour employed. The whole of the extra cost of a cottage beyond that &#163;14 17s. is due to the higher prices of materials, and the Inter-State Commission shows that there are combines and monopolies throughout Australia which fix the prices of articles to suit their own interests. We have no longer the freedom of trade about which people used to talk. It is no longer a question of supply and demand. These individuals form associations &#39;to look after their own interests and filch as much as they possibly can from the general public. Some honorable members may say that we have no power under the Constitution to deal with soldiers&#39; homes, but without an amendment of the Constitution the Government can cut timber in their own forests in Papua, and they can establish brick yards in various States, and in this way they can reduce the cost of timber or brick cottages for the &#34;soldiers. However, no effort is made in this direction to protect men who have done so much for the country. We claim that we are looking after their interests; but, if an election is held, the position will be made very clear to them. When they know exactly what has been done, they will be thoroughly ashamed of the Parliament which is in charge of the affairs of the country, for which they have fought. The cost of living is a vital question. I do not speak about it week after week just for the sake of talk-  ing. My object is to draw the attention of the public to it. I claim that the Commonwealth Government have the power to deal with it, and that within the next few weeks we ought to see a change brought about; but I know that I cannot hope to see it done, because here we are up against so many vested interests. </para>

                        <para>-I am pretty sure there is. It is inconceivable that most of the metropolitan dailies should have referred to it in this way if there had not been something in it. Some of them have already written leading articles on it. I, therefore, assume that an offer has been made, but I am not surprised that it has not come before Cabinet. It is quite natural that a matter even of such importance might have been held over owing to the early arrival of the Prime Minister back from Home. If an offer has been made to construct a railway and to provide the money - in other words, to take Government bonds in payment - I do not want that offer to be turned down without the fullest and most complete consideration being given to it. </para>

                        <para>- No ; I stand for this country. I always have done so, and always will. This is not only not a Norton-Griffiths offer, but it is something that is conceivably better even than the construction of the railway by the Government themselves. The offer has been made broadly on the principle that a price is to be agreed to between the parties. The Government might want competition and open tender. Probably that would be the best course, because it would settle any vexatious strife that might arise afterwards when other railway builders, as they always do, come along the day after the fair, saying that if the work had only been open to tender they would have been in it, and would have given the Government better terms. However, that is a matter of detail, which must be considered. My point is that if a tangible offer has been made, it should not be treated like a previous offer by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Timms to complete the construction of the East- West railway. That was a genuine offer, backed up by  a  very substantial sum of money. </para>

                        <para>- I know the Department had already done &#163;2,000,000 worth of work, and the offer was to complete the line for another &#163;2,000,000. Substantial backing was forthcoming, but the offer was turned down, because, according to the Minister of the day, the then Engineer-in..Chief said that be could do it as cheaply by day labour.  That is  true, and is in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> in the speech of the Minister who &#34;was responsible for  accepting  that assurance and turning down the offer. . To-day we have  a  railway completed at .  a  cost, not of &#163;4,000,000, but of more than &#163;7,000,000. I know that war conditions arose, but I know approximately how much they meant in the matter of cost, because most of the material was already secured at prewar prices. I shall not go into details, because I promised only to indicate rather than to elaborate these matters. I do not want, nor do I think the Committee wants, a repetition of what occurred then. I therefore repeat that any offer made in regard to the North-South railway, not only ought to have the serious consideration of the Government, but is such a big national question that the Government should not turn it down on its own initiative without giving the House some say in it. This is a big matter, and big national matters should be considered by the House. We, as a Parliament, have been very considerate since the war began. It has been largely necessary that the Government should be practically all powerful, and able in many respects to act on their own initiative. </para>

The time has gone by now when any Government has a right to conduct the affairs of this nation without the authority of Parliament, as provided by the Constitution. I hope we are going to get back to constitutional lines, and trust that before any such offer is turned down by the Government the House will have an opportunity to say something about it. </para>

Men will not load the best meat on earth, and a lot of other things, nowadays. They are very funny in the matter of what they will and will not load. On the continent of Europe this particular commodity is a staple article of food, and has been for centuries, and possibly will be for centuries to come. We have in Australia tens of thousands of fat horses. </para>

                        <para>- There is further testimony. My honorable friend has done good work on the other side, and brought back some useful hints. I hope the Acting Treasurer will bring this matter before the Cabinet, and if there are certain . Continental people, our own Allies, to whom horse flesh is one of the staple daily foods, and they desire to purchase that commodity from us, the opportunity ought not to be lost because of a stupid prejudice. I regard it as a national duty to call the attention of the Committee to the question. We are not asking that the Government should permit the export to any foreign country of anything that is not acceptable to that country. </para>

                        <para>- The squatter is the man who is raising horses. Horse-breeding is one of the factors of wealth in the interior of Australia. There are parts of the interior where, particularly in the dry seasons, only horses can be run. It is impossible to raise sheep, and it is almost impossible to raise cattle, owing to the distance they would have to go for water ; but horses can be depastured because they will travel 20 and 30 miles to water. We shall not be giving fair consideration to Australian production if we do not seriously entertain this proposal, which I commend to the Committee. </para>

                    <para>.- I claim the attention of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> to the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Zuenko,</inline> wife of a Russian deportee. As Acting Prime Minister, the honorable gentleman agreed that this woman should be allowed to leave Australia to join her husband. I have been informed that the husband has been sent to Alexandria, whilst his wife, who is in a delicate state of health, has been sent to Bombay. The officials knew the condition of the lady, and surely a little extra care should have been taken to see that she was able to rejoin her husband. But I understand she is stranded in Bombay friendless and penniless. I know that the Treasurer was prepared to do the right thing; but, evidently, there has been a serious departmental blunder. It is an inhumane act to send a woman in her state of health to a place like Bombay, whilst her husband has been sent to Alexandria. </para>

                        <para>- Her husband is a Russian who got into trouble in Brisbane. He was brought to New South Wales, and subsequently deported. His wife followed him from Brisbane, and as she had some little difficulty in getting access to her husband, she interviewed me. She told me that if her husband were deported she would like to be allowed to accompany him. That request was only fair, for, even though the Government deal  with persons who advocate views which are not acceptable to them, there is no reason why inhumane treatment should be meted out. to women who are guiltless of any crime against the &#39; Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Another &#39;matter to which I wish to refer is the treatment meted out to young Australians who were sent to Great Britain to learn submarine construction and shipbuilding. </para>

                </continue>
                <para>From about . 700 applicants in all parts of Australia,, the Navy Department, after a thorough examination of the qualifications and credentials, selected nine young Australians of brilliant attainments to be sent to Great Britain in order to gain further experience in the great shipbuilding yards of that country. The idea was that they would return with enhanced knowledge, and enable Australia to build up a competent technical staff that would be capable of carrying out the construction of submarines and war-ships of all descriptions in our own dockyards. Having undergone their course of training, the young men returned to Australia, and I propose to tell the Committee what has happened to them. One of them, C. Hutton, is a Diesel engine expert. Honorable members know that a Diesel engine expert is a most important technical workman in connexion with submarine construction. Hutton had not been back in Australia more than two or three weeks before he received an intimation from the Navy Department that his services were not required, because the Government did not intend to proceed with submarine construction. He has now been snapped up by the Fore River Shipbuilding Company, of Quincey, Massachusetts, United States of America, at a salary equal to &#163;1,000 per annum. The Navy Department was to have paid him &#163;250 per annum. If Hutton was not an expert worthy of a responsible and well-paid position he would not have been engaged by such an up-to-date firm as that I have mentioned. The country has lost his services, because the Government said they did not intend to proceed with submarine construction. Why did they spend thousands of pounds to send this man to Britain in order to gain experience and knowledge ? Another member, of the party was H.  Kidd, an engineering draughtsman. On his return he was left in an ordinary position at Cockatoo Island Dock at a salary of &#163;250 per annum. This man has been snatched up by Dalgety and Company of Sydney, at a salary three times greater than that paid to hi in by the Commonwealth, which has now lost his services. We spent thousands of pounds in sending these young Australians abroad to be technically trained, and when they return the Commonwealth, apparently, has no use for them, and allows them to go into private employment. Then there is the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Duggan, electrical expert, who, out of 700 applicants, was selected for technical training. When he returned, he was taken into the employment of Siemens Brothers, also at a greater salary than that paid to him previously by the Commonwealth. This firm stands so high in the electrical world that they do not require any but experts in their employ ; and to those experts they pay large salaries. They evidently knew the value of this brilliant young Australian, and employed him at the first opportunity. The latest of all the cases is that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> Hoskins, boiler-making expert, and the one boiler-maker out of the nine men who were sent Home for training. When he came back to Australia he was given an ordinary job at Cockatoo Island at &#163;250 a year, but to-day he is under engagement to Messrs. Poole and Steel to take charge of the practical work of ship construction at their shipbuilding yard in South Australia. I have mentioned four nien out of the nine who, within a few months of their return to Australia, after being technically trained at the expense of the Commonwealth, were &#34;taken into private employment. And while this is going on, what does the Commonwealth do? As a matter o.f fact, we have imported from Great Britain <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. David</inline> Pickering, Shipyard Manager at Williamstown, ait &#163;600 a year. We first imported <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curchin</inline> at &#163;2,000 per annum, and then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pickering</inline> at &#163;600. </para>

                    <para>.- The tax-gatherer having just finished his work for the year, this seems to me rather an opportune time to bring under the notice of the Committee some of the difficulties under which the taxpayers are labouring. For many years it has been evident to any one interested in primary production that the taxing of the man on the land is of a more grievous nature than that of any other section of the com&#39;munity. He has to pay State and Federal land taxes, State and Federal income taxes, Crown land tax, shire tax, and the Pastoralists&#39; Protection Board tax. It is not so much the number of the taxes of which I complain as the form under which the taxes are collected. It has been stated here, and quite rightly, within the last few weeks, that wo could do much to relieve the situation of the man  who has to pay all those taxes if the Federal and State taxation were unified. This would mean a tremendous saving in&#39; time and money-,&#39; and would relieve the man on the land of much of the burden  which to-day is interfering with his efforts in the way of primary production. But, as I have said, it is the form of the taxation that is the chief trouble; and I should like to lay before the Committee the form which is issued to graziers, large and small, as that on which they must furnish their returns. As far back as 1905 I dealt with this matter in the State Parliament of New South Wales, and I drew the attention of the Commissioner of Taxation to the fact that the primary producer was being most unfairly taxed in that he had to pay on his natural increase, which very frequently he could not realize on. The man on the land is taxed in such a burdensome way that it takes up a great deal of his time, causes him much annoyance, and interferes with production to a dangerous extent; and yet this is a matter which could be very easily amended. </para>

                <para>I desire to lay before the Committee some of the troubles which the man on the land experiences in this connexion. On18th October, 1905, I received from the Department of Taxation in Sydney the following letter: - </para>

                </para>
                <para>Referring to your recent interview with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. First</inline> Commissioner Spiller, when the question of the departmental method of treating as income the natural increase of flocks and herds born during the year was under discussion, I have to inform you that the Commissioners, having considered the vews set forth by you - <inline font-style="italic">inter alia.</inline> - &#34; that a taxpayer in being assessed on the natural increase, as above, would pay tax on an assumed income which might never be realized, as some, or perhaps all, of the increase might die before any sale could be made,&#34; will be prepared to concede an allowance in respect of the deaths which have subsequently occurred in the natural increase if the value of the said natural increase has previously been taken into account in arriving at the net income. The claim in connexion with the death of any of the lambs to be made a charge against the year in which the value of the said lambs had been taken into account as income. </para>
                <para class="block">That was, as I say, in 1905, but the Government have gone on all these years collecting the taxation in the same old way. A man who has a natural increase has to pay on that increase whether he realizes on it or not, and under no conditions can he deduct the loss from the income tax. In the form issued to landowners and graziers for income-tax purposes, the Commissioners give a sample case on which they are to work; and the formula this last year reads as follows :  - </para>

                <para>Mr.FLEMING. - In assessing income the Commissioners fix upon 10s. per head in respect of the natural increase of lambs in New South Wales and 9s. per head in Queensland. The total thus arrived at in respect of the value of the natural increase is added to the price paid for sheep purchased during the year, and, on the average price thus obtained, the taxpayer has to pay. Every practical man will recognise that this system is unfair, since the amount on which a taxpayer has to pay depends entirely upon whether his purchases exceeded the natural increase in his flocks. Another important factor to be borne in mind is that the whole of the natural increase might possibly die before the owner could realize on it. The only fair method of taxing the man on the land, who is producing, to a greater extent than is any one else, the wealth of Australia would be to call upon him to pay on the natural  increase of his flocks or herds only when he realizes. Sooner or later the money must come into the exchequer. The Commissioner will say that if that system were allowed, the man on the land might be adding to his capital by adding to his stock every year. In the end, however, the result to the Department must be the same. When a man realizes on his stock, he must pay taxation on his income. I do not think honorable members on either side would for one moment support the system&#39; adopted by the Commissioner of Taxation under which a man may be, - and is, called upon to pay a tax on income that he has never actually enjoyed. It is only fair that a man should not be called upon to pay income tax in respect .of the natural increase in his flocks or herds until he has realized on that increase. While a grazier, is carrying sheep, he has to pay income tax in respect of the income which he derives from the sale of their wool, and he has also to pay the stock tax. </para>
                <para>Another objection to the present system is that the man on the land, is not allowed, any deduction in respect of deterioration of his cattle or horses on account of age. He is the only class of taxpayer who is not permitted to write down the depreciation of his stock. Viewed from every stand-point, the man on the land, who, in the aggregate&#39;, is producing the greatest amount of the wealth of Australia, is being taxed most unjustly, and he is getting tired of .the job. The position is becoming serious. A number of these men are beginning to find the burden of taxation too heavy. I know quite a number who are thinking of giving up .primary production because of the appalling burdens which are being thrown on them by this unfair system of taxation. </para>

                <para>I have here an actual return sent in in respect of the. financial year just closed. The details are as follow : - Stock on hand 1st July, 6,594 sheep, at lis. lid. - which is the average value, according to the Commissioner&#39;s method of assessment - &#163;3,929; 46 cattle at &#163;6, &#163;276; 58 horses at &#163;8, &#163;464. Purchases for the year - 2,061 sheep, &#163;2,480. Sales for the year- 1,963 sheep, &#163;2,961; 9 head of cattle, &#163;121; seven horses, &#163;36. Killed for rations, 186 sheep at 13s. 10. 8d., &#163;129. Thus the gross income of this taxpayer according to the Income Tax Commissioner&#39;s formula amounted to &#163;8,961, and the deductions in respect of stock on . hand killed and used amounted to &#163;7,149,- leaving a. net income of &#163;1,822. The actual result in practice, however, was as follows: - Sales for the year, 1.963 sheep, &#163;2,961; killed .for rations, 186 sheep, &#163;129; sales for year, 9 cattle, &#163;&#34;121; seven horses, &#163;36; total, &#163;3,247. Deducting purchases amounting to &#163;2,480, the net income from the year&#39;s transactions thus amounted to &#163;767. The income from increase at the average value allowed for stock on hand was as follows:- 523 sheep at 13e. 10.8d., &#163;363. I should point out in passing that these sheep should have been put down at 10s. per head, so that the actual income in respect to them amounted to only &#163;261 10s. Value of six cattle at &#163;6 per head, &#163;36. This gives a total of &#163;399 to be added, in respect of increase, to sales. As against that total, there-was deducted&#39; &#163;8 in respect of one horse, bringing down the total to &#163;391. The actual income from the year&#39;s transactions amounted to &#163;767, and the accrued income from increase in stock totalled &#163;391, so that the net income thus amounted to &#163;1,158. From that total a sum of &#163;100 should rightly be deducted since the- increase of lambs was allowed,  for at the average value of the whole of the stock for the year, whereas it should have been included at a value of 10s. per head. It will thus be seen from these figures that the net income of this grazier, according to the return which had to be furnished upon the Commissioner&#39;s formula, was &#163;1,822, whereas the actual net income, including natural increase, was only &#163;1,158. Thus, observing the Commissioner&#39;s formula, the taxpayer had to pay income tax on the sum of &#163;664 in excess of the income actually earned by him, even allowing for taxation upon the natural increase.&#39; </para>
                <para>I am sure that no honorable member would support such a system of taxation. It is grossly unfair. It is damaging the prospects of the community; is unjust to the graziers, and has a detrimental effect upon the general wage fund of the people. If the men on the land have to pay more taxation than they should be rightly called upon to bear, . they have less money to distribute in the shape of wages. Every man is naturally anxious to improve his property, if it is worth while doing so. The average man on the land is interested, not only in making money, but in improving his property, and in increasing production. Whether he holds freehold or leasehold country, he takes a pride in increasing its productivity. It is a sort of professional pride to be found throughout the length and breadth of Australia. If the taxation of the men on&#39; the land is placed on a fair basis, they &#39;will continue to do their utmost to increase production, not merely from a sense of duty to the country, but because of&#39; the personal interest and pride that every man takes in his own property. </para>
                <para>I hope the Government will see that better methods of assessing the man on the land are adopted in the future. I am aware that the Graziers Association of New South Wales is urging that income shall be taken, not as for one year, but on an average of three years. They think that the adoption of. their proposal would enable them to a certain, extent to equalize their losses. I wish, however, to make the point, and to emphasize it, that no system of taxation will be fair under which a man is taxed on the natural increase upon which, in many cases, he never realizes. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster)</inline> has referred to the&#34; prohibition of the export of horse flesh. No man in Australia is a greater lover of a good horse than I am, but I think it monstrous to prohibit the export of horse flesh having regard to what that prohibition means. Those who go into the back country in many cases will see fat horses running about, arid practically wasted. In the inner districts of New South Wales horses are just being kept alive in these days of drought at the expense of sheep and cattle. If the export of horse flesh were allowed these animals would be kept in good condition, and would not be . as they are to-day - mere skin and bone, being just kept alive until the rain comes. Another point is that a horse requires the very best feed. He picks out the very best grass, and is the most delicate and dainty feeder of any animal on four legs. He is also the hardest of all animals on country. The rural districts of Australia are suffering to-day. Graziers in the dry country are trying to keep their horses alive until the rain comes, and, consequently, their sheep and cattle are on short commons. Had. they been allowed to export horse flesh when their stock was in good condition - when the graziers saw that a drought was approaching - a great many of these animals would &#39;have been turned into meat and sent abroad. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member need have no fear in that regard. The lifting of the prohibition would merely enable a man to dispose of his surplus horses. It would also encourage many who are giving up horse breeding to go on with the work. Unless a man can work a horse it is a most expensive luxury. Horses are the most unprofitable form of live stock in Australia today. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member represents a country constituency, and he knows that it is the aim of every bushman to ride or drive a .good horse. In the effort &#34;to secure one good horse, a man often breeds forty or fifty culls, and these culls, which are being wasted today, could be turned to profitable account if the export of horse flesh were permitted. </para>

                <para>There is another aspect of this question which appeals to me as a lover of horses. In &#39;all our capital cities we see poor old horses, many of which have done big things in their day, being practically worked to death between the shafts of vans and cabs. We can see these good old faithful slaves being gradually worked to death in this way by heartless men until&#39; they are finally sent to the Zoo. If the export of horse flesh were allowed these horses would be kept in good condition instead of being gradually starved and at the end of their working days would be mercifully destroyed. It grieves me to walk about the streets and see these poor old horses working. Game as pebbles, but gone in the knees and bung in the fetlocks, they are being knocked about by men who know no more as to the treatment they require than do the animals in the Zoo, where ultimately these poor old beasts go. Instead of permitting them to be worked until they drop dead in the streets, I want to see opportunities provided for the owners to treat them well and fatten them up so that when they are in good -condition they can be killed and sent abroad as horse-flesh. An old horse well fattened would be just as good eating as an old bullock in good condition. I hope that this stupid prejudice against the exportation of horse-flesh will be wiped away. Australia will be the gainer by thousands of pounds in the place of a few score pounds we are making out of the years of misery to which our old horses have now to submit. </para>

                    <para>.- The extraordinary speech of the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming)</inline> is only in keeping- with that made just previously by the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster).</inline> The honorable member for Robertson was quite illogical. He says that these horses are extraordinarily expensive to keep, but when asked why they are bred, he says that it is for a purpose unknown, and which he could not explain. As it may be thought that the whole of the Chamber is in favour of the exportation of horse-flesh if the arguments put forward by the two honorable members who have preceded me are allowed to go without protest, I take this opportunity, as representing a portion of a State which grows beef, and exports perhaps more beef than all the other States put together, to say that once the exportation of horseflesh from Australia is permitted under any conditions whatever, a death-blow will be dealt at the exportation of beef. I can readily imagine why the honorable member for Wakefield is in favour of the exportation of horse-flesh. It is because in his State horses are bred, and very few cattle. One can also imagine the capital that would be made by the American Beef Trust out of the exportation of horse-flesh from Australia. </para>

                        <para>- It would be argued that the consumer could not tell the difference between the horse-flesh and beef. Horse flesh can easily be made to pass for beef, and once the knowledge that Australia is exporting horse-flesh goes abroad, our beef trade will be irredeemably ruined. In any case, it would take years to live down the prejudices created, especially in Great Britain. The honorable member for New England (Lt.-Colonel Abbott) . says that he has partaken of horse-flesh at the Front, but he did not do it voluntarily. </para>

                        <para>- That difficulty could be overcome by strict supervision, and by preventing the factory from canning any other kind of flesh. Then such a thing could not happen as occurred in connexion with Angliss&#39; abattoirs, from which vile and filthy diseased meat was sent to our soldiers. I am, perhaps, the only honorable member in the House who has eaten horse-flesh, and if I knew of a restaurant which would provide it at the present time, I would like to renew an acquaintanceship of my student days. So much as to horse-flesh being  a  good article for human consumption. I remind the honorable member for Robertson that there is a very strong organization in Melbourne for the prevention of cruelty to animals, and he has only to call for the assistance of a policeman to have any cruelty to horses he notices prevented at once. </para>

I, therefore, speak under correction; but if the loss is &#163;1,500 it means that 12,000 meals, at2s. 6d. each, are thrown away, or 30,000 meals at1s. each, and there have been a lot of hungry people in Melbourne lately. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that name would apply to Richardson&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Cafe Francais.</inline> I still say that you cannot get the meal you get down there for the same money here. Let the management be handed over to the chef, the steward, or the waiters ; let them supply our meals, and then we will not have this loss. Another way would be to run the Refreshment Rooms in connexion with an establishment outside. That would do away with the unnecessarily large waste of food that takes place from time to time when the Houses rise unexpectedly early. The answer I got to my query was, &#34; The accounts for 1918-19 have not yet been audited and published.&#34; That is not a very satisfactory answer. Although the year closed three months ago, I am still waiting for the information. If I could get the accounts for the year 1917-18, which are over a year old, I could show what the loss was then. My point is that the Refreshment Rooms could be run without a loss, either in connexion with a restaurant outside or by letting those who do the work run them on a co-operative basis, eliminating every one else who has any controlling influence. </para>

                    <para>We have heard a lot about profiteering, and the increase of prices, but nothing is done, and the thing is allowed to go on quietly. The vile and infamous tax upon children&#39;s amusement tickets is still collected, as my leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> has reiterated time and again. The children have to pay a tax of 33 per cent. on a 3d. ticket. If a kiddie goes to a show his father has to give him an extra1d. to pay the amusements tax. Yet, although the prices of admission to dress circle and stalls have been increased at other places of amusement during war time, the tax there is only 1d. in the1s. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> felt ashamed when he pressed the amusements tax on the House. Honorable members will recall that he said that the tax on children&#39;s tickets could be reconsidered later. When is that opportunity coming ? These are the headings that have appeared in some of the papers regarding it: The <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> Melbourne, called it an arbitrary tax; the <inline font-style="italic">livening News,</inline> Sydney, a mean tax; the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> a dangerous tax; the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times,</inline> Sydney, an inequitable tax; the <inline font-style="italic">Truth,</inline> Sydney, a detrimental tax; the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> Melbourne, a rough-and-ready tax; the <inline font-style="italic">Daily News,</inline> Perth, an objectionable tax; the <inline font-style="italic">NorthEast Despatch,</inline> Wangaratta, an aggravating tax; the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Call,</inline> Melbourne, an iniquitous tax; the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> Melbourne, an unjust tax; the <inline font-style="italic">Triad,</inline> Sydney, an infamous tax; the <inline font-style="italic">Mirror,</inline> Sydney, a discouraging tax; the <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> Melbourne, an unfair tax; the <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser,</inline> Adelaide, an unjustifiable tax; and the <inline font-style="italic">Graphic,</inline> Melbourne, a hard-hitting tax. Has there ever been a greater amount of sarcastic criticism of an infamous impost? The proper way to collect the money was by means of the income tax. The Government should charge the incomes made out of the amusements, but they chose a mean and contemptible way by sneaking 33 per cent. on the child&#39;s 3d. ticket, although they imposed a tax of only 8 per cent. on the ticket of the lady and gentleman who go into the dress-circle. </para>
                    <para>It is the same all along the line. Take the case of soldiers&#39; dependants. I have received a letter, which I shall afterwards hand to the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett),</inline> because it came from his electorate. I trust I have his permission to quote it. I always reply in a case of this sort stating that I have sent the letter on to the honorable member for the district, and try to say a good word or two for him. This is the letter - </para>
                    <para>Could you please give me any information in this matter? I am the wife of a returned soldier, who now has deserted me twelve months past. Word came through the Young Men&#39;s Christian Association that while my husband was in England be had committed bigamy, and when he knew the news had come to Australia he disappeared. I then issued a warrant for his arrest, but the police have failed to trace him. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, I</inline> and his infant son have been left destitute; the only money I had coming in was the war pension of 4s. for self and 2s. 3d. for child, and when my husband failed to appear before the Board they cancelled it, leaving my child and me to do the best we could. I pleaded, but oil in vain. I begged for assistance from the Repatriation Fund, but it was useless. It meant that I had to give up my home and everything. I might mention that the Recruiting Committee still holds &#163;10 - wages due to my husband - also the  Deputy  Commissioner of Pensions holds a sum of money uncollected by him; but they say I have no claim on it. . <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, it</inline> is this that I am wanting to know: Is there no help for the deserted wives of soldiers in Australia? I sec that English women, wives of our Australian soldiers who were deserted, are getting assistance from the Repatriation in England. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, I</inline> am one of the unfortunate women whose husbands went astray while abroad; but surely there is a little help from the Repatriation for his son. I have a good character, and I do not deserve the treatment I have received from the military. I was willing that my husband should do his duty to his country, and now I am left to suffer. Through worry, my health has broken down, and I am unable to work. I am depending on my widowed mother, who is not in a position to keep the child or myself. </para>
                    <para class="block">If that poor mother had lost her husband, she would &#39;have been entitled to a pension, but in this case something worse has happened to her. Sorrow for death can often be tempered by kindly thoughts and memories, but there are some things even worse than death. This lady was offered by the Department a miserable pittance, for no one can say that a child can live on 2s. 6d. a week. The offer was so. contemptible that if the Government would take the House into its confidence, we could, in one short half hour, make impossible actions such as this, and so remove the continual trouble from those who have suffered, and the larger number who know of the injustice done, &#62;and are constantly seeking to have it remedied. </para>
                    <para>Surely we can increase the old-age pension to fi per week. There is no honorable member on either side of the House who will say that an old-age pensioner can live on 12s. 6d. per &#39;week at a time when the purchasing power of. the sove-&#39; reign has decreased to 12s. 6d. in some cases, or even to 10s., as the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> said in the course of his speech yesterday. If this matter were put to a vote of. the House honorable members would surely grant an increase of the old-age pension to 20s., while the high prices of food and clothing continue. How the treatment of these pensioners contrasts with the generosity to others ! According to an answer to a question I asked, the Commonwealth Chief Justice, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, drew in salary to the 30th .June last, &#163;55,087. He has drawn a little more -since that date. He has been drawing for twenty-five years a salary of &#163;3,500 per annum, making a total of over &#163;87,000. I endeavoured to get information in regard to the total amount of allowances paid to him. The answer was one that hides what the public should really know as to how much this high-placed gentleman has cost the country. &#34; No expenses were paid to the Chief Justice,&#34; I was told, &#34; on account of the expenses of himself and associate when travelling to discharge the duties of his office, but there were paid such sums as the Chief Justice certified to have been actually expended.&#34; Honorable members will recollect that I have stated before that if <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith had lost his money by unwise speculations, and was really in need of financial assistance after his retirement, I would be willing, on account of his achievement in having translated Dante&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Inferno</inline> into English vernacular verse, to contribute yearly an amount equal to my income-tax payment last year. But I have yet to learn that he is in the unfinancial position that a person receiving such a pension should be. The Old-age Pensions Act allows a pensioner to own a home, but if he possesses the value of that home in cash or in war bonds, for every &#163;50 thus possessed &#163;1 is deducted from the pension. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith was eminent in the law ; he possessed one of the keenest legal minds that has ever graced our </para>
                    <para>Bench, and he has probably the greatest literary knowledge of Italian of any person who has ever been in Australia; yet, he is willing that the hat should be sent round to the Government to collect for him a pension of &#163;5 per day. I ask for only &#163;1 per week for those who have contributed in minute fractions to the enormous salary that he has received.  His  great work in translating Dante will live, but it may not earn nun anything in royalties. I give him full credit for that achievement, but I desire to read to the Committee a resolution which was carried at a public meeting last night - </para>

It is time we stopped greasing the fat pig. I have read to the Committee the unfortunate case of the soldier&#39;s wife and children who had been deserted. What a. contrast there is be-  i   tween her lot and that of Lady Bridges? I have nothing to say against the widow of General Bridges; but this Parliament paid her a sum of &#163;3,500. Was it through Government House influence that she received such treatment? I am sorry that her husband paid the supreme penalty together with nearly 60,000 of our men. The greater is the pity that there is such a cursed thing as war. I think &#163;30 per week is the salary of a general. He re- ceives, also, a field allowance of 25s. per day. Surely Lady Bridges could have saved more than the wife of Private John Brown, who only gets 6s. per day. I propose to give notice to-morrow of a motion dealing with this matter. &#39; </para>

                        <para>.- Some days ago I asked the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> if the Government contemplated introducing  a  Bill to amend the Naturalization Act in order to allow of the naturalization of illiterates. I believe that such an amendment should be made in consonance with the principles of Democracy, fair treatment, and common-sense. Tinder the existing law an illiterate person cannot be naturalized, and &#34; illiterate &#34; is denned as meaning inability to read and write in English. It matters not how highly educated a person may be in any other language. I know that it is difficult to pass any legislation that will cause no hardship. There are, however, some persons whom this provision in the Naturalization Act hits very hard. I shall content myself with referring to one which is typical of many others of which I have knowledge. There is a German lady, now seventy-five years of age, who landed in Australia when she was- twenty years of age, and spent the whole of her life in the back-blocks. She was unable to attend any school at which she could learn English. Some of her sons fought in the recent war. She reared a very respectable family, and- within the last few years has inherited property in Australia. Naturally she desires, before taking her departure from this world, to settle her- property upon her children. It is only reasonable&#39; that she should be allowed to do that. </para>

                        <para>No Commission has been appointed that I know of to inquire into the future government of the Pacific Islands. The Commission recently appointed is dealing with New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago, on outlines that have already been- prepared. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">There is not much information in that reply. In the first place, the Minister tried to dodge the question by suggesting I had made a mistake in referring to the Pacific Islands instead of to New Guinea ;. but if New Guinea is not a Pacific Island,. I do not know what it is. As a matter of fact, I think the Administrator of the Territory holds his commission as Administrator of the Pacific Islands. I do not wish to argue that point, but merely to show one phase of the question at this particular juncture. It was our soldier boys who wrested these islands from the enemy - who fought for them and cap,tured them, and has enabled us to retain them, ever since. If there is anything in. those islands, of which our returned soldiers would like to take advantage in the way of settlement, the way ought to be made smooth for them. I would not ask. soldiers to go there if they have no desire to do so, but I am given to understand that there is room for a very large soldier settlement, and that, without asking the men to- spend the whole of their time there, a very decent living could be provided for at least 1,000. I have no complaint to make in regard to the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Commission, but there is the danger that these islands may pass into the hands of big companies or combines, whose only interest would be to develop them so as to provide openings for large speculations and exploitation. For the information of the Committee, I should like to read a few extracts from some matter written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> N. Leach, who has been several times in New Guinea, and has resided there permanently for about two years past. I know that gentleman personally, and I discussed the matter with him even before the war broke out. He went over there to report on the islands, and since his return, after giving some assistance in administrative work, he has written several articles on Rabaul. I shall not weary honorable members with the whole of ,what this gentleman has written, but only select some portions to show what a great heritage we have, which might be utilized for the benefit of our returned men. </para>

                    <para>This morning I asked the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Webster),</inline> what was the reason for reducing the commission on the sale of postage stamps from 2-J per cent.&#34; to 1 per cent., and the reply was one which I do not think proved satisfactory to the House. The honorable gentleman told us that he desired to get Australia into line with the rest of the world. My own opinion is that, if we can &#34;go one better&#34; than, the rest of the world, we ought to do so, and set an example. Goodness knows, 2^ per cent, on the sale of anything is not a big profit - it certainly cannot be called profiteering. This decision to reduce the commission will affect country places very severely, for it is a difficult matter to persuade people to undertake the sale of postage stamps. It means that a shopkeeper may have to make anything from 20 to 300 trips per day to his counter in order to sell postage stamps; and, from the departmental point of view, the proposal of the Postmaster-General is not sound business. If the commission is reduced, it will result in increasing me cost of running the Department, as, I think, I can prove by a statement furnished from Ipswich, which is one of the principal cities in my electorate. It has been contended by the Department that the selling of stamps by stationers and others brings trade to their shops; and I have in my hand a record kept by a vendor of his transactions for a fortnight. The following are the figures: - </para>
                    <para class="block">These figures show that, in order to make a profit of 6d. per day, these vendors, if allowed a commission of only 1 per cent., would have to serve 600 customers per week. Speaking from memory, there&#39; are in the city about eight such vendors of stamps, and some remain open until 8 p.m. I venture to say that they will refuse to sell stamps on a commission of&#39; only 1 per cent. If they do, the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department will have to employ another counter-hand at the local post-office, and the salary payable to such an officer would far exceed what the Department would have to pay the vendors on a basis of a 2^ per cent, commission. If a man takes to the post-office a sheet of stamps which he has received in some business transaction, he does not get their full face value. The Department deducts 10 per cent. It considers that 1 per cent, is sufficient to allow vendors of stamps, but those who wish to sell stamps at the post-office have to submit to a deduction of 10 per cent. I want the Postmaster-General to review this matter with the object of ascertaining whether he is doing justice to. the people who purchase stamps, or to his own Department, by reducing the commission to the niggardly amount of 1 per cent. </para>
                    <para>There is one other matter to which I desire to- refer. Honorable members today have received a cartoon, which, no doubt, is very instructive. It bears no imprint, and I am thinking of reproducing it, and sending it out with some comments of my own. Whether I do so or not, I shall make a few comments upon it in this House. The cartoon is intended to represent the old Dairy Produce Pool, and the object of those responsible for its issue is to adversely criticise the proposed new scheme. It is hardly necessary for me to say that it has been issued by the agents - the persons who, according to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> &#34; farm the farmers.&#34; The position in regard to the old Dairy Produce Pool is that last year it exported butter to the value of &#163;5,159,472, at a cost, so far as the administration of the Pool is concerned, of &#163;9,882, or less than one-fifth of 1 per cent. Had there been no Pool in existence, this butter would have been exported through the ordinary channels .at a cost of 3 per cent. - the ordinary commission charged by agents. That would have amounted to &#163;154,784; so that, deducting the Pool&#39;s commission of one-fifth of 1 per cent.&#34;, we have succeeded in saving in interest - without hurting the consumers or any one else - &#163;144,902 in respect of one year&#39;s transaction. Another point is that when the Pool was first created, the proclaimed price of butter locally was 149s. 8d. per cwt., while the Imperial contract price was 1516. per cwt., plus one-half the profits made in London. Under that agreement, we received back from the Imperial Government &#163;19 per ton, or over &#163;575,399, and that amount was distributed amongst the producers&#39;, thus bringing up the price of butter exported to 170s. per cwt. I would ask the people of Australia to say whether, if the agents had bought this butter at 151s. per cwt., and on sending it to London had made a profit of 19s. per cwt., they  Would  have returned that profit to the producers ? In addition to the saving of commission, to which I have referred, the Pool, or &#34; the grab &#34; depicted in this cartoon, were able to return to the producers a sum of over &#163;575,399, representing one-half the profit made in London under the Imperial contract. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to refer to the speech made by the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> in regard to the cost- of the parliamentary refreshment rooms. I am convinced that his remarks  will convey to the public quite a wrong impression as to the actual position. Having been a member of the House Committee for a good many years. I &#39;challenged his statements; but, not having seen a balance-sheet recently, I was not prepared at the moment to give the exact figures as to the loss, if any, involved in conducting the refreshment and billiard rooms. I had a very fair idea, however, of the actual position, and felt assured that the statements made by the honorable member -were calculated to convey a wrong impression. Since then, I have refreshed my knowledge by a perusal of the balance-sheets. The balance-sheet -relating to the last financial year has not yet been audited, and, therefore, I shall not quote it. I shall refer only to the figures for the preceding year ; but I may say that the result in. respect of the last twelve months will be found to be very similar. The position is that no loss is involved in connexion with the refreshment and billiard rooms and the afternoon tea-rooms, which are available to members and their constituents. Every one knows that this is essentially a tea-drinking Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- It would be absurd to bring in wages costs, and to say that the parliamentary refreshment-rooms should be regarded in the light of an ordinary city refreshment-room, where three meals a day are served for six days in the week. We have to keep up a big staff of. waiters, and any loss sustained is not in respect of refreshments that are bought and paid for by members, but in relation to wages. There are no salaries involved. It is merely a matter of the wages of workmen engaged in connexion with the rooms. We have to maintain a staff to provide luncheon and dinner for a full House; but, as honorable members are aware, the rooms are not fully used, on the average, for more than two days a week, and even then they are used for approximately, only six months in the year! The full staff is not maintained during the recess, but a considerable proportion of it has to be retained during the whole, of the year. If we had to show a profit, after providing for wages, we should have to dismiss all the men engaged in connexion with the supply of meals, and close down, and honorable members would have to pick up a meal wherever they could obtain it in the city. </para>

                            <para>- No; I have no desire to be personal. There was practical unanimity in accepting the position. With the soaring of prices, the House Committee determined that honorable members who made use of the rooms upstairs should pay everything their refreshments cost. Honorable members have done so, and I understand that this year the profit will be very similar to that which was made last year. In the matter of the balance-sheet, and as regards the conduct of the rooms, we compare more than favorably with any other Parliament in the Commonwealth. Nobody has been keener than our House Committee in exercising economy. The only alternative to our present system would be to copy what is done in South&#39; Australia by allowing a caterer to take over the whole of the refreshment rooms. But in that case we should have to find the crockeryware, furniture, and services, and the caterer would merely find the provisions, making his profit out of them. I do not think we would be a penny better off. I am sure that the other members of the House Committee will join with me in saying that there is no waste, and that no item of expenditure could be eliminated. </para>

                        <para>. - To-day the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> drew attention to the profiteering that is rampant in this country. It is the most vital matter affecting the people of Australia to-day.. Every housewife knows that day and night the profiteers are robbing her. The evidence taken before the Inter-State Commission when they inquired into the cost of groceries has been in the hands of the Government for twelve months, but no effort has been made by Ministers to protect the public. The honorable member for New England (Lt.-Colonel Abbott) and other honorable members representing country constituencies will agree that the increased charge for kerosene and benzine is purely profiteering. </para>

The remedy that Free Traders suggest for  defeating  the operations of profiteers is to open our ports and deprive the local  manufacturers  of their local trade. They claim that in this way the public would get a cheaper commodity. But here is a case in which there is  absolute  Free Trade, and yet in no other commodity is the rural  community  being pillaged as it is being robbed  by  the Standard Oil Company and other oil firms in the matter of the price of  illuminants  and motor power. </para>

                    <para>A director of the Vacuum Oil Company, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hamilton,</inline> giving evidence before the New South Wales Commission on 30th December, 1915, swore that the profits during the last half-year on petroleum spirits, &#38;c., were less than they had ever been.&#34; The total profits for the company&#39;s financial year ending 30th November, 1915, were, in fact, over &#163;400,000, a sum much greater than the profits in any preceding year of which the record has been made available. When we examined <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hamilton</inline> on his statement to the New South Wales Commission, he attempted to justify it by saying that there had been a strike in New South Wales, and that the expense of handling goods in New South Wales is greater than in other States. &#39;He also said that he had in mind the cost of importation of goods then about to arrive or to be landed, although his evidence unmistakably related to a period then past. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hamilton</inline> had previously stated to the New South Wales Commission that he was unacquainted with the financial side of the company&#39;s business, and there is, in our opinion, no doubt that, with whatever intent his statement as to profits was made, the effect was to mislead the New South Wales Commission very seriously in a matter of prime importance. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is how one of our so-called honest, reputable traders purposely misled the New South Wales Necessary Commodities Commission in giving sworn evidence.

                    <para>The Commission viewed very seriously the applications made for increases of price, especially those of 1915 and 1916. During those years the company&#39;s turnover was equal to &#163;5,159,534. Out of the profit made it could have paid a dividend of 10 per cent., quite ample for any company during the war, and been able to reduce the sale price of its products by &#163;821,000, equal to 16 per cent. on its total turnover. </para>

                    <para>The company was supplying the public with necessary commodities; it was in a position almost of monopoly; and its disregard of the public interests in seeking increases of price, whilst still making excessive profits, amounts, in our opinion, to profiteering. </para>
                    <para>The company has stated that it ran a great many risks, especially with regard to the heavy freights which it was from time to time compelled to pay in order to keep up its stocks and supplies. In the opinion of the Commission, the company ran no risks against which it was not adequately insured by its large accumulated profits. At the end of 1914, these accumulated profits exceeded &#163;400,000. The company not only passed every risk on to the consumer, but was able, during 1915 and 1916, on a capital and reserves averaging &#163;1,500,000, to make a net profit of &#163;981,000. </para>
                    <para class="block">One method of dealing with these people is to follow the example of France, which, like other countries engaged in the war, now finds itself in a very serious financial position. Its Government is carrying out all the distribution of benzine and kerosene for the French people, and making the profits which the companies were previously making - </para>
                    <para>It is suggested that, unless the Vacuum Oil Company and the other companies who are now supplying the Commonwealth with kerosene and other oils, can be brought under some arrangement by which only a reasonable profit can be charged, the Commonwealth Government might consider the desirability of undertaking the purchase of, oils from the refining companies in America and the distribution in Australia, in order to save to the community the large profits now being made. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is my idea as well as the idea of the Inter-State Commission.

Instead of loosening their grip on the community these people are going to tighten it by bringing the oil supplies of the world into still fewer hands, and, God knows, they are in few enough hands now. Here is the proposition as recently published in the press: - </para>

                        <para>Some American bankers have purchased 750,000 shares of common stock of the Shell Transport and Trading Company, the largest petroleum concern which is interested in most of the oil-producing centres of the world. It occupies much the same position in England as docs the Standard Oil Company in America. The price paid is said to be about 25,000,000 dollars, and the shares involved are of British denomination, having a par value of &#163;1 and are worth in London to-day &#163;8 per share, which is equivalent to about 33 dollars in American currency. The Shell Transport and Trading Company&#39;s common stock outstanding amounts to &#163;12,000,000, and its joint operations resulted in a strong combination of interests in oil lands in the Far East, Russia, Roumania, Mexico, Venezuela, and other countries. According to a recent official statement, the Shell Company&#39;s cash resources amount to &#163;24,000,000; its annual disbursements to shareholders, from 1913-1018, were 35 per cent., and last year a60 per cent. stock dividend was paid. The tendency of the times seems to concentrate the control of petroleum more and more in a few hands, which is not in the interest of the consumers. </para>

Neither this nor any other Government should rest on their oars until they know that the best experts have been employed, and that the best men are working there. If the Government are not prepared to go ahead now, they should have been. They were warned, as every country was warned, to be ready for the aftermath of the war, and the situation that would arise when the soldiers were demobilized. In connexion with oil, however, we are almost as far back as we were seven or eight years ago.

A lot of profiteering is going on in that matter, and the users of these cures are paying many hundred per cent. over and above the real values. The Government would do well to take in hand that question, and the oil question, which is most serious, both to those who use oil as an illuminant and those who use it for motive power. Oil is going to play a very important part, not only now, but in the near future. Our vessels, both naval and mercantile, will be mostly propelled by oil power, and so will our industrial machinery. This is a great opportunity for the Government, if they and their supporters profess in the smallest degree to be friends of the rural producers, to benefit the farmers by pouncing upon what has been declared by the InterState Commission to be a monopoly, and rescuing the public of this country from the claws of the monopolists. </para>

                        <para>.- While agreeing with a great deal of what the honorable member for Maribyrnong (Mr.Fenton) has said, I still think it is time that honorable members opposite gave us a few suggestions as to how to cope with profiteering. Every member of the Committee desires to see the profiteer laid by the heels and treated as he should be, but we are a long time in getting at anything like a remedy. I do not think the Government are doing all they might do in the matter. It is time they got into closer touch with the State Governments. If a convention representing all phases&#39; of political thought in the community, and not necessarily comprised wholly of politicians, were called together, they could decide what changes were feasible and necessary in the Constitution. </para>

                    <para class="block">If that were done, I believe the States would be only too glad to cede to the Commonwealth the powers recommended. That is on the lines of the platform of the National Federation, and offers the quickest way of arriving at definite results. It would be far preferable to the Government bringing down proposals for a whole lot of referendums, or a very drastic referendum for constitutional changes. The State Parliaments would possibly fight them if they took the latter course, and the referendum might ask for much greater powers than are necessary for the work in hand. A convention such as I suggest would probably devise the right amendments to make in the Constitution in order to give this Parliament the power to deal with profiteering as it should be dealt with. </para>

                            <para>- Not at all. We are working under a Constitution, and I think the best friend of the Commonwealth, and. the States, too, is the man who will work according to his contract, and not attempt to grab from another agent, who is also working for the public, that which is not rightly within his grasp. If the Government proceed in the way I have suggested, they will get the powers they need, and very much more quickly than by means of a referendum. Suppose a referendum were taken without any arrangement with the State Parliaments, and the vote went against the Commonwealth? The whole question would then be put back for goodness knows how long; but if a convention were convened, and, the State Parliaments ceded the powers we asked for, the position would be entirely satisfactory. If we launch out without consulting those who ought to be consulted, and without having regard to the benefit of the people, we shall have only ourselves to blame if our proposal is not accepted. </para>

                    <para>The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has given some salutary and very good advice with regard to increasing production. We can only do that by all setting earnestly to work. There is no royal road to success. The same road that has always been trodden must be traversed. We must increase our production in order to meet our liabilities, and we must see that we get a proper return for the expenditure of our public money. We cannot afford to allow our latent minerals and oil resources to lie dormant for all time. If we do not display enterprise in this direction, I do not know where the Government will get the money required to meet all the claims that are pressing upon us. I am not satisfied with the action of the Government respecting the development of Australian oil-fields. Some years ago they entered into a contract with the Tasmanian Government to take 8,000 tons of oil per annum for naval purposes, but the Bill intended to enable the Government to do this failed to pass the Tasmanian Parliament, and when war came the Australian warships went to the other side of the world, where they did so much to uphold the honour of Australia. Subsequently, when the Commonwealth Government were approached to renew the contract, they declined to do so. Our Fleet is now back in Australian waters, and the Commonwealth Government are paying, I understand, more than &#163;6 per ton for oil fuel. The people interested in the proposition to which I refer are anxious to renew the contract, and are hopeful of being able to float a company if the Commonwealth Government will give them a contract for 8,000 tons of oil per annum at a reasonable price, &#163;4 10s. per ton being about the sum mentioned. This, of course, is considerably under the present price. I understand, also, that the oil now being used is no better, if, indeed, it is as good, for naval purposes as the Tasmanian product. The successful establishment of this company will lead to the employment&#39; of a large number of returned soldiers and other people in need of employment. We are only beginning to feel the pinch of our financial obligations. The worst, I believe, has yet to come. Our taxation burdens are not likely to be lessened, and, moreover, our resources are likely to be curtailed, because money which, in normal times, is used for the development of industries, is now required of the people for other purposes. I cannot understand why the Commonwealth Government do not give this company a little more encouragement. They appear to adopt a &#34; standoffish &#34; attitude towards this Australian industry; but I hope that I am mistaken, and that in a short time the Government will show that they are really interested in its development. I believe the Government will have to spend a tremendous amount of money in Papua before they get much of a return, though, if they strike good oil, they will soon&#39; get all their money back, and very much more, too. But, so far as I can learn, no oil suitable for naval purposes has ever been found in Papua. It is far too valuable for that. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and very fine fuel oil. I believe the user can get more out of the gallon for motive purposes than out of the oil which is ordinarily used, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade&#39;s</inline> estimate is correct, there is a big future for the Tasmanian shale proposition. I am speaking not only for the Tasmanian shale oil propositions, but for the entire oil resources of Australia. An earnest attempt should be made to exploit all our possibilities in this direction. We should see what stores of&#39; wealth are available to the Commonwealth, and develop them accordingly. Oil and the development of electric power are the lines of progress for the immediate future. I intend to hammer at this subject of our oil propositions until I get some satisfaction, and I hope it will not be long before the company to which I refer has an opportunity, of proving its ability to fulfil the contract it is asking for. The Commonwealth Government might enter into a tentative arrangement. They would soon be in a position to know if the company could complete the contract suggested. That would give the company some encouragement. It would know that if it could fulfil its contract the Commonwealth would take supplies from it.. </para>

                            <para>- The company to which I am referring has a good oil proposition, and is asking the Commonwealth to enter into a contract to buy oil. The Government should give the company some encouragement, but at present they are not prepared to enter into a contract until they are certain that the supplies will be forthcoming. I suppose that the reason for their hesitancy is that they fear that they may jeopardize oil supplies from other sources. I suggest that a tentative arrangement should be. made, and if the company is able to show within a reasonable time that it can supply the oil, a contract should&#39; be given. If, on the other hand, it is demonstrated that oil cannot be supplied from that quarter, the Commonwealth can cancel the arrangement, and get its supplies elsewhere. If the Government are really sympathetic, and desire to give latent industries the fillip they need, they will easily overcome a little difficulty such as presents itself in connexion with this case. </para>

                            <para>-The Tasmanian Government had a contract with the Commonwealth Government, but the Bill authorizing the former to deal with the shale was defeated in the Legislative Council. The Tasmanian Government applied to the Commonwealth for a renewal of the contract, but that was refused on the ground that our Fleet had left Australian waters. Now the Fleet is back in home waters, and the Department is paying over &#163;6 per ton for oil. The Tasmanian company is prepared to supply oil, of perhaps superior quality, at a lower price. </para>

                            <para>- Then, why not enter into a tentative arrangement? At present the Commonwealth Government are buying oil, not at a contract price, but in quantities as it is needed, and are paying the  World&#39;s  price, which is very high. In Tasmania there is a chance of developing an industry which would provide  work  for a great many returned soldiers and others, and if it proves to be the permanent proposition that geologists predict, it will be not only a big asset in itself, but the foundation of other industries, which will add to the general wealth of the community. </para>

I have visited the Blythe River iron ore field, which struck me as being an immense proposition; but, as to how much iron there is there, and its quality, I am not prepared to pronounce an opinion. The point is that the experts who have made investigations on behalf of the Commonwealth, have not reported favorably, and the Commonwealth Government has surrendered its option. </para>

                            <para>-That may or may not be the case. I know that the deposit was inspected quite a number of years ago by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Darby,</inline> who had been sent out from England by interested parties, at rather considerable expense. He reported that the field contained a very extensive deposit of best quality iron. He, at any rate, was well satisfied. The Commonwealth, however, has been advised otherwise, and has given up its option. The Commonwealth authorities appear to be anxious to secure iron. That being so, I call their attention to a deposit at Ilfracombe, near Beaconsfield, in the neighbourhood of the Tamar. There is said to be a great quantity of good iron in that neighbourhood. Commonwealth representatives can take up a lease from the Tasmanian Government, and, at very little expense, can ascertain whether the deposit is worth while. If they are not satisfied with that field, there is still another large iron deposit in a different part  of  my electorate for which it is claimed that the quality is excellent. It is asserted, also, that there are still further valuable deposits in parts of the west coast of Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>.- If what is in the mind of the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Page)</inline> is correct, namely, that there is to be a general election at no distant date, then it is only natural that every honorable member should seize the opportunity to tell his constituents what he thinks of the past actions of the Government, and of their proposals for the future. If we are to go before our constituents very shortly, and are to be judged by the sins of omission and commission of which the Government are guilty, I cannot help feeling that there is a hot time ahead for those who have supported the present Administration upon those issues which have loomed so large in the public mind in recent months. It maybe remarked that I am in the happy position of representing a constituency in which there is very little to fear. I hope such is the case, at any rate; but, apart from that, I care not whether it is considered necessary, in the interests of the proper government of the Commonwealth, that a mandate  should be obtained from the people. . If a mandate is necessary, it does not appeal to me that it must be secured at the earliest possible opportunity. Personally, I cannot see any reason for the Government desiring to obtain a mandate. Matters have not so vitally altered since the present Government took office. The people have more than once, since then, expressed themselves upon what should be the duty of the Government in respect to outstanding Australian affairs to-day. We have fought and won the war. We have paid tribute to those who fought and won. We have given credit to the full. Adulation has been unstinted. </para>

He holds the best interests of Australia as deeply at heart as does any other person who could have been sent to the Old Country to endeavour to do the work which he has done. He has conscientiously performed his duties in the way which appeared to him. to be best, as a true and loyal Australian who has. always placed Australia first. </para>

                    <para>I commend the Prime Minister for having kept a stiff upper -lip when- it came to talking about and defending that Australian ideal, which is so near and dear to the hearts of all of us, and which means so much to our national development, namely, the maintenance of a White Australia. If the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Webster)</inline> were present, I would offer a suggestion which has a bearing upon our White Australia ideal. Without any disrespect to our Sovereign, King George V., I suggest, in view of the fact that the maintenance of a White Australia is so vital to Australians, that we revert to that good Australian symbol which formerly appeared upon bur postage stamps, namely, the figure of a kangaroo on a white Australia. I merely make that suggestion by the way, and I hope it will be remembered by the Postmaster-General, to whose poetical mind it must appeal with all its patriotic significance. </para>
                    <para>I desire to compliment the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> on his speech to-day, which is one of the best that has been delivered in this House. It dealt with a question which the Government have to face, and to answer. The Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Register</inline> denies that there has been any profiteering,- and asks where it can be found; but we all know the enhanced prices we have to pay to-day, and it is useless to requote figures on the subject. The honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> gave us figures which are the result of investigations made by the Inter-State Commission ; and if no action is to be taken on the report, why was the Commission ever appointed? The newspapers- to-day rightly condemn the Government and Parliament for not putting a check on the expenditure of the Commonwealth. We have had commissions of inquiry into what were sometimes really silly matters ; for instance, the Com-&#39; mission appointed by the Senate to inquire into the effect of drink on our troops represented an absolute waste of money. As I have said, we all know from practical, personal experience- that there is profiteering in groceries, clothes, house rents, and so forth, and the fact is made clear, not only by such statements as those of the honorable member for Hunter, but in the bi-monthly reports issued by Mr: Knibbs. From these we learn that the cost of living has gone up by 50 or 60 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- That argument does not appeal to me, and I do not think our standard of living should be gauged by the English standard. I am sure that the honorable member would not like the valour, physique, and accomplishments of our soldiers at Gallipoli and in France to be measured by those of the British soldier. The Prime Minister (Mr.&#39; Hughes) yesterday focussed our minds on a big rout of the Britishers, and then drew attention to the handful of Australians who went through the Britishers, and held up the hordes of Huns. The policy of conscription in England revealed an appalling percentage of unfit men amongst the 2,000,000 of conscripted  troops ; and I can only hope that . the English standard will never be our standard. </para>

                            <para>- To whatever the honorable member may refer, it is hardly fair that the Australian should be placed in the position of the bootmaker who makes good boots, but himself wears the worst. Some method should be devised whereby the people of Australia shall enjoy that prosperity which is their due, and not be compelled in the midst of plenty to pay exorbitant prices for all they require. I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine say that the farmer, if need be, must make sacrifices, even to the point of putting a fire stick into his standing crop instead of harvesting it. We were led to believe that the war period would mean a time of travail to Australia and its inhabitants generally, and that production during that period would seriously decline. The with&#39;drawal from industry of 400,000 men for the fighting line, alone, not to mention, those who formed contributory arteries to it, naturally involved some measure of sacrifice. Let me ask why the people of Australia should be bled in the way that they have been ? Many persons have submitted to it under the impression that the war was responsible for it. Only a few nights ago I happened to pick up a back number of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> which was published during the early days of the war, and in it I read an interjection by the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)</inline> to the effect that there were contractors making huge fortunes out of the war. Yet the Commonwealth is going to pay 5J per cent, upon borrowed money, which is to be expended in helping the &#34;digger,&#34; and the Government have the audacity to print a poster depicting a &#34;digger&#34; with the brass badge upon, his coat and. with his hand . in his pocket to finish the job. Quite&#39; recently the <inline font-style="italic">South Australian Register,</inline> in an article caning the Labour party generally, and the Bolsheviks in particular, said that the present loan would prove a great success. It affirmed that the money required would be subscribed. Of course, it will. I recollect reading an article written by the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming)</inline> before he left for the war - an article which was published in the newspapers of all the States - in which he stressed what &#187; gilt-edged security was the 4J per cent, war loan which was then being floated. He said that he was going to put his money into it. </para>

In reply to the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming)</inline> I say that if I owned those deposits they certainly would mean that I would be safe from want for all time. For all practical purposes in regard to the financing of the Commonwealth they can be used. If not, there is a Compulsory Loan Bill before Parliament which contains the means for enforcing contributions to the Peace Loan if that course should be deemed necessary The honorable member for Robertson knows perfectly well that, in the words of the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey),</inline> the question of finance is one of financial legerdemain. The <inline font-style="italic">South Australian Register,</inline> in backing up its statement that the loan will be subscribed, quotes the increase of &#163;102,000,000 in the trading banks deposits.

There is a gentleman engaged in writing for the former journal who was at one time chairman of the Chamber of Commerce. His name is Arnold Davey, and quite recently, in speaking generally of the war debt of the world, he stated that it amounted to &#163;40,000,000,000. </para>

I told the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> some time ago that for a smaller wool clip the wool-growers of Australia were receiving&#163;2,500,000 more than they had previously received. In reply, the Minister pointed to the Wartime Profits Tax Act. I looked up that measure, and was interested in ascertaining the precise amount of revenue collected under it. I found that in 1917- 1918 the amount thus collected was &#163;680,008 from all sources. </para>

                    <para>The suggestion that the inflated currency is responsible for the increase in prices means that profiteers have been fastening on to the general body of the people, including our soldiers and their dependants. We have had more money in circulation, because of the fact that our men who went to the Front made provision for their dependants, and a separation allowance was also granted. Because of the inflation of the currency in this way, the cormorant of capitalism has come down and stuck its talons deeper than ever into the people. . <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> shows that the increase in rentals and the cost of food since 1914 is between 50 and 60 per cent., whereas the increase in wages amounts to only 26 per cent. In other words, Mr. Big-vested-interests &#39; &#39; has increased his income to the extent of between 50 and 60 per cent. by exacting increased prices from the general community, merely because, in the matter of wages, they are a little better off than they were a few years ago. Honorable members opposite will have to show the people why it is harder to keep the wolf from the door than it was before we had an inflated currency We should have done better had we refrained from borrowing to finance the war. I regret that I did not follow the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey),</inline> when he moved as an alternative to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher&#39;s</inline> first war loan proposal that we should obtain a credit or &#163;20,000,000, as was done in Great Britain. As it is, the Government has been juggling with the credit of the capitalist for the benefit of the capitalist. The Government and their supporters may try to bulldoze the people, but they will find it difficult to do so. They have a knowledge of what is going on. They take an interest in the affairs of this country, and the time is coming when they will demand to know the reason why we have to pay 5&#189; per cent. on money borrowed to repatriate our men. I am watching very carefully for the first member of the Ministerial party to enter the chamber wearing a celluloid war loan button.
