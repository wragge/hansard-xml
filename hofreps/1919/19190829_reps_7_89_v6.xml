                    <para>That the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of&#39; Australia expresses its sorrow at the loss which has befallen the British Empire in general; and the Union of South Africa in particular, by the death of the Right Honorable the Prime Minister of the Union, General Louis Botha, patriot, soldier, statesman, and empire-builder, and extends its sympathy to the people of the sister Dominion. </para>

                <para class="block">A feeling of sincere and profound sorrow will prevail throughout the Empire today upon the news of the passing away of the great Prime Minister of the South African Union. In no portion of the Empire will that feeling be more deeply experienced than in the Commonwealth of Australia. We are conscious that the Empire has sustained an irreparable loss in the death of one who will ever be honored as patriot, statesman, soldier, and nation-builder. His personal characteristics endeared him to his own people; his courage, determination, high principle, and magnetic personality, inspiring confidence, marked him out early as a leader of men. His manly, courageous bearing, his noble sense of chivalry, commanded admiration and respect from his foes. </para>
                <para>Our hearts go out in sympathy to the people of the sister Dominion. For them, he has. truly been a nation-builder. In a country which suffered through the devastations of war, he stood steadily fox unity  and peace; and in the government of mixed traces, for toleration and forgiveness. He strove to mould the life of his country on sound national and democratic lines. It is gratifying that he lived to see the high national status that the Dominions had achieved at the close of the war, and that his signature, on behalf of the Union, was on what is probably the most important document in history. </para>

                    great services to the Empire are not yet fully realized. The mind goes back to that evening at Pretoria when the Peace Treaty of Vereeniging was sighed. After the signature, Lord Kitchener rose and held out his hand, saying to General Botha, &#34;We are good friends now.&#34; That hand-clasp meant much to the British Empire, It was the beginning of the drawing-together of the races in feelings of true friendship, and real union.
                </para>
                <para>General Botha fully appreciated the principles of equity, justice, and freedom upon which the Empire was based.  His  advocacy of its cause and his personal leadership in the recent war have been an inspiration to all portions of the King&#39;s Dominions. As Prime Minister of a great Dominion of that Empire, he has shown himself to be the soul of honour. </para>
                <para>To-day we mournourloss,and desire to place our appreciation of his life work permanently upon the records of this House. A personality conspicuous among the great personalities of our time has passed away. The abiding influence of his character and work will remain. May we say or him, as he said of the late Cecil Rhodes, &#34;The heart in reverence bows to the silent prayer that what was greatest and noblest in Louis Botha may remain a living influence in the country he loved so well,&#34; and we may sincerely add,&#34;and in the (Empire which he fought so bravely and unselfishly to preserve.&#34; </para>

                    <para>. -I second the motion. Unhappily, during the last f ew months death has visited the homes of many of those who are near and dear to us. We all read last night with feelings of profound regret of the death of the Prime Minister of the sister Dominion of South Africa, General Louis Botha, and the news must have come as a shock to the people of the Empire. Doubtless in South Africa, as in Australia and other parts of the Empire, the extraordinary strain imposed upon its statesmen by reason of the abnormal position with which they have had to deal, has led to a deterioration of their fibre, and made them less able to withstand successfully many of the ills that beset us. </para>

                <para>We sincerely sympathize, quite irrespective of party, with those who have thus been bereaved. We are all familiar with the life of General Botha. It is not many years since be took part in a war which many believed to be wrong, while others considered it to be justifiable, but he showed on emerging from it that he was prepared to do everything within his power to bury the ill-feeling that had been created by that unfortunate conflict. In company with the people of the sister Dominion, South Africa, we mourn his loss to-day. </para>

                        <para>-  On the point of order, sir, it will be remembered that the  Chairman  of Committees having called upon the honorable member for Barrier to withdraw the statement made by him, the circumstances under which that request was made were not, and could not, at the time, be made the subject of debate. The  Chairman  of Committees declined to hear honorable members on the question. The honorable member for Barrier having been named, that fact was reported to the House, and he was thereupon suspended from its service. I submit, with great respect to you, sir, that the action of the  Chairman  of Committees must in some way be cognisable by the House. I do not know how it would be possible to take action in regard to it other than by dealing with it as a matter of privilege. If honorable members think, as I do, that the action of the  Chairman  of Committees was a flagrant abuse of his position and power, and showed, as I think it did, partisanship and a tyrannous spirit, them surely it is open to an honorable member to bring before you and the House in some Way- </para>

                        <para>-  Surely I have a right to speak. I understand the natural desire of honorable members opposite to cloak this matter, hut we must have power to refer to it by virtue of some standing order. I put it as a point of order, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that this course of conduct having been pursued by the  Chairman  of Committees, and not having been debatable  by the Committee or, later, in the House itself, until the honorable member had been suspended from its service, it follows that now, on the re-assembling of the House, with you in the chair, it is open to any honorable member to say that the  Chairman  of Committees not only abused his position, but invaded the rights of honorable members. </para>

                        <para>- As already stated by me, the proceedings of a Committee of the whole are governed by the Committee, and questions arising out of such proceedings cannot be dealt with by the House except upon report. If any question of order concerning proceedings in Committee was involved, it should have been raised at the time in Committee. No question of privilege can arise out of action taken &#39;by the  Chairman  of Committees in .carrying out the Standing Orders. The Committee of the whole, having carried a certain resolution, thereby indorsed the action of the  Chairman.  The  Chairman  reported the matter to the House, which in turn indorsed the action of the Committee. These proceedings, having been taken. in accordance with the Standing Orders, cannot afterwards be made the subject of a question of privilege. Whether the  Chairman  was right or wrong is a question which cannot now be debated, since the Committee first, and the House afterwards, decided the matter by a vote which cannot be reflected on unless on a motion for its rescission in the regular way as provided for in the Standing Orders. A question of order can only arise at the time of the occurrence to which it relates. </para>

Yesterday was the third occasion on which the honorable member for Barrier has been suspended, and, therefore, his suspension on this occasion is for one month. But I suggest that the Standing Orders were framed on the understanding that the sessions of this House would be annual. In view of the fact that owing to the war the session has extended, and apparently will extend, throughout the whole life of the Parliament, I ask whether there is any possibility of leniency being shown to the honorable member? </para>

                        <para>The second amendment of the principal Act for which this Bill provides deals with certain positions in the Public Service, in respect of which it is not considered desirable to have competitive examinations. It is hardly fair, for instance, that cleaners, who have been in the temporary service for some time, and have given satisfaction, should be required to undergo an examination in order to become permanent officers in the General. Division. It is proposed to specify certain classes of these servants, and to enable them to be appointed without being submitted to a competitive examination. </para>

With that I entirely concur; but as Admiral Viscount Jellicoe visited and inspected the Randwick Wireless Works, formerly owned by the late Father Shaw, I ask the Acting Minister for the Navy whether that portion of the Admiral&#39;s report is secret, and, if not, whether it can be laid upon the table of the House? </para>

                    <para>-I desire to make a personal explanation. A few days ago I taskedtheMinister representing the Minister for Defence a question in regard to the wives of soldiers who have been married in England. I inquired whether any special privileges had been granted to them in regard to their passage to Australia, and also whether any concessions had been made to the sisters-in-law of soldiers who had married overseas. From the answer which I received the impression may be given that I am in favour of these sisters-in-law receiving special treatment. </para>

                <para>I am asked &#34;Why not ? &#34; I do not desire to incur the hostility of quite a number of unmarried ladies in the Commonwealth. There are a few in my own electorate, and it is just possible that the impression may get abroad that I asked the question, to which I allude, because I am in favour of special concessions being granted to the sisters-in-law of soldiers. That is not so. We are told that in Melbourne and suburbs alone there are 20,000 eligible unmarried women in excess of the number df unmarried eligible men, whilst for the Commonwealth there is an excess of more than 100,000 unmarried eligible women.I did not ask the question with a view to increasing the immigration of unmarried women. </para>

                    <para>- I ask the Acting Leader of the House (Mr.Groom) whether he has made himself familiar, in a general way, with the results of the municipal elections which took place in Victoria yesterday, and which he will find recorded upon the back page of some of our morning newspapers. If he has done so, and if he has marked the success of the Labour party at those elections, will he accept that as a broad hint to the Government- </para>

Most of the questions asked without notice have dealt with matters which are not of such urgency as to warrant the taking up of time in asking or answering them without notice. Questions which are not urgent should be placed upon the business paper. The honorable member&#39;s question, however, has nothing whatever to do with the business of the House, and relates to matters outside the cognisance of Ministers. </para>

                        <para>- The Commonwealth has already undertaken -to advance to the States funds to enable them to proceed with re-afforestation, providing returned soldiers are employed on the work. Seventy-five per cent, of the money advanced is by way of loan, and the remaining 25 per cent, as a gift, in consideration of the inefficiency of the nien in this class of employment. In addition to this, the Commonwealth provides each man sent to employment with the necessary personal equipment, and also pays the cost of his transport to the place of employment.

                    <para>Victoria, Western Australia, and Tasmania have taken advantage of this offer, but there is a manifest disinclination on the part of the men to accept this class of employment. The Commonwealth has also arranged to advance to the States from &#163;30,000,000 to &#163;40,000,000 to enable them to make land &#39;available for soldier-settlement, and for the construction of necessary public works, such as railways, bridges, &#38;c, for their successful occupation, returned soldiers to be given preference of employment. The funds are advanced at the rate at which it cost the Commonwealth to borrow, less a rebate of &#163;25,000 interest on each &#163;1,000,000 borrowed, in respect of the States making advances to the soldiers at cheap rates of interest. It is anticipated that the works covered by these proposals will soon be in hand, and, in consequence, additional avenues of employment will be available for returned men. In addition, &#39; the Commonwealth has offered to loam to the States at favorable rates of interest, to be in turn .advanced to local government bodies, funds to enable the latter to proceed with local government works, provided returned soldiers are employed as far as possible in the undertakings. So far no definite proposals have been received from any of the States except Queensland. </para>

                        <para>- I am not dealing with that subject now, although instinct dictates what the answer should be. The matter, which has received consideration from time to time at the instance of the honorable member, was fully discussed at the conference of electoral officers in 1915, and a form of claim suitable for joint enrolment was then drawn up. It was of the size now in force, 6&#188; in. by 4 in., as suitable for postal and index purposes, as well as ordinary electoral purposes.I am also informed that it is a good thing to have the signature on both sides, because sometimes the particulars on one side of the card are filled up for the applicant by other persons. The signature will be a great help for verification purposes. </para>

                        <para>. - I welcome the introduction of a Customs Bill, or anything pertaining to the Tariff. The introduction of a new Tariff is a long-deferred promise, but I recognise that the delay has been caused by the exigencies of war time. Still, as I suggested earlier in the session, the Government could have, by a single clause, given complete protection to Australia by a measure adopting <inline font-style="italic">inglobo</inline> the whole of the Tariff of the two most up-to-date nations in the world so far as fiscal matters are concerned. I refer to the United States of America and Japan. When the Tariff is brought on I shall be as limited in my remarks as my duty will permit me to be, because it is the desire of the House to push this matter along at every opportunity and have it completed before the next election. </para>

                    <para>I shall endeavour now to sound a note which I hope will find an echo in the breasts of many Honorable members. So far as I know, it is a new proposal. I do not think it has ever been mentioned in any Parliament in the world. Honorable members will agree that the crystallized thought of the greatest statesmen nowadays tends to the conclusion that, in order to eliminate the curse of murder which men call war, secret treaties should be abolished. There is nothing so irritating throughout the length and breadth of Australia as the greatly increased prices of goods and commodities, generally referred to as profiteering. The proposal I wish to put before the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> and the House is that, if it is right to abolish secret treaties in order to eliminate war; it is right to abolish the secrecy of the Customs House, so that citizens may know the value upon which the importers pay duty on goods brought into this country. Pianos at one time were landed in Australia for something like &#163;17. </para>

                            <para>- The one I have in my mind was sold to the public for &#163;45. If any one for a fee of sixpence could go to the Customs Department and see the landed price of pianos, the people would be given a certain amount of protection against retailers, who charge them profits amounting to 200, or 300, and even as much as 400, per cent. Alternatively, the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth of Australia Gazette</inline> could be made a much more useful document than it is to-day. It is very rarely that any one reads it, and I never yet met a man who read it from cover to cover. If he did, I would take it as a symptom of lunacy on his part. We would like to know the cost of many goods on which import duty is paid, and that knowledge would cause the Australian public to keep a keen eye upon retail prices when they went above a figure that would allow a just profit to be made. The Government of the day might then feel called on to issue a proclamation according to law, enacting that for the welfare of the public only a certain rate of profit should be allowed. What would happen if the Government, by proclamation, determined that the piano I mentioned should not be sold at a net profit of more than 50 per cent. over landed cost? This would immediately stop all that interchange of commodities between individuals which does not bring the article any nearer to the consumer. I believe that wheat has been sold more than once in wholesale transactions, and we have been told that certain imports have changed hands no less than eleven times, the selling price to the public being increased with every sale.I ascertained by the translation of the chief adviser of the Japanese Consul in Melbourne that matches were made in Japan and  exported  at less than1d. per gross - that is, 144 boxes full of matches ! In London, to make a gross of match boxes, without the matches, women and children used to be sweated and had to find their own fire and paste. No protective duty is worth a snap of the fingers against such a low cost of production as I have just mentioned. It indicates to me that the article should be a Government monopoly. That is the only means of fixing a Trust or Combine, which has its headquarters outside the confines of our territory. </para>

                    <para>Every one to whom I have made this suggestion indorses my belief that to give publicity to the landed cost of articles in Australia would be a great preventive of unjust increases in prices. What is the use even of 1,000 per cent. duty in the  instance I have given ? What hope have we, with our higher ideals and higher wages and improved factory conditions, of competing against an industry of the kind to which I have referred? Every one recognises that no country in the world has increased the wages to its workers to the extent to which Japan has done lately. The advance has been really phenomenal, and the employees in many of the Japanese trades and callings are receiving more now per day than they received for a whole week&#39;s work when I visited Japan. In those times male country workers could be obtained for about 50s. per year, and females for about 30s. per year. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad my honorable friend agrees with me. I look upon Japan as possibly the first co-operative Commonwealth the world will see. I do not know any other country which has so many nationalized industries. It is the only country that has beaten the American Tobacco Combine, and it did so by using its Customs Department. Japan offered the American Combine on two occasions to purchase their business and pay for their good-will. The Combine refused, knowing that in America they were backed up by all the other Combines. They had brought the Japanese palate to like the cigarettes which they were supplying, and they were very haughty and amused at the idea of Japan taking their business from them, seeing that in the meantime they had conquered England. The Japanese Government imposed a duty of 50 per cent. The Combine still laughed. Next year the duty was increased to 100 per cent. When it reached 150 per cent. the Combine approached the Japanese Government with a request that they should enter into negotiations. The Government refused, reminding them that they had previously made two fair offers which had been turned down. Next year the dutv rose to 250 per cent. This meant that cigars landed in Japan at &#163;10 per 1,000 f.o.b. would cost the Combine &#163;35, as against a cost to the Japanese Government of &#163;10 plus landing charges and freightage. Even the American Combine could not stand that. When they found that the Japanese Government would not purchase their business, they gave up Japan and had all the rest of the world at their feet. The Japanese Government then obtained all their buildings and machinery, which it would not pay them to remove, for a mere song. Japan was not content with that, because I find from Kelly&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Customs Tariffs of the World</inline> that the duty in Japan on all tobaccos, other than chewing tobacco and snuff, is 355 per cent. Cigarettes manufactured by cheap. Japanese labour, and equal to any made anywhere else in the world, can be bought there at the rate of twenty-five for 2d. </para>

                    <para>As Japan was able to combat successfully one of the strongest Combines in the world, we also should be able to defeat the Trusts and Rings. I am reiterating what is really an old suggestion on my part . I commenced my political career by advocating the nationalization of &#34; lights, smokes, and drinks.&#34; France has made &#163;1,000,000 out of the nationalization of matches alone, and the movement has met with the satisfaction of the French people. </para>
                    <para>A point that I wish to stress is that we should do away with the secrecy of the Customs House. Let the citizens of Australia know what is the bedrock price at which goods consumed by them are imported. If that were done, a succeeding Government might see, in its wisdom, a chance to prevent the exploitation of the people in so far as imported commodities were concerned. It would be easy for the Department to garner the details relating to a particular industry, showing what would be a fair value to fix for its products. Then, by means of a referendum, the people might be asked to determine what would be a fair selling price, making due allowance for a reasonable profit. </para>
                    <para>The Minister should be able to do something to put down the infernal profiteering  that is going on. There are many difficulties in dealing with the profiteer; but I think there is a way out. If the Government think there is not, then they should tell the people, and let them appoint others who will find a means of dealing with such individuals. </para>

                        <para>- I recognise that this is largely a machinery Bill, designed to provide by Statute law for much that is now dealt with by regulations. In these circumstances, I shall delay the House for only a few minutes. I rise particularly to draw attention to a clause in the Bill, which provides that the value of goods on which duty shall be collected shall be the fair market value in the country of origin. This provision is likely to have a bad effect on the commercial world of Australia. It is calculated to penalize men who are and have always been anxious to do the right thing in connexion with the importation of goods. I learn that the practice for which this clause provides has given rise to a great deal of friction between importers and the Department of Trade and Customs, and that many importers have been inconvenienced, and, in some instances, quite unintentionally, no doubt; penalized, by the Department. I understand that duty may be collected either on the f.o.b. invoice value plus 10 per cent., or on the fair market value of the goods concerned in the country of origin. I would point out, however, that an importer might purchase goods at a certain price, and find it impossible for some time to secure their shipment to Australia. In the meantime the value of such goods in the country of origin might considerably increase, with the result that, under this Bill, he would be charged duty on the higher price, and not on the f .o.b. value. Such a man might have entered into a contract, as an indentor, for the supply of such goods at a certain price, and in this way he would be very seriously inconvenienced. Again, goods might be purchased in New York at a certain price, and while they were held up owing to shipping difficulties, there might be a considerable fall in their value there. A competitor coming in and purchasing at the reduced price, and able to get his goods away as soon as the first purchaser, would thus have an unfair ad vantage; since he would only have to pay duty  on  the lower value. </para>

                    <para>I ask the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> to try to devise some  other  means of getting at the dumper. I have the utmost contempt for any man who tries to evade the payment of duty rightly chargeable to him, and would make such an evasion a penal offence. But I would urge that it should be sufficient to provide for duty being collected on the invoice valuef.o.b. plus 10 per cent. It should be possible for the Department in. some other way to deal with the unscrupulous trader, whom nobody desires to protect. </para>
                    <para>Mr.FINLAYSON. (Brisbane) &#91;12.8&#93;. - While in Brisbane last week I had an interview with the Chamber of Commerce, and had brought under my notice very pointedly the matter to which reference has just been made by the honorable member forDenison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith).</inline> I have been waiting this opportunity to point out what I think is the gross injustice done to the trading community of Australia by section 154 of the principal Act, as proposed to be amended by this Bill. Whereas the genuine invoice value plus 10 per cent. has hitherto been accepted as the correct value for duty - and every effort is made by the Department to insure that the invoice value so declared is correct - it is now proposed to adopt a new system whereby the value for duty will be the value, at the time of shipment, provided that it is not less than the invoice value. </para>

                    <para>Those who know anything of business, must be well aware that orders are booked in other countries months, and in some cases years, ahead of the date of shipment to Australia. Recently shipping conditions have been abnormal, and goods have been piled up in Great Britain, America, and other countries awaiting opportunities for shipment to Australia, According to the Minister&#39;s statement it is now proposed to make it quite clear in this Bill that duty is to be levied on the value of all goods at the time of shipment. Let us consider for a moment what might be the position in regard to a contract entered into by an engineering firm: Obviously months, or even a year or two, might elapse before the goods forming the subject of that contract could be delivered. </para>

                            <para>- I have already mentioned that. The Customs Department takes good care that the higher value shall always be the value for duty. That, I think, is perfectly fair. I am pointing out, however, that after goods have been ordered at a price agreed upon the value of those goods might rise very considerably owing to current shipping delays before they could be shipped to Australia. In such a case the purchaser would be penalized to the extent of the additional duty payable on the increased price. </para>

                            <para>- That has nothing whatever to do with the question. If any passing on is going to be done, it will apply not only to the duty but to everything else. The question of profiteering does not affect this matter in the slightest degree. The provision to which I object simply means that in placing orders and incurring liabilities abroad, the trading community of Australia, and the general public in proportion, are going to be penalized because of artificial increases and changes that may take place in the price of goods as between the date of purchase and the date of shipment. If conditions were normal, and shipping was available without serious interruption, the risk would be comparatively small. </para>

                            <para>-In any case, I openly admit that if shipping were normal the risk under this Bill would not be so bad. But I do not think that the policy that is proposed is honest and proper. After all, we must rely to a very large extent upon firms in this country anticipating a demand for goods, and placing their orders in other countries at such a period in advance of local requirements as to insure that we shall have trade flowing backwards and forwards. Under this Bill they will be compelled to take a risk between the time the goods are purchased abroad and the time of their shipment. That, I think, is unfair, and harasses and interrupts legitimate trade. </para>

                            <para>- My own experience, when I was in business, was that it was very difficult to ascertain what the Customs Department required. I was desirous of doing the right thing. I had no wish to take advantage of the Department, but I was always treated as if I had some ulterior motive and was seeking to rob the Government. However, the Customs Department take every precaution to protect the revenue, because even the most reputable firms are likely to make mistakes, but this proposed alteration, whether or not it be to meet an interpretation of the law by the High Court, is causing considerable perturbation in the minds of importers in this country and manufacturers and exporters abroad. </para>

But the trade of the world is so nervous that the more restrictions we place upon it the more disturbing is the effect on. the general public. If a firm is compelled to place abroad an order for machinery or softgoods months or years ahead of delivery, and has to take the risk between the date of purchase- and the time of shipment, it must; cover itself by an additional margin of profit. </para>

                            <para>- The duty is always paid by the public. The merchants in fixing the wholesale distributing price must on entering into contracts with their customers for the delivery of the goods add an additional margin of 10, 15; or 20 per cent. to cover the risk they take between the dates of purchase and shipment. Therefore the Australian public will be penalized. </para>

                            <para>- I know that they are gone now, but if we substitute other restrictions such as the Bill proposes, we shall hinder and not help trade. It is quite obvious that the trade of the world will develop along lines different from those that were followed before the war. New avenues and, channels of trade must be developed, and we in Australia must operate along them in order to maintain our trading relations with other parts of the world. I think we should develop the most friendly commercial relations with America. Our mutual interest in the Pacific justifies us in having close reciprocal trading relations with New Zealand, Canada, and America. International disturbances often arise as the result of commercial antagonisms, and as I believe the principal theatre of international trouble in future will be the Pacific, we should cultivate the most kindly commercial relations with the nations that share with us the interest in that ocean. For that reason anything that can be done to promote trade between Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States of America will be altogether to our advantage. If it be true that the clause I am referring to is aimed at the United States I am afraid it will have the effect of hindering instead of helping trade with that country. </para>

                            <para>- I am merely pointing out what will cause difficulties in our commercial relationship. I am convinced, after consultation with the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce, that we are causing unwarrantable risk and interference, and that no good purpose will be served, by insisting that the increased price, as between the time of purchase and the date of shipment, should be liable to duty. The price which an importer pays for goods is the amount on which duty should be collected, and the Customs Department should be content with such duty. So long as the Government have reasonable security that the invoice price is genuine that is quite sufficient for all useful and necessary purposes. </para>

                    <para>Mr.BOYD (Henty) &#91;12.28&#93;.- I indorse many of the remarks of the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson)</inline> in regard to the clause he particularly dealt with. The principle it contains has operated in the Customs Department in two different ways. When the war broke out and prices were rising the Department did not accept the invoice value of goods. The original Act gives to the Customs authorities power to load the invoice price in order to bring it up to the value existing in the exporting country at the time of shipment. For instance, if a man bought a ton of iron at &#163;20, and before the iron arrived in Australia the price at the port of shipment had risen to &#163;30, the Department added &#163;10 to the price shown on the invoice, making the invoice value the normal price at the port of shipment when the goods arrived in Australia. A deputation to the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> pointed out that the Act provided that duty should be payable on the invoice value. The Department replied, in effect, &#34; We are entitled to get duty on the full value of the goods. When prices begin to fall, the importer will get the benefit of a refund, because the goods will be priced at &#163;30 in the invoice; but if the price at the port of shipment at the time when the goods arrive has fallen to &#163;20, only on that value will duty be collected.&#34; That promise was made by the Minister </para>

So far I have not interrupted honorable members, but unquestionably that tendency obtains at the present time. I would remind the House that the clauses of a Bill should be discussed in Committee and only its general principles should be debated upon the motion for its second reading. </para>

                            <para>- The principle which was observed in the Customs Department of charging duty upon the full value of goods as set out in the original invoice, plus any increase which may have taken place in the country of shipment, operated until a deputation waited upon the Ministerial head of thatDepartment. An interjection by the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Foster)</inline> prompted me to ask the Ministerwhen the Department promised that, when prices began to fall, duty would not be charged on the invoiced prices of goods, if those prices were higher than the value of the goods at the time at their port of shipment. I do not know the precise date upon which that promise was made, but I do know that the Customs Department is acting on that principle to-day. </para>

It followed that course in pursuance of the promise which was made, and I say that it is a perfectly equitable course. But under this Bill, now that prices are falling, an attempt is to be made to catch the advantage both ways. T he Department got the advantage when the rise took place, but now, when it has to make concessions on a falling market, it says, &#34; No.We wish to collect duty upon the invoice value &#34; - a course which is absolutely dishonest. </para>

                            <para>- Upon the value set out in the genuine invoice. I have no objection to the Department collecting duty upon the full value of any article. But by maintaining these prices when the market is falling, the Government are deliberately keeping up the cost to the consumer and thus encouraging that profiteering of which we hear so much from the Opposition. Everybody knows that the merchant does not pay the duty. He merely passes it on, with a percentage of profit added to it. That is business. By adopting the course that is proposed in this Bill, prices will be artificially raised and the consumer will have to pay. While the country is seething with agitation against profiteering, this measure seeks to perpetuate that evil by reason of the attitude of the CustomsDepartment. </para>

                    <para>There is another principle involved in the Bill which I do not regard as a fair one. It seeks to clothe the Government with power to prevent any duty being collected upon goods imported for the purposes of trade, so long as that trade is managed by the Commonwealth. In other words, if we take over the sugar industry or any other industry, and control it as a Commonwealth concern- </para>

That is why I am prepared- to kick. So long as I am a member of this Parliament I shall protest against the Government taking unto themselves powers which properly belong to this Parliament. The longer this process continues, the more incompetent will honorable members become to enact legislation in the interests of this country. Apparently the only voice we shall have in these matters will be in our power to take exception to regulations when they are laid upon the table of the House. If no exception be taken, those regulations will have the force of law within a period of fourteen days. </para>

I need scarcely remind honorable members that regulations framed under the War Precautions Act have been presented to Parliament, and honorable members have tabled motions disagreeing with them. But by means of certain standing orders, the Government have effectually prevented those motions from being discussed. </para>

                            <para>- What has that to do with us ? I cannot be bluffed like that. When once effect has been given to regulations, this House is impotent to alter them. That applies to this Bill and to nearly every Act of Parliament providing for the payment of fees. The Minister should make up his mind as to the different fees his officers should receive, and incorporate them in a schedule to the Bill, and not leave them to be prescribed in an indefinite way. I shall always protest against the gradual taking away of the power of honorable members and placing it in the hands of Ministers - a course of procedure which simply compels those of us who are not in the Ministry to become useless excrescences on the legislative machine. </para>

                        <para>. - I cannot indorse the sentiment expressed by the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson),</inline> that every encouragement should be given to the establishment of trade between Australia and America and &#39; Canada, and other places bordering on the Pacific Ocean, because the- arrangement of a reciprocal agreement with those countries, even with other Dominions of the Empire, would mean that there would be very little for Australian workmen to do. One country stands out particularly as a very serious competitor with Australia. I hope the day will come when, actuated by the best of good sense, we shall give the Minister for Trade and Customs the statutory power to say that goods shall not be permitted to enter Australia unless they are manufactured under conditions similar to those prevailing- here. A good deal has been said about the effect that the shipping disabilities have had in increasing the cost of imported goods, but the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> has shown us that, so far as shipping between Great Britain and Australia is concerned, conditions are now almost normal. In fact, he has explained that some of our vessels which are bringing back troops are arriving in ballast. Since the war began, one country which has been able to control the seas and its own mercantile marine has been in a position to land goods in Australia at a cost with which Australian manufacturers have not been able to compete. The trade which this country is doing with Australia has so increased that persons who were fiscal atheists are now awaking to the fact that if Australia is to be in a position to pay its enormous debt, every effort must be made to find employment for its people. If this country is to be in a position to hold out a welcoming hand to immigrants, its industries must be stimulated. </para>

We ought to insert a clause insisting that goods shall not be allowed to come into Australia unless they are manufactured under conditions similar to those applying here.

That country has landed millions of pounds&#39; . worth of goods in Australia during the war; and, be it said to their lasting disgrace, since the war broke out and our trading connexion with Germany ceased, many people who call themselves Australians &#39;have taken themselves to this Eastern country, and filled it with orders for goods for Australia. The goods supplied to those orders are now coming here.

I heard it said by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> that, owing to the undervaluation of invoices, Australia was losing &#163;1,000,000 per annum. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, we have had some disgraceful exhibitions of under valuations. Our Customs Department, under State management or under Federal administration, has been &#34;rooked&#34; time after time. In this respect conditions have improved in recent years, and I believe that Australia is now enjoying the receipt of Customs duties on goods valued at their proper invoice value at the port of shipment. But when I look at the latest figures supplied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> and see what an immense quantity of goods is coming in, I realize that our Customs officers have their hands fairly full. During the first nine months of the financial year 1918-19, textile goods, not including apparel, were imported to the value of &#163;21,000,000, as against &#163;11,000,000 for a similar period in 1917-18. It is a step in the right direction to tighten up our Customs laws, and give the Minister and his officers every possible authority to scrutinize invoices, not only when goods arrive here, but also at the port of shipment. When the practice of investigating invoices abroad was first instituted, the British manuf acturerstookexception to it. They said, &#34; Why should Australian Customs officers come into our invoice departments to ascertain the value of goods.?&#34;Ibelievethat we did it under the threat that if the British manufacturers were not prepared to allow an inspection of their books disclosing the invoice value of goods sent to Australia, we would have to take measures to preclude the entry of those manuf acturers&#39;goods into Australia. I believe that we still have officers on the other side of the world carrying out this duty, and I understand that prior to the war even Germanmerchants desirous of despatching goods to Australiahad to submit to these investigations. An honest man may object to this scrutiny of his books, but the Customs Department has come to the conclusion, from what has happened in the past, that every man doing business with it must be deemed to be a rogue. I would like the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> to state whether the same investigations take place in Japan ; whether our officers are privileged to enter a Japanese merchant&#39;s warehouse and ascertain the value of his goods prior to exportation. </para>

                            <para>- From what I know of the habits of the Japanese, I am doubtful whether our Australian Customs officers are permitted to enter a Japanese warehouse in order to secure the information they can obtain in Great Britain.The Japanese goods coming to Australia are made the subject of, perhaps, the worst system of profiteering there is in the world. Recently a special Commissioner came to Australia from Japan in order to ascertain the requirements of our buyers, and was told that one of the troubles our merchants had in dealing with Japanese goods was that the bulk shipment was never up to the sample submitted. He promised to do his best to see that the matter wasrectified,but whether he has done so I do not know.However, we should treat the Japanese manufacturers in the same way as we treat the British manufacturers. If they will mot permit our officers to ascertain the invoice value of goods in Jap an, we should subject them to Customs disabilities here. I see no remedy for this evil but in the direction of absolute prohibition. I would not do what the honorable member for Brisbane has suggested - make a Customs arrangement with any nation which may be regarded as a partner in the custody of the Pacific Ocean. I admit that very often wars are occasioned over trading disputes; but Ihopethatwe shall never buy support for ourselves by ruining Australian industry. When the Minister says that he and his officers are doing their best, it is hardly fair to insist that they should do more; but why should he not make the same stipulation as was made by the honorable member for Yarra in regard to British and American goods, and impose certain disabilities upon Japanese goods if our officers are not permitted to examine the invoice value of those goods in Japanese warehouses ? </para>

                    <para>The Bill meets with my approval, because it has a general tightening-up effect, but we know that the trouble in regard to the importation of goods is that the wholesale houses must make their profits as well as the retailers. Coates has almost a monopoly of cotton, and there are two firms in Australia - one in Melbourne and one in Sydney - who have the monopoly of the distribution of that particular article. We must keep our eyes on that sort of thing, and take care to see that ample protection is given to our own traders and our own people, who should be our chief concern. </para>

                        <para>. - I sympathize with the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr.Greene) in his desire to get this Bill through ; but I wish to refer to his remarks regarding the High Court judgment, which affirmed the validity of the regulations under which the recent practice of determining values has been carried out. The Minister is evidently thoroughlysatisfied,because,in his own words, the High Court has given a definite decision that the power claimed by the Customs is inherent in the original Act. That judgment came as a surprise to the trade. It was severely technical, and having regard to the case under consideration, it was, in a way, cruel. It disturbed the commercial interests in Australia considerably in &#39;every State, and naturally so. </para>

                            <para>- It was not. The case was the typical one, and had reference to the importation of a shipment of linoleums. . It affected several houses in the Commonwealth in this way.: The firm purchased linoleums and wanted them . immediately, because the market was bare here. They could not get them for months, because there was no shipping. In some, instances that I know personally they not only purchased the linoleums, but they sold them here right out. After a good many months&#39; delay, the linoleums came along. They were delivered and paid for, and then the Customs stepped in and said the invoice was not correct, as it did not represent the value of the goods at the time of shipment. Neither did it, but it followed the practice that had always been observed, and the case was an exceedingly hard one, because these men, in good faith and in the course of honest trading, had received the goods, distributed them, and obtained the money for them, and then the Customs Department claimed duty on a higher price. </para>

                            <para>- It is admittedly so, and possibly there has been justification, because there are fraudulent persons; but it should also fee remembered that special penalties are very properly provided against fraud. The Department established values in a very immoral way, as I shall show. At the time the linoleums were shipped, the market at Home was bare. There are certain makers of linoleums who are well known, and their makes are standard makes. They had no stocks, and, therefore, to ascertain values at . Home at the time of this shipment, you had to go to the place where the few linoleums that were in existence would command almost any price that the holders liked to ask for them. Is that a fair or decent standard of value? I say it is not, and I appeal to the (honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best),</inline> who would do all he could to help Customs duties upwards, to say whether it is. It is not a fair moral standard of value, and trade could never be conducted . under such conditions. . My honorable friends opposite . are . always talking . about profiteering, and . the oppression . of the consumer. This practice does . not give them . a fair deal, because it is . they, and not the importer, who must pay . the extra amount, ..except . in this unfortunate instance, where the . importer had followed the practice of a generation back, and thus landed himself in a position where he could not recover what was claimed from him after the goods &#39;had been paid for. Although the High Court judgment has beengiven,the firm intend, whatever . it costs them, to takethecasetothePrivy Council. I understand there are certain limitations, and that they have to obtain permission to go to the Privy Council&#39;. They ought to have permission. It cannot on any moral grounds, or on any grounds of equity, be withheld from them. If this practice is to be established, it is going to prevent in trade what is known as forward buying, because that will be made impossible!. </para>

                            <para>- Let me elaborate that. The Minister for Trade and Customs does not like any calling this a new practice, and he would certainly object to my calling it an immoral practice, but if it is recognised, what object is there in a man buying forward ? Buying forward is a common and very legitimate practice in business. </para>

                            <para>- Of course, and if his risk comes off right, his enterprise is all in the interests of the consumer, because he will bring much cheaper stuff to this country. The practice in trade is for a certain percentage to be put on the goods. If a man, instead of getting the benefit of forward buying, must pay Customs duty on the price current at the date of shipment, the consumers will not get the advantage from his enterprise which they would otherwise get. Take, for example, cottons. It is a common thing for the manufacturer to look ahead for one, two or even three years. </para>

                            <para>- I am talking about the raw material. If an Australian importer sees that a rise is coming along, and these men know pretty well what the world&#39;s markets are, he steps in and buys forward, not for immediate delivery, but for a long time ahead. I admit that so far as the Customs are concerned, he would not have serious difficulty in the case of cottons, because there &#39; is not much of a duty. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that. Some members have referred to the Chambers of Commerce. These bodies in all the States got a scare about this Bill, but in South Australia the Collector was able to remove a great deal of the feeling of unrest, because the Chamber of Commerce there had. not seen the Bill, and were proceeding under a misapprehension. The member for Kooyong is perfectly right in saying that in normal times the practice will not make much difference in the case of cottons, particularly with regard to the United Kingdom, because there is a fairly level and even standard of business there, and it is pretty honest too. But there are other parts of the world which proceed on different principles. </para>

                            <para>- And rough on our fiscal policy here. I understand that in&#39; Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa, the principle for. which this Bill provides is recognised, and it means that in respect of imports from the United States duty will have to be paid, not on the prices for export, but on the home values. That will be a distinct advantage to Australian industries. It will  mean a little more protection for them, and an extra preference to Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>.- I cannot agree with the conclusion arrived at by the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster),</inline> who spoke of a shipment of goods which were sold before arrival here, and who considered it to be a great hardship that the importers were called upon to pay an increased rate of duty because the value of such goods in the country of origin had increased between the date of their purchase and the time of shipment. The honorable member urged that, in the interests of consumers, the excess duty so collected should be refunded to the importers. If he could guarantee that the consumers would be benefited in the shape of reduced . prices to the extent of the  money so refunded, there might be some reason in his argument. It seems to me, however, that an importer who purchased in a low market would take advantage of any subsequent increase in values, and would sell at the higher rate, so that the general public would receive no benefit if a refund such as the honorable member suggests were made. </para>

                    <para>With the general principles of the Bill I largely agree, but I regret that the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> has not availed himself of this  opportunity to take more power to control exports. Yesterday, I asked him a question relating to the high cost of. boots and leather, but he denied that there was any increase in prices. In to-day&#39;s newspapers, there -appears a report of an inquiry in which it is shown that the prices of military and other boots have considerably increased, and that these increases are likely to go on. By means of this Bill the Minister could take power to protect the users of boots and leather just as he is taking power to protect the Customs revenue. He could provide for the regulation of the export of leather and raw hides. </para>

                            <para>- Quite a number of cattle raisers who have died recently were exceedingly wealthy men. If they could make money at the pre-war prices, we might well ask what such men are making to-day. Unfortunately, we have in this House men who shut their eyes to the fact that users of boots and shoes, as well as other goods, are being exploited. It is not my desire that the producers of hides, or any other raw material, should not get a fair price, but we ought to have some regard for the consumers. American agents are touringtheCommonwealth buying up all the leather and hides they can secure. That being so, we are only at the beginning of high prices for boots and leather. </para>

                            <para>-The honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falkiner)</inline> reminds me of a story I was told about a pie merchant. A customer said to him, &#34; These are really good pies.&#34; The pie merchant replied, &#34; They ought to be, because on every one I sell I lose one farthing.&#34; &#34; Then,&#34; said the customer, &#34;how do you make the business pay? &#34; The pie merchant replied,. &#34; By the number of pies I sell.&#34; Apparently, the honorable member for Hume loses on his stations, but makes the business pay by the number of stations on which he loses. The position is that a number of boot factories cannot get supplies of leather, to keep them going. They are unable to compete with the buyers from America., and we are given to understand . that&#39; the leather they purchase is re-exported from America to Germany. </para>

Boot manufacturers have been making goods of a very high quality, but because America is prepared to pay , a big price for the best hides, the bootmaking industry must be shut down. I do not blame the man who has hides to sell for getting the best price, but we must do something to save the bootmaking industry, and to conserve the interests of the people who, at the present time, are compelled to pay high prices for footwear. </para>

He says that the necessity for that course arises from the fact that the consumers have to pay more for their goods, and will soon be causing a disturbance. The man in Australia who has most reason to rise in his wrath is the producer on the land. The honorable member referred to the income tax which some landholders&#39;are paying. Under the present system of taxation- man who is raising stock- might easily, and very often does, pay substantial income tax, although- his operations for the year, have shown a loss. Very frequently he&#39; pays taxation on the natural&#39; increase of his flocks and herds upon which he never realizes: Under our absurd method of taxation- a- man is charged- taxation on what the Department&#39; calls the average value of his stock, but in many cases that stock dies before the grower has an opportunity of turning- it into cash. </para>

                        <para>- None. For years when I was in the Parliament of New South Wales I fought the Income Tax Commissioner on this matter. Finally, I received an assurance in writing from the Commissioner that natural increase would not be taxed until it had arrived at the age of maturity, which, in the case of) sheep, was fixed, at twelve months. But that promise has never been carried out.; taxation- is still- collected on. unrealized natural increase. To my certain knowledge&#39; men in. New South Wales., including some in, whose family the freehold has been for generations-,, are selling out owing principally, to this iniquitous; form of taxation.. </para>

                            <para>- No. The grower pays his taxation on the natural increase, although he may never get a penny from it. I intend on another occasion) to suggest what I consider a fair system of taxation for the man on the land. We are told that&#39; this measure will stimulate primary industries, and that it is necessary to do that in order to meet Australia&#39;s enormous debt. What are the industries that will enable us to bear the burden of debt? According to the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Y ear-Bookthe</inline> added value of manufactures in 1916 was &#163;67,000,000, and the total actual return from primary production was &#163;201,000,000- exactly three times the return of the value of manufactures. Yet we are told that the primary industries are to be kept in check by not being allowed to export their products at the world&#39;s value. Our national debt will be a considerable- burden on. Australia, and how- are we to meet it unless we encourage wealth production? Can we encourage wealth production under the present iniquitous system of taxation, and if effect is given to the ideas that have been enunciated by the honorable member for South Sydney and. others on the Opposition side? </para>

                    <para>Mir. FLEMING.- Unless something is done to alleviate the position of the man on the land, primary production will&#39; not increase at anything like the rate it should do. In addition to the taxation which he has to pay he must lock up in his business a far greater amount of capital in proportion to his production than any other class of trader. The manufacturer has a turnover annually of the greater part of his capital. Every bank in Australia is anxious to. get commercial business, but very few are willing to extend their operations in connexion with land propositions. The reason is plain. Whilst the commercial man. has a. quick and frequent turnover of his capital, the man on the land, especially if he owns freehold, has the far greater part. of his capital locked up. </para>

                            <para>- The primary producer also is a leaseholder at times. The primary producer on freehold land is the best asset that this country has, because he has a greater inducement to improve his holding than has any leaseholder. But under the present system the freeholders with large capital locked up are getting a smaller return for their capital than are any other men in Australia. The consequence is that they are becoming tired of &#34; carrying the baby,&#34; and many of them are trying to sell out. That is a very serious state of affairs, having regard to the present financial position of Australia. Frequently these men must continue buying land in order to save their stock, or to cut down the managerial and overhead expenses of their blocks. They have about reached their limit, and unless some  relief  is afforded there will be no necessity to place any restriction on the export of primary products, because there will be a very much reduced quantity available for export. </para>

                    <para>I desire to suggest to the Minister what seems to &#39;me a very proper extension of the trade of this country. At present we are practically ignorant of what the British Empire as an Empire can do. The various Dominions are all at a loss to know what position they bear in relation to each other. This country would do . well to establish a Board of inquiry and adjustment to ascertain exactly what commodities Australia can produce to greater advantage than any other part of the British -Dominions. If every other Dominion throughout the Empire did the same, and a free interchange of goods between the various parts of the British Empire were arranged, we should then be in something like a sound position to frame a Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- That is true. I suggest to the Minister that it is advisable to establish in Canada a Trade Commissioner who would be able to advise the people pf the Dominion of what trade can be done between them and us to our mutual advantage. I assure him that many of the leading men of Canada hold the idea that the British Dominions, should trade amongst themselves to the best advantage, that we should know more of each other, and work together more than we have done&#39; in the past to promote the stability of the Empire. As a  pri-mary  producer I say that Australia stands to benefit by that movement as much as, if not more than, any other part of the Empire. We are the most happily circumstanced country in the world for primary production except for the lack of sympathy on the part of the Government. There is no question that the city interests overshadow us here to a larger extent than  they  do  in most of the Dominions. Yet the same problem confronts them all. But in Australia we have presented to us the finest opportunity which could be presented to a country of primary production, such as this undoubtedly is. Under our present system we .are breeding the best men who have ever been seen in the fighting line. Yet we have been told that we must divert population from the lines of natural production into the channels of manufacture. When I hear speeches such as were delivered by the honorable member for South Sydney, and realize where they would lead us, and when I know how the country interests are suffering at the present moment, I cannot too strongly endeavour to convince the Government that if the existing drift be allowed to continue, we shall have very little chance indeed of progressing along that upward road which we have -hitherto travelled. </para>

In this clause we are merely seeking to do what we have already done under our Excise Act. </para>

In my opinion &#39; it is better for the commercial community that that should be the position.

The practice proposed in the clause is that which is already in existence, and, in my opinion, it is a good one. </para>

                        <para>. - I  do not think it would be found practicable to do what the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falkiner)</inline> suggests. In any case,, it would depend upon the Minister whether a clearance was ultimately given. If he decided that no clearance should be granted until some requirement had been complied with, under this amendment the owners would probably be obliged to have recourse to legal proceedings before a determination could be arrived at. In this  clause we simply declare what is the practice which obtains to-day. Whilst all the provisions, of the Customs Act. may have been respected, there may, nevertheless, be harbor dues, or some law in connexion with the States which has not been complied with. </para>

This is the right of the&#39; individual&#39; against the Crown The clause we are now considering seeks to&#39; take- from the private citizen a right: which he has at law to-day Why have our Courts&#39; been&#39; established?

This Chamber strongly objects to new clause declaring duty must be paid on home consumption value at date of shipment, making it impossible to know landed cost of goods in some cases for year.

                <para class="block">If this amendment is agreed to it will mean that the Customs Department will be obliged to resort to the practice followed since the war began. The Customs Act already gives the Department the power to ascertain at the port of shipment the price of any goods for which invoices are presented. If the price at the port of shipment is found to be higher than the value shown on the invoice, duty can be charged on that higher price. On the other hand, if a reduction &#39;has been brought about in the price of the goods by the collapse of the war - the goods may have been held up in. dock in Great Britain for a considerable time - the Department, with a knowledge of the value at the port of shipment at the time the goods were entered for clearance, merely charges duty on that value. The Customs Department promised the importers that this system would be continued, and if the promise is not redeemed, it will amount to an attempt on the part of the Department to keep up prices, and so indirectly swell the cry of profiteering. If this clause is levelled against Japan, why should not the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> inform honorable members? Surely the time has gone when we must hesitate to open our mouths in regard to Japan. The Parliament of that country does not scruple to express its views concerning other nations. Is not our trade our own business? </para>

                        <para>- True; and. if there was the slightest fear of our being compelled to match our Navy against that of Japan,  in a matter of trade, we might be justified in speaking with bated breath. But the war is over, and Australia is still part and parcel of . the &#34;Empire. In time of war the British and Australian Navies are one. Remembering that, therefore, it will not be argued that the Japanese Navy is a match for our ships. If we should be called . upon to defend our country, I think Australians would be capable of doing so. That argument, however, is not appropriate to this. discussion. On a matter of trade solely, if there is any risk in regard to . Japan, if there is urgent reason why this clause should be passed, why does not the Minister supply the whole of the facts? </para>

Although this clause will . assist us materially in dealing with difficulties experienced by the Department regarding Japanese trade, it will also apply to quite a number of other countries which are exporting to us lines of goods for which there is no consumption value within those countries.

The Department is constantly dealing with invoices    which declare the home consumption value to be less than the figures set out in those invoices; but the point is that there is no home consumption value.

                    <para>. - I have been considerably influenced in my views by the speech of . the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poster). His</inline> remarks were devoted at length to this particular clause. The honorable member is a practical man; he obviously knew what he was talking about, and yet he was unable to offer a suggestion - for surmounting the difficulty. I have personally consulted Customs officials, and have sought an -explanation of this clause. I ask honorable members to imagine that the pen which I hold in my hand was made in Japan, or in some other foreign country. I want it to be understood that it is an article which is not used in the country of its manufacture. It would be competent for the foreign manufacturer to assess its home consumption value at 3d., for the reason, that it has no home consumption value whatever. I had hoped that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> would offer some obvious way out of our difficulty, but he has failed to do so; and . I certainly can see no solution. ..We are told that a similar provision is to &#39; be found within every Customs Act throughout, the world, and that it is the only effective . safeguard against dumping. We have, therefore, no . alternative. We- are up against a stone wall. The Minister assures the Committ.ee that we are putting altogether a wrong interpretation on the Bill, and &#34;that when we reach normal conditions in regard to shipping, and other matters, the purchaser will be able to ship at once, and the clause will not apply, except when dumping is indulged in. If that is so, we have no alternative but to leave the measure . as it stands. </para>

                        <para>- They want the right to declare the invoice value, then.  <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. FENTON.-</inline> But the invoice value may be exceptionally &#39; low. Customs officers were sent, abroad to examine the books of merchants in other countries so as to- protect our Customs. Department. We have accumulated millions of pounds through that inspection being made abroad. When the merchants took exception to it, they were told that if they did not allow our -officers to examine their invoice values there prior to the shipment of&#39; the goods we would place our own values on them here, and tax them accordingly. It- is a most peculiar- position for an Australian Legislature to be in if it cannot protect itself in a. Bill of this kind. Is. there any quiet or mild way of telling, the. people of other countries that we are determined to-, protect ourselves ? If we cannot express - our meaning in proper language, in our own Act, what are we coming to? Are we to speak only with bated breath, as the honorable member for Denison suggests, in dealing with a country which has been our- Ally for some time, but which to-day -is our most bitter competitor-in the world&#39;s markets? Rather than use mealy-mouthed language for that purpose, it is time we came out into the open, because, whether we do it by subterfuge or otherwise, other nations know what we are doing.  The people we are trying to deceive arrive at our meaning very quickly, whatever language- we: use in our Acts of Parliament. I would go further, and, in order that we might know exactly where we stood, enact&#39; that no goods which we- can produce or manufacture ourselves shall be. imported: here unless they are made under conditions, similar: to those of A-us; tralia. Before the Bill goes, through, I shall endeavour to have an amendment of that kind inserted. </para>

                    <para>. -I favour strengthening- the Customs Act so as to make- it- impossible for persons who endeavour to defraud &#39; the Customs to do so. I wish to put every person on a fair footing, so that all, may pay 20s. in the &#163;1, and L believe- that 95 per cent, of the traders desire that. It is to protect that 95 per cent, against the unscrupulous 5 per cent, that we should make the Act as strong as possible. Some of them have no objection to putting in a home consumption value where- there is none. In- 1904 or- 1905, when we were fixing the duty on stripper harvesters, the. Massey-Harris people made it appear, that they were selling in the United States at an entirely different price from what they were prepared to export their goods to Australia for. They wanted to have the duty fixed on what they alleged to be the market- price there. Another phase of the question is that plenty of firms have factories-in&#39; one country and a selling branch in another country. They have -what: are known as house-to-house transfers. They sell their goods without any- profit in the! country of export, and make the- whole of their profit here. </para>

It may cost them &#163;40 to manufacture &#39; their -harvesters. They may decide to make no profit there;  and  fix  the price at &#163;40, so as to get the advantage of the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty here, letting their Australian houses make the whole of the profit. If, on the other hand, it is advantageous to them to reverse the procedure for income tax purposes, they will make the whole of their profits there and none here. That is what the Customs Department has continually to watch. This clause is much shorter than the section which is being struck out of the original Act, and which was framed, I think, by Charles Cameron Kingston. It ran -  154.

                <para class="block">There &#39;were a great number of cases under that section. This bound volume of Acts has no fewer than three foot-notes to that section, showing that cases have already &#39; been decided upon it, and there is an eternal fight between the Customs officials and importers as to the true value on which duty should be paid. I would go much further than the Minister. I would compel every importer to lodge with the Customs Department a duplicate invoice, so that if a dispute arose at any time, a copy of the genuine invoice would be available to the Department, and there would be no fear of its destruction by fire. On one occasion, while I held office as Minister for Trade and Customs, it was proposed to make a raid on certain premises at 10 a.m. next day. Only four persons were aware of that intention; but a few hours before the time fixed for the raid a fire took place. It might have been surely accidental, but it was a curious circumstance. Cases have occurred where the Department has asked permission to examine the books of a firm. A Customs official has visited the firm&#39;s premises, perhaps on a Saturday morning, and has been told, &#34; We are about to close, up. You had better come round on Monday morning, and we will fix- up the matter with you.&#34; Before Monday there has been a fire. I would strengthen the hands of the Department in the interests of the great majority of traders, who are endeavouring to do the fair thing. I do not think the clause, as it stands, will lead to any inflation of prices. If, because of it, one-tenth of the goods coming in were given an inflated value, I am convinced that the price of the remaining 90 per cent, would go up in proportion. I shall support this clause as it stands. My only regret is that the Minister is not prepared to make it even stronger. </para>

                <para class="block">I move . this amendment with the object of enabling the public to ascertain what is really paid by importers for goods which they bring into this country. The time has arrived when there should be no further secrecy in this regard, in view of the extortionate prices which&#39; the consumers are now being charged. -During the debate on this Bill, a good deal has been said as to the need for protecting importers against the payment of increased duty as the result of an increase in the price of goods in the country of origin between the date of purchase and the time of shipment. Nothing has been said, however, as to the need of protecting the public from the high charges imposed upon them by importers and others. In view of what is happening, and the clamour on the part of the people generally for an investigation as to the reasons for the increased cost of living, it is time for this Parliament to take action. We have here an opportunity to do something in the- desired direction. If this amendment be agreed to, the public will be able to know exactly what these goods cost to land, and to compare those costs with the prices which they have to pay. They will thus be in a position to determine whether or not the retail prices are exorbitant. We have in the community to-day men who contend that prices are not excessive - that there is no profiteering going on - but that the increased prices ruling here for various goods are due to the increases paid for them in the country of origin. If that is so, let us clear the public mind of any suspicion that profiteering is going on. No one objects to any man getting a fair return on his caoital, however it may be employed; but the Labour party urge that no man should be so protected as to be . able, with impunity, to make exorbitant charges. At present we have no means of ascertaining what prices are paid by those who import goods, and I think it is reasonable that &#39;the Committee should say that, in view of what is taking  place, the Comptroller-General should make public what is the declared value of goods upon which duty is imposed. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to direct the attention of the Government to a matter that is in course of development in Australia to-day, and which, I think, they should look into. In their desire to establish new industries in. Australia;, the Government made some concession,&#39; in the shape, I think, of a reduction of duty, to a company known as the Australasian Films Company, who undertook to enter upon the production of picture films in Australia. As honorable members are aware;the industry has attained immense dimensions in the United States of America. In Australia, with facilities in the shape of the best possible climate for photography and the possession of plenty of artistic talent, it was hoped: that the company would begin the business of picture-film production. T. regret that they -have. not. done so, and I wish to direct the attention, of the Government to. the&#39; fact that there appears to be a move on foot to form nothing less than a Trust, which, will Have complete control of the Australian picture-theatres and the films screened in them. I find that the Australasian. Films Company  are  practically agents for big picture- production companies in the United States of America. They are distributers of films, and make profits from that business; but at the present time the proprietors of picture-theatres may obtain their films direct from the producers if they, please. I have here a copy of an agreement that is: being submitted to picture-show proprietors, with a view to forming an association, first, in New South Wales - the head-quarters, of the Australasian Films Company - and, later, in the other States. One of the conditions proposed is that picture-show men joining the association undertake to take their films from the Australasian Films Company.I shall supply the Minister who has control of the business with a copy of the agreement I have here, but I may quote-from one article of the agreement to give honorable members some idea of what is proposed. I find this condition proposed - </para>

The land  at  Wagga is not intended to be used for picture purposes, but merely came into the possession of the firm through a lawsuit. There is no intention on the part of the Australasian Films Limited to produce pictures locally. Such a venture would be less profitable and more risky than their present business of conducting an agency for American firms. This announcement is designed to fool the public and stave off any action that may be taken. </para>
                <para>Some men in Australia had the courage to commence the production of moving pictures in the Commonwealth. One producer is likely to go right out of the business because of the opposition of Australasian Films Ltd. The author of the <inline font-style="italic">Sentimental Bloke</inline> has written a very fine scenario&#39; of that book, &#34;but the company which is prepared to produce the film is blocked by the Picture Combine. Encouragement should be given by the Government to local producers. I understand that Australasian Films Limited made a definite promise to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> that they would encourage local talent, but they are ignoring that -promise when they are attempting, by the formation of a Combine, to prevent the establishment of the film-producing industry in Australia. For that industry Australia possesses every advantage. The climatic conditions are excellent for photography, and we have . amongst our people some of. the best histrionic talent in the world. As this is a matter of very great importance, I ask the Acting -Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr . Groom)</inline> to make careful inquiry into it. I do not know whether it can be dealt with under the Industries Preservation Act. Honorable members are aware no doubt that at the present time there is an association of picture show managers, but what I am condemning is the attempt of the Combine to force all these people to take their supplies only from the Australasian Films Limited, which is merely the agent of foreign picture-making . firms. The Government should place a check upon any Combine or Trust if it is legally possible to do so, and should insist that if Australasian Films Limited intends to do anything for local products, some evidence of that intention should be given. I ask the Government to seriously consider the . matter in order that every facility may be given to those who have the courage to engage in the manufacture of films within the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to bring under the notice of the Government &#39;a complaint that has been made to me this afternoon b.y public servants engaged in the Defence Department. I have been informed that officers of the Defence Department who have been on active service abroad have been notified that they are granted leave of absence for the whole of to-morrow on full pay, for the purpose of participating in the welcome home to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> Certain of those returned soldiers have represented to me, very naturally, that they regard this permission as being objectionable to them, and as constituting a precedent in the Service which is to be deplored. Those of us who have even meagre information are aware of the somewhat ostentatious effort that is being made by the Prime Minister to court the support of the returned soldiers by all sorts of absurd &#39; and extravagant promises, to which no sane person imagines that he intends or hopes to give effect. This deliberate division of the Public Service into civil and military parties respectively in order to serve political ends cannot be too strongly deprecated. Our soldiers are essentially citizen soldiers, and we have always been told that it is the desire of. the Government and the people that when they had finished their service abroad they should be re-assimilated by the community and their soldier character shed in the discharge of their civil duties. That is an object which all wise people will keep in view. My particular object in speaking is to voice the feeling of returned soldiers who have expressed to me the view that it is repugnant to them to be asked to leave their work in order to perform functions in which they have no desire to take part, and that in their absence their work should be done by their fellow officers, to whom the concession of leave is not granted. We cannot too strongly reprobate this form of political favoritism, because the granting of leave is a sort of bribe to these men, for whom we all have every respect, to give their support to the Prime Minister and his policy. I do not think that such a thing has ever been attempted, or even heard of, before in connexion with the administration of the Public Service. I mean the offering of special advantages to one branch of the Service in order that they might manifest their sympathy with the head of the Government. I hope it will not be persisted in, but that if the matter has proceeded too far to be withdrawn, such a course will not be followed again. </para>

                        <para>. - The matter mentioned by the honorable member for Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spence)</inline> comes within the jurisdiction of the Department of Trade and Customs, which deals with inquiries into the operations of Trusts and Combines. It is open for anybody who feels aggrieved to make&#39; a complaint to the Comptroller-General, setting out in writing the ground of complaint. The matter can then be investigated by him. I suggest that this proceeding be adopted in the case referred to. </para>

                    <para>It is much to be regretted that the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> has made a complaint this afternoon.  His  remarks show how utterly he has failed to comprehend the circumstances under which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> is returning to Australia. Our soldiers have been abroad fighting for the preservation of the Empire, the freedom of nations, and the destruction of military autocracy. The war having ended, it was necessary to secure in the Peace Treaty the fruits of victory obtained by those brave heroes on the battlefields of Europe. It is admitted by all who are impartial judges of the events of the past few months that the Prime Minister has done magnificent work at the great councils of the nations, which drafted the Peace Treaty. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member utterly fails to understand that thousands of our soldiers who went across the seas to fight for the liberty . of this country desire to pay some tribute to the man who has done his best to consummate their work. The leave granted to the men is not for political purposes at all, but purely to give them an opportunity which they desire, and which is granted . at their own request, to pay a tribute in a non-political way to. the Prime Minister. It is much to be regretted that at this time the honorable member cannot allow his feelings of prejudice to abate in order that the nation may express, in a whole-hearted manner,  its gratification at the conclusion of &#34;the war, and its appreciation of the men- who fought so courageously and successfully in that conflict. </para>
