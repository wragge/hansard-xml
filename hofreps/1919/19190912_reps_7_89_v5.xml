                            <para>- Quite so; and I should think it very probable that such a Conference will be held. Whatever other Dominion is represented at such a Conference, it would be a calamity for Australia to be absent. We are further away from the heart of the Empire than is any other Dominion. Representatives: of Canada may cross over in a week for all sorts of consultations with the Imperial Government. I strongly emphasize the absolute necessity of Australia being represented at all such Conferences, whenever and wherever they may take place. </para>

                        <para>- The question is one which I think I should answer. In ordinary circumstances, the present system of control will shortly lapse, and the question of whether it should be continued is now being discussed with the steam-ship owners. We have to take every care that the Australian coastal service is not denuded of shipping owing t to the inducements offered to ship-owners to send their vessels to other ports where much better freights are offering, and where high prices can be obtained for their ships. </para>

                            <para>- The easiest way to avoid debates on lengthy replies is to refrain from interjections which provoke replies. If honorable members do not desire to hear answers to questions, and intimate that fact, Ministers will doubtless refrain from replying to them. I am unable to say what should be the answer made by a Minister to any question put to him. Obviously many questions are of such a nature -as to involve more or less lengthy replies. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask the Assistant Minister for Defence a question relating to Australian-bom soldiers who enlisted in British regiments. . These men were in Great Britain when the war broke out, and, being anxious to volunteer, were induced to join British regiments. They endeavoured afterwards, without success, to secure a transfer to Australian units, with the result .that, on their return to Australia they are treated as British reservists, and are hot entitled to the privilege&#39;s extended to members of the ALF. in respect of Australian rates of pay and repatriation rights. Will the Department of Defence take action to remedy this state of &#39;affairs? </para>

                    <para>My words in cold print would seem to indicate that I was inciting the men on- the Australian Fleet to mutiny and rebellion, but such a thought was as far from my mind as it possibly could be. Having subjected myself to military discipline in my past, I know, as- every other honorable member knows, that discipline must be maintained, not, , only in a Fleet, but also among any body of men. Therefore I am sorry that I interjected as I did1, seeing that my words bear the construction that T sought to incite the men on these vessels to mutiny. My only desire was to get them out of gaol. </para>

                            <para>- -Following the graceful example of the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Page),</inline> I wish to say a few words of explanation. Some little time ago, on the discussion of a motion for the adjournment of the House to consider the question of deportations, I brought up the case of a person, whom I did not designate by name, but whom I indicated, and whose name I subsequently handed in- to the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom),</inline> whowas in charge: of the House at the time. I made a complaint <inline font-style="italic">m</inline> regard to that man and his proposed deportation, and, of course, I made it on good faith and on evidence which I considered was absolutely sufficiently sound to justify it. However, I have found since then, that I had no basis of complaint, as the man had none, and I say now that he was not badly or unfairly treated by the Defence authorities. It is only right that I should do this. Having such a perfect gallery of excellent grievances, I have no need&#39; to introduce any fictitious ones. </para>

                    <para>. -  The chief feature of the debate upon this motion has been the manner in which honorable members of the Opposition have constantly referred to the question of profiteering. One would almost imagine from their remarks that they claimed a monopoly of the subject, and that honorable members on the Ministerial side were anxious to see profiteering kept going in perpetuity. Of course, it is quite unnecessary for us to say that we are just as anxious as honorable members opposite to see profiteering brought to as speedy an end as possible; but I am rather inclined to think that the motive influencing honorable members opposite is not so much the desire to get rid of the profiteer as it is to use him as a very desirable political card. With the prospect of an early election they believe that it will be a nice cry to put before the electors in order to accentuate the differences between capital and labour. Instead of our having real peace in the community, we shall have as much class hatred as it is possible to bringabout. </para>

                        <para>- We are all pleased to see the honorable member for Macquarie return to us in health and strength, and he will understand that my remark does not apply to him, but the subject has been brought forward in season and out of season in every debate during the last few months. It is not the profiteering that is troubling honorable members opposite so much. It is the class hatred that, from their point of view, is so desirable for the purposes of their party propaganda. We hear  a  great deal about the party being given representation at all . Conferences, but the question is: which party opposite is to be given representation? According to this morning&#39;s newspapers, those engaged in the boot trade of Sydney have, to their honour, instituted  a  Whitley Commission Board, in order to bring about better relations between employers and employed. But in the same issue we read that the Trades and Labour Council of Sydney condemns the movement, because its members are anxious, like honorable members opposite, to keep class hatred alive, for the purpose of arousing rebellion in the country. That is their object. If  Ave  are to have an International Conference, I hope the Government will seriously consider whom they are going to allow to represent Labour on it. Are they going to permit this revolutionary crew, who do not represent Labour, to represent it, or are they going to allow the men behind the Whitley Commission to do so? The two cursed storm centres in Australia are the Trades Hall, Sydney, and the Trades Hall, Melbourne. They are keeping up this embittered feeling for their own ends, to the detriment of the welfare of the people of this country. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member takes his orders from the Sydney Trades Hall. I say emphatically that the section on the other side of the House that professes and claims to represent Labour does not represent it. I represent it better than they do. I represent it on the lines of the Whitley Commission, that can save the workers and bring prosperity to this country, and to every other country where it is tried. </para>

                <para>Now that the question of profiteering has been raised in this debate, let me ask  what is the cause of profiteering, and who created it? This House is very largely responsible. I do not say that the House did it intentionally, but it committed an error of judgment in fixing the rates of tax . in the War-time Profits Tax Act. We did not take the whole of the wartime profits, as we should have done. The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs),</inline> when Treasurer in a Labour Government, proposed, I think, to take 60 per cent., the &#39;remaining 40- per cent, to go to the individual. Both in the Caucus and&#39; out of it I was in favour of taking every pound of the war-time profits. If a man was -eager to make a profit - and every one of us, if in the same position, would be equally guilty - -and he knew .that the -Government were going to take 60 per cent, and leave him 40 -per cent., he would naturally increase his prices in order to increase his share of the profits. The responsibility for profiteering, if it exists to the extent claimed by honorable members and the -press, rests largely, if not wholly, with this House. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of war profits. I think the ultimate solution of this question lies in &#39;a recognition of the principle that all war profits should go to the Treasury. There is a difficulty in dealing with Trusts and Combines, hut 1 think we can cope with them by limiting their profits. We could allow them a certain net profit, although I am not prepared at this stage to suggest any definite figure. That is the line on which the House and the country will have to proceed. There should not be high prices in the case of locally-manufactured productions, but until we get back to normal freight conditions, it would he better if some of the oversea commodities, which are absolutely essential to us, were imported solely by the Government, rather than that private individuals should be allowed to make great profits out of them at the expense of the consumers and the public generally. This Parliament and the country must face this question, and the sooner we do it the better. We are not likely to get much assistance from the State Parliaments. Individuals at times grow tired of power, and give it up, but there has never yet been an instance of an organization or combination of interests  relaxing  its grasp of power unless it is absolutely kicked out. Until the public take up this question of the powers of the Commonwealth and States, the States will never do anything except squabble among themselves, and devise every conceivable scheme to keep the powers they have. We must remodel our Federal Constitution on the lines of the Constitution of Canada. That is the only type of Federation that can be worked under the British connexion. </para>

                <para>Me. ARCHIBALD. - I think it would be quite possible, by means of two or three carefully-drafted amendments-, hut the quickest and most effective way would be a Convention on the same lines as the one which built up our present Constitution. A Constitution like outs, which is simply a &#34; pup &#34; of the American Constitution, can be worked on. a Republican principle such as obtains in America; but it is utterly impossible to do it under the connexion with the British Crown, and as T am strongly in. favour of the British connexion, and the last man to think of having anything else, I consider that out best way is to set about putting our own house in order so that our Constitution will be able to work as smoothly as does that of South Africa or Canada. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates)</inline> has shown a great amount of industry and taken a great deal of interest in connexion with banking returns, but I would respectfully call his attention to a phase of the question which he appears to overlook. He pays too much attention to&#39; bankers simply as custodians of money, and loses sight of the fact that they are also dealers in credit. After we instituted the Australian. Note issue, there was a strong feeling, both outside and inside the House, expressed here by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine and others, that we were increasing the issue out of proportion to the gold reserve, and beyond the point of safety. . There was some talk about the danger of a collapse, although fears of that kind were never well-founded. One of the reasons for the present high prices is the tremendous amount of paper money in circulation all over the world, and the appreciation of gold. A number of professors are wandering about, both here and in other countries, offering quack remedies and nostrums, but all their spouting on tubs cannot do- away with the inevitable working of the economic laws which govern currency. &#34;We cannot get away from Gresham&#39;s law, the effects of which we are now realizing. Of course, the amount of paper money in circulation  in Australia is a mere bagatelle, -and I am not referring to it at all, nor questioning, the undoubted safety and soundness of our. present currency ; but in England, and all the Allied countries, there is a perfect deluge of paper money in existence, and the fact that the exchange value of the English sovereign in New York was 17s. 6d. last week indicates that Gresham&#39;s law is in operation. I do not know what the exchange value of the English sovereign in New York is to-day. I hope it has improved; but it is more likely to have gone down to 17s., and that result is only the logical effect  of the quantity of. paper money that is in circulation. I am giving, not the views of political quacks and mountebanks, but of shrewd men who- understand the financial position of the world. The position is serious, although I do not say it cannot be got over: It requires careful, calm, and dispassionate review, and no man who- occupies a seat in the Australian Parliament should deliberately inflame the minds of the people outside on the question. Seeing that the people are already suffering enough from high prices, members who address them should at least tell them the truth, and not make statements which are a long way from it. It has been suggested that Europe and even Australia will have to live on credit. If that means anything, it means that we shall have practically to live on the production of Australia, both primary and secondary, before it is actually available, by means of bills of credit and so forth. I do not  say  that such a. thing could not be done. It can be done, and I believe it will be done; but when a proposal of that kind is seriously put forward as a means of carrying the community through the present troubled times, it is no occasion for political mountebanks to wander about and. inflame- the public mind merely to make party capital for- their own personal ends. . Men who do . that are nothing but a. gang of place-hunters who want power, and care absolutely nothing for the true interests of the country. I do not propose to say any more on the subject of profiteering, but it is a problem that must be, and I believe will be, faced. But we shall face it more effectively if we -deal with the matter honestly, and give the outside public the facts of the case. </para>
                <para>I wish to deal with one matter in. connexion, with the administration of. the Trade and Customs Department. A great amount of irritation can be caused through the Government interfering with matters that do not concern them at all. In South Australia, there is strong feeling on account of the action of the Trade and Customs Department in suppressing the sale of the Mattei remedies. Those remedies have been in use in South Australia for a number of years, and many people believe that they have derived much good from them. The agent for them was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wendt,</inline> a prominent jeweller in Adelaide. The old gentleman did not seek to make any profit out of the sale of these remedies; he distributed them as a work of love, and on his death he bequeathed the agency to his son, through whom the people have been able to get the remedies without having to pay any handling cost or middleman&#39;s profit. Experts discovered that certain so-called remedies are injurious, and the Customs Act was amended to enable their importation! to be prohibited. If there are any so-called remedies which are &#34; injurious, suppress them by all means, and put in gaol those who deal in them. Prison is the proper place for persons who dishonestly make money out of the ailments of their neighbours. The Customs Department obtained the formula of the Mattei remedies, and experts pronounced that they contained nothing that would give any benefit to those who used them. They did not discover that the remedies contained any ingredients that would be injurious to the human system. If patent medicines are doing no harm, why should the Government interfere with their sale? One. of the Mattei remedies contains three or four ingredients which the Government experts say will do nobody any good.. How do they know that? Medical experts profess to, know everything, but when .there is -an epidemic of disease in the community they show they know nothing at all. How can they say that certain ingredients mixed iri fixed proportions will not produce beneficial results? I, a layman, say it is impossible for a medical man to make any such positive declaration. In any case, though these patent medicines may not do much good by themselves, yet the people have faith in them, and that faith helps to effect a cure. Of the thousands of people in Melbourne and other cities who go to doctors only half are ill; the others merely fancy they are ill. To the latter a doctor gives a bottle of coloured water, and as they have faith in that prescription they consider themselves cured in a short time. The reputation of the medical profession is maintained by the fact that the doctors cure people who really have no ailments, and it is a profitable game. In defending the distribution of the Mattei remedies, I have a right to ask why the Government should allow the medical profession to sell coloured water to people who merely fancy they are ill. Is not that fraud? I do not blame the medical profession very much; we must all recognise human nature, and it would be contrary to human nature to refuse to sell to people something they fancy they need. A medical friend of mine said to me, &#34;Why blame me? A patient comes to me and says he is ill. I know there is nothing the matter with him, but if I tell him so he goes to another doctor around the corner,&#34; who says, &#39; You will be dead in a week if you do not take my prescription.&#39; &#34; </para>

                        <para>- I am not referring to doctors in their treatment of serious illness. I should be sorry if my reflections were applied to all members of the medical profession in all circumstances. I divide the medical profession into three classes. One-third of the doctors and surgeons ought to be gaoled for getting money under false pretences; others know a little and do small harm; the remainder of the profession are really able men, who can tell by the look of a patient what is the matter with him. They have an instinct for the profession, and .without that instinct no man can be a good physician. I ask -the Government to allow the Mattei remedies to be distributed in South Australia. One man has told me that they have done him a great amount of good. I said that 1 did not think they had done him much good; except in so far as he believed they had. He  insisted that the remedies themselves had actually been efficacious. By&#34; a little ingenuity he was able to get a supply of these remedies from Italy, but the Customs Department seized them, and will not release them. This Parliament has a right to say that no man shall take advantage of the ailments or the credulity of his neighbours, but when there is a- demand for a patent medicine which the authorities cannot prove to be in any way injurious, this Parliament is going outside its province in prohibiting the distribution of it. </para>

                <para>Honorable members may think that I am treating this subject in a spirit of levity, but I remind them of the history of &#34; the Peculiar People,&#34; a sect who were, common in London in the sixties. They comprised mostly engine-drivers, firemen, and other employees of&#34; the Great Eastern Railway. They, did not believe in employing the services of a doctor at all ; they were harmless, honest, Christian people who followed literally the teaching of the Old Book,, that the Lord will restore those who have faith. The Peculiar People practised that faith, and official returns showed that they were the most healthy community in the East end of London, but they fell foul of the Government through not calling in medical aid in cases of illness amongst infants. I recollect several prosecutions at. the Old Bailey in the. early sixties on charges of manslaughter, because children had died without having received medical attention. The last of these cases was tried before Lord Chief Justice Cockburn, who stopped the proceedings and asked that the elders of the sect should see him in his room. There he told them that whilst the law did not desire to interfere with their faith, they must employ the services of a doctor in cases of illness amongst children. On their giving that promise, the accused person was liberated on bail, and from that date no further prosecutions have taken place. In the old files of the London <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> honorable members may read articles written, on this subject by the late George Augustus Sala, and they show a record of a community of working people noted for their simple and blameless lives, and who were healthier than any other section of the East End population. Therefore, len no honorable member tell me that there is no power in faith to cure ailments. How far faith will cure in other cases I cannot say; I merely mention what happened in connexion with one sect who practised faith-healing. This Parliament has no right to prevent any person using so-called remedies unless they can be proved to be injurious. I again ask the Government to remove the prohibition on the sale of the Mattei  remedies </para>

                <para>I desire, without heat, to continue my remarks on a matter with which I was dealing last evening. I was unable to state then what had been the loss on the Parliamentary Refreshment Rooms. Honorable members on both sides have contradicted my statements. In justice to myself, I have obtained authentic information for the year 1917-18, and it shows that the .loss was &#163;1,309. The honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Foster),</inline> in dealing with this matter, excluded wages, which could hardly be done in connexion with any  business concern. It would be very  easy  to conduct a restaurant in Melbourne and give good food and attention if &#39;the proprietor had not to pay wages. Therefore I think the statement made by the honorable member may be reviewed from different points of view. I understand that no rent is paid,- and nothing for lighting, though T believe a certain amount is allowed for firing. Further, no expense is incurred for cutlery, except in the way of replacements, or for linen, crockery, or glassware. If honorable members desire a club, which they sometimes are accused of enjoying here, let them contribute to. its upkeep. It has been thought by some that I objected to paying the prices asked in the Refreshment Rooms ; hut that I have never done. I have objected, however, to a difference being made between the price asked from a member for meals and the price charged in the case of others who are &#39;permitted to use the Refreshment Rooms. People outside, perhaps more than we do, regard it as an honour to dine in Parliament House; and I am sure that no. honorable, member would object if a little extra were charged in the case of visitors.- I have not the figures for this year, because the accounts have not been audited up to 30th June. There may be great loss .experienced in the event of the Houses suddenly adjourning, and no one remaining to partake of the meals; and I suggest that the proper method, under the circumstances, would be either to donate the food to  some  charitable institution, or enter into a contract with a city caterer who could make use of it. Personally, I should like to see the experiment tried of permitting the Refreshment Rooms staff, who have been here for some years, and are all steady, reliable men, to form a small co-operative company amongst themselves to carry out the necessary catering. If that were done, this little com-pany could also have a restaurant in the city, where any waste, such as that I have referred to, could be absorbed. I wish to emphasize that honorable members pay full value for what they receive in the Refreshment Rooms; and it is an absolutely false idea, which is entertained widely outside, that we have here a nice little club, where we can eat and drink what we desire. </para>
                <para>I believe that some 700,000 men offered their military services to Australia ; and I notice from the records that the percentage refused was larger than the percentage accepted. This, of course, would become accentuated as we approached the end of the war, and oik younger men. were going away. Of the 700,000 men who offered,  some  430,000 were accepted. These figures show that at least 70 per cent, of our available mcn of military age offered their services. We have been told by the Prime Minister (Mi-. Hughes) that of our war expenditure of &#163;350,000,000, we may possibly receive &#163;50,000,000 by way of indemnity. Before . the war the wealth of Australia was estimated at &#163;1,200,000,000, and since the war we have been told by our Statist and other authorities that the wealth has more than doubled. We may- take the cost of the war at &#163;400,000,000, and the present &#39;wealth of Australia at not less than &#163;1,600,000,000. Honorable members, of course, will recognise that that estimate is only approximate; but could even the wealthiest combine of capitalists in the world, headed by Rockefeller, with his &#163;200,000,000, hope to purchase Australia for even double the present valuation <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> As a matter of fact, we, as a people, would not -permit it. If we allow 33 per cent, on the &#163;1,600,000,000, we have &#163;520,000,000. That, I recognise, is a very large &#39;amount; so we may allow 25 per cent., representing &#163;400,000,000, which would pay every penny of the debt incurred for the war, and afford substantial. relief to every man, woman, and child who, at the -present time, are in some cases being unfairly taxed. </para>
                <para>We must all agree that the -soldiers, in their interview with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> yesterday, &#34;hit the nail on the head&#34;; and I am glad to observe that the honorable gentleman, in regard to the hand-weaving of Anzac tweeds, gave the. men an answer that would have been given long ago in. this House if the common-sense ability of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> had been at the disposal of the Department. <inline font-style="italic">&#34;We</inline> all know that many of our returned men ane not getting a fair chance.. Some, blessed with good luck - or, shall I say, influence - can obtain loans from the Repatriation Department, where others with fair claims, who have done good , work, and earned equal honour, are refused. One decent fellow who required &#163;25 for furniture was, after a few weeks&#39; delay, absolutely denied, and another man - one of the finest physically I ever examined - was refused &#163;150, which he desired to devote to the purchase of a fishing boat, in order to supply food that is at present sadly needed in Melbourne. </para>
                <para class="block">Under these circumstances, I &#39; have  thought out a plan, which I shall probably bring before the House in the form of a motion at an early date. If this  suggestion of mine were adopted we could supply a home,, for every returned soldier without the possibility of the Government losing 10 per cent, of the money advanced. The Government would- hold the whole of the security in their hand&#39;s, and would be able to follow the good example of New South Wales, where, two years ago, I learned that there were 900 war widows who have had no fear of the landlord&#39;s knock. In Victoria, which approximates most nearly to New South Wales in the matter of population,, there was only one widow so happily circumstanced, and she had been provided for, at Brunswick, by the kindly contributions of kindly individuals.

                <para class="block">In my early days I  thought  that if we could eliminate the landlord, fairly and justly, it would be a benefit to the community; and in the case of a number of houses of which I was the nominal owner - barring a few &#34;blisters&#34; - I made the tenants their own owners much to their present satisfaction. I also have the happiness to enjoy the good feeling of these people for what I then did. In support of the suggestion made in the motion I have just read, I should like to give a concrete example, which, but for the ability and energy of an American author, would have been lost to the world. I allude to the building of the Guernsey market by means of the issue of currency scrip. In the early days of last century, when money could not be borrowed in London so easily as just prior to the war, the Guernsey people desired to raise capital for the building of their market. At Guernsey, at the time, there was a very able Governor, who suggested that, as the people had amongst them brickmakers, carpenters, stonemasons, and other tradesmen, they should set to work and build the markets themselves. This wise suggestion bore fruit, and in the course of three or four years the people decided to issue currency scrip for, I .believe, &#163;10,000. This scrip the shopkeepers and citizens agreed to accept in currency, and a very ingenious and able scheme was involved. I ought also to mention that the hew municipality agreed to accept the scrip in payment of rates and taxes. The markets were built, and immediately every stall was rented, no stalls being allowed in the narrow streets of Guernsey. As the rents were paid for the stalls each year, scrip to that amount was burnt, the occasion being observed as a holiday. As time went on the whole of the scrip was destroyed, and the citizens found themselves in possession of a building for ever, which yielded them some &#163;500 a year. </para>
                <para>In the State Parliament, the present <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, when a member, had a return prepared, which showed that Victoria had borrowed some &#163;50,000,000, and had paid back something over &#163;53,000,000 in interest and a small portion of the capital&#39;; but the State still owed about &#163;50,000^000. Had the State Government, in the building of their railways, adopted a plan similar to &#39;that carried -out in Guernsey, the railways of the State would now be free of &#39;debt. &#34;We all know that the great trouble with the railways is the immense amount of interest they have to earn ; and this, I think, emphasizes the value of the suggestion I am making. If such a plan were adopted under our present circumstances, the Government, in providing for out returned soldiers, could not possibly lose any money, for, as I have already said, they would hold as security every house and every acre devoted to that purpose. In addition -to that, &#34; there would be the increased values of the future, and we all -know how values have gone up. The Government would also have the knowledge  that they were freeing a large number of homes for our citizens. Landlords, after all, are like other business med. When there are ten. persons after the &#39;one house, &#39;up goes the rent. I have met only one man who was prepared not to raise the rents for his houses during &#39;the war period. He was a Jewish gentleman, and when I approached him on the subject, he asked me whether I thought a return of 6 per cent, on his capital was too much to expect ? I replied that I did not think it was. &#39;He claimed that that was all he was receiving., but when I told him that I was speaking on behalf of something like fifty tenants, and urged him not to put up his rentals, he ultimately agreed not to do so. He inquired, however, why it should have been necessary for me, as a&#39; member of Parliament, to make this request? &#34;Why,&#34; he asked, &#34; does not the Government insist that no rents shall be raised during war time?&#34; </para>
                <para>There I leave the matter. Whether a general election takes place almost immediately or not for some months hence, I shall remain true to the pledge I gave at the last general election, that neither by word of mouth nor by a -vote would I do anything to impose upon the workers of this country the burden of the war loans and interest thereon. They should not be called upon to meet our huge war indebtedness. We are here for only a brief span, on this rock, whirling through space, which we call the earth, but -the earth itself will be here for all. time. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hugh</inline> Mahon, when representing Kalgoorlie in &#39;this House, once submitted a motion that all war debts and interest thereon should be provided for by a special tax on the land. I agree with that proposition. The land will be here when we are but dust and ashes, and it&#62; should provide for our war expenditure. If the&#39; wealth of Australia to-day is &#163;1,600,000,000, who will say that twenty years hence it will not be &#163;5,000,000,000, I have given brief expression to my views on this subject, and I hope that some one will be able to evolve an even better scheme. </para>

                    <para>.- I have listened with much interest to the speeches made during this debate, and&#39; particularly to the remarks made by the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archibald),</inline> regarding the high cost of living, which he showed to be due. to a certain extent to our inflated paper currency. In every European country -there is an inflated paper currency at the present time, and in this respect we are the least offenders. It cannot be denied that the prices of commodities are the highest where the greatest amount of paper currency is in circulation. If we desire to reduce the cost of living, we should deal with the question of the* circulation of paper money. If we could devise some means of paying off our notes - we might even fund them - I think we should remove one of the causes for the great increase in prices. In 1914, when our population was practically what it is today, our note circulation amounted to &#163;6,589,798. When the note issue was in the hands of the - private banks, which had a gold backing, our paper circulation was about &#163;4,000,000. but when the Commonwealth printing; press got to work, the paper currency used by the same people as&#39; before increased to a large extent. The notes in circulation jumped from &#163;6,589,798 in 1914 to &#163;19,000,000 in February last, and whereas the banks held &#163;7,000,000 of notes in 1914, they were holding in February last &#163;37,000,000 in notes. Prior to the Commonwealth .note issue we had a gold currency, and any surplus gold was exported as an ordinary commercial commodity. Since then, owing to the war and other causes, the Government have taken possession of practically the whole of our gold, and have substituted for it a paper currency, with the result that a great number of our, banks to-day have only paper instead of gold reserves, and in clearing, settle in paper instead of gold. They are able, therefore, to extend credits on their paper backing. In . these circumstances a bank . is prepared to extend its credit to five times the amount of its reserves in gold. It is thus made possible for people to obtain accommodation from the banks against, not a gold, but a paper, currency. That may be all very well from the point &#39; of view of the convenience of trade, but it has a serious effect upon the Commonwealth. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>In a leading article published recently . in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> it was stated that the trade balance against Great Britain was &#163;800,000,000, and that the rate of exchange against the Empire was something like 15 per cent. Let us follow up that point, and see to what extent this high rate  of exchange against the Empire affects the cost of living. It means that when we export to the United States of America &#163;100 worth of wool we receive in return only &#163;85 worth of commodities. In other words, the consumers have to pay, not only the duty on the commodities we import, but the 15 per cent, against us in respect of the exchange rate, because the trade balance is against us. This is due to the fact that we have lost our gold currency and have substituted for it a paper currency. When these commodities, valued at &#163;85, but- for which we have paid &#163;100, reach Australia, the people compete for them with paper money, with the result&#39; that prices go up more than ever. The paper currency permits of this increased competition. In this way prices have gone up to the extent of 50 per cent. The sooner we tackle this question, not only in Australia, but throughout the Empire, the better for our people. The sooner we revert to a gold currency the better it will be for Australia. </para>

When we give the people of Australia, in place of the gold and paper currency of &#163;&#34;6,000,000, which was  quit3  sufficient for their purposes a few years ago, a paper currency of &#163;45,000,000, this increased paper currency must necessarily mean increased, competition for goods. </para>

                <para>Regarding the question of immigration, let me say at once that it should receive the early and serious consideration of the Government. While our boys were at the. Front they proved the very best immigration agents we could have had. They spoke of the attractions that Australia held out; and while the iron is hot, I think the Government should send some of our returned soldiers to America, Great Britain, France and other Allied countries to address associations of ex-soldiers of those countries and endeavour to induce the best of them to emigrate to Australia. We have a huge continent, as big as Europe, with only 5,000,000 people in it, and every immigrant we get will help to share the burden of debt which is now crushing us down. </para>

                        <para>- I do not ask the honorable member to eat it. I simply suggest that we should be- permitted to send horseflesh to countries where there is -a demand for it. I cannot follow the argument of the honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bamford.)</inline> that the exportation of horseflesh f romAustralia would destroy our beef trade. We export beef, mutton, pork, and rabbits; and a man who gets beef does not mistake it for pork or rabbit. Why should horseflesh be mistaken for beef, mutton, or rabbit ? Surely it can be easily distinguished. The exportation of, horseflesh would be one means of enabling us to decrease our great liability. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> there were 2,437,000 horses in Australia in 1916. Horses are useful until they are twelve years of age, after which they gradually decline so far as usefulness to man is concerned. Thus 8&#189; per cent., or 204,000, of our horses are put out of use each year, but these are mostly animals useful for fattening. If each horse should realize &#163;12, it would mean &#163;2,448,000 additional income derived by the people of Australia through the sale of horseflesh. </para>

In 1915, Australia exported 24,107 horses, valued at &#163;459,978, an average of about &#163;19 per head. Those were mostly horses suitable for coaches and gun teams, and the greater part of them were sent to India. </para>

                        <para>- We will not always be in the same position in regard to shipping. Normal conditions will soon be established, and then we ought to be able to send away horseflesh just as we send away other flesh. Before the introduction of motor cars, motor lorries, and railways, we had to depend upon horses for means of communication ; but every year now we find motor vehicles and railroads displacing these animals, and motor tractors replacing plough horses on farms. In future, the plough horse will be almost a thing of the past; and the question will be to what use our horses can be put. It is far easier to fatten a horse than to fatten a bullock. If a backward store bullock and a comparatively poor horse are put into a good paddock, the horse will be prime fat in two months, whereas it will take a year to fatten the bullock.. Each year a number of horses become crippled, or are put out of use from other causes. In times of drought they are shot. There is, at the present time, one of the worst droughts on record. Many teamsters and others have been spending every penny they possess in order to keep their horses in good condition; but now they have come to the limit of their means, and have been obliged to sacrifice their teams. By compelling the owners of these teams to slaughter their animals and bury them, Australia is losing wealth that otherwise might be a benefit to the community if the Government would only permit the export of horseflesh. In the far-back areas of some of the States there are a lot of brumbies running wild. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kidman</inline> stated in Sydney the other day that he is sending men out to shoot 2,000 of them, because they are a menace to his properties. I noticed the other day that the Police Department of New South Wales sold splendid horses in the township of Carcoar, about 8 miles from where I live, for as low as 5s. per head. I also noticed that a teamster in the township of Rockleigh, in the district of the honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nicholls),</inline> sold sixty splendid draught horses in good condition for &#163;5 per head, because he could not afford to buy fodder for them. The honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Foster)</inline> knows as well as I do that many people have turned their horses out, and that many others have died on their hands simply for the want of food, owing to the drought. If we had had a market for those horses before the drought reached the &#39; stage that it afterwards reached, they could all have been put to some commercial use. </para>

                <para>I was pleased to hear that the Government had decided to make a payment on account of the Wheat Pools. I cannot stress too emphatically the importance of the Government considering the present condition of the wheat-growers of Australia. The figures of production for the 1918-19 Pool are: New South &#34;Wales, 13,801,000 bushels; Victoria, 22,918,000 bushels; South Australia, 20,563,000 bushels; Western Australia, 7,341,000 bushels, or a total production of 64,623,000 bushels, a tremendous reduction on previous years. The local consumption of wheat in Australia, at 6 bushels <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> amounts, roughly, to 30,000,000 bushels. I cannot understand why the Government do not fix the price of wheat to the local millers on the parity of the price ruling abroad. Why should the millers be allowed to obtain wheat at 5s. per bushel, whereas the parity abroad, the f.o.b. price, is 8s. 6d. ? The millers .and local consumers should pay the full oversea parity for whatever wheat they consume. </para>

                        I have to intimate that, as it is considered that public requirements will he adequately met if the hours of attendance at the telephone office are fixed at three per diem, namely, from 9 a.m. to noon, Monday to Saturday, arrangements have been made accordingly, to take effect on and from the 22nd September, 1010.

                <para>That is the letter I received from the  Deputy  Postmaster-General for New South Wales. A similar reduction of hours has taken place in seventy odd telephone offices in the electorate of Macquarie. Three hours per day for the telephone is positively useless to the great bulk of country residents. The worker cannot use the telephone between 9 a.m. and noon, because he has to work from 8 a.m. till 5 p.m. The man working on the. land is usually busy from 6 in the morning till 6 at night, and it is not possible for him to leave his work to send a telephone message, so he has to let many important matters go in consequence. A farmer may be working 2 miles away from the post-office, and it is unreasonable to expect him to leave his work at 11 in the morning to telephone a firm about bags or other requirements before 12 noon. I admit, in fairness to the &#39;Postmaster-General, that regulations have been made whereby any person can send a telephone message after the fixed hours by paying a sum of, I think, 2s. 6d. for the first hour, . and an increased rate after that time. That extra charge goes to the postal attendant, and none of it goes into the funds of the Postal Department. The Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Webster)</inline> distinctly said this morning that the hours of country telephone services have been reduced in order to give the attendants at the various offices an increase in pay.  His  idea, therefore, is that if you reduce the hours of a servant you increase his pay! When the question of sweating was mentioned, the Minister said he was not sweating his employees, because he had reduced their hours from six and seven to three. </para>

                        <para>- No. Many of these officials work three hours per day for the Postmaster-General for an allowance of about 5s. per week, and the Postmaster-General says that is not sweating. He makes out that he is lenient to them, but they cannot take on any other positions, because they cannot fulfil their hours at other occupations. They have taken the telephone office on as a sideline, more for the convenience of the Postmaster-General and the public than for their own benefit and prosperity. The Postmaster-General knows that many of these country postal attendants are on the verge of making an application for an increase iri pay, and, in order to forestall them, he says, &#34; I will reduce the hours.&#34; Petition after petition has been forwarded to him, protesting against the reduction in the hours, but, his Department simply replies that under no circumstances can the conditions be. altered, because there is not sufficient revenue coming from the particular offices concerned to warrant the Postmaster-General in keeping them open for longer periods. I have written the Postmaster-General repeatedly on the. matter, and have not received a. satisfactory reply in a single instance. On each and every occasion he has said that owing, to the falling off of postal business in that locality the hours must be. reduced. I. do not altogether blame him for. this-, because, in the majority of. cases, he does. not. know the conditions which exist in those districts..

                        <para>- When criticism is directed against the administration of any Department the Minister controlling it. should be in the House. On several occasions when I have dealt with matters concerning the postal administration the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Webster)has</inline> been absent. The complaints I make are not imaginary or trivial grievances, and the least that can be expected of the Postmaster-General is that he shall attend in his place and listen to honorable members with a view to rectifying any wrong. Today the postal service in the country is much inferior to that in the. cities; and. I have every reason to believe that the Minister&#39;s own electorate receives far more consideration than do many other country electorates. </para>

                        <para>- It ought not to be, but it. is so. The Minister has introduced a system of economy-, either false or; real, which is causing inconvenience and hardship to many country residents: The reduction in the. hours of. post-offices and country telephone exchanges is not desired&#39; by the officials in those offices, because such reduction means lower wages. If the Postmaster-General had, in his desire to assist the employees, given an increase in. salaries and a smaller reduction of hours no complaint would have been made. I have pointed out previously that, in many country districts the men employed on the land cannot leave their work early in. order to go to a post-office and get in touch with the business people, and the result is that on many occasions- they are unable to place orders which are of great importance to them. If the- new system affected only a; few people no great exception could be taken to it, because I recognise that it would be hard to maintain elaborate postal facilities in every hole and corner of, Australia. But the majority of the places from which serious complaints&#39; come have fairly large populations, the&#39; bulk of whom are primary producers.. They are just as much entitled to consideration as are the city merchants. Upon no consideration, would the Post- master-Gen eral attempt to curtail the city postal and telephonic &#39;conveniences to the extent that he has done in the country. The reduction in &#34;the hours of country offices is a grave public scandal. For the last twelve months complaints have been made regarding the matter, but despite repeated applications to the Postal Department no satisfaction has been given; .the only answer of the Postmaster-General has been .that it is necessary for him to  economize  in his Department. Economy is being effected at the .expense and inconvenience of the .country producers. I am certain that all honorable members agree &#34;that the country telephonic and telegraphic facilities are inadequate, and that the  Postmaster-General  ought .to .extend them, in order to enable country people to conduct their business in the regular and convenient fashion. </para>

                <para>Some considerable time ago <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> asked in .the House whether the Government would consider -the .advisability of increasing the old-age pension. The reply <inline font-style="italic">2.</inline> received was that on account of serious financial obligations the Government could not see &#39;their way clear ito grant such an increase. The consequence is that the old-age pensioner is still obliged to live upon :a paltry pittance. The original pension was 10s. per week, which, on account of the high cost of living and other altered conditions, was increased about three or four years ago to 12s. 6d. per week. If the pensioner was entitled to that increase three years ago he is certainly entitled to another increase of 5s. at the present time. I have prepared a list of the necessary commodities that the pensioner can purchase with his allowance of 12s. 6d. per week, and I feel sure that it is applicable to nine out of ten cases. The first outgoing which he has to meet, if he does not live in a tent, is rent, for which I have allowed 2s. 6d. as a minimum. </para>

                        <para>- Those who are wholly dependent upon their pensions cannot pay more. For meat I have allowed 3s. 9d. per week, bread ls., sugar 7d., tea 9d., tobacco ls., newspaper 6d., fuel 2s. Those items total 12s. Id. per week. No honorable member will deny that those are bare necessities. No pensioner should be expected to live within those limits of expenditure, but that is as far as the pension will enable Trim to go. With an additional 5s. per week the pensioners could buy only -vegetables, clothes, and blankets. They -could not afford to pay more than 2s. for vegetables and another 2s. &#39;for blankets and clothes. Consequently even with a pension of 5s. they -would be in pitiable circumstances. If the Government can recklessly spend money - and nobody can deny that that has been done - they ought to be able to give to these old people who have &#34;blazed the track &#34; the means of reasonably comfortable living. Many of the old people who to-day are receiving 12s. 6d. per week are justly entitled to considerably more for-the labour they performed in the early days of Australia. I have -visited many of these old people and noted &#39;the conditions under which they live. No honorable member would care to see his -relatives living under the -same conditions. </para>

                        <para>- Very often that is the case. It is the&#34; -duty of the Government to protect as far as possible those old men and women who have pioneered this country. The 10s. per week paid when the pensions were first instituted was more beneficial than <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> at the present time, in view of the decreased purchasing power of money. It may be said by some that these old people should utilize their energies and time in gardening, and so forth. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. Then, again, if any -old-age pensioner happens to get a job at 21s. or 22s. a week his pension is stopped. I have known repeated cases of old ladies drawing a pension for four or five years, and it then being discovered that their husbands, up to the last twelve months of the period, had been earning &#163;2 or &#163;1 10s. per &#34;week. When the husband himself applied for a pension it was in many cases granted, but the amount overdrawn by his wife was deducted. There are many cases of pensioners living on 18s. or 19s. a fortnight, simply because of an error of this kind made in the early stages. I hope the  claims of the old-age pensioners will receive more careful consideration than in the past. </para>

                <para>I should now like to refer briefly to the pensions being- meted out to our returned soldiers. In many cases these pensions are satisfactory, but in others much hardship is involved. If a man returns from the Front minus a leg or an arm, he really is totally incapacitated, because he would find it impossible to compete with the average worker on the labour market. The pension allowed to a single man for an injury of this kind is 22s. 6d. per week, which is totally inadequate to maintain him. Of course,&#39; if he is a married man a certain allowance is made for his wife and each of his children; but the single man is certainly not compensated for the hardships that he has undergone. Such men ought to be given sufficient to maintain them in common decency, and I hope their case &#34;will receive more favorable consideration. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened with great interest to the. discussion, from which I gather that the great desire of honorable members is to insure the &#39;prosperity of Australia. Prosperity, in my opinion, can only be created by a thorough organization of our methods of production, and it is my intention this afternoon to suggest to the Government that they should deal  Avith  a question which will have to be&#39; dealt with at an early stage if we are to progress as we desire. I refer to the provision of better means of communication with the Old World by cable, or, preferably, by wireless. This is a subject to which 1  have given much attention, and I have arrived at the opinion that we could encourage commerce and create trade within our shores if we had better and cheaper means of communication. That we have not proper means at the present time was clearly demonstrated during the recent terrible war, when we found our cables very much congested, and business consequently considerably hampered. It was impossible to communicate with any promptitude with those people abroad who are desirous of obtaining our products. The three cables over which all our messages must go are quite inadequate even in normal times such as we may expect. The splendid work done by our men at the Front, in protecting France, Belgium, and Australia, have given us an advertisement such as we never had before, and I am convinced that our population is going to increase and our commerce grow. We should be in no way hampered by inadequate means of communication, and no one can deny that the cable service, is now not only inadequate, but too costly. The charge for cable messages to the United Kingdom is 3s. a word; to France it is 3s. 6d. by the Pacific route, and 3s. by the Eastern; to Italy, by the Pacific, 3s. 9d., by the Eastern, 3s.; to Spain and Portugal, by the Pacific, 4s. 0&#189;d., and 4s. Id., and by the Eastern, 3s.; to China, by the Pacific, 6s. lid., by the Eastern, 2s. 6d.; to Japan, by the Pacific, 7s. 4&#189;d., by the Eastern, 3s. 8d.; to India, the Pacific offers no&#39; service, and the charge by the Eastern, the only route, is 2s. 6d. ; to Java, by the Pacific, 6s. 10d., by the Eastern, 2s. 6d.; to Egypt, bv the only route available, the charge is 3s. 5d. ; to South Africa, the lowest charge is 2s. 2d. ; to Canada, by the Pacific, 2s. 4d.; and to the United States of America, 2s. 4d. If by . any chance our line to Canada were to break down, there is only the costly United States route at 4s, The charge to South America is from 3s. l|d. to 9s. 3&#189;d. per word. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>We have already worked up a big trade with many of these countries I have mentioned, particularly Java,- and that trade will go on increasing. The energetic people of Australia are intensely interested in the development of the eastern tinfields, and they have been well rewarded for their courage. -in undertaking the venture. With South America, again, better communication is necessary. It would &#39;be invaluable to business people. We hope to build up a very big trade with China; but our means of communication with that country is not what it should be. It is of no use for us to send out Trade Commissioners to other countries if we are not able to assure business men that there is at their disposal an easy means of communication with those countries. The cost of procuring goods is charged to the consumer eventually, and the cost of our communication with the Old World adds materially &#39;to our cost of living. In my opinion, the time has arrived when, by the appointment of a commission of experts, or some other means, steps should be taken by the Government to bring about the establishment of commercial wireless in Australia. Speaking from memory, I think that for the last ten years there &#39; has been communication established by a wireless system between Ireland and Canada, and there is now also a system working from Carnarvon, in Wales, to New Jersey, in the United States of America. The latter system is worked, not only with wireless apparatus, but is connected up with land lines, and it is possible now to send a telegraphic message from London to New York in the course of a few minutes. It is difficult to say what might have happened during the war had it not been for the existence of this splendid means of communication &#39;between the United Kingdom and the United States of America. </para>
                <para>We have practically no commercial wireless system established in Australia. Some honorable members may consider that the establishment of such a system is impracticable; but wireless telegraphy has long gone past the experimental stage. One of Marconi&#39;s engineers has made a most wonderful discovery. He has found that what is known as static electricity, or the disturbance of the ether by lightning, operates vertically, whilst the current sent out by ether waves operates horizontally. This engineer has invented a most wonderful machine, now part of the wireless apparatus, which prevents the static electricity - the high potential lightning current - from interfering at any time with the electrical current generated and used for wireless telegraphy. When the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> was in the Old Country, he was able to send a message to Australia traversing approximately 12,000 miles, by means of this wonderful system. Its development here would considerably reduce the cost of our communication with the Old World. It is difficult to estimate what it would mean to the business people of Australia, and to consumers in this country, if Ave  could bring down the- cost of living by the adoption of scientific means of communication of this kind. In proof of what I am saying, I quote the following statement reported to have been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Godfrey</inline> . Isaacs, managing director of the Marconi Company:- </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Assuming a distance of 6,000 or 12,000 miles, and a traffic of 10,000 words a day, at the rate of 2s. a word, that would give the wireless a very handsome profit. So soon as possible the rate would be reduced to ls. 6d. a word, and he believed that the traffic would correspondingly increase, and/ would reach nearly 20,000 words a day. When it reached 40,000 words a day,, a ls. rate would be introduced, and when it reached SO.,000 words a day, a rate of 3d. per word would be charged, and would give the same receipts as the 2s. rate, and the 3d. rate would compare with the 3s. per word cable rate of to-day for such a volume of business. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That demonstrates the value of the adoption of this scientific means of communication. Are we in Australia going to stand still in this matter? I am not concerned as to who controls the wireless system; but surely the Government are not going to adopt  a dog-in-the-manger policy. If they will not undertake this important work themselves, they should let some one else undertake it. I do not know how far the Marconi Company may be protected in their possession of the highly scientific machinery I have referred to; but they seem to have been the principal electrical engineers who had the courage to devote their time and money to experimenting with a view to making possible the efficient wireless communication to which I, have referred. I can quite understand that the Commonwealth Government could not afford to go in for such elaborate experiments as the Marconi Company have undertaken. In the first place, the Government have not &#39; at their disposal the necessary highly qualified engineers, whilst at the head of the Marconi Company there is the inventor of the wireless system, or the man who put to practical use the discovery made by another very brilliant man. many years ago, and made it possible to have communication on land and sea without metallic connexion. I ask the Government to give this matter their earnest consideration. The Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> reminds me that it is desired to .finish the consideration of the Bill this afternoon, and I shall, therefore, be very brief in what I have to say. . </para>

                <para>Mr.LAIRD SMITH.- That may be so, butthat&#39; cutting in was stopped during the war. The Government could take power by Act of Parliament, &#39; not only to fix the rate per word to be charged, but to impose certain restrictions. I fail to understand how it would be possible for the Government to control the monopoly here. It would be necessary for them to have a world monopoly, but they can have no influence or control outside Australia. </para>
                <para class="block">We are told by scientists of the day that improvements in wireless telephony are such that we shall be able within the next six months to speak with London. A few days ago an aeronaut flying at an altitude of 5,000 feet over New York was able by means of wireless telephony, to speak with people in the streets of that city. Instead of trying to block scientists in every way, we ought to encourage them to continue their excellent work. My views with regard to Government monopolies are well known. Every great enterprise likely to become a monopoly should, in my opinion, be controlled -by the State ; but I am not going to stand by the State when it . attempts to stem the tide of progress by &#39;preventing the establishment of a scientific industry in our midst. I hope that Ministers will : give this matter the consideration that it warrants. My only regret is that my time is so limited that I cannot deal fully with it. I have made electricity a life-long study, and keep myself in touch with every advancement made. </para>
                <para>I do not agree with the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pigott)</inline> that, because of our war liabilities, people who come here are likely to be overburdened with debt. Those who settle in Australiawill be as free from debt and as well off as any people in the world. If we let it go forth that this is the best country in which to settle, we shall secure all the immigrants we want. </para>
                <para>I was delighted to hear the Minister in charge of Shipping <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> say this morning, in answer to a question, that the Government were taking action with the object of &#39;retaining our coastal shipping. Tasmania has suffered more than enough by reason of the shortage of shipping, but it would have suffered far more if ordinary competition had been allowed to continue, and ship-owners had been free to withdraw their vessels from the Australian coastal service. I do not criticise the Government because of any shortage of shipping from which we have suffered, because I realize that, had our Inter-State shipping been open to the competition of the world, and free from Government control, it would not have remained here. As the result of the action taken, by the Government, we secured a much better service than would otherwise have been possible. I hope that by amicable arrangement with the shipping companies, they will be able to insure to the island State of which I am a representative, as well as to other parts of the Commonwealth whose trade and . commerce depend so largely upon shipping facilities, the means of communication necessary to enable us to get our products to market. </para>

                <para>This amendment will allow honorable members an opportunity to vote on the question of whether there should be a further inquiry into the purchase of the Shaw Wireless Works. It will be remembered that, as the result of an inquiry which took place last year, the honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jensen),</inline> then Minister for Trade and Customs, was gazetted out of office, and that a member of another place, who was also a representative of Tasmania, resigned his seat. The inquiry on that occasion was a secret one, and we have not had an opportunity to discuss the report of the Commission which conducted it. In submitting it to the House and moving that it he printed, the then Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> made a speech, and was followed later by the honorable member for Bass, who defended himself from the imputations made against him in the report. No other honorable member, however, had -an opportunity to deal with it. I moved the adjournment of the debate on themotion&#34;That the report be printed,&#34; and since then the question has not been before this Parliament. I maintain that we have a right to deal with it. The report was more widely read by honorable members than any other report that has been presented to this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, when they were purchased by the Hughes Cabinet, some time during 1916, and that is why we desire a full inquiry. The Minister for Works and Railways has stated that our letter was not received by the Government until about the 24th March. Immediately the Government announced their intention of not holding any further inquiry, the letter I have read was despatched to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> who was in the country, and it took some time to obtain his signature. It did not arrive in Melbourne promptly, but so soon as it did it was signed by the others, and forwarded to the then Acting Prime Minister. . The communication was sent after the Government had decided that no further inquiry should be held. We ask for a full and open inquiry, because we consider we are entitled to it. I have nothing to conceal in connexion with this or any other transaction that took place while I was a member of that Cabinet, and the same applies to the other members. I hope there will be a full and open inquiry, because the Government cannot afford to allow the matter to stand where it is. </para>

                <para>A question was asked the other day. as to whether the report of Admiral Jellicoe on the wireless installation in Sydney, could not be made public. At the present juncture I am not concerned very much whether the purchase of the Shaw Wireless Works was a good or a bad bargain, but I am concerned with the honour of members of Parliament. It is right to have a full and proper investigation, and that no suspicion should rest on any member of the late Cabinet. Every member should be given an opportunity of clearing himself, and thus preventing any suspicion resting upon him. Ex-Senator Long, who has already gone out of public life, is anxious that further inquiry should be made. He said that until the report was presented he did not know the nature of the evidence given against him. </para>

                    <para>.- The request of. the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> is that there should be a further inquiry into the purchase of the Shaw Wireless Works which, as he pointed out, was effected in August, 1916, when he and the colleagues he has mentioned were members of the Cabinet. In reply, I would remind the honorable member that, in the first place, the Commission was appointed under the Royal Commissions Act, and had full and complete power to conduct the inquiry to the fullest possible extent. The Commission had power to call such witnesses as it desired, and to conduct its proceedings as it thought fit. In exercising its discretion, the Commission decided to examine witnesses <inline font-style="italic">in camera,</inline> but, after taking evidence, the facts elicited and the evidence were made public. </para>

                        <para>- I was just about to explain that. It was subsequently that the honorable member for Bass addressed the House, and a long debate took place in the Senate, and afterwards the Government reconsidered the matter in order to ascertain if there was any justification for. further inquiry regarding the transaction. It came to the conclusion, after consulting with the law authorities, who were given a free hand in the matter, that no such justification existed. The Royal Commission had absolute control of the conduct of its inquiry. It had the fullest authority under the Royal Commissions Act to make the most complete investigation, and in order to assist . it to do so the Government, at the request of the  Chairman,  had placed at its disposal, the services of the Assistant Crown Solicitor, and eminent counsel in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> E. Starke. The object of the Government was to have : the fullest investigation made. After the House adjourned at the end of last year, Cabinet again referred the case to the Commonwealth&#39;s legal advisers &#39;to see whether any advantage would be gained by a further inquiry regarding the transaction, and whether it was at all possible to elicit further facts that would elucidate the matter, or furnish additional information.. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Starke</inline> replied that the &#39;Royal Commission on the Administration of the Navy Department had made a complete and exhaustive inquiry, and that he was still of the same opinion as previously,and that he could not suggest any line of inquiry that might elicit further information. </para>

                    <para>At the request of the Government, eminent counsel and the Assistant Grown Solicitor, who both assisted the Commissioner throughout, the whole of the examination, have considered the question of a further investigation. Their opinion having only just reached the Attorney-General&#39;s Department, Cabinet this week carefully reviewed the whole question. Counsel advised that the. matter had been completely and exhaustively investigated, and that there were no further lines of inquiry which would be likely to elicit any fresh facts. Cabinet therefore approved of the recommendation of the Acting Attorney-General that no further inquiry should be held. The position of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long,</inline> however, as announced by me in the House, was specially referred to counsel and. the Assistant Crown Solicitor to consider and. advise as to whether the evidence disclosed any facts which would justify or demand action in a Court of law. Counsel on this question advised that a prosecution would not succeed; and Cabinet accordingly decided that no further action he taken. </para>

I have read a good deal about this case, and the names of men have been mentioned in connexion with it in such a way as to suggest wrongdoing on their part. I refuse to believe that they have been guilty of any wrongdoing whatever. It is very easy to understand why people mention the names of members of Parliament so lightly.

                <para>From the very inception of this trouble, the action of the Government has been questionable. When the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper . published a series of articles, drawing attention to the report of the Commission which investigated the affairs of the Navy and Defence Departments, and asked what action the Government proposed to take in regard to the Minister who bad spent money in opposition to the recommendation of the Naval Board, Ministers pretended that they did not know who was the Minister referred to. But they knew all the time. The then Acting Prime Minister knew all the time. I invite honorable members to read a speech upon this matter, which was delivered in the Senate last session by Senator Gardiner. There they will find that, according to the evidence given by a man named Augustine Carroll before the Commission which inquired into the purchase of the Shaw Wireless Works, the then Acting Prime Minister had been made acquainted with the charges preferred against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen.</inline> That man went before the Commission and told the Commission his story. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> said - </para>

The honorable member refused to bring the matter up in the House because it was said - I am speaking from memory - that he was on the same side as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen</inline> in &#39;the conscription campaign, and did not care to do it. That is what Carroll says. Then, after the honorable member for Balaclava entered the Government, Carroll said that he declined to bring the matter up because he was a colleague of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen&#39;s.</inline> Carroll, it appears, for some reason, went to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen&#39;s</inline> office, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen</inline> arranged to have a couple of detectives there to hear what he had to say. Carroll went to a solicitor and put his case before him, and the solicitor advised Carroll to go to the Commission and tell all he knew. He went to the Commission and told his story. Why was the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> not called by the Commission to ascertain what truth there was in Carroll&#39;s statements ? We have no evidence that he went before the Commission. Apparently he was not called. Here is the singular part of the thing: <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> E. Starke was engaged either by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen</inline> or by&#39; the Government to go to the Commission and cross-examine Carroll. </para>

                        <para>- All these things show the need for an open inquiry. The Commission consisted of three business men, with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McBeath,</inline> a member of a Flinders-lane firm, as  chairman.  None of those gentlemen had any legal knowledge, and there we had the spectacle of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Starke</inline> on one side and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cussen</inline> on the other, arguing as to what these gentlemen ought to admit in the way of evidence. I venture to say that they admitted as evidence statements which would not be admitted by a High Court Judge or any other Judge trained in the knowledge and administration of the law. It appears that Carroll has been described by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Starke,</inline> according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> as &#34; an unmitigated liar.&#34; Yet he has: been allowed to. get away from Australia to.

                    <para>.- I desire to refer to a subject upon which I have been fighting the Government for the past three years at least. I had proposed to move the adjournment of the House about a fortnight ago, but I was dissuaded at the earnest solicitation of Ministers, who gave the assurance that the matter at issue would be dealt with at once. I deferred taking action then, but I feel now that it is impossible to permit the present condition of affairs to continue. I would have liked to venture a few words of appreciation upon the work of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook at the Peace Conference, but at this late hour I will not delay honorable members further than to say that now that those gentlemen are home again, it is surely time we reverted to constitutional methods of government. So soon as the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy had returned to this Parliament the time was ripe for the presentation of a Ministerial statement respecting transactions undertaken in the Old Country - the purchase of ships, the contemplated actions of the Government in regard to that purchase, and contracts made with the Imperial Government in wool, wheat, metals, &#38;c. This Parliament has certain powers, and it should exercise them. Parliament should be, and must be, consulted. We have gone too far; we have been drifting all the tune. If we are to have a Czar, an autocrat, here - doing as he likes without consulting Parliament - it is surely time for Parliament to take action, or else to say to the Prime Minister, &#34; We are quite satisfied, and are perfectly willing, to permit you to do as you wish without seeking parliamentary authority at all.&#34; </para>

                <para>I desire to refer specifically to the . refusal of the Government to permit the export of base metals. We are informed that it is the policy of the Government that, so far as possible, Australia shall be self-supporting. We are told that we should try to build up our manufactures, and to utilize our base metals to promote the industries of Australia. That has been the policy of the Government for the past four years. Surely at some time or other during that period the Government could have, and should have, introduced a Bill,or framed certain regulations&#39;, for the control of the base-metal output. Surely this Parliament should have been consulted, should have been informed, of the purposes and ambitions of the Government. The Commonwealth Parliament could have passed legislation to confer upon the Government the necessary power to do what they sought to do. But the Government say they will not permit any one in Australia to trade in base metal ores without their permission, and then only through certain Combines. We, in Western Australia, have had to send our copper right away from the north-west coast to the eastern coast for treatment. Is there any shortage of copper on this side of Australia for the. building up of industries? Is the policy of the Government aimed at such a purpose? At a time when copper was quoted at more than &#163;100 per ton, 11 per cent, ore was shipped from Whim Creek to Port Kembla. It did not even pay the cost of treatment ,aud transit, although worth &#163;11 per ton, and men have been turned out of work. The mine has been closed down; hundreds are out of employment. Is it fair that men should be encouraged to put money into ventures away in the far north-west of Australia and be treated in this manner, and that, then, the Government should say, &#34; We will smother you; not because we desire to destroy industries, but because we want to hand these metals over to the manipulator and the exploiter &#34; ? For those are the people into whose hands our output of base metals is being delivered. On the other hand, surely some special concession might have been made to retain a white -population in the far north. </para>
                <para>I told honorable members some little while ago about men who had discovered a magnificent lead deposit in Western Australia. There have been very heartening particulars in the press during the past day or two regarding a discovery of gold in the Hampton Plains district. Honorable members are always glad to hear &#39;of new discoveries, knowing that they mean production and development. With respect to the lead deposit, I have visited the mine, which i&#167; situated some 80 or 90 miles north of Geraldton. Out of a small pot-hole - for they have not gone down more than about 40 feet - the parties working there have taken out about &#163;70,000 worth of ore in less than three .years, hut their profit has been less than &#163;4,000. </para>

                        <para>- The manipulators L The men owning this lead mine informed me that they have now an English buyer for their ore. They are prepared&#39; to put on 100 hands immediately. Large numbers of men are out of employment. We, in Western Australia, are suffering from depression. Why cannot we secure the requisite permit for export to Great Britain? What parliamentary authority have the Government to prohibit permission? <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Higgins, apparently, rules the Government in regard to all these matters. The Government delay, and delay, and delay; and they ask us to sit quiet. They ask us to keep our faith, and to wait and see! I would not mind if Parliament were to say, &#34;We will not permit metals to be exported from Australia while they are wanted for the development of local industries.&#34; Nearly every honorable member of this House has received a copy of a document issued by the Mine Managers Association of Western Australia, wherein the owners of. certain tin mines show that &#163;21 a ton has been lost to them, and has gone to the manipulators on this side of the Commonwealth. The parties on this side are not asking for what the Government are forcing us to send them. From Queensland the same complaint as that which I have to voice on behalf of Western Australia may be heard. The Cobar Smelters  Association works have been compelled to close down. They have established their own smelters and their own electrolytic plant. They could export electrolytic copper. Theassociation sent a letter to the Government indicating that they would be compelled to put off large numbers of men, not only from their own property, but from a number of small mines dependent upon them for the purchase -of their ore output. They referred to the losses accruing to the State through the non-transit of goods over the railways - fuel, timber, and the like. All they asked&#39;, for was the right to sell their copper ; but they could not get a permit. They were given to understand that they would have to sell through the Copper Producers Association. Why should they be compelled to hand over the control of their mine and its output &#39;to any outside body?&#34; Had time permitted me to go fully into- this question, I would have moved for a reduction of &#163;100,000 upon the proposed vote; and, thus, I would have compelled honorable members to arrive at a definite decision. Protests have emanated from practically every State: from Tasmania in regard to its tin; from Queensland with respect to copper ores; and from New South &#34;Wales and Western Australia. It is for honorable members to say whether they consider the Government justified in refusing, time after time, to grant permits. </para>

                    Higgins has acted as adviser to the Government. Who is this gentleman? He is the man who, while financial adviser to the Government, strongly recommended the purchase, for &#163;110,000, of the Blythe River iron deposits. I have before me a letter in which he points out how satisfied he is in regard to the value of this property.

                        <para>- In every instance tin and copper were to be sold to approved countries. We never asked for anything else. We were agreeable that the Government should make any regulations they chose as to whether the copper should go to England, France, or America. But we did complain of the injustice of compelling us to pay &#163;500 to join the Copper Producers&#39; Association., to pay that body 1 per cent, for handling our ore, and to bind ourselves to allow them to make our contracts for the next fifty years. I have produced the correspondence and agreement in proof of my statement. It was unfair that any company should be compelled to join the Copper Producers&#39; Association on pain of being denied the opportunity to sell their product. I have been fighting this matter for three years, and only an hour ago I was assured that the matter would be considered by the Government at the earliest possible moment. </para>

                        <para>- That is not a fact, but I do not wish the honorable member to misunderstand me. The Whim Creek copper mine had been exporting ore to England for many years. About 80,000 tons of hand-picked ore had been sent to Great Britain, and, with the profits, the company built a railway to the coast, and set up a special leaching plant, at a cost of about &#163;80,000. That  plant  proved a failure. Later, when the manager went to Sydney he consulted engineers by whom,  special  tests were made with the oxides from Whim Creek. As a result he was under the impression that if the company could find money for the purpose of erecting another plant on the design recommended in Sydney, they would be enabled to treat the enormous body of 7 and 8 per cent, oxidized ore, now lying in the dumps, the surplus left after the hand picking. About two years ago, while the war was still in progress and this country was supplying copper to Japan, the company asked to be allowed to send their ore to that country for treatment. It must be remembered that the Government were selling zinc, lead, and copper to Japan at the time, and had they acceded . to the request made I am satisfied that the profits from the treatment of the ore would have proved sufficient to erect a new plant and afforded employment for 400 or 500 men .to-day. But the Government refused, and insisted on the ore being sent to Kembla, and the&#39; 11 per cent, ore sent showed a direct loss. </para>

                    <para>The results from the various underground workings are especially disappointing. The &#34; middle &#34; tunnel results simply substantiate the poor opinion formed of this portion of the outcrop from surface inspection, and the same may even be said of the &#34; river &#34; tunnel. Some of the ore in the &#34; upper &#34; tunnel, however, looked fairly, good, and some nice clean ore is showing in one or two places on the surface immediately over the tunnel; the results go a long way towards proving the irregularity and non-continuity of the better grade of ore exposed on the surface to the south-west, and also that shown in sample trench &#34; B &#34; to the north-east. </para>

I do say, however, that there is an outcry from every State in regard to the action taken by the advisers of the Government in controlling these industries. Had the Government framed regulations - had they passed legislation which would give them effective control - no one would have complained, because Parliament would then have been responsible. But, time after time we find business of this kind . completed in a hole-and-corner method. When Ministers are interrogated we are told that the business is of a secret nature, and cannot be disclosed to the public. What reason can there be for that attitude ? It is impossible there can be any reason to justify the Government in acting as they are doing at the present time. </para>

                        <para>-In any case, where was the harm, so long as the goods went to an approved country.? A Metal Exchange has been created, and such an exchange I approve; but will honorable members believe that I got from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran the articles of association of the Exchange only on the condition that they were regarded as confidential. No person is allowed to sell ore except through the Exchange. Why did the Government not come and ask Parliament to give them power to make that regulation <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> We have had the Cobar Smelters Associated Company, month after month, writing to the Government merely asking permission to sell .their copper to approved countries. Why should that company give to an outside organization absolute control over their business for 50 years ? I do not think that honorable members realize what the position means. The leading metal organizations in Australia were called to a conference in the Attorney-General&#39;s room, for the purpose of forming a Combine, but the Broken Hill and Mount Lyell companies objected to join the Zinc Producers&#39; Association. They would have to pay &#163;500 to join the association, and 1 per cent, for the handling of the ores, and at the same time leave the association the whole power to make contracts and fix prices, not for the duration of the war, but for a period of fifty years. However, they were forced to join. They are doing the same with copper, and are trying to do the same with tin. </para>

                        <para>- We shall find some method of dealing with the matter. If the hour had not been so late I had intended to move a reduction, of the proposed vote by &#163;100,000, to secure attention being given to this matter. I shall not do that now, but I hope that what I have said will make the Government realize that strong exception is taken to the course they have followed. I trust also that in this matter Parliament will assume the responsibility which properly belongs to it. During the war I was prepared to excuse the Government for doing many things with which I did not concur, but now that the war is over the position is  entirely changed, and there can be no justification for the Government continuing to deal with the metal industry in the manner in which they have dealt with it. I had the promise of the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> that as soon as the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> re- . turned this matter would be settled. I remind Ministers that no good can result from asking the people of Western Australia to send their ores over here, and to continue to insist that they shall do so will only make enemies for the Government in Western Australia. I conclude by expressing the hope that the Government will give this matter favorable consideration without further delay. I am sorry to have been compelled to delay honorable members on this occasion, but Ministers are aware that I have felt very strongly upon these matters for a long time, and things cannot be allowed to remain as they are at present. </para>

                    <para>Great Britain is resuming trade relations with Germany, and we are told that some of our raw material is going there for certain purposes. Why, then, should this man be deported? He has been a good citizen, and is married to an Australian girl, whose mother fostered three Australian soldiers, one of whom was killed at the Front.  Her  family is well known in Williamstown, and there is no doubt as to the loyalty of every member of it.  Her  husband does not know why he is to be deported, and I fail to understand why the Government should be prepared in this way. to separate husbands and wives. This young woman does not desire to go to Germany. She was bom here, and, as a matter of fact, I understand she will  not accompany her husband. Are husband and wife to be separated and divorced because of action taken, without warrant, by the Government? Some common sense should bo displayed in dealing with these matters. I hope die Minister will promise to inquire into this case, and to secure leniency for this man if he &#39;has not committed any heinous crime. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; and his case has been dealt with. I do not ask that any alien who has proved himself to he an enemy to Australia, in the true sense of the word, should be allowed to remain here; but I think it is foolish to deport men who have been taunted into making rash statements. For instance, I know a German who came to Australia many years ago because he objected to the Prussian system of government.&#39;&#39; After the war broke out he was constantly taunted - told that the British were going to smash the Germans, and that he could not stand up against an Australian. He showed that he could do so, and, as a result, was deported. I hope the Minister will look into these matters. </para>

                        <para>.- I understood the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> a few minutes ago to say something of a personal nature regarding myself, and I, consequently, answered in vigorous language. I understand, however, that he did not intend to be in any way personal. </para>

                            <para>- I accept the honorable gentleman&#39;s withdrawal. I want to say, with all earnestness, that the people are tired of the smothering up that goes on in connexion with so-called public inquiries. They are not content with what has happened in regard to the Yates case, the Watson case, or the Shaw wireless purchase case. I am prepared to resign my seat and to contest an election with any Minister on the question of whether or not these secret tribunals should not be opened up in the name of justice. </para>

                    <para>As to the Shaw wireless case, I believe that Father Shaw died either as the result of violence or the administration of poison. I ask the Minister to have the remains of the deceased gentleman exhumed, so that it may be ascertained whether he died as the result of a foul blow or from poison. There are in this community religious men who share my opinion as to the causes leading up to Father Shaw&#39;s death. Shooting cases are far too frequent in Melbourne, and no man can draw a fairly  large  sum out of a bank without that fact being fairly well known to one or other of &#39;the gangs that infest our city. </para>
                    <para>If a. public inquiry is not made now into the purchase of the Shaw Wireless Works, such an investigation will be ordered by the next Parliament, because the people will not be humbugged in this way. Any one who reads <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> speech on the subject, or the records, will agree that the evidence given before the Board would not have been admitted in any Court of law. Imagine a man saying that he knew what occurred in a certain Sydney hotel at a time when he was in Melbourne. </para>
                    <para>Did not the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> say he would make ex-Senator Watson prove his statements&#39; concerning the Ready case in open Court? I am willing to give any member of the Ministry an opportunity to contest my seat on the question of whether or not this matter should not be inquired into in open Court by a member of the Supreme Court Bench. </para>
                    <para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para>
