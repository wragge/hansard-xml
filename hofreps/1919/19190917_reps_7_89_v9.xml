                        <para>- I desire to make a personal explanation. In the course of my speech in moving, on Wednesday last, that the House approve of the Peace Treaty, I quoted from memory some figures relating to reparation. I find that the figures I gave were not those which were in my notes. I, therefore, desire to make a correction, to which I shall ask the press to give the widest publicity. I also ask the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> to make a special note of it. Instead of stating that Australia's war expenditure amounted to £300,000,000, and that the capitalized value of pensions, &amp;c., was £54,000,000, I should have said that our actual war expenditure was £364,000,000, and that the capitalized value of pensions, repatriation, loss to civilians, and civilian property, &amp;c., incidental to the war, amounted to  £100,000,000. As the matter is of vital importance to Australia, and is entirely non-party, I have, with the permission of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. 'Speaker,</inline> already made the necessary corrections inHansard. </para>

                        </talker>
                        <para>- I desire to announce that  His Excellency  the Governor-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ronald</inline> Munro Ferguson, accompanied by  Her Excellency  Lady Munro Ferguson and representatives of the British and Foreign Bible Society of Victoria, assembled in the north lobby of Parliament House on Friday afternoon for the purpose of presenting to the Commonwealth Parliament a Bible and lectern from the Bible Society as a souvenir of the signing" of Peace. Their Excellencies were received by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> on behalf of the Parliament, and by Chaplain-General Rentoul, D.D., and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> M. Griffiths on behalf of the British and Foreign Bible . Society. The following' is the official report of the proceedings:- "HIS EXCELLENCY, in making the presentation, said - It is my privilege to present this copy of the Scriptures to the Commonwealth Parliament on behalf of the Bible Society, an organization which has a long, and illustrious history. No doubt many members of Parliament are familiar with the works of the society's greatest colporteur, George Borrow, and have read his celebrated book, <inline font-style="italic">The Bible in Spain.</inline> In his day, centuries ago, the need for the activities of the Bible Society were very apparent, and evidenced by the story of one great coal master betting another that he could not say the Lord's Prayer, and paying the forfeit when his friend triumphantly vindicated his knowledge by repeating the 23rd psalm. In contrast to this we can trace in the most mundane deliverances of a hustled and bustled Prime Minister evidences of familiarity with . Bible language, without which no man can measure the strength,' flexibility, the majesty and rhythm of the English tongue. I come from a country where, as in Wales, the Bible -has played a great part in moulding national character and stimulating the intellectual development of the people. Scotland has, no doubt, had other pre-occupations - she has never neglected a bawbee - but she owes her moral stability and her attachment to the eternal verities to the fact that for centuries the Bible has been the standard work in the home and in the school. The Bible Society and parliamentary government are typically British institutions. One strives to promote the good of man and of the nation by implanting high ideals in the heart of the individual, and the other by engrafting such ideals and giving them permanence in the laws of the country. It is fitting, therefore, that this Book should be given, by the Bible Society to Parliament to stand in its Library as a symbol of the copartnership of two forces working in very different fields for the good of the country and the uplift of national life. <inline font-weight="bold">"Mr. SPEAKER (Hon. W. Elliot Johnson),</inline> in accepting the gift, said Your  Excellency  and representative's of the Victorian branch of the British and Foreign Bible Society: I desire to express, on behalf of honorable members, a deep appreciation of the handsome gift of this beautifully-bound copy of the Bible and the appropriately-designed lectern accompanying it. Not only will the Bible, with its historical inscription, be a valued and distinctive addition to the Commonwealth Library, but it will stand as a constant reminder of the fact that its presentation was 'associated with the restoration of a condition of peace following upon four years and a half of unprovoked warfare, waged with relentless ferocity and unparalleled cruelty and inhumanity against peacefully disposed countries by a nation intoxicated with the mad lust of power, ambition, and world conquest. </para>

                    <para>A gigantic world-encompassing conflict was precipitated as the ultimate consequence of. the vicious ethical and moral  training of the people of Germany, and flagrant disregard of the principles and noble Christian ideals enshrined within the covers of this sacred Book. </para>
                    <para>Honorable members generally, I am sure, heartily appreciate the gift, and the spirit by which it was prompted. May I express the hope that it will ever serve to inspire us all in the performance of our duties as legislators to strive to mould the destinies of Australia in harmony with its great ideals, its lessons, and its precepts. I commend to the earnest consideration of honorable members, before they return to the chamber to renew their legislative duties, a quotation inscribed on the cover, from a psalm with which, doubtless, many, if not all, of them are familiar - </para>
                    <para>Beholdhow good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity. "The PRIME MINISTER <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> - Your <inline font-weight="bold">Excellency, Mr. President,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.-I</inline> feel ill-equipped to speak those words that ought to be spoken upon such an occasion as this. Whatever gifts of speech I may have, are, I fear, utterly unsuited to serve my present purpose; but, on behalf of my fellowmembers,I desire to say as well as I can how much we appreciate this manifestation of that which  His Excellency  has signalized as the joy which is in the hearts of himself and of the people of Australia, of the Empire, and of the world, that Peace has come at last. </para>
                    <para>In what concrete form could he have expressed that joy which would be one-half so suited to the occasion as in the presentation of this Bible? " On earth peace, good-will toward men !" That is in our hearts; and that is our purpose. The Australian nation - emerging as it is after dreadful trials in the Valley of the Shadow of Death.; and, turning its face towards the rising sun, heavily laden, surrounded on all sides by pitfalls, beset by difficulties - shall find in those words which are here set out that consolation, that counsel, that advice, that stimulus for courage and patience, which alone can see us through. </para>
                    <para>Your Excellency, on behalf of the Parliament, I thank you. I hope that succeeding generations will regard this as one of those things which mark the spirit in which the Australianpeople, who have done their duty nobly  in  the war,accepteda great victory - not arrogantly, not in a spirit of vengeance, but in a spirit of true thankfulness; offering up to the Diety who has had us in  His  kindly keeping these many and dark years those thanks for all that we owe to Him. " The Rev.W. S. ROLLAND. - Your  Excellency.  - On behalf of the Victorian branch of the British and Foreign Bible Society, I desire to tender to you a hearty vote of thanks for your kindness, and for the kindness of Lady Munro Ferguson, in being present with us upon this very unique occasion.We accord to you our hearty thanks for the admirable address which you have delivered in connexion with this presentation. We all join - both the members of this Parliament and the members of the British and Foreign Bible Society - in expressing to you, sir, our thanks and. appreciation. I formally move that such a vote of thanks be given. " <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. JAMES</inline> BIRTCHNELL.- It is my pleasure and privilege to second the motion expressing the thanks of this gathering. </para>

Thewhole of the Empire, with the exception of Australia,has approved of  it.

                        <para>- To the best of my knowledge, two deputations of munition workers and 'others 'have made representations to  the  -Department on  the  subject. </para>

                    <para class="block">The first of these, which took place some time ago, and was received by me, requested that war workers should be allowed to participate in the Department's housing and land schemes. But they pointed out distinctly that in neither case did they wish to be placed on the same footing as returned soldiers. In other words, they were quite agreeable that the latter should have preference. The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> has since made an announcement that Cabinet has approved of making representations to the States, asking them to treat war workers on the same footing as returned soldiers in regard to land settlement and of placing war workers on the same basis as returned soldiers in regard to housing. In regard to the latter, an amendment of the Act will be necessary. At the subsequent deputation on Monday last the request put forward was more extensive, and I am not aware of what the Minister's decision was. </para>

                        <para>- The Victorian Government have been treating the High Court very generously in supplying buildings for its purpose, but last year difficulty arose about procuring a suitable room, and -the Crown Law Department immediately wrote to the State Attorney-General expressing appreciation of what had already been done 'by the .State Government, and asking them to meet the wishes of the Commonwealth. The reply was that a certain court-room was available for the High Court. A copy of the communication, was forwarded to the Justices of that Court, and nothing further was heard in regard to the matter until the complaint was made in' open Court the other day. I have already given instructions that a letter shall be addressed to the State Attorney-General, in order to prevent a recurrence' of the incident. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not know that I shall bo very long in debating this matter, particularly in view of the suggestion made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> this afternoon, that the motions must be disposed of' by this day week. I believe in the gospel being preached by the Prime Minister now - work not talk. I remember, however, that on one occasion, when the Opposition did not debate the Address-in-Reply, the Government found themselves with-, no work for us to do. I am not sure that it matters very much whether this Parliament agrees, or does not agree with the Peace Treaty, which would, in my opinion, in any circumstances be signed by Great Britain. Of course, it is probably better 'that all the Parliaments of. the Dominions which were represented at the Peace Conference should have an opportunity to discuss the Treaty. But there is one question, in which, at least, 90 per cent, of the people a-re more interested than they are in this. I feel quite sure that that proportion of the  people are more concerned about the cost of living than about any discussion on the Peace Treaty. The other 10 per cent, are concerned, perhaps, as to whether another war may break out, and afford them a further opportunity of making increased profits. I see that the Prime Minister is going about stating that he intends to introduce measures to deal with the profiteers. If he does so, he will find in me a very willing supporter; and I say deliberately that the sooner we have an opportunity of dealing with that legislation direct, or with something else that may affect it, the better it will be so far as I am concerned. </para>

                <para>I have gone through the Peace Treaty with its very numerous .articles. I suppose there was never one framed that took a greater length of time in the framing, nor any other that received the consideration which this one did. I do not know of any other Peace Treaty that has the number of signatures attached to it that this one has. If, as the result of this Treaty, a League of Nations is established which will guarantee, as far as that is possible, the future peace of the world, the Conference will have done good work. But if, after all the attention and trouble given to the production of this bulky document, we are to have other wars, then the Treaty is hardly worth the paper on which it is written. One of the most important things in it, to my mind, is Article S, of Part 1, which contains the Covenant of the League of Nations. This  provides- </para>

To the adoption of that policy, so entirely faithful to every pledge given to the British nation throughout the war, France has been the principal and the successful obstacle. It is a tragic fact that, at the end of a triumphant war against German militarism, a French newspaper, the Socialist <inline font-style="italic">L'Humanité</inline> is compelled to ask the question, " Is it Germany, freed from militarism, or France, delivered over to it, who is now the victor?" </para>

Those who have come closely into contact with the effects of the war know the awful horror that it has been. Every civilized man should do his best to have a proper League of Nations brought into existence, pledged as far as possible to disarmament and the abolition of the conscription that has been in existence in various European, countries and in other countries up to the present, time. To ensure peace, two things are necessary. First, total disarmament bv each country except as expressed in the' qualification in the first  paragraph  of Article S; and, secondly, the killing of militarism by the abolition of . conscription. When some men put on uniform they think they can run the whole country themselves.  They  have absolutely no consideration for other people. </para>

                <para class="block">It would be a good thing if some of the secret treaties entered into during the currency of the war, and, in fact, all the secret treaties in existence at the present time, were handed over to that body as well. If secret treaties have been the cause qf many of the wars in the past, as I believe they have, and if the League of Nations is to have any real existence, they should all come within the purview of the League. The League must know what has gone on in the past, and what engagements are in force at the present time. It has been said in the House that secret treaties were entered into while the war was going on. The honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. H. Catts)</inline> asked this afternoon whether any secret arrangement was entered into during the war by the Prime Minister of an Australi an government to which the present Prime Minister and myself belonged. I know of no such arrangement, but if such secret treaties do exist, the League of Nations should .at least have cognizance of them through its Secretariat. I hope that all secret treaties entered into by the nations which are parties to the Peace Treaty, and who propose to join the League of Nations,- will be made known by them to every other member of the League. Nothing is more calculated to disrupt a political party than is the action of a few of its members in arriving at a secret understanding amongst themselves. The position .is the same with regard to nations. The news that, ia secret understanding has been .arrived .at between two nations leaks out sooner or later, and gives rise very' often to a very serious situation. Should a secret treaty be made between Great Britain, Italy, France, Japan, the United States, or any  other country; the League of Nations would crumble before its structure had been completed. </para>

My only regret is that I cannot get the four proposals placed column by column in Hansard, to show how the later proposals coincide with those put forward by the Labour party in June, 1917, and which were said to be wrong. Had this Peace document, so identical with our proposals, been drawn up in 1917, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of lives would have been saved. </para>

                        <para>- I have not the slightest idea.The Minister is more at home in speaking before butter producers and denouncing me when I am not present to put the other side of the question. It must not be forgotten that the Peace ultimately agreed upon was based - much as the Prime Minister may not have liked it - upon President Wilson's fourteen points, and they were practically identical with those proposals of ours, which were said to be wrong in 1917. </para>

Smuts and Lord Robert Cecil, of the British Delegation. This gentleman made many statements, into which I do not propose to go. I regret that in America the parties are making a political fight of the Peace Treaty, instead of studying it on its merits. In speaking to the Prime Minister's motion I have not uttered one word from a party political point of view. </para>
                <para>The world has been in a turmoil for the last four years, and we are not yet out of it. We read of a filibustering Italian raiding Fiume, just as Doctor Jameson attempted to raid Johannesburg before the Boer War. Right throughout the civilized world we can note the effects of the war on commerce and industry. People have been absolutely unsettled. I have not encountered one returned soldier actually engaged in fighting who is not more restive to-day than he was before leaving Australia. It will take our returned soldiers some time to get back to normal conditions, and I believe that people generally will not recover from the disquieting effects of the war for many years to come. Therefore, I hope that in the very near future something will be brought into existence - whether it be a League of Nations or something else - to prevent the building up of armaments or the making of munitions of war; and I am anxious that there shall be an early ratification of Peace in order that people can settle down to normal conditions. . We are told that there is to be a "new era." I hope it will be a new era for the majority, and not for the few, and I trust that in future we shall not have what has been too much the feature of the past, the minority having all the necessaries and a good many of the luxuries, while the majority have been compelled to struggle to get the bare necessaries of life. That is why I remarked at the outset of my speech that more people are concerned as to the cost of living than as to the ratification of Peace, but I believe that the longer we postpone the ratification of this Treaty the worse it may be for all concerned. </para>
                <para>A Labour Conference is to be held in Washington next month under Part XIII. of the Peace Treaty. If any person is to leave Australia to attend that Conference he must leave immediately. I am not in the confidence of the Government, and I have heard nothing except what the Prime Minister said publicly as to what Ministers propose to do in regard to the matter, but if men are to be expected to thoroughly represent Australia at that Conference they should at least have a little time in which to familiarize themselves with the subjects to be discussed. </para>

                <para class="block">I have been wondering whether, . if we agree to the motion, we shall be compelled to enter into a conflict with Germany along with the other nations mentioned in. the Treaty. Of course, it must be remembered that we have only the one side put forward. One may hold that what the other deems to be an "unprovoked movement of aggression" is really not so.' In my' opinion, the best guarantee for the safety of the world in the future is a strong League of Nations administering the Treaty which has been drawn up, providing for the abolition of armaments, and, in accordance with the proposals of our Labour party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George, and  President  Wilson, the- absolute prohibition of the manufacture of armaments or munitions of war by a31,7 private person - for then the Governments themselves will know what  is going on - also providing that all secret treaties in existence shall be handed to the Secretariat of the League of Nations, so that it will not be possible for nations allegedly in partnership to have secret understandings which have in the past done more to provoke war than 'has any other thing. I hope that the League of Nations will grow and be the means of preventing in the future such an awful war as we have had in recent times. </para>

                    <para>. - My first words in discussing this motion are an expression of my concurrence in a great deal of what the honorable member said in the later portion of his speech - With him, I hope that the League of Nations will so function as to permit of a reduction of armaments, and secure the world's peace for many generations, and that it will from time to time so police the Treaty, as it is intended to do, that the terms and conditions of it may be made just, reasonable, and effective. The honorable member tried to make it appear that the pioneers of this Treaty have been the Labour party of Australia. If that be so, I congratulate the Labour party . upon having been gifted with such prescience as to be able to lay down the lines of this World's Treaty. I suggest to the honorable member, however that he should read more carefully the series of proposals which emanated from the Labour party in 1917. If he does that he will see that one or two of them, at any rate, would have- been fatal had they been incorporated in any Peace Treaty. They would ha.ve been fatal to the strength and power of the British Empire.  I refer particularly to the condition relating to the freedom of the seas. The reference to that by the honorable member was most unfortunate, for I think he knows that this one of the fourteen points was abandoned altogether. I believe that never once did  President  Wilson seek to press upon the Peace Conference the view he had enunciated in regard to that matter. It was recognised on all hands that the freedom of the seas' was an utterly impracticable proposition. ' With these exceptions, I agree largely with what was said by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> and I re-echo his hope that the League of Nations may so order itself in  future, and so gather to itself the support of the civilized world as to become a mighty instrument of peace and progress. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>This Treaty may be said to ring down 'the curtain on the- world's greatest drama. Whether it is the final, curtain  remains to be seen, whether it is a prologue to new and more wonderful scenes is a matter which the future will reveal. But I venture to say that, with its Labour movement and its League of Nations, it may be described as the Magna Charta of a new world. It is, at any rate, an effort to release the world from the intolerable tyranny of huge and staggering armaments and the grip of Prussian militarism. The Treaty attempts to rescue and salve out of the conflagration all that is best in the Old "World civilization, and to make it the foundation for a new, more stately, and enduring structure. It is not a logical or symmetrical document - no treaty could ever be, that - and for the simple ' reason that the new structure has to be built on the old site, and the business of the world has to be carried on meanwhile. If one could sweep the world free of its institutions and. civilization, and. begin afresh, to erect new structures, perhaps we might do better; one cannot say. But we have to continue our institutions, and at the same time erect, if we can, out of the terrible destruction of the old elements, something new that will be enduring and useful. </para>
                <para>The Treaty sets up a number of new sovereignties in the world. It revives the sovereignties of a number of ancient kingdoms; and assigns to them their metes and bounds. Out of these <inline font-style="italic">combined</inline> sovereignties we hope to construct a great moral and material force that will insure the peace and safety of the world, and guide and guard the birth of the new freedom which the Treaty confers upon mankind. </para>
                <para>The aims of the Treaty may be shortly stated as follow: - (1) The restoration of Belgium, Servia, and Montenegro, with compensation for the damage they have suffered - complete restoration, so far. as it is possible to  compel  it; (2) The evacuation of invaded territories in France, Russia, and Roumania, again with complete reparation. (3) Re-organization of Europe, with a stable <inline font-style="italic">regime,</inline> and respect for nationalities, recognising the right of all peoples, great and small, to security  and  liberty of economic development. (4) Ample guarantees of land and sea frontiers from unjustified attack. (5) The restitution of the provinces torn from the Allies. (6) The liberation of the Italians-, </para>
                <para class="block">Slavs, Roumanians, Poles, -and Czechoslovaks from foreign domination. (7) Setting free peoples from the tyranny of the Turks. (8) An attempt to turn the  Ottomann  Empire out of Europe once and for all - I am "sure we shall all agree with that - to undo the wrongs of 1914, to vindicate justice and international right, and to reconstruct the political foundations of Europe. These things, it is hoped, will give liberty to its peoples and' prospects of lasting peace. I fain would hope and believe that the best has been done in very difficult circumstances. At any rate, we may satisfy ourselves that Australia 'is rid. once and for all- of the German menace' in the Pacific. With the prohibition of armed forces in all the mandated territories, a great deal has been done to lift from Australia that fear and that weight of oppression which always have been existent while foreign nations have been so near to our doors. It is the best guarantee we Ban have that we shall be able to pursue our own destiny in peace, and, I hope, in progress.. </para>
                <para>It seems to me that we shall be better enabled to get a bird's eye view of the Treaty if I state the effects of it upon the German nation. In both material and moral respects what Germany loses we gain. If I may throw the matter into this antithetical form we shall be able to see what the effect of the Treaty is upon Germany, and, therefore, what the gain to ourselves and. the Allies is. </para>
                <para>First of all, let me deal with the German war aims and 'the result of the effort to achieve them. I would place first in those aims the destruction of the British Empire. The result of that effort has been complete failure; to-day the Empire is more united, stronger, and more extensive than ever. I would place as the next purpose of Germany the destruction and possession of France. The result of that effort has been that Germany must restore Northern France completely. Whoever has seen Northern France will concede the justice of that condition. It is impossible to imagine precisely what has taken place there. Honorable members may sometimes get from pictures or paintings a faint conception of the devastation, but the sight of it first-hand leaves on the mind a picture of agony, despair, and desolation.  such as cannot be conceived by the. people in Australia. Northern France is to be restored. Germany set out to conquer the whole of France. In that effort she has lost Alsace-Lorraine, I hope, for ever. The de-militarization of the left bank of the Rhine, the prohibition of fortifications within 40 kilometres of the eastern bank, and the army of ' occupation for fifteen years, indicate the complete failure of Germany's designs upon France. In middle Europe, Germany to-day finds herself cut off from the Middle East by Czecho-Slovakia, Jugoslavia, .and Roumania. Bulgaria has been thoroughly beaten and subjugated; Turkey has been dismembered. Middle Europe is no longer what it was. </para>
                <para>Another of Germany's objectives was the retention and the development of her colonial possessions. For that purpose she had been sacrificing millions, of pounds annually for many years past. All these possessions are lost to her to-day, and, I hope, for ever. Germany set out to. develop her colonies as military and naval bases ; not for the sake of the good she might do to the backward nations of the earth, not for the material  development she could stimulate and _ initiate, but for the one purpose of making these possessions great military and strategic outposts in her sinister designs for world conquest. All these are gone. Her' design in Africa was a great black army; and there is now no German territory in Africa. Egypt, it is well known now, was to be given to Turkey as a. trophy of her triumph in the war. To-day, for the first time in the whole history of Egypt, the' world recognises the protectorate of the British Empire. Germany set out to exploit Russia. Some people have an idea there is still a danger of her doing so; but I do not see it. If this Treaty can be made to hang together, and if the settlement can be carried out as intended, Germany hae little hope, in. my judgment, of exploiting either Russia , or the- ' Siberian part of Russia. Poland has been interposed as a barrier between Germany and that part of her intentions. </para>
                <para>German war aims, in a word, were world-power - naval, commercial, military, and in every other respect. The result has been complete failure.  Her  navy, for instance, surrendered, and then suicided ; its collapse has been complete.  Her  warships and submarines are to be broken up; and all the navy that is left to Germany under this Treaty is a mere shadow  of  the navy that she possessed  on  entering into the war. Perhaps it may be useful to recount the naval strength of Germany as provided for in the Treaty. We allow her six battleships  of  10,000 tons each; and what that mean's may, perhaps, be best  realized 'by remembering that our own <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> is 18,000 tons. We allow her six cruisers  of  6,000 tons, while our cruisers of tha <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline> type are 5,400 tons. We allow her twelve destroyers only, while Australia has twelve destroyers at the present moment, in her own little fleet. We allow her twelve torpedo boats, with  no  submarines, while we ourselves have six. The total <inline font-style="italic">-personnel</inline> of the German navy is to be 15,000 officers and men. She had the second navy in the world, but by this Treaty she is reduced to the position of the smallest. </para>
                <para>And. so with the German army. The future strength of her army is to be 100,000 men, including officers. Statements were made the other day that the German army was to be 200,000, but that is only temporarily, until things settle down, and it will ultimately be reduced to 100,000 men and officers. Her general staff and military colleges have' all been dissolved and destroyed. Her armaments have been greatly reduced, almost to a negligible point. For instance, we .allow her 204 field guns only, and 84 howitzers ; all excessive armaments are to be surrendered to the Allies. All importation of armaments is completely abolished, and she is not permitted to manufacture except what we permit for the purpose of replenishing the small army allowed her. She is prohibited from developing poisonous gases or liquids, and from the manufacture or importation of armoured cars and tanks, and such-like instruments of war. Chiefest of all, her conscription system is to be absolutely abolished. Her future army of 100,000 men is to be on a voluntary basis with enlistment for twelve years. Short-term enlistment has been completely done away with, and we permit her to recruit only 5,000 men per annum to replace the waste of the men discharged before the term has expired. The reason for that is thus explained. Germany has had a fixed standing army prescribed for her before to-day. Napoleon determined that she should have a limited army; and Germany began by introducing a system of training for three years. There was no limit placed  on  the number  of enlistments, and Germany passed the nation through, those short periods of training, with the result that, before long, she was as strong as she had been before. Care has been taken under this Treaty to prevent any possible recurrence of that. 'In a word, we may sum up this aspect of the matter 'by saying that just as Germany pioneered the way to the world's great armies she, we hope, will pioneer a way to small armies in the future. Germany's military power is negligible, and she has been deprived of the possibility of doing mischief in the immediate future. No one can doubt the existence of evil desire and intent on her part. Like all beaten nations, Germany is sullen, and has gone away to think evil thoughts and concoct evil "schemes; but this Treaty stands in the way. and strips her of the power and means' of accomplishing her desires. Militarily and  navally  we need have no fear of Germany in our day and generation if only the Treaty can be given effect to as it has been shaped. </para>
                <para>What has been the effect commercially on Germany of this war, and of the Treaty which arises out of it? The trade of Germany before the war was growing at a wonderful rate. There was no nation which was so constantly and completely penetrating the world with her commercial ventures and schemes. Two lines of figures will make this apparent. In' 1890 German exports and imports combined were £419,000,000, and this had risen in 1913 to £1,070,000,000 - a tremendous increase. Had Germany only been content to pursue her way as she was doing, she would very soon have had the world in subjection on that plane. But power seems to possess the seeds of its  own  dissolution, as history bears witness. </para>
                <para>In her mercantile marine  Germany came second only to the British Empire. Her position to-day is that her sea-borne trade, excepting in the Baltic, has been completely obliterated for the next five years for certain. Germany surrenders to the Allies all her merchant ships over 1,600 tons, half the tonnage of her ships between 1,000 tons and 1,600 tons, one quarter of the tonnage of all her steam trawlers and other fishing boats. Then, for five years, Germany must build for the Allies up to 200,000 tons of shipping per annum. She must transfer to the Allies all her commercial concessions in Russia, Turkey, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and her former German colonies. All these concessions have been stripped from her; - she is left bare of them to-day. </para>
                <para>As to her imports and exports - a matter which affects us all - Germany must not discriminate as she used to do against the Allies by means of Customs duties or otherwise;, neither must she discriminate in any way against the nationals, the individuals of the Allies. These and other similar provisions. I venture to say, handicap Germany tremendously for the future, and lift the handicap which she used to impose on us. It is only fair to say, however, that the German factories have not been destroyed or dismantled as the factories were in Belgium and Northern France. The Treaty requires' that Germany shall make good the factories which were destroyed in those countries, and that she shall deliver machinery, tools, and other implements for that specific purpose. </para>
                <para>It comes to this : that, instead of gaining the commercial supremacy of the world, Germany has lost substantially all her sea-going mercantile marine, on which her foreign trade depended. She has lost all her foreign rights and concessions, except in neutral countries, and she has lost the power to protect her commerce by any policy of preferential duties or methods of the kind. In addition, she has to bear the staggering load of her own debts, and all the costs of reparation. </para>
                <para>It appears to me. therefore, that we need not be particularly fearful of German inroads in the commercial sphere in the immediate future. Give her all the advantages she possesses in having her factories, and everything connected with them, intact, there is yet laid on her such prohibitions and such a staggering burden of obligations as will require all the machinery she can possess, and a great deal more, before she carries out the terms of the Treaty. </para>
                <para>Under this Treaty it will be entirely our own fault if we allow Germany to do what she did before, namely, give a military twist to all her internal arrangements for commerce. This is one thing I hope and believe the League of Nations will do, acting, as it were, as the inspector-general of this Treaty in the international sphere. </para>
                <para>What has been the effect on German finance? Here, again, the position can be stated very briefly. The Treaty provides that Germany must meet all her  financial obligations out of charges on her property and resources within the Empire, and on her property and security outside the Empire. Reparation, and the costs incidental to the Treaty, are made a first charge on the assets and revenue of Germany in the future. She undertakes  to  pay the total cost of the armies of occupation, and to liquidate a series of charges in the following order of priority : - First, the armies of occupation during the armistice period, then the costs of the army of occupation after the Treaty has been signed, and then the costs of reparation and other general costs incidental to her carrying out her obligations under the Treaty. Germany has had a huge and vital slice taken out of her territory, and these nationals have been grouped within new boundaries, and delimited in other spheres, so as to leave Germany a good deal poorer. I refer in particular to Poland and to Czechoslovakia. The provision made with regard to the share of obligation to be taken by the ceded territories is very interesting. It is based upon the ratio which is to be established between the average revenues of the ceded territories in the three prewar years. That, capitalized, is to be made the basis of the total payments that they must make of .the German debts which were floating and current .in the year 1914. But exceptions to this arrangement have been provided for. France gets Alsace-Lorraine back again free of every encumbrance, and .quit of every obligation. Poland is to be relieved of a great portion of her debt, since most of it. was imposed upon her as the price of her own subjugation by Germany. After all these years, justice comes along in the shape  of  Nemesis to Germany, and deals out this even-handed treatment to her, even in the apportioning of those debts which were incurred in her conquests of the long ago. </para>
                <para>Then there is the question of the pay-' ment for German Government and' Crown property in the ceded territories. They have to be estimated and appraised; but no payment whatever is' made to Germany: ' Payment is made to the Allies through the Reparation Fund, so that Germany does not benefit directly one fraction by any of the payments by the ceded territories. </para>

                <para>Germany renounces all her rights under the treaties which have heretofore existed between her. and other nations. She forfeits all her rights in all the controls which she exercised of commissions in State banks and other financial and economic organizations up and down the world. She forfeits completely any of these things relating to concessions in other countries, even the concessions which she had in Russia, although what we are to do with 'them when she has dis-. gorged them in Russia is a problem.  It  may be that when Russia ' has quietened down, and our whole account with Russia comes to be taken, then, and then only, can we strike the balance with Russia and with Germany, so far as her interests in Russia are concerned. Germany, too, has to give up - and,  I  dare say, has given up by this time - all the gold that  was transferred from the Ottoman Bank to the Reichsbank when, she raised thos© loans for Turkey about two years ago. The same thing occurred in AustroHungary. She gave them loans, and took all their securities. All these she has  to  disgorge, and they are all given back, not to Turkey and Austro-Hungary, but  to  the Reparation Fund. Everything has  to  go 'there. Germany gets nothing whatever back from anywhere in respect  of  any concession or any loan. </para>
                <para>One impression which  I  brought back with me from the Peace Conference is that it is a terrible thing to lose a war. The doctrine of <inline font-style="italic">vae victis</inline> is a very fearful one, and  I  have a conviction that  I  would rather die than lose in a fight like that. The humiliation that is put upon nations when they have to submit to the bitterness of defeat is something ' that one realizes only when one come? face  to face with, the duty of meting out international justice, according to present international standards. Let me hasten to add, Germany deserves all she has got. She deserves a great deal more ; and whatever Nemesis may come to her in the future in the shape of suffering, . it is because of the unprovoked attack she made' upon peaceful and unoffending citizens of other nations, and not because of anything done to her by the Allies. She has herself entirely to blame. </para>
                <para>Germany renounces all the benefits of the Treaties of Brest-Litovsk and Bucharest. <inline font-style="italic">A</inline> Commission is to be set up under the reparation clauses which may require Germany to acquire and transfer all the interests . &gt; which Germany has in. any public utility or undertaking in Russia, China, Turkey, Austro-Hungary, Bulgaria, or any of the ceded or mandated territories. Germany has to indemnify the nationals of those territories, and gets her credit in the Reparation Fund. Whatever Germany has to pay, she must pay in the currency of the country where the debt is due. That will be a tremendous disability, since her mark to-day is worth only about 4d. One could make money to-day in many of the German territories by purchasing things at German values and bringing them out and selling them at our own. </para>
                <para>On the question of reparation, I should like to say a few words in addition to what the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has said. In the first place, it is well to get clearly in mind what the principle of reparation- is. Reparation ought in strictness to be restitution; but, of course, that is .impossible There are many things that can never be replaced  in connexion with this war. We  cannot replace the 7,000,000 dead, or the strong limbs of those who were maimed and despoiled during the war ; but, so far as possible, reparation should mean restitution, and that is the principle which has been applied, with the limitations  imPosed  by the nature of things, in this Treaty. M. Clemenceau, in a very brilliant reply to the Germans in connexion with this matter, laid down this definition of what reparation ought to be and to do as follows: - " To right a wrong is to replace things as far as possible in the state in which they were before the wrong was committed." That, of course, is impossible in a case like this; but, taken by and large, an effort has been made to do it in this Treaty, The vast extent and manifold character of the damage which has been caused creates in itself a problem of great complexity, delicacy, and magnitude, and a continuing body has been set up to deal with it. It was found impossible to deal with every point of it in the Treaty itself, and, therefore, a continuing Commission has been set up, which will from time to time apply the principles laid down in the Treaty, and see, if possible, that complete reparation is made. It will be a small body, of limited <inline font-style="italic">personnel,</inline> and of very broad and plenary powers. The aim of the reparation clauses is the early and complete discharge of Germany's obligations; to see that she does not shirk,, and to give relief where and when it is necessary to do so. For this purpose we permit Germany to make counter proposals to the Reparation Commission. Realizing her obligations, she may see that she can make these payment; in some better way than is proposed in the terms which have been laid upon her. So long as they carry out the purposes of the Treaty, and the amount imposed by the Treaty, any proposals she may make with that end in view will be given full consideration and effect, so long as they do not conflict with the. principles of the Treaty itself. </para>
                <para>The formula laid down is that there shall be compensation for all damage done to the civilian populations and to their property. That excludes, of course, the cost of the war. There is a great deal of difference of opinion as to whether or not we ought to have laid upon Germany the total cost of the war as an obligation. It appears to me that it would not add to the status, authority, and power of the Treaty to include in it obligations which it was known could never be carried out. The Treaty will, I think, be stronger if it contains only such provisions as we are able effectually to enforce. So it came about in the end that this plan was adopted, by reason, if you like, of one of Wilson's fourteen points, but I would suggest, not solely because that point was there, so much as 'because there was a general feeling also that Germany could not stand up to those obligations, and that to have imposed- more upon her would ha.ve been to run the risk of losing all. Germany to-day is, like other nations, very much distracted. Germany to-day is smitten, and smitten hard. Germany to-day is crippled in her resources for the want of raw material. She has lost 2.000,000 of the flower of her mau- hood, and, with all the other obligations of the Treaty laid upon her, my own impression is that Germany has a great deal to do, and all she can do, and, perhaps, more than she can do, although I hope not. </para>
                <para>First of all, Belgium is to be reimbursed all her liabilities in the war. That stands in the forefront of the reparation clauses. She is to get £100,000,000 in cash out of the first £1,000,000,000 that is provided by Germany. Afterwards she- is guaranteed her war expenditure which she borrowed from the Allies. I am bound to say that, in my judgment, Belgium has been treated very fairly, I would even say generously, in this Treaty. It seems rather invidious to mention these things, but I venture to say that the other European nations as a whole have been treated at least as well as the British nation in the settlements that have had to be made. The Commission which has been set up is to present the bill to Germany by the year 1921. Germany must pay in. thirty years. The Commission may extend the term. In 1921,Germany must have paid £1,000,000,000 in gold, commodities, ships, and securities. It was at first intended to make her pay in gold entirely, but this was found to be impracticable, and she was given the alternatives mentioned, so long as she paid the equivalent of £1,000,000,000. The first charge on that amount is, of course, the cost of the army of occupation and the food which has had to be supplied to Germany. Germany to-day is being kept alive by the Allied countries, and I should like to impress upon honorable members the further fact that Europe is being kept alive to-day by America and the Imperial Government Europe cannot maintain itself to-day, and will not be able to maintain itself for some considerable time to come. It should always be borne in mind that America and Great Britain to-day are keeping Europe alive - that they are standing between her and hunger. </para>

                <para>In the year 1921 Germany is to issue gold-bearing bonds for 40,000,000,000 marks- £2,000,000,000. This sum is to bear interest at the rate of2½ per cent. up to the year 1926. If she has not liquidated this liability by that time she is to be given an extension, but the amount is to bear interest at the rate of 5 per cent., with 1 per cent. amortization. She also undertakes when called upon to issue gold-bearing bonds for yet another £2,000,000,000, making, in all, £5,000,000,000, that she has to provide. This is to be only a payment on account. It does not represent the totality of Germany's obligations. The Commission is to report again in two years, when, it is hoped, that it will have obtained final data that will enable it to assess the damage under these categories, and so provide for the complete payment of full reparation by Germany. In addition to these payments, Germany, as I have already said, is to build us 200,000 tons of shipping per annum. She is to give France, Italy, and Belgium from 45,000,000 tons to 50,000,000 tons of coal a year. We are to obtain 50 per cent of all her dye stuffs and chemical drugs in stock. In addition, we may requisition 25 per cent. of her total product of these goods up to the year 1925. Germany forfeits all her cables. All are swept from her, and given over to the possession of the Allies. The British Government is to operate them in trust for the Allies. </para>
                <para>These reparations, as I have said, are made a first charge on the revenues and expenditures of the German people. For this purpose the Allies are to examine her Budgets year by year. She might otherwise so arrange her Budgets as to prevent our seeing what her capabilities are in this direction. We, therefore, reserve to ourselves the right to scrutinize her Budgets, and, if necessary, to require an alteration of them with a view to her paying to the Allies the uttermost fraction possible in the way of indemnities. </para>
                <para>These, briefly, are the terms of reparation which have been imposed upon Germany. Again, I say they are very severe ; but not more severe, not sterner, or less just, than all the circumstances require. Germany set out to conquer the world. In this Treaty we have the answer to that attempt. She set out to subjugate the commerce of the world. She is stripped of her power to do injury in that respect. She set out to gain the countries of the world. Much of her own territory has been taken from her. </para>
                <para>Then there is the second Treaty referred to briefly by the Prime Minister. It provides that in the event of any unprovoked movement of aggression against France being made by Germany, Great </para>
                <para>Britain shall go to the assistance of France - " France beloved of every soul that loves its fellow kind." This second Treaty, in my judgment, does nothing more for France than the provisions of the League of Nations would do. .France, however, was nervous. She was not prepared to trust absolutely the League of Nations, and so she said, " I want further guarantees. I am here bleeding at every pore. My country is destitute and desolate by reason of the fight which the people of France have made in the interests of the civilized world. I want all the guarantees you can give, and in guaranteeing me you also guarantee yourselves." And so it was seen to be a fair thing to quiet and satisfy France with the added emphasis of this obligation which the Allies took upon themselves to see that France was not invaded in the future. </para>

It is a joint-and-several agreement. I hope that the United States of America will agree to it, and that we shall do so. It is a fair thing, and, moreover, is a recognition -of the new fact in European strategy that the Rhine is the real strategic military frontier of Britain as well as France. That fact has emerged during the course of the war. </para>

                        <para>- No, I have not forgotten the principle, and it is' being emphasized in this second Treaty. In our fight with Germany we kept the war from our own shores. France felt the burden, . the agony, the tremendous impact of it all. Our people escaped it, and it is fair that we should guarantee to France that she shall not feel it in the future except in common with all the Allies. We must always remember that Germany still has a population of 70,000,000, whereas France has a population of less than 40,000 ,000 ,v and Great Britain only some 45,000,000 of people. The brunt of this obligation of resisting a German invasion of this kind will always rest .upon Great Britain and France. The United States of America will be still under the disability of being over one week's sail from the scene of conflict, so that the first impact of any such collision must necessarily fall upon Great Britain and France. They must take the first shock, the first surprise, should anything of the kind happen in future, and the total population of Great Britain and France is little more than that of Germany. - </para>

                        <para>- Yes. We do not know what the future may have in store for us. We do know, however, that, right down the centuries, all civilized nations have had to defend themselves from the overflow of less civilized nations and peoples. The fact stands out that this can be- done in the future only by joint action on the part of the whole of the civilized peoples of Europe. I commend the second Treaty, therefore, to the cordial approval of this House. It is a fair thing to 'France. It is- just to ourselves. It is, withal,  a prudent measure. It is such a measure as the present war has made necessary, and as the future may yet require. </para>

                <para>I mentioned that Germany had lost for ever, I hope, all her colonies. How great that loss is to her may be readily gathered from a reference to some figures which I have tabulated, showing, first of all, the extent of German oversea territories, as well as the immense importance which she attached to them. So important were they regarded by Germany that in the governing of .them she incurred a loss each year to the extent of £3,500,0.00. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; and that is one reason why I asked leave to make this further statement. I had better, at the outset, quote the figures which I have taken from <inline font-style="italic">Whitaker' s Almanac Joi</inline> last year. The information there set out is fairly accurate, but there is a diversity in the years mentioned, so that if we were tabulating the statistics to-day some changes would have been made.

                <para>In the first place, Kiau-Chau, that battleground which has played so important a part in the considerations of the Peace Conference had, in 1912, a population of 84,000. It is not very important from the point of view of its population, but it is a highly important strategic centre, and is so regarded by the naval and military authorities of the world. In 19.12, its receipts were £312,000, and its expenditure £732,000, showing a deficit of £420,000. That fact alone will indicate, I think, the great importance attached by Germany to this place from a strategical military and naval standpoint. Then we have the mainland of New Guinea, the Bismarck Islands, the Solomons, and all the other German islands in the Pacific, excluding Samoa, which has been given to New Zealand. Strange as it may seem, Samoa is the only German colony in the group where the receipts and expenditure balance. It is the one island that is paying the cost of its own government. The mainland of New Guinea, with an area of 70,000 square miles, has a population that is not easily ascertainable. There has been no census, and, as far as I know, no responsible effort to tabulate the population, and so it is given generally as being from 110.000 to 350,000. The Bismarck, Solomons, and other islands have an area of 16,000 square miles, and an estimated population of 250,000. All these figures are for the year 1912; I have not been able to find any later statistics. The receipts of these islands in that year totalled £78,000, and the expenditure £138,000, leaving a deficit of £60,000. </para>
                <para>That is the obligation we are taking over in connexion with the mandate which has been given to us. The deficit by this time, however, may be less. Since 1912 the islands have been developing. Their rubber and copra production are much improved, and I should not be surprised, when the figures come to be definitely ascertained and fixed, to find that these islands are practically self-supporting in the matter of governmental expenditure. In my opinion, very shortly these islands will be a source of revenue, and if one may so put it a profit to us. I hope that we shall be able, by good and judicious management, to make them pay the cost of their own development. In that regard the outlook is very promising. There are great resources as yet undeveloped in these new territories, and I hope that a definite move towards their development may be made as soon as we become responsible for them and begin to move actively in the governing of them. </para>
                <para>As to our own territory, Papua, it is well known that large deposits of oil bearing strata are to be found there, and so far we have had in <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade</inline> a very competent geologist dealing with them. I found that in London he was well regarded as a geologist. He is a graduate of the London School of Mines, and that is a certificate as to his being a thoroughly competent man, from the scientific aspect, for the work on which he is engaged. But as honorable members know, our operations in Papua have been most unfortunate. I have come to the conclusion that this is because we have not had the experience requisite for the proper development of these oil deposits. <inline font-style="italic">[ Extension of time granted.]</inline></para>
                <para>When in the Old Country I went down to Chesterfield to see the oil wells which were opened there almost as soon as we reached England. I attended the opening ceremony which Lord Cowderoy organized when the first bore was begun. He told me that for two or three years before he had even made arrangements to commence boring operations he had his own staff of geologists and chemists at. work. They were engaged for nearly three- years in Great Britain definitely defining the anticline where the oil deposits were supposed to be, and testing the oil chemically for its quality. It was only when he had satisfied himself by geological and chemical tests that oil was there in commercial quantities that he secured from America an expert corps of borers to put down the bores. What that exactly means will be gathered from an illustration that I can give the House. A fortnight before leaving England I again went down to Chesterfield to see what progress was being made. I had become very interested in the subject, and desired to see what progress was being made on the practical side with the boring operations. I found that Lord Cowderoy had struck oil in one bore, and that the oil was dripping quietly into tanks, but that it had been determined to go down another 50 feet. </para>

The superintendent told me on the occasion of my last visit that if he could get from three or four more bores the result that he had then secured, it would insure thoroughly sound commercial operations. Later on the oil had begun to gush, and I presume that the position now is satisfactory. The point that I wish to mention is that when I inspected the bores a flange on one of the pipes in a bore of 2000 feet had broken at a depth of more than 1000 feet, but in less than twelve hours every pipe was up and stacked at the head. The pipes were taken up, repaired, and put down again. I mention this incident only to show what practical men who had been engaged in this work all their lives can do. </para>

I quote this incident only to show how necessary it is to sharply divide the two aspects of this work. At the banquet which Lord Cowderoy gave, the health of the superintendent of the bores was. proposed. The superintendent, an. American, said in reply, "Well, I guess I can't talk much, but if the oil is there, I calculate I will find it." That was his speech. The oil was there, and he did find it. I came to the conclusion that these men knew their business. They had been boring all their lives, and had became expert. </para>

I know nothing about the geology of the Commonwealth, but I candidly confess that I should like to see a determined scientific and systematic effort made to explore Australia with a view to the discovery of oil deposits. The question is all important for the reason that the industries of the world are gradually passing over to an oil basis. It- is important, also, from a defence-from an Admiralty - point of view. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot do so; but I should think that the exploitation of the supposed oil-bearing strata is one of the first things that should be undertaken in that territory. I believe that the Dutch oil-fields continue right through those islands to New Guinea, and it is part of our duty to see if we can find oil. We have an Empire which is dependent on its Navy and its oceangoing commerce. In a word, we are a marine. Empire, yet we possess only 2 per cent. of the world's output of oil. This is a serious problem from the point of new of the Empire and its future development, and I sincerely hope that we shall be able to make our contribution to those stores of oil without which the Empire cannot hope to stand sure in the international competition of the future. </para>

                <para>In regard to German South West Africa, there is an expenditure of £2,250,000 among 270,000 people, roughly, £10 per head of the population, showing the immense importance Germany attached to these Possessions. She developed them for two reasons: to exploit them for raw materials for her manufacturers - the greatest blow at German industries has been made by depriving her of the possibility of obtain thing these raw materials from her own colonies - and to develop strategic points up and down the world, with a view to developing the naval and military resources of those places, and making them an aid to her ambition of world power. </para>
                <para>We have been given a mandate. I do not wish to add anything to the Prime Minister's explanation, except to say that I am thoroughly in favour of the mandatory principle, chiefly for one reason, that .it is to our interest in the Pacific to eliminate, as far as we can,- the  possi-bility  of the formation in those islands of any force, naval or military. The mandatory principle does this -by prohibiting the preparation of any naval or military force, and by preventing the setting up of fortifications in all the mainland territories, or for any reason whatsoever. That is a very great gain to Australia, and a great element in the security which we hope will ' come to us as, in the future,  Ave  try to develop the resources of these islands for the benefit of the Empire and the world. </para>
                <para>Let me refer now, briefly, to the League of Nations. I, too, whole-heartedly and cordially approve of a League of Nations. The object of the League, which is embodied in the Treaty, as far as I understand it, is to put between the conception and the act of war as many obstacles as possible. That can be done best, perhaps, in two ways - and here I might say that I am practically quoting what I think was a very admirable setting of the matter by M. Tardieu, one of the Peace plenipotentiaries of France - it can be done, first of all, by giving- to the nations the best geographical conditions which we can secure for them, with due regard to ethnological justice and economic prosperity. In the second place, it can be done by the creation of a common bond of union, so that an act of aggression against one may be made the common concern of all. The underlying principle  of any permanent settlement is, of course, that the people shall have the 'right to dispose of themselves, to fix their own- destiny, to have their own outlook upon life, and to live their own life in their own way. This involves, as embodied in the League of Nations, the requirement that we shall stand shoulder to shoulder in the enforcement of the Peace principles, and in seeing that they become expressed in the Statutes, rules, customs, and traditions of -the nations of the earth. The League of Nations is a union for a constructive Peace. It is, if you will, an ideal; an aspiration; but I venture to say it is worth while. It may be said to be an effort to realize the real brotherhood of the nations of the earth. . It is riot a ' super-State. And here I should like to call the attention of the Leader of the Opposition. <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> to the quotation which he made from the British Labour  party's Peace programme, in which they advocated a super-national League of Nations. This is no super-national  League of Nations. The great problem was to avoid the erection of a super-State, which, of course, would have destroyed the sovereignties of the States . as then existing, and have given us over, body and soul, to the control of those who .were possibly not friendly to us. That has been avoided in this League of Nations. It was the first tough problem that had to be tackled, and I venture to say that an even keel had . been steered between a super-State on the one hand, and a mere empty triviality on the other. Our sovereignties are preserved, but an organization has been created which, I believe, will have a, very material effect on the achievement of the objectives which the League sets out. In my judgment, this League of Nations contains no danger to the British Empire in any shape or form, and involves no danger to the British Fleet, upon which that Empire depends, nor any derogation of British prestige, which, to-day, is the highest in the whole world. The increased power and prestige - the character - of the British Empire in the Council of the "World, was impressed' upon our minds more and more' as the Conference lengthened out. </para>
                <para>The preamble of the League of Nations sets out that one of its objectives is international co-operation, and not competition in warfare. It is constructive, therefore, in its first sentence. It aims at a complete and real co-operative Commonwealth of Nations, and carries our cooperative civilization several points further than at present. Its objectives are of the .noblest. It aims at world peace, with a ban upon war ; and when we remember the .price we have paid in this tragic struggle, it should lead us to the consideration of any proposals which hold out hope for the future. </para>

                        <para>- I venture to say that such is not the case. The honorable member suggests that these nations have been guilty of a pure piece of make believe. Nothing could be further from fact. No responsible British statesman to-day, with the weight upon his shoulders which he carries, and with the nation behind him staggering under its great load of debt, could do other than look sympathetically on any proposal which seemed to offer future relief from these crushing burdens, and I hope that the honorable member will not suggest that this League of Nations is a pure piece of make-believe. It is an honest effort to try to get some instrumentality for the mitigation of those things to which he alludes. </para>

                <para>The League begins by affirming the desirability of open, just, and honorable relations between nations. It sets up the reign of law, instead of force, as the actual rule for international conduct. It makes the League the Inspector-General of the Treaty, and the Inspector-General throughout the whole international sphere. It sets in the foreground that perfect good faith shall be kept, and that a scrupulous respect for treaties shall be observed. When these treaties have been dragged into the open, we shall have gone a long way to seeing that they are observed, and to seeing that they are just and right, and we shall have gone a long way to guarantee that people will be able to live under them in peace and security, without recourse to warfare. The work to be- done is very great. It is to make peace. It is to make new States and to maintain them, and to give the older nations of the world greater security and greater peace. There are many new nations opening a new chapter of liberty and self-development. This Treaty may be said to be the birth certificates of these new nations emerging from the collapse of the old. Some of these new nations are really very old nations. Servia, for instance, was a nation in the fourth century. It was conquered by Charlemagne in the ninth century. It passed under Turkish rule, then under German rule, and then under Austrian rule. But through it all Servia has preserved that which we call the "soul of a nation," that which cannot be killed. You may suppress it, you may oppress it, and you may overlay it for centuries, but it will emerge again into the sunlight at the first opportunity and assert its invincibility and inviolability. You cannot kill that which we call ." the soul of a nation." Servia preserved her language, her race names, and her traditions for 1,400 or 1,500 years, and made her .appeal at the bar of the nations to be set up in greater power and greater potency than ever before. The same 'thing may be said of Bohemia, which was a Kingdom in the fifth century. I had pride and pleasure in being able to assist in setting up <inline font-style="italic">La Boheme</inline> as a nation again. If honorable members had been there, as we were, and heard the multifarious appeals that were made to us by many of the little Kingdoms up and down Europe, they would have realized that you cannot kill that which you call " the soul of a nation," no matter what you do. ' There is one little Kingdom I remember in particular,  Lusatiacontaining  150,000 inhabitants, and the appeal it made for some kind of autonomous government and the long history which it unrolled and related to us, showing the immensity of its cultural contributions to Europe, was very tragic and  very  pathetic. </para>
                <para>It was impressed on my mind also that the chief ingredient in the spirit of nationality is language, and, therefore, our great object in future should be to bind together all the Anglo-speaking races of the world, wherever they may be. I have come back to Australia more and more feeling the urgent necessity of seeking to cultivate by every possible means in our power cordial and intimate relations with the great Republic across  the  Pacific. </para>
                <para>The League of Nations is really the Treaty. The document is shot through with references to the League of Nations. The ' League functions all through the Treaty, and if it did not live a day longer, it will already have served a useful' purpose in the making of this peace. We could not have a peace with any prospect of its lasting but for it. All the while it has been in the background' as the .reservoir, shall I say, of the sorenesses which have been engendered in these new delimitations and in the fixing of these new conditions. It must be remembered that to-day Europe is still full of mutual hatreds. Some of the Allies hate each' other almost as much as they hate the Germans, and trouble has arisen in fixing the metes and bounds of the new nations, and in trying to draft ethnographic lines which were set down as the fundamental principle to begin with. It is quite impossible in Europe to draft lines that will give ethnographic justice.. The races are so intermixed .that you must ma through them arbitrarily at some point or another. And so it is with economic interests ; they aTe 'all intermixed and interwoven; you cannot make boundary lines unless you run through both economic and ethnographic lines of interest; you must make a rough-and-ready byand.large arrangement. But the adoption of , this method has left a great deal of soreness behind it. For instance, in Bohemia there are over 2,000,000 Germans. We had the alternative of giving the Czecho- Slovaks a boundary which they could protect, a very high range of mountains, and thus including 2,000,000 Germans, or of excluding those 2,000,000 Germans and giving them a boundary line which they could not defend. Therefore, we included the Germans, and in so doing created a problem which has to be faced in the future. We cannot expect those Germans to be content. I am citing this as a typical case to show the immensity of the problems which we had to handle in the making of this Treaty. These Germans cannot be expected to be content, because they are the capitalists of Bohemia, they manage the big indus7 tries, and now to be brought into subjection to the  Czecho-Slovaks  is a bitter pill for them. </para>

                        <para>--- About 12,000,000. When 2,000,000 or 3,000,000 Germans are included we may expect that the future will bring some little troubles of its own, and unless we have a League of Nations, or some similar authority, to deal with these troubles when they arise, we had better commence arming at once for the next war. That is the alternative. These nations signed the Peace Treaty believing that the League of Nations would afford some possibility of a review of the Treaty in the future; otherwise, many of them, I greatly fear, would not have signed it. At any rate, if they had signed, the Peace would not have lasted very long. So diverse are their interests, so intense their racial animosities, and so shot through are their affairs with the conflicting strands of national interests, that it would be impossible to preserve peace unless some organization like the League of Nations were set up to overlook them. </para>

                <para>Under the Treaty  itself many other functions are given to the League of Nations. For instance, it secures adequate railway facilities over Polish territory between Germany and East Prussia. It secures to Poland railway facilities over the German territory of Danzig. Honorable members may recollect that a great battle was waged regarding the free port of Danzig. Poland desired an independent outlet to the sea, and "ultimately it was arranged that Danzig should be made a free international port. A High Commissioner is to be appointed by the League of Nations, and he, in conjunction with the free people of Danzig, will arrange a constitution for the governance of that port, giving Poland all the rights of access to the sea to which she is entitled, but at the same time setting up the autonomy of people, who are German in race and sympathy. Many of these problems had to be internationalized, .and we must have some body to police the arrangements, and see that they are carried out in their entirety. That is the one hope of the world.  Therefore, putting aside all sentiment, I ask honorable members to look upon the League of Nations as an organization set up for giving effect to the Treaty, and as a principal and integral part of its machinery. The League will guarantee the boundaries between Austria and Germany - a ticklish business in the case of peoples who desire to come together, but whom we wish to keep apart.. </para>
                <para>An important provision in the Treaty is Article 213, by which, so long as the Treaty remains in force, Germany undertakes to give every facility for any investigation which the Council of the League of Nations, acting, if need be, by majority vote, may consider necessary. We have disarmed Germany, but how are we to guarantee that she will remain disarmed? We all recollect the surprises that she had in store for us at the commencement of the late war. Honorable members will recollect the enormous howitzers, that overthrew immense fortifications and made the world gasp with surprise. Behind the veil of secrecy Germany had evolved those great engines of war, the existence of which the world learnt with astonishment. Therefore, we say to Germany that the League of Nations shall inspect her thoroughly, even to the very vitals of her country, in order to take care that no fresh machinations against the civilized world shall be commenced. In other words, the League of Nations is to be the Inspector-General of the Treaty. I emphasize that phrase, because it seems to aptly describe the functions of the League, apart from its higher objectives and aspirations. The League is to see, for instance, whether the economic laws relating to nationals and businesses, which have been given a five-year limit in the Treaty, shall be extended or terminated at the end of that period. The League is to inspect all treaties that are made between nations. We are not prevented from making fresh treaties, but we do covenant that when we have blade a treaty, it shall be reported to the League of Nations, which in turn will report it to the world. The League is given power to interpret all provisions of the Treaty respecting ports, railways, and waterways. Many international arrangements have been made in regard to rivers, ports, and waterways of various descriptions. </para>
                <para>And most of all, and greatest of all, the League will provide, as one of its chief functions, for a reduction of national armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety. Germany has been disarmed. That means a tremendous relief for Germany economically and financially. For instance, she will save the £80,000,000 per annum which, in pre-war years, she spent on naval and military establishments. Under the conscription system there were always in Germany1,000,000 men under arms. Conscription has been abolished, and the financial equivalent of the return of those 1,000,000 men to economic pursuits will be at least another £150,000,000 per annum. Those two savings combined make the huge total of £230,000,000 per annum. Germany has her factories intact; France has not; Belgium has not; other nations have not. Fortunately for us, our factories are intact. But can we continue to carry the present staggering burden of armaments, while Germany escapes scot free? This aspect of the problem will affect us profoundly and intimately in our economic affairs, and the competition in the markets and commerce of the world. So it seems to me we shall do well to study the matter of disarmament in order to discover if there be not some means by which we can be released from the tremendous burdens which every European nation is carrying to-day. So long as disarmament is relative and proportionate, I think it can be done with safety. Reduce the armies in Europe by half, reduce the navies of the world by half, and the British preponderance will be preserved. From that point of view I suggest that we should study this matter, in order to see if we may not relieve ourselves of some of the immense load that Europe has carried for so many years. That, I know, is the view of the Imperial Government, and of the Governments of most of our Allies. They feel that their peoples require some release from the tremendous and crushing burden of armaments, and that relief is the more necessary because by our own act we have lifted the burden from our enemies, with whom we must compete in future. I am not likely to deal lightly with a matter of that kind. Until there is a general movement in that direction, there can be no surcease of our naval or military preparations. They must continue so long as other nations are arming to the teeth. But the League provides a means by which schemes of disarmament may be studied and recommended. All that has been conferred upon that body is power to recommend, formulate, and suggest, and to supply knowledge. It has been given authority to try to induce nations to disarm. </para>

                <para>The League of Nations is to be governed by a Council consisting of the five great Powers and .four representatives of smaller Powers, one of which shall be a neutral country. Spain has already been selected for that position. It may be said, in passing; - and this again is our security - that the five great  Powers  will have the chief controlling voice and power of determination in all matters relating, to the integrity and inviolability of kingdoms/and states. The Council may be said to be a sort of higher House. Below it will be the Assembly, where all the Powers, which are members of the League, will meet. In that. Assembly Australia will .have an independent voice. The decision's both of the Council and the Assembly must be unanimous; and it is just as well to keep the fact in mind. The assent of a party to a- dispute, always providing it is not a dispute of honour, is not necessary in case of a decision on the dispute; but the party may be represented on the Council in connexion . with any matter as to which a dispute has arisen, and as to which appeal is made. <inline font-style="italic">Sitting suspended from 6.15 to</inline> 7.4-5 <inline font-style="italic">p.m.</inline></para>

                        <para>- It is to be called together when the Council desires, and the Assembly may request to be called together. Any member of the Assembly may request that a meeting be called, and if the Secretariat of the Council think it of sufficient importance, they may call a meeting, or may try to settle the trouble without doing so. Remember  always  that there must be large powers conceded to a Council of the kind. The members of this Assembly are separated all over the world, and cannot meet readily or rapidly; but a competent and representative Secretariat has been appointed, in close touch with four or five of the greater Powers, to deal with matters off-hand. I have no doubt that this Secretariat will be able to smooth out differences and difficulties before trouble really arises. </para>

In questions other than the supreme and vital question of honour, the Assembly may discuss or suggest any course it thinks fit, and may be called together for the purpose; but in all matters affecting the sovereignties of the nations, both the decision of the Council and. the decision of the Assembly must be unanimous. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. One of the common errors connected with the League of Nations is that it professes to make war impossible, and that, as this is obviously impracticable at present, the League, therefore, is a failure. The answer to that is that the League does not, and cannot, give any absolute guarantee against war - no league or combination of Powers could guarantee the world against international violence. But though wai- cannot be entirely done away with, it can be mitigated. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; we can interpose more obstacles to war, obstacles that are now  absent.  But even if we cannot abolish war, and fail in the attempt, I suggest that it is worth while trying. War may be prevented or mitigated by bringing the nations together for consultation and discussion of international difficulties, and requiring delay and arbitration or inquiry bv the Council before resort to arms. We covenant to do that by joining the League of Nations. One of the main functions of the League is to create just and honorable relations between the nations. That can be done by a pledge and covenant such as we give when we sign the Treaty not to go to war for three months after an award has' been made, and not to go to war at all against any member of the League who has obeyed the League. These are covenants which we made in joining the League of Nations, and in affixing our signatures to the Treaty. </para>

                <para>The penalties are two, and are pretty considerable. There is the penalty of ostracism and banishment from the League of Nations. What that means, let the fate of Germany in. this war bear witness. It is not a light thing to be banned by the rest of the world for breaking a covenant and doing something against the interests of the world's peace. No nation will take such an obligation on its shoulders lightly, for the penalty itself is tremendous. But there is also the material penalty of the boycott in the shape of a blockade. Those who know anything' about the war know that the blockade broke the German morale. There were Germans fighting with absolutely nothing between their bare skin and their tunics; and that was the result of the blockade. If a nation does not honour the covenant entered into, they have to meet the two penalties I have described, apart from the possibility of an armed intervention. </para>
                <para>There is another very common error in the idea that if a country joins the League of Nations it may be compelled to fight in a cause in which it does not believe; and it is worth while brushing that error aside. In no case can the League order a nation to fight on behalf of any cause. The League may suggest and recommend a nation to fight; and, of course, if the nations agree as a whole to recommend the fighting, so be it - it will be difficult for a nation to stand outside a general concentration of armament of the kind. But a nation breaks no covenant if it does not see its way to take part in the defence of any cause in which it does not believe. </para>

First of all, the representative of Great Britain on the Council of Five has to agree, and then there has to be another and independent agreement by the Government of Great Britain. These two separate agreements have to be made to any course suggested by the League of Nations before the latter can interfere in any way with our armaments or matters of the kind. There can only be disarmament either of the Army or the Navy if we say definitely and decisively twice that we desire it. It will be seen that all the bogeys that have been raised are thoroughly provided against, and at the same time a thoroughly competent organization has been created which will, I hope, go a long way to securing the peace of the world. </para>
                <para>I desire, in conclusion, to deal with just one other point. This League of Nations is set up for the purpose of creating a better international atmosphere. It is out of the murky atmosphere of our international relationships that hideous wars have come; and the purpose of the </para>
                <para class="block">League is to create good- will up and down the world. ' Good- will, as I have often said, will no more create itself than goods will sell themselves; and it is time there was a recognised movement to create and maintain international good-will for the future. This League, therefore, is no iridescent dream - no mere rainbow across the sky of war - but is a practical  organization  for practical ends. It begins by trying to create a better world atmosphere in our relations one with the other. It is an effort to transfer the energies of the nations from war to peace - from. the arts of war to the arts of peace. It stands for co-operation in constructive things, and for the destruction of those things which mean war, pestilence, and discord. On these grounds alone I submit that the League of Nations is worthy of support. </para>
                <para>Power is given to~~ supervise all international agreements regarding the white slave traffic - a very necessary thing - and traffic in opium and other drugs of' the kind are to be controlled. The League lias to guarantee freedom of communication and transit in the world, to provide for the equitable treatment of commerce of all the nationals who subscribe to the Treaty, and to see to other matters of national concern. In the prevention of disease, the League is to play an active and, I hope, useful part. .Red Cross organizations are to be given special prominence, with the object, possibly, of twisting them away from the problems of war to the constructive problems of peace. As a great international health organization and ameliorative agency it has, during the war, in every part of the world, ministered to the comfort and welfare of our soldiers. It is a pity to see an organization of the kind disbanded; and, in response to urgent appeals from every quarter of the globe, the League of Nations is to try and shape this great Red Cross organization for constructive ends as they affect the health and welfare of the world at large. The League is also to direct all the international bureaux of the world, if the parties will consent to hand over their control. </para>
                <para>There is also a Labour Covenant em"bodied in the Treaty, to which I should like to call attention for one or two moments. I supported this Labor Covenant from start to finish very cordially and earnestly. I believe it is quite time that something was done in the direction of internationalizing the standards and prescribing the plane on which the world's industries shall be carried on in the future. Here is .an earnest effort to do it. In the forefront of the Labor Covenant its aim is embodied in these words - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Whereas the League of Nations has -for its object the establishment of universal peace, and such a peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice; </para>
                    <para>And whereas conditions of labour exist involving such injustice, hardship, and privation to large numbers of people as to produce unrest so great that the peace and' harmony of the world are imperilled; and an improvement of those condition's is urgently required, as for example, by the regulation of the hours of work, including the establishment of a maximum working day and week, the regulation of the labour supply, the prevention of unemployment, the provision of an adequate living wage, the protection of the worker against sickness, disease, and injury arising out of his employment, the protection of children, young persons, and women, provision for old age and injury, protection of the interests of workers when employed in countries other than their own, recognition' of the principle- of freedom of association, the organization of vocational and technical education, and other measures; </para>
                    <para>Whereas also the failure of any nation to adopt  humane conditions of labour is an obstacle in the way of other nations which desire to improve the conditions in their own countries </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">There is an attempt to even up the standards of Labour and' Industrialism in the backward countries of the world. That is not an easy thing to do, and this Covenant is not drawn in the precise language that would be used if nations did not differ so much in their industrial outlook and conditions. Provision had to be made, for instance, to meet the industrial standards of India and of some of the other eastern countries. Therefore, wording had to be adopted cautiously, in order to obtain their signatures to this Treaty, and at the same time to make it a really effective instrument. These guiding principles are set out in the Peace Treaty. I should like to say to my friends on the other side that some of the most earnest minded men, in shaping this Labour Covenant for inclusion in the Peace Treaty, are men who have never had any direct relations with Labour. That was the thing that struck me. I remember well the part played in the discussion of this question by some of those men who outsiders would, perhaps, never dream would trouble their heads about it. </para>

                            worked very laboriously to bring this Covenant into its present concrete shape; but there were others of the British Delegation who took a very active, keen, and sympathetic interest in its framing. If honorable members could see the differentiation between it and the Labour Covenant as presented to the Peace Conference by the Labour bodies of Europe, they would see the shaping it has had, in order to make it fit its objective and fill its proper and appropriate place in- the Treaty as a whole.

                <para>No one will object, I think, to those things which are set out and embodied in the Treaty- The guiding principle of the Covenant pf Labour is that labour shall not be regarded merely as a commodity or article of commerce. Provision is made for the right of association; the payment of adequate wages, so as to enable workers to subscribe to reasonable standards; an eight-hour day or a forty-eight hour week, which is rather behind' what we have already obtained; a weekly rest of twenty-four hours, which should include Sunday wherever practicable - ; honorable' members will perceive that these things affect other countries a great deal more than 'they do our own - the abolition of child labour, with such' limitations upon the labour of young persons as to enable them to continue their education and assure their full physical development; equal remuneration for work of equal value - the ladies were there in full force asserting their claims to recognition - standards set by law, so far as the conditions of labour are concerned; and a provision that due regard must be paid to the equitable economic treatment of all workers lawfully resident in any country. " Equitable," not " equal," is the word used there. That is one of the difficult bits of international diplomacy that one has to face in shaping a world agreement, which is much more difficult than to shape one between ourselves. Provision is also made for a system of inspection, in which women are to take part, and so on. </para>
                <para>From the Australian point of view, there should be a warm welcome for this Labour Covenant; but there is another and material reason, and even a selfish reason, if I may say so, for' supporting it, and that is that our standards to-day are ahead of the standards of the world. I should despair of .the future of the Old Country if I did not see similar movements shaping themselves in other  coun-tries.  The war-time industrial conditions of the Old Country are becoming its normal conditions. The wages paid during the war are becoming the normal wages of peace. I candidly confess that I am glad to see it, but Great Britain could not carry on her European competition if conditions remained as they were in ,pre-war days in the rest of  Europe. That is the difficult and delicate part of the whole matter. But here, again, I think we may take some comfort. A while ago there was a strike of clerks in Berlin, which was settled upon the basis of £170 a year minimum for single men and £208 a year minimum for married men. There was a strike in the Silesian coal fields, which was settled, I think, upon a seven-hour day basis, so that while the standards are moving up in our own Empire, they are beginning to move up in other countries. This Covenant is an effort to even them up, for bv so much as we can even u,p the industrial conditions of other countries to Our own, by so much do we even up the standards of competition, and relieve our own industries. From that material point" of view, therefore, this Labour Covenant is worthy of all acceptation in a country such as ours. </para>
                <para>There is the League, and there are the Covenants. To me they seem' to bring a great 'hope to the world. They are worthy of a trial-. I do not pretend that they are going to bring in the  millennium.  Heaven is not coming down upon earth either because of the Treaty, or because of the League of Nations, or the Labour Covenant. But they set up ideals which are worthy of our acceptance, and worthy to be pursued in the hope that we may banish wai- for ever from our midst, and bring about in the future a better and higher state of civilization. </para>

                        <para>- No. He said that he had not seen the statement in the press. He could not say that he knew nothing about it, because he does know about it, and the Minister for the Navy knows about it. When this House is making its first essay into international affairs, surely it ought to be in possession of the whole of the information. Honorable members ought to know all about this treaty of 1915, because the man, or men, who agreed to that compact committed the most traitorous act that ever occurred in the history of Australia. Yet the facts are concealed from us. </para>

                <para>At this time, by arrangement with the Imperial Government, an Australian Expeditionary Force had proceeded to New Guinea, and after a few days' fighting the German Governor at Rabaul surrendered to Major-General Holmes. 11th September, 1914.- The whole of the German Possessions administered from Rabaul, comprising New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the Solomon, Caroline, Marshall, and Ladrone Islands, were transferred by surrender to the Australian authorities. </para>
                <para>Major-General Holmes set about arranging for his administrators to proceed to the headquarters of the various groups. 9th October, 1914. - Announcement that Japan had occupied Yap, in the Caroline Islands - a territory that had been surrendered to Australia. This statement caused some anxiety. 12th October, 1914, a statement was issued by the Japanese Foreign Office that Japan intended to relinquish the Marshall and Caroline Islands to Great Britain at an early date. 22nd October, 1914, we had an official statement by the Japanese Foreign Minister that the balance of the German islands north of the equator had been occupied by Japan - those islands which had been surrendered to an Australian force on the 11th September. 19th October, 1914, the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> published a statement that Australia was then ready to administer affairs in the Marshall, Caroline, and Ladrone groups. </para>
                <para>But Japan would not surrender those islands, and has refused from that day onwards to give them up. Japan had said that she was ready to hand them over to Great Britain'. The Australian Government accordingly made arrangements for their administration, but Japan would not, and will not, hand them over. </para>
                <para>The time at my disposal does not permit me to deal fully with the developments around the Pacific, although they are fraught with unfortunate possibilities for Australia in the future, but I remind honorable members of the demands made by Japan upon China in January, 1915, which, to put it mildly, did not take much account of the Anglo- Japanese Treaty ; of the ultimatum delivered by Japan to China in May following, which brought the dispute to a head, compelling China, by a threat of war, to capitulate and accept the agreement with regard to Shantung, where there are 36,000,000 defenceless Chinese who have been annexed and sold into bondage for the sole reason that they cannot defend themselves. "What is the position in regard to the Marshall, Caroline, and Ladrone Islands? They comprise upwards of 1,200 square miles of territory; they are situated immediately north of the equator. With these in the possession of Japan, that nation holds stepping-stones from Yokohama to Rabaul at intervals of not more than 500 miles. There is not more than twenty-four hours' steaming from point to point of Japanese territory between Yokohama and Rabaul. </para>
                <para>The effect of the settlement that has been made in the Peace 'Treaty is that Australia has taken its frontiers northward to Rabaul, but the frontier of Japan has been brought southward 3,000 miles to the equator, until their front door and our back door almost adjoin-. </para>

                        put up a strong plea, and quoted a string of historical examples of nations making demands for the control of strategical position=. He showed clearly that the Caroline, Marshall, and Ladrone groups of islands were certainly in that position with regard to Australia. We have thus seen the position from the stand-point of Australia as put by the Prime Minister.

                    <para>Japan's aim' must be to educate and help the natives. Justice supported the claim by Japan to the islands, and she believed that the islands could be developed to her advantage, and controlled to the greater advantage of the natives by Japan than by any other Power. </para>
                    <para>Furthermore, the whole of the people in Japan felt that this would be a proper recognition of Japan's work in the Pacific. The Japanese would resent these islands 'being placed under other control as constituting a reflection upon Japan. </para>

                            <para>- He mentioned the whole of the islands. It is of no use to quibble in that way. Why does not the Prime Minister give the information he is asked for in the House? What is the use of taking up my time by splitting straws in that fashion? The Prime Minister made the statement regarding the whole of the Pacific Islands. There was no limitation. He claims to have asked for the whole of the Pacific Possessions of Germany, although he had bargained them away in 1915, and the answer of Japan was that she would not part with the islands north of the Equator. </para>

We are compelled to put together the evidence that we gather from different parts of the world, and link up the story ourselves, because there is a deliberate conspiracy on the part of these delegates to keep from the House information which it should have at its disposal: </para>

They may think that, by keeping facts from the House, they are rendering the House a service. They may think it is an honour to them to keep facts from the House. </para>

These works, which strike even civilized men with astonishment, could only have been effected . by the labour of thousands of men working in concert and under command; and they prove from their aspect, and the evident intention of some pf them, that their builders must have had, at the time of their erection, some form of settled government and system of- religion. By whom and for what purpose they were built are questions to which no answer has yet been given..... </para><para>There are numerous relics of a vanished civilization, embankments and terraces, sites of, ancient cultivation, and solid roads, neatly paved with regular stone -blocks, ancient stone platforms and graves, and enormous council lodges of quaint design, with, high gables and lofty carved pillars..... </para><para>Professor Maximilian Brown, in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> in 1914, wrote thus concerning the wonderful ruins at  Ponape,  in the Carolines:- </para><para>It is only the student of the Pacific Ocean Olof anthropology that knows anything of  Metalanim,  a' megalithic city on the southeastern shore of Ponape, one of the most easterly islands of the Caroline Group. . . . </para><para>How could people, who had no better than sholl decorations and shell axes, have quarried and transported and erected in their place these countless blocks that only the most modern appliances would seem able to manipulate?

There are many signs in Micronesia that the existing penetration of this island world by Japanese traders is not the first in the history of the region.

No such common and offensive word as  " Jap "  is ever heard; the term Japanese is always used. The Marshall Islanders axe taught to recognise in the Japanese an honorable, capable, and mighty nation. All troublesome and detrimental influences likely to  thwart  Japanese ideals in this respect have been destroyed. It is Japanese law in the Marshalls, not German, mu those laws, with their regulations, are making a perfectly new' set of conditions, stirring up the blood of a once indolent race of Pacific natives. The Marshall Islands boys and girls have a very high average intelligence. The native schoolboy is a perfectly drilled  Japanese naval cadet, looks smart in his uniform and cap, and thinks no end of himself and his Japanese officers. If the Marshall Islands are to remain under the protection of the Japanese, in ten years' time, they will form a New Japan. </para>

It is not for me to decide whether the honorable member's remarks are in good taste or not. That is for the honorable member himself to decide, but, so far as I can see his remarks cannot be ruled out of order so long as they are associated with events connected with the Peace Treaty. The war and the Peace Treaty are so much interwoven subjects that it is not easy to lay down a hard and fast line of demarcation in a debate of this character. I would point out, however, that the extension of time which was granted to the honorable member has already nearly reached the limit of the original time of one hour and five minutes provided for by the standing order. I suggest, therefore, that if extensions are to be granted some time limit should be set to them. In any case, the extension should not exceed the original time allowed under the forms of the House. </para><continue>

                            <para>- I had almost concluded my remarks. A great deal of my time has been taken up by interruptions. As our time is limited, it was fair that I should be allowed to proceed without interruption in debating a subject of this kind. We were maintaining five divisions in the field, which meant 100,000 men. There were practically 400,000 men enlisted from this country, which was ample for the maintenance of five divisions; but the Prime Minister gave authority for the creation of a sixth division, so that if there was any lack of support it was because this Government gave authority for a larger number of divisions than the country was able to maintain. </para>

                        <para>It is strange that the majority of the Australian Contingent voted against compulsory service for Australia. Why? Let no one imagine that it was because these heroes have become opponents of the war; nor is it even because they think their country has done enough. They have voted against compulsory service, first of all, for a reason of a general nature, which applies to the whole body of Australian electors, namely, because the Australians have a horror of all moral compulsion and a burning love of liberty. These soldiers have also been influenced by another objection; they fear lest to introduce a professional army into Australia may be to infect their nation with a spirit of militarism which is not all to their taste. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is certainly taking the fullest advantage of the latitude I promised to allow in the debate, but his references must have some relation to the work of Ministers at the Peace Conference. Matters of administration incidental to events associated with, the Peace Treaty may be referred to. It is very difficult for me to say what is and what is not relevant to a matter of this kind, because the discussion itself covers so wide an area. At the same time, I think the honorable member should have some regard to the fact that the House, in granting him. an extension of time, probably did not think he would occupy the House at such great length in bringing his speech to a close, whereas, since that extension was granted him, he has occupied twice the .time originally allowed him under the Standing Orders. I ask him, therefore, to curtail his remarks. </para>

Here is the neutral evidence of these French war correspondents that our soldiers did not want conscription- </para>
