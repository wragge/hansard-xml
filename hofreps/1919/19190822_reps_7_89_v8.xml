                                <para>- Speaking generally, our police at present is to settle upon the land, in conjunction with the States, members of the Australian Imperial Force, and after that to help the Imperial Government to place upon lands in Australia ex-service men. The Imperial Government has decided to pay the fares of such men to Australia, as well as those of women who have done certain classes of war work. The question of general immigration has been considered, but is to remain in abeyance until the classes to which I have just referred are provided for. I may say that there is very great difficulty in inducing farm labourers and others employed on the land in Great Britain to come out. Shortly before the war, when I held office as Minister for External Affairs, we endeavoured to encourage that class of immigration. As the result of a canvass made on a fair day about three years previous to the war about 130 persons intimated their willingness to come to Australia; but on a subsequent occasion we found that only some four were prepared to do so. This shows that farming men in Great Britain are more inclined to remain at home. I hope, as the result of a conference with the State authorities, to arrange a policy as soon as we have settled the others on the land. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask the Minister for Home and Territories whether past protests by the Commonwealth Government in regard to the destruction of bird and seal life on Macquarie Island, south of Tasmania, have met with any response from the Tasmanian Government.If not, will he consult with his colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs, and ascertain whether it would be possible, equitably to impose some Excise duty calculated to prevent the wasteful destruction of lives of the kind which might be in time to come a valuable asset to the people of Australia? </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Mr.GLYNN. - The question of acquiring from Tasmania control of Macquarie Island is under consideration. I looked into it some five or six weeks ago,, and determined to again submit the matter to the Cabinet. About 1916 we asked the Tasmanian Government whether they were prepared to hand over to us the control of the island, which is about 900 miles from Sydney. I think that on a voyage from New Zealand an extra two days would enable vessels to call at that island, and the question is whether there may not be naval visitations to the place at times. I agree with the honorable member that something ought to be done in the direction suggested by him. When the island was transferred to Tasmania, I think it was under lease for about ?40 a year. So far as I can ascertain from the dockets, there was then a very large destruction of excellent fauna, including penguins, seals, and what are known as sea- elephants. Something should be done to put a stop to such destruction. </para>
                    <para>Mr.Fenton. -What is to be said as to the destruction of edible fish by seals ? </para>

                        <para>- I desire to draw the attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs, as the Minister in charge of foodstuffs, to a very grave situation that faces stock-owners, and which has a national significance, because of the daily increasing danger of drought affecting conditions in Victoria and Riverina, where stock to-day are in fair condition. In Southern Riverina and Victoria, when this season's lambs mature, there will be approximately 34,000,000 sheep, and the provision for slaughtering is wholly inadequate. I desire to ask the Minister whether the Government has any proposals to meet the situation, which involves, not only serious individual, but grave national, loss. </para>

I again remind honorable members that a personal explanation must be confined- to matters in respect to which an honorable member has been misrepresented or misunderstood. The sole purpose of an explanation is to correct a misrepresentation or clear up a misunderstanding of something he has said previously. The honorable member for Adelaide will not be in order in stating to the House a lot of details, which, however important and interesting in themselves, are not properly relevant to a personal explanation. </para>

                        <para>.- I regret exceedingly that circumstances have prevented me from studying the second-reading speech of the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn).</inline> I have had a hurried glance through it this morning, but have not had an opportunity of completing my perusal. The press reports of debates do not give the details that honorable members are anxious to have in studying an important measure of this kind. I regret, too, that the Government on this occasion have departed from the practice of reprinting the principal Act with the proposed amendments shown in black type, so that honorable members may see at a glance what alteration in existing law is contemplated. The Bill itself conveys no idea to honorable members of what the Government are proposing unless they are conversant with the provisions of the main Act. For instance, the Bill provides that section 2 of the principal Act shall be amended by omitting the definition of " the Minister." What that means cannot be 'comprehended without reference to the principal Act. Again, clause 3 proposes to amend section 3 of the principal Act by omitting paragraph c and' inserting in its stead another paragraph. There is nothing to tell honorable members what the original paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> provides. Only a limited number of bound volumes of the Statutes are available in the building, and yesterday, in anticipation of the continuation of this debate, at least three honorable members on this side were studying the principal Act and the effect of the Bill upon it. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Clause 3 proposes to prohibit the immigration of any idiot, imbecile, feeble-minded person, epileptic person suffering from dementia, . insane person, person who has been insane within five years previously, or person who has had two or more attacks of insanity." I do not know whether the medical experts of the Government advise that it is necessary for the country to prohibit the entry of that class of person. No worse affliction can overtake any person than insanity, and I am not aware whether the medical experts advise that a person who has suffered from insanity should be refused admission to the Commonwealth within five years of his recovery from that affliction. This provision will necessitate that every person seeking entrance to Australia shall be questioned regarding his mental history. When the Minister was explaining the Bill I asked, by interjection, what America is doing in this regard. The Minister informed us that America had taken certain action, and I know that every person arriving in the United States is first paraded on the ship, in order to ascertain whether he has been vaccinated, and then again at the Immigration Depot, Castle Garden, where further information has to be given. If we adopt this clause every person who comes to Australia will have to be asked the question, " Have you been insane during the last five years ?" </para>

What I objected to in America was the differentiation of treatment as between the different classes of passengers; and in the Bill before us we are adopting an entirely different principle from any hitherto acted upon in Australia. The Bill breaks away entirely from our previous ImmigrationAct. </para>

                            <para>- These certificates are granted only in the cases of persons who come out on assisted passages; a person who pays his own fare from Great Britain, or any other country, is not, so far as I know, asked a single question. The States at one time had control of these examinations, tout it was thought better for the Commonwealth to deal with them, and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Norris</inline> was sent Home to put the business on a proper basis, and bring about uniformity. It was then openly stated that immigration agents, not only for Australia, butt  other countries, who were paid so much per head, utilized the services of local doctors, who, of course, had no responsibility. It is true that some undesirable persons may have come to Australia under that system; hut the' provision in the Bill will apply to only one section. That, I admit, is the larger section, because more workers than shirkers, or better class people, will be affected. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister has admitted that only those who come out on assisted passages have to obtain medical certificates. Personally, I am confident that no other class of passengers requires certificates. It is true that in a later portion of the Bill it is provided that commercial travellers, tourists, and others, who do not come under clause 3, may be admitted as at present. </para>

                            <para>- But how are the mentally defectives to be picked out? I know that the Health officer meets a vessel down the Bay, and if, for instance, small-pox is discovered, the vessel is quarantined at Portsea; if not, while the vessel is off Williamstown the medical examination of 500 or 600 persons is over in an hour or two. Is the Health officer to stand in front of a person and tell him that he looks as if he were mentally defective? If this provision is to stand, it ought to apply to every person who comes to the country. </para>

                            <para>- I remember <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing, in this House, giving the details of the political career of the Minister for the Navy, and showing the number of parties to which he had belonged, and how he had preached Republican doctrines and the overthrow of Monarchy. Another honorable member, who has since gone to another place, prepared a record of the career of the Minister for the Navy, under the title, " Ere Joseph went down into Egypt," and in this there was quoted many political opinions which the honorable gentleman had expressed in former years. As I say, the Minister for the Navy, or, indeed, any person, could be excluded under such a provision as this. It all depends on the way these things are administered. The Minister himself admitted that any one could be kept out under that clause. </para>

                            <para>- It would be very easy for any member to sit down and let the Bill go through, accepting the narrow interpretation which honorable members opposite are putting on it. They say " We are aiming at anarchists," but the clause goes further. I am not going to vote for a clause of that kind, when I believe that it is contrary to a policy of which we as Britishers have always professed to be proud. If there was one tradition on which the Britisher prided himself it was that persons who had been driven out of any other country on account of the views they held could find sanctuary in Great Britain. </para>

Persons driven out of their own countries for the views they held were not those who caused danger and injury to Great Britain during the war. That came from the wealthy people, the commercial travellers, traders, and others, who had businesses in Great Britain, and whom the Government will let in under this Bill. The German commercial traveller, and the German business man can come in under this Bill. Under it, too, the Government will let in the Japanese commercial traveller, the Japanese business man, and the Japanese wealthy man. They will also allow the wealthy German to enter. </para>

I shall vote against the Bill, believing it to be only a piece of political shop-window dressing. I know that men's liberties have been taken away in this community, and even in this House. Our Standing Orders provide that every member shall be allowed to speak twice in Committee.

I lived and worked there and in the United States for five years. I had to go to the United States as an immigrant, so that I know from practical experience the treatment which steerage passengers or third-class passengers receive there compared with others. First class is not a bit too good for me after that experience.  I know the position in London, for I have lived and worked with the people there. "Will the Minister say that Great Britain has legislated on lines like those of this Bill? </para>

One regulation prohibits any one from flying the red flag with the word " Socialism " in white letters on it, but an auctioneer' is permitted to fly a red flag with his name on it. Apparently, Great Britain can deal with immigration questions by regulation and we cannot. We have to wait in some cases, but we must not wait in others. </para>

                            <para>- A Bill of this character will tend to stir up hatred. It will teach our children to treat certain people, not as human beings, but as something quite different. I really believe that the object the Ministry have in introducing this measure is to cover up their misdeeds and their failure to take action in other directions. On one occasion two gentlemen were driving along a road behind a restive horse, and when they approached a traction engine the driver said to . the other, " I will give him a good clout over the head." " Why ?" said his companion, " Because," said the driver, "he can think of only one thing at a time. If I give him a clout over the head he will think of that, and will forget about the traction engine." Ministers think that by stirring up their supporters with this class of legislation they will distract their attention from the profiteers. They will say to the electors, " We legislated to keep every German out of Australia for five years," but they will not tell them that at the same time they will permit German commercial travellers or wealthy German tourists to come in, or that they will have one method of examination applied to those who travel in the steerage, and another to those who travel in the first saloon. I object to a continuation of this policy of keeping up hatred. We should endeavour to get the people, of Australia to realize that no good purpose will be served by doing so. Professor Meredith Atkinson, in a recent address, said that he had heard more extreme views put forward in Oxford University than he had heard at any gathering on the Yarra Bank or elsewhere. Apparently those who expound such views in Oxford University would be prohibited immigrants under the proposed new paragraph <inline font-style="italic">gd.</inline></para>

                        <para>.- In its general intention the Bill should receive the support of a very solid majority in the House. I have waited for a considerable number of years to see some of the proposals contained in it embodied in the law. It is a long time since I first urged that we should take power to <inline font-style="italic">exclude</inline> certain undesirable aliens, and I am pleased that at last action is being taken in that direction. When I hear the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> and others expressing the fear that this legislation will interfere with liberty and freedom, I am reminded of the exclamation made by a famous Frenchwoman when she was about to be led to the scaffold, during the Reign of Terror, that there are many follies indeed committed and uttered in the name of freedom. Among the worst are those conditions which have allowed criminals and degenerates to flood Australia with practically no restraint. Unfortunately, among our alien population there is a considerable percentage of undesirables, who have been allowed to remain in the country, and it is a blot on our legislation and administration. </para>

Power is to be taken to exclude anarchists, but there are anarchists who are as harmless as the proverbial lamb. There is a school of anarchy which talks about and looks forward to a time when there will be no law, or any form of government, simply be-' cause the people will be so prone to do the right thing that restraint of any kind whatsoever will be unnecessary. </para>

                            <para>- There have been, and probably are, systems of government in the world at the present time which it has been, and would be, any patriotic man's duty to oppose, and overthrow, if possible, by military measures. Prior to the war the system of government in Russia was one that, I think, any one would have been justified in opposing by force, and if there is any form of government in Mexico at present I am not sure that it would not be a very good thing if a sufficient number of ' patriots were prepared to take u,p arms and re-establish a better condition of affairs' in that country. It might be possible under this Bill to exclude a man who would be a credit to any country. We can all recall men like Kossuth and Garibaldi, who took up arms against civilized Governments, and are today enrolled amongst the heroes who have fought for the  be6t  interests of humanity. I should not like to see placed on our statute-book a measure which might, by some blunder on the part of an overzealous Government officer, perpetrate an outrage on a man of that class. At the same time, I recognise the stern necessity in these days of excluding from this country men who are prepared to take up arms against countries with representative institutions. </para>

                    <para>There are in the world to-day large numbers of men whose idea is simply the destruction of all existing systems of government. They would destroy even such systems of government as we have in Australia. These are men to whom destruction means progress; to whom ruin means prosperity,. There is only one method of dealing with such individuals. When we find them in  our country, we should either throw them out or put some equally emphatic end to their machinations and their mischiefmaking. </para>

                            <para>- I am coming to that point. I desire to see larger powers taken with respect to deportation. There is power under clause 7 .to deport, within three years after his arrival in Australia, any person convicted of a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment for one year or longer; or who is living on the prostitution of others. "Under the Bill as it stands a man might be found guilty of perhaps the most dastardly offence that could be imagined - living on the prostitution of poor wretched women - three years and a month after the date of his arrival here, and having been punished for that offence, he would be  free again to carry on within Australia his infamous trade. We should have power to deport those persons at any time after they have been convicted of such ah offence. </para>

My view is that any person found guilty of an indictable offence of the character mentioned in clause 7 should be liable to deportation at any time after his arrival in Australia. I tried to introduce the principle in another measure of this kind which was before the House some years ago. </para>

                            <para>- It is worthy of consideration. It might be advisable to provide that, unless a man is actually sentenced to imprisonment for twelve months or more, he should not be liable to deportation. There might be circumstances which would justify some consideration for a person who had committed an offence of the kind set out in clause 7, but who, because of special features was sentenced to only a short term of imprisonment. </para>

                    <para>Clause 7 also gives power to deport persons who have become inmates of an insane asylum or public charitable institution within three years after their arrival in Australia. There is one class of individual with which Australia has been cursed. I refer to the typical waster, who has been sent out by his people for his country's good, but certainly not for  the good of Australia. I have known him to live here for years on their remittances, a pest and a nuisance to every one, and eventually to be put for the remainder of his years in a charitable institution. Several cases of the kind have come within my own experience. The Government should take power to restrain that kind of immigration into Australia. Speaking as one who knows something of the view taken of this matter in the Old Country, I may say that Australia has been regarded too often as a country to which should be sent all such undesirables. It is not fair to this country, because they are a taint to the community, and are just as objectionable as others who commit certain offences which lead to their imprisonment. </para>
                    <para>I shall give the Bill my general support. I trust the Minister will accept my suggestions in the spirit in which they are uttered, and, if necessary, when we get into Committee, I shall move amendments designed to improve the measure in the direction I have indicated. </para>

                        <para>. - I sympathize with some of the remarks made by the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler)</inline> as to the class of persons whom the Government might be at liberty to deport.  His  suggestion is that a number of those mentioned in clause 3 of the Bill are of the most undesirable class, and in the best interests of the country should be subject to deportation at any time the Government see fit to deport them. I would like to draw his attention, however, to the fact that under the principal Act it is quite competent for the Government to deport certain persons of a criminal type, so that it is not necessary to incorporate in this Bill what has already been provided for in the principal Act. </para>

                            <para>- Clearly, by arrangement. The honorable member was complaining that we were going much further than the United States of America has gone. In America, it is necessary that passports shall be first obtained from the American Consul, who, before issuing them, satisfies himself as to the character and health of the applicants. In that way, the fullest possible precaution is taken. In the past, Australia has been rather regardless of those precautions, and I think it wise that some effort should be made to protect ourselves against the conditions and dangers which we know exist. </para>

                            <para>- When those with whom the honorable member is allied are fighting to remain in alliance with the British Empire, we shall recast our views and see something in them to admire. The only crime of the Ulstermen is that they insist on remaining a part of and in association with the Mother Country, and refuse to belong to an enemy nation, and to subscribe to a form of Home Rule Which makes for the establishment of a republic which, in turn, would aim at the destruction of the British Empire. I congratulate the Government on recognising conditions as they find them. They realize that the anarchists and direct.actionists are a menace to the community, and that the hideous Bolshevik element is insidiously penetrating, with deadly effect, various peaceful communities. They see. abroad the emissaries of Lenin, Trotsky, and other criminals who are responsible for the appalling conditions of affairs existing in Russia, and they are resolved that men of that type shall not be permitted to enter Australia. </para>

                            <para>- We are dealing with the peaceful community of Australia, not with Russia. Our people desire to continue to live peaceful and contented lives, and the only means of insuring that is to recognise ordered government and discourage revolution. Every person in Australia may be constitutionally represented in Parliament, and may by that means play his part in the promotion of ordered government. There is no democratic aspiration that cannot be achieved through the existing franchise for this Parliament. Bearing that fact in mind, we are fighting for the maintenance of ordered government, and to secure social and industrial peace; the anarchist cancer must be cut out ruthlessly. Some honorable members opposite are very solicitous lest men of the anarchist or Bolshevik type should be excluded from Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps not; but I would be very glad if clause 3 of the Bill could be linked up with section 7 of the Act, which provides for the deportation of undesirables. The deportation of these criminals seems to be a matter of great concern to some hon.orable members opposite, but I assure them that there is not the slightest chance of any innocent man coming within the provisions of the Bill. The undesirableness of an immigrant is to be determined,  not  on the mere <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit</inline> of the Minister. A Board is to be constituted, of which a Judge of the Supreme Court, or some other individual of judicial position, will be  chairman,  to investigate and decide whether certain persons come within the terms of the Bill. If it is found that a man was convicted of a criminal offence, or is living on the prostitution of others, or has been an inmate of an insane asylum or a public charitable institution, or - and this is the part that hurts honorable members - he is an " anarchist or person who advocates the overthrow by force or violence of the established government of the Commonwealth, or of any State', of of any other civilized country- </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member need not worry himself on my account. If a man advocates the assassination of public officials, does the honorable member think that such a person should be allowed to remain in the Commonwealth ? Does he object to advocates of assassination being deported ? The Bill will prohibit also a person who teaches the unlawful destruction of property. Perhaps that is more to the honorable member's liking ! It is obvious that the classes of persons enumerated in that provision are no mere figment of the Minister's imagination. Such individuals exist in our midst, and they are undesirable citizens of whom Australia should get rid at the earliest possible moment. The Government realize that these agents are the cause of the dislocation of government, anarchy, starvation, and distress. But they do not wish to do any man an injustice. They provide that suspected persons may be brought before a Board, and only if they are proved to be undesirables of the type prohibited, will they be deported. My only regret is that Australia did not earlier enact similar legislation. The country would have been much better off to-day if that had been done. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member is referring to the German Royal family, the civilized world has ruled them to be despised criminals. I am certain that had victory gone to the Germans, instead of to the Allies, they would not have shown to- us the same tender solicitude that some honorable members are desirous of extending to them. If there exists hatred and bitterness, our enemies alone are responsible for it, and, furthermore, the war has revealed to us the hideous and infamous side of the German character, and we are legislating with that knowledge. In any case, the prohibition of enemy aliens is limited to a period of five years, at the end of which Parliament can review the position. </para>

                            <para>- Lord Milner does not come within the provisions of this Bill, and the honorable member knows that his reflection is unjust and wicked. When the Germans have become properly penitent, and have shown remorse for the criminality for which they have been guilty, we shall be able to reconsider their claims to more considerate treatment. This Parliament need not show undue tenderness in dealing with circumstances which we know to exist. Therefore I gladly afford my support to the Bill, whilst being of opinion that its provisions might be strengthened in several respects. </para>

                            <para>- I welcome the Bill in one sense - because it will give us on this side a free hand when we get into power. I am opposed to the Bill, not because, as the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> suggested, it is merely a harmless measure introduced for electioneering purposes, with a view to placing this side of the House in an invidious position'. I do not take that view at  all; I believe the Bill is part and parcel of a conspiracy of the organized thieves of society, who to-day are taking steps in every country of the world to deport people who are opposed to existing social order - to the existing economic basis on which society rests. It is from that point of view that I oppose the Bill. I do not propose while I remain in this House to lend any assistance to the governing classes of this or any other country to safeguard themselves from the well-merited punishment which is fast approaching. </para>

It is designed to protect those people who have taken society by the throat, and are robbing the great bulk of the people. It is such measures as this that meet every effort of the people to release themselves from the crowd who are fattening and battening on them. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister tells us that he deliberately struck out -the word " believes ", but he has carefully inserted " advocates or teaches ". It is a very fine distinction when a man may believe in a certain thing, but so long as he does not open his mouth he is all right. No doubt the word was left out because it is impossible to determine whether a man believes' in a thing unless he advocates or teaches it. To my mind, though I may be wrong, the fellow countrymen of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn),</inline> and myself, are to a large extent members of an organization which seeks to establish the government of their own country by its own people, and, by reason of that membership, would be debarred from entering Australia. </para>

                            <para>- The Sinn Fein organization. I have a copy of the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> of 13th June last, which reports the findings of the Irish-American Commission, which, with the permission of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George, and armed with passport3 granted by the British and American authorities, made an investigation of the conditions in Ireland at the time of their visit. This Commission has made seventeen specific charges against the administration of the British Government in Ireland and the armed occupation of Ireland by British military troops. Amongst those charges is one which I say would justify the overthrow by force of any Government in any so-called civilized country that dared to treat its inhabitants in the manner described. If those conditions existed in Australia, England, or any other country, the people would have no manhood in them- - would be worse than serfs and slaves - if they did not revolt by physical force, or any other means, against such damnable conditions. Amongst the seventeen charges made by the Commission are the following: - </para>

Under the Bill, people who resent that state of affairs in Ireland, and who propose to take active steps to remedy it, by whatever means in their power, will be prohibited from entering Australia. The Minister knows that the great majority of the Irish people to-day are determined to get rid of these damnable conditions. </para>

                    <para>According to the Bill, after the expiration of  five  years, any person who is of " German, Austro-German, Bulgarian, or Hungarian parentage or nationality, or is a Turk of Ottoman race," may still be excluded from this country for advocating or taking part in the overthrow of autocratic institutions, by force. By some it will be said that such an interpretation will not be placed on the provisions of the Bill, and I believe that it will not in the case of the higher and ruling classes. Men of the type of the German baron, who was allowed to have his wireless-equipped yacht off the English coast during the whole period of the war, will not be debarred from entering the Commonwealth, but a Karl  Liebknecht,  a Rosa Luxembourg, or any German working-class advocate of social justice, would be excluded, just because they happen to be German. </para>

As the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler)</inline> put it in dealing with Prince Kropotkin, a man may be theoretically in favour of another form of government, which he believes is a higher form than the parliamentary system, and may not be engaged in deeds of violence at all. If that man came to Australia, believing that it would be more advantageous to the people of Australia, from the administrative, social, and industrial points of view, to substitute a Soviet form of administration for our existing parliamentary institutions, would he be shut out by this Bill? </para>

The practice of picking out certain- clauses or portions of clauses, and referring to them in detail is quite irregular in speaking on the second reading of a measure. It is only proper to deal with clauses in detail during the Committee stage, when the general principles of a Bill may not be discussed. </para>

Minister is explaining the provisions of a Bill, more latitude is allowed to him than is usually accorded in the general discussion in the House, so that he may acquaint honorable members with the character and nature of the provisions of the Bill, thus enabling them to be better equipped for discussing the clauses -when the Bill goes into Committee, where the clauses can be fully debated and any desired amendments may be moved. </para>

                            <para>- The Bill proposes to debar from coming to Australia, or to deport,' people who advocate the unlawful destruction of property. A similar provision was embodied in the Unlawful Associations Act, and when that measure was before this House I pointed out that advocacy of the unlawful destruction of property might be construed to mean " destruction of perishable commodities or foodstuffs " ; and the man who does not happen to be born in Australia, but is an official of a union on strike in an industry connected with perishable foodstuffs - a butchers' union, for instance, or any other union in connexion with the meat trade - might be accused of having advocated the destruction of property because, owing to the strike, certain produce had been destroyed. Of course, we have been assured that the Unlawful Associations Act would not be used in that way, but the experience of the people of Australia has been that a Government which is exercising power of a dubious nature, such as that which is embodied in the clauses of the Bill before us to-day, places on it an interpretation to suit itself. The experience we have had during the war, and since then, in respect to the deportation of men, does not give the people any feeling of security that the Government of the day will not abuse the power given by this Bill. Men have been deported without the least shadow of a trial or opportunity to defend themselves, and this Bill does not give adequate protection to members of the working class who may come into conflict with the vested interests of the country, as represented by the Government of the day. I do not believe that the policy of which this Bill is a sample has been developed in Australia. It seems to me it is part and parcel of an . international arrangement to deport members of the working classes who are opposed to the existing social order in any country in which they have not been born, and who seek to develop in it a system of government more in harmony with economic evolution. Men have been deported from America, and South Africa is adopting this same method of dealing with persons. Some years ago the Union Government deported seven or eight men - extra constitutional action was required in order to do so - solely because of their connexion with an industrial trouble in Johannesburg. The measure before us will permit the same thing to be done here. First of all, the Bill provides that men who are known to hold ideas calculated to subvert the existing form of capitalistic government, known as parliamentary representation, shall be prevented from entering Australia; then, in another portion, it says that if persons holding these ideas are found in this country at any time within three years after they have arrived here, they may be deported. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue><para>There is an apparently innocent line in the Bill, which provides that a person who has previously been deported under any Statute shall be debarred from re-entering the Commonwealth. If the people of any country are living under conditions under which they are not prepared to continue, and they rise against a tyrannical minority that hitherto has controlled the country by holding down the majority of the people by force, if they succeed in overthrowing the existing Government, that " existing institution " for which this Bill provides, I see no reason why people who take part in that movement should be debarred from entering Australia. What danger would there be in permitting persons to enter this country who have taken part in a fight for freedom- in their own country; for example, the Russians who overthrew Czardom, the Germans who overthrew the .Kaiser, or the Austrians who overthrew the monarchy at Vienna? Of course, there is portion of the Bill which prevents these people from entering Australia for a period of five years on the specific ground of their nationality, but after the expiry of five years this Statute will still be in force. Are we to' understand that people who come from presumably civilized countries, where republics have been established, similar to those in America' and France, may be debarred from entering Australia? It seems to me a peculiar attitude to take up, unless it is aimed at the working-class people who seek to alter the existing social system. Was not the present American form of government established by force? Was not our British system established by armed revolt against the Stuarts? If in those days it was good to revolt against tyranny, oppression, or autocracy, in order to obtain freedom, surely it is good to-day to do so. </para><interjection>

Furthermore, the party to which the honorable member belongs has proposed, through the columns of the press, to disfranchise men who strike. If ever a day comes in this country when any Australian Government dares to disfranchise those who refuse to work under adverse economic conditions, and have the manhood to strike, that Government will be overthrown by force. </para>

                            <para>- I am pointing out reasons why certain particularly  obnoxious  clauses in the Bill should be  negatived.  I can anticipate a condition of  affairs  arising' iri this country when the' people will no longer be prepared to allow agents of Trusts and Combines to use the. so-called constitutional machinery of government to delude and hoodwink the; public while they are actually  perpetuating  autocratic conditions such as existed in Europe prior to the overthrow of the Autocracy. </para>

I could have no faith in any Board appointed to deal with matters of this' character by the existing Administration. I do not believe this provision will give, the slightest protection to a man whom the Government propose to deport. Those, who have followed the treatment meted, out to Paul Freeman and others who have been deported, from Australia will have, the last of their illusions dissipated as to this proposed Board offering any protection to men ordered to be deported. As long as some people powerfully situ'ated are allowed to pull the strings, any one may be deported from this country,, and this Government will tamely carry out the behests pf its masters." </para></speech>

                        <para>.- I gather from the speech just made by the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> that he is wishful that the riff-raff of the world, who are now being turned out of every country in Europe, as well as out of America, should be given free asylum here. Every man who has proved to' be dangerous in any other country is a fit man, in his opinion, to come into Australia, no matter what' principles he may advocate. This Bill, he says, is aimed against the working classes. As a matter of fact, it is aimed against, not the working classes, but those who work the working classes. It is aimed at people who are trying to get into Australia, and who, for the most part, have never done an honest day's work in their lives. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The assertion was made by the honorable member that those who advocate systems of government different from our own are perfectly entitled to come here. He seems to think that the Bill is directed against citizens of Australia, and that under it they will have no right to alter our Constitution when they desire to do so, even by force. If they are strong enough, they have that right. It is not proposed to deport a citizen of Australia who has been resident here for three years. The honorable member's whole argument seemed to be an attempt to suggest that this was an effort to suppress in every way those who are already citizens of the Commonwealth. He even went so far as to say that people from other countries who advocated different forms of government would make suitable citizens. According to that line of argument, the man who advocates and pushes the view that citizens of China or Japan have a perfect right to come here, and to advocate the abolition of the White- Australia policy, should be welcomed by us with open arms. Our White Australia policy, as a matter of fact, is based upon economic considerations, and not on the question of colour. If the honorable member's argument is to be carried to its logical conclusion, it means that Japanese, Chinese, and other coloured people should be allowed to come here, and by their presence here in sufficient numbers to upset the whole policy of a White Australia. </para>

                    <para>In response to- an interjection, the honorable memberspoke' of the "limited mentality" of those Who sit on this side of the House. I do not know whether he is a competent judge, 'but, taking' it at its worst, the " limited mentality " of honorable members on this side, and that of the majority of the people of Australia, is such as to lead them to the view that in past years, not only in this country, but in Great Britain and other lands, there has grown up a class of individuals that is dangerous to good government and the nation. In the past, we have been very foolish in allowing such -people to come in and to try to upset ordinary forms of good government. The peoples of other countries have realized that they have been foolish in taking to their bosom these men, who are prepared to stab them in the back, and, at the first opportunity, to assassinate them. The honorable member for Barrier advocates that we should continue to submit to the humiliations that we suffered during the whole of. the war period from the presence in our midst of men of this class, and that we should again allow such men to come in free. </para>

                    <para>. - Have the Government seriously considered this clause from the point of view of self-preservation? I am concerned as to what might happen to future possible supporters of the Government if we prohibit the entry of " any idiot, imbecile, feeble-minded person, or person suffering from dementia." Do the Government think that any- wage-earner in Australia, other than idiots and feeble-minded persons, could possibly support them ? </para>

' If Ministers' are to be' be the judges, I object, for. my own personal . comfort may be concerned. ' The officials, of the Department, are trained in this kind of work, and certainly it should not be 'left to the Ministers themselves. Personally, T would submit myself to the present Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn),</inline> but the peculiarity of the present Government is that amongst its members there is only one man who asserts himself, 'and who has any power, and that is the gentleman who is supposed to arrive here in a- few days. </para>

                        <para>- In my weakness, I have supported measures introduced by the Government only to find them used, not for the preservation, but for the destruction of the liberties of the people, and I am afraid that any legislation passed now may be used in the same way. The War Precautions Bill appeared to me just as innocent and necessary as the present Bill, and I did not oppose it. That Act, however, is used for political purposes; and if the clause before us is permitted to stand, it may be that the Minister for Defence, or some other Minister, who does not think with me in politics, will charge me with mental aberration. The Government have made this clause most comprehensive, embracing as it does all who may be politically opposed to them, and every possible opinion that an immigrant may have on any phase of life. The Government are trying to make the people believe that . they desire to exclude individuals, of anarchial opinion, or those who are mentally deranged - people who think that the only method of reform is by bombs. But the Government reserve to themselves the right of saying what "anarchy" is, and of administering the Bill at their o'wn. sweet will. In this way, any person who endeavours: to.' enter the country, and who is objected to by the Government, 'may , be,: taken by the scruff of the neck and " booted out. Australia  is- a country of large areas, and there are other nations which declare that we hold it. in a manner injurious to the rest of the world. We are all wishful for desirable immigrants, not desirable in the opinion of the Government and their supporters, but desirable in the opinion of civilized people; and not- one act by the present Government' can claim any civilized  method. There' is not one act by that arch-fiend, the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.. Hughes)-</inline></para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> has asked me one relevant question - who it is that decides whether a person comes within this clause or not. I do not want to offer an opinion, as the honorable member has done. I simply tell him that before an immigrant leaves England he is examined as to his mental . and physical capacity. If he passes the doctor he gets a certificate. On the voyage out it may be discovered that a person comes within the terms of this Act regarding mental or physical debility; an examination is then made by the medical official on board. If on landing here it is found necessary, a further examination takes place. That is all provided for in the original Act. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The regulations actually contain the words which we are now adding to the subsection of the Act as regards imbecile's, idiots, , and so on. As I said on the second- reading, they are the basis of administration, but, to give clearness and validity in the matter, the words are now being added to the Act. There is no alteration in the existing . procedure. The test is not applied by the Minister, but by the medical men. </para>

                        <para>- All persons coming out as assisted immigrants are examined to test their fitness. Under the regulations, although- they have not been much in operation during the war, the immigrants are examined at the ports from which they come. For instance, under section 3d of the Act, "Any intending immigrant shall be examined' as to his physical and mental fitness by a medical referee, and shall answer the authorized list of questions put to him by the medical referee." That applies to any one coming out as an immigrant. </para>

                        <para>- It applies to any one who is an immigrant. If a person is coming out here on a trip only he is not examined. I explained on the second reading that an immigrant does not mean an ordinary tourist, but means a person who is coming out to make this place his home. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports asked if the test would be applied by the Minister or by an official. </para>

                    <para>.- The main principles of the Bill are contained in two clauses, and that fact justifies the gracious help which the Opposition . have afforded the Government . to get- the Bill into the Committee stage as soon as possible. We are enabled under this clause to consider by itself one main principle. I commend the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> for the generous tone in which he introduced the Bill, and only regret that he had, by reason of his associations, to make concessions' so far as he did to the passions . and prejudices of the Government and those who support them. The Bill, and particularly this clause, involves an extension of the policy of exclusion from the Commonwealth, and involves, also, the exercise of the right, which should be used with great moderation and care, to remove persons from the Commonwealth. While in its language the clause penalizes the advocacy of violent action for governmental purposes so far as to make it a ground for deportation, it constitutes in its very terms a violent assault upon a cherished democratic principle. I refer to the right, which should be inherent in the people of every country, to assert the form of government under which they think they ought to live, and, if necessary, to resort to armed rebellion if they believe that they are being harshly treated or oppressed. If we deny that right, we thereby insist upon the justice of any oppressor holding the people in chains until they can, by constitutional and peaceful means, induce him to remove the gyves from their wrists and the chains from their limbs. </para>

                    <para>. -  I put a question to the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> to-day, with a desire to bring under his own and the Government's notice the gravity of the position as I see it with regard to live stock in Australia, and particularly in Victoria and the Riverina. The situation, I think, could be relieved by a rapid and sagacious stroke of statesmanship on the combined part of the Commonwealth and State authorities. I know they are unable to relieve us so far as rain is concerned, and I do not desire to put forward gloomy forebodings while there is still time for the season to develop favorably in Victoria, but I do press upon the notice of the Government the following facts-: I have twice, by questions in this House, addressed to the Acting Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> and to the Minister in charge of shipping <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton),</inline> asked that the most urgent possible representations be made -abroad for the fullest supply of insulated space to relieve the present congestion in the limited frozen storage accommodation existing in this State. To-day Victoria has, roughly, 17,000,000 head of sheep, and there are about 10,000,000 sheep in southern Riverina. If we add  a moderate allowance for lambs, we can safely say that we have in sight and on foot in this area as many as 34,000,000 head of sheep and lambs, representing today one of the Commonwealth's greatest liquid assets. There is still time to preserve the greater portion of these sheep from loss. Even if the season goes well, we cannot cope with that number. But the prospects of a normal season are very poor in Victoria, while I notice that in New South Wales days have been set aside for prayer for rain. Scientists are also at work; but still the rain does not come. </para>

                        <para>- Any one who has a decent outlook on Australian affairs would not for a. second think of praying for a drought. We have only our primary industries to look to to meet our huge, colossal national debt, and even the poorer people of this country would be mistaken in 'thinking that a drought would be a short cut out of their trouble. This is not an ordinary matter, and I impress' on the Government that they must not look on calmly while a calamity may overtake the country. . Provision already exists in Victoria for the cold storage of mutton and lamb; but even if it were going at full speed all the year, utilizing the whole of its machinery and space, it could not conceivably meet the situation.  The sheep on the hoof cannot be saved unless we have the aid of the elements. I do not hope for the intervention of the Government in that respect ; but if the elements do not come to our rescue, the next 'best thing to do is to endeavour to create a sufficient organization to deal with the tremendously abnormal conditions that will meet us . within a few weeks even if rain should fall. All the pastoralists are holding on to their sheep to-day if they can do so, so that they may shear them. We are on the eve of shearing in Victoria. In other States shearing is in progress. After, shearing the market will become flooded with sheep. Every pastoralist in difficulty will rush his stock to the market; but there will not be sufficient organization to absorb them. There is still time to create it if the Commonwealth and the States will co-operate to put up' immediately sufficient cold storage on a colossal scale, to turn all this stock into sovereigns. </para>

                        <para>- When the lambs mature, if they do, the limited area of Victoria and southern . Riverina will have to make provision for 34,000,000 head of sheep. A calamity faces us if they are allowed to die, because there will be no means of killing them, holding them to cold storage, and exporting them. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> ought to make immediate and urgent representations to the Imperial authorities. The people of Europe,, and even Great Britain, want food. If stock die on our hands,,, we shall be guilty not only of negligence, but also of a crime in allowing this national waste to take place. I would not be taking up the time of the House at this late hour on an ordinary matter. I do not want Ministers to fold their arms and look on while this calamity is threatening us. I am aware that the huge meat contracts with the Imperial Government are held by the States until three months after peace is finally declared, but Commonwealth Ministers cannot be held blameless if they allow stock to die while there is a chance of turning the sheep into millions of sovereigns. Ministers have interfered with . the States when they have not been asked to do so. Here is a chance when the country looks to them to devise some means by which they can co-operate with State Governments and save Australia from a huge national loss. </para>

                    <para>.- There is a grave situation in North Queensland which can be relieved  by  the  Ministry  , and I trust  it  will be done very soon. The cause  to  which the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> has referred may have the effect  of  making food cheaper, but the situation  in  North Queensland can only result  in  making food dearer. There is a great scarcity  of  sugar, and  it  may  be  necessary  to  import from Java, where the price is now £50 per ton f.o.b. When people have  to  pay  that  price for sugar  it  will make a very serious inroad  on  their purses. </para>

                        <para>- I have received telegrams stating that the sugar mills are closing owing to the scarcity of bags, not  because the crop has been a failure. As a matter of fact, the crop is fairly up to the average. 'There are plenty of bags in Australia, but, because of the strike, they cannot be conveyed to the north, where they are so urgently needed. I had a conversation with the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> a little time ago, and he told me that he was doing all he possibly could to have the necessities of the district relieved. To-day I would like him to say whether anything has' been done or is likely to be done in order to make bags available to the North Queensland sugar mills? </para>

                    <para>;- I have been informed that several returned soldiers employed in the Taxation Department for some months past have received notice that their services will not be required after 1st September next. As the taxpayers' returns have just been sent in, one would expect that there would be ample work in the Department for any officer who has . recently been employed by it, and I ask the Minister in charge of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> to make inquiries and see that the places of those returned soldiers , are not filled by men who have not done their duty to their country. </para>

                    <para>. -  I wish to draw attention to a matter that I spoke about some time ago. Recently, when I was at Canberra, I met a couple of Australian girls, daughters of a manufacturer in Fremantle, whose son has been fighting at the Front. They had married naturalized Germans, and accompanied their husbands to Fiji. Their husbands were interned there and brought to the Canberra Concentration Camp. </para>

                    <para>.- I understand that the repatriation regulations are so framed that a young man who has returned from the Front, but has not previously been in business, is unsuccessful if he submits an application for an advance to establish him in business. I have received a communication from a young -man, who waited on me this morning. He has an opportunity of representing four firms trading between Victoria and Queensland, and needs about £100 to set him up in this business. However, he is debarred from getting assistance from the Repatriation Department because he is not maimed; and was not. previously in business. Many of our lads went to the war when they were eighteen or nineteen years of age, and had no opportunity of being in business for themselves. Now that they have returned, they are of a marriageable age, and they find that they must get into some business in order to set themselves up in homes. . </para>

I am informed that where a grocer buys several tons of unrefined sugar he is not only now charged for what he had to pay for the refined article, but that, in addition, he has to pay for the bags in which it is supplied. If unrefined sugar can alone be supplied by the refining companies, then the people should not have to pay for it what is ordinarily charged for the refined article. </para>

                <para>As to the question of the vocational training of returned soldiers, many of us are not sure whether the limitation as to age is provided for in the Act itself or under a regulation. The position is that the Repatriation Department does not provide for the vocational training of returned soldiers over twenty years of age unless it is in respect of  a  trade which they were following before they enlisted. I know of  a  returned soldier who enlisted when he was eighteen or nineteen years of age, and was principally engaged in connexion with telegraphic, telephonic, and signalling' work at the Front. He became practically an expert in electrical work, and, upon his return, was offered  by a  firm of electrical engineers employment at  a  rate representing what he could earn end agreed upon by the Repatriation Department. But, because he  was  not in the trade before he enlisted, and is now over 20 years of age, the Repatriation Department refuses to make up the difference between the wage offered by this firm and the  Wage  required. </para>
                <para>Most of us think that wo could make  a  success of  any  business that we chose to enter, and I know that many returned soldiers, in the early days of the Repatriation Department, went into businesses for which they were not fitted, and failed to succeed. Only last evening  a  young man who, before he enlisted, was in the electrical engineering trade, and held excellent testimonials, came to me, and told  me  that, owing to the loss of  a  leg, he was unable to follow his ordinary occupation, and that he had commenced work as  a  manufacturer of clothing. A firm had offered him an order for 10,000 coats according" to  a  sample submitted by him, but, while he was able to get some private backing, the Repatriation Department  refused  to supplement that assistance, because he was not in business when he went to  the  war. I shall do all I can to help  him,  and if there is any difficulty in the way of granting such assistance, I think that the Act should be amended. The House, 1 believe, is unanimously of opinion that those who are likely to make good in any business should be given  a  chance- A  man  of thirty is more likely to quickly acquire the details of a new industry than is  a  youth of twenty. Such  a  man would recognise tha', he was getting into years, and that, as this was his only chance, he must give the closest attention to his work. I ask the Acting Leader of the House to make representations to the Minister for Repatriation that some relief should he granted in the directions I have indicated. </para>

                        <para>- The position is that during the last two months the Government have been making the most urgent representations to the Imperial authorities to make further provision than was contemplated by them for the supply of insulated space to take our meat away. We found ourselves in ' the middle of winter with the cool stores practically full, and with the knowledge that, apart altogether from drought or the possibility of drought, there would be an abnormal quantity of stock coming into the cool stores in the early part of the year. The tonnage which the Imperial Government proposed to allot to Australia was altogether insufficient to deal with the accumulations actually in store, let alone any provision that might be made in the immediate future. We cabled repeatedly in the most urgent terms, asking that additional insulated space should be made available to us. At first we did not get much of a response, but during this week we received a cablegram stating that, in addition to the tonnage which had been allotted, the Imperial Government .proposed to allot a further 34,000 tons of insulated space for the removal of frozen meat from Australia during the month of September. That will materially relieve the existing congestion, and make room for a large number of sheep and  lambs during the early part of next year. I assure honorable members that the Government are fully alive to the urgency of the position, particularly in view of the fact that the only way of saving: to this country the value of a very large number of stock, if the drought becomes severe, will- be by running into cold' storage at the first possible moment all those that, are in condition. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot say that I have. Even if the storage- were not provided, and! the sheep' were not. put in cold stores-, mutton' would not be any cheaper if a drought happened:. There would be no mutton fit for consumption after the first rush of stock to- the market. The market might drop for a week or two, and then- it would soar higher than it had ever been. The doctrine that meat may be made cheaper by not.' providing' cold storage is absurd. I admit that something may yet be done, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour, to- meet the abnormal condition of affairs, existing in the south of Australia at. the. present time.. Anything; the Government, can do in co-opera-, tion with the States to relieve the existing position, will be done; and we shall give the- most earnest' consideration to any representations by the. State Governments. We realize the seriousness of the position, and the absolute necessity, an Australian stand-point of conserving our. capital . assets in the form, of sheep and lambs: </para>
