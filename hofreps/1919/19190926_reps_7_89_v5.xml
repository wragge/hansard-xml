                        <para>- Some six weeks ago I wrote to the Defence Department regarding the case of a member of the Australian Imperial Force named Baker, who had been four times wounded, and had on several occasions got into trouble, with the result that he had returned to Australia penniless, and had no deferred pay to draw. In reply, I was told that the matter would receive consideration. About the same time I also brought under the notice of the Department the case of an Australian who joined the British Forces just after the sinking of the <inline font-style="italic">Lusitania,</inline> and who, after serving for some years, now finds himself stranded in England, and desires to be repatriated. In answer to that inquiry, I was also informed that the matter would receive attention. Will the Assistant Minister for Defence expedite the inquiries into these matters, with a view to some satisfactory action being taken ? </para>

                    <para class="block">This is a  small  Bill of a few clauses to amend certain sections of the Trade Marks Act 1905-1912. The first clause is_ an amendment of section 18 of the principal Act, which deals with the question of the registration of trade marks, and provides that the Registrar may refuse an application to register trade marks which contain such expressions as &#34; Trade Mark,&#34; &#34; Registered,&#34; &#34; Copyright,&#34; or any representation of the King, the Queen, or any member of the Royal Family, or of the Royal Crown, or any representation of the Royal Arms, or of the Goat of Arms of the Commonwealth or any State. It is intended by clause 2 to amend this section by providing that the Registrar may refuse to register - </para>

                        <para>Any word or mark which is declared by the Governor-General by proclamation to be for the purposes of this section a prohibited word or mark, or any word or mark so nearly resembling any such word or mark as to be likely to deceive. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Governor-General will b&#171; empowered to proclaim certain words as prohibited words, and when they are so declared, the Registrar may refuse to allow them to be registered in connexion with a trade mark. For example, it&#39; is considered desirable to protect the use of the word &#34;Anzac.&#34; The Governor-General may proclaim the word &#34;Anzac&#34; and other words of a similar character to be prohibited, and thereupon they may not be registered in any trade mark. The clause is in harmony with what has already been done under the War Precautions regulations. </para>
                    <para>Clause 3 is really in substance an adaptation of section 91a of the Patents Act. It Ls proposed to insert a new section as follows : - 100a. Where any person claiming to be the proprietor of a trade mark, by circulars, advertisements, or otherwise, threatens any other person with any legal proceedings or liability in respect of any alleged infringement of the trade mark, any person aggrieved thereby may bring an action against him, and may obtain an injunction against the continuance of such threats, and may recover such damages (if any) as he&#34; has sustained thereby if the alleged infringement to which the threats related was not in fact an infringement of any legal rights of the person making the threats: </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Provided that this section shall not apply if the person making the threats with due diligence commences and prosecutes an action for infringement of his trade mark. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>This new section will apply where one person is using a trade mark, and another who has really no valid right to the use of it threatens him with legal action if he does not abstain from exercising what is his own right.

                    <para>Clause 4 repeals section 113 of the principal Act, and proposes to insert  another  in its stead. Section 113 provides that no person shall, without the authority of the King, or of some member of the Royal Family, or of the Governor-General, , or of the Governor of a State, or of some Department of the Government of the Commonwealth or a State, assume  OT  use in connexion with any trade, business, calling, or profession the Royal Arms or the Anns of the Commonwealth, or Aims so nearly resembling the Royal Arms or the Arms of the Commonwealth as to be likely to deceive in such a manner as to be likely to lead other persons to believe that he is carrying on his trade, business, calling, or profession by or under such authority. Unfortunately, it is rather difficult to enforce this section, and it is proposed to amend it in two ways. At present, the provision could be interpreted to mean that a State Governor or a State Department could give permission to any person to make use of the Commonwealth Coat of Arms, and it is proposed to take .away that right, and stipulate that the Commonwealth Coat of Arms shall only be used under Commonwealth authority. It is also difficult to establish, the concluding words of the section in  such a manner  as to  be likely  to  lead other persons  to  believe  that  he is carrying  on his  trade, business, calling, or profession by or under such authority. </para>
                    <para class="block">It is considered much, more satisfactory to have a straight-out prohibition of the use of coats of arms, and these words are to be omitted. The amended section will then read as follows: -  113.(1.) No person shall, without the authority of the King, or of some member of the Royal Family, or of the Governor-General, or of the Governor of  a  State, or of some Department of the Government of the Commonwealth or of a State ( proof whereof shall lie upon the person accused), assume or use in connexion with any trade, business, calling, or profession the Royal Arms or Arms so nearly resembling the Royal Arms as to be likely to deceive. </para>

                    <para>There is another matter which has been brought under my notice by a member of the New South Wales State Parliament who has recently been to the United States of America. In nearly every country in the world the words &#34;Life Savers &#34; have been registered, as applying to a certain confection, but the registration of these words is refused in Australia. There is no doubt that most persons, particularly Americans, indulge in extravagant claims as to the healing or curative properties of the goods they offer for sale, but, as a matter of fact, &#34; life saving &#34; is a phrase usually applied to cases of drowning. This confection is got up in a form representing a miniature life-buoy. The point I wish to make is .whether the Registrar of </para>

I know that this is a matter which is properly covered by the Commerce Act - at one time the Trade and Customs Department deemed it necessary to completely revise that Act, for the purpose of dealing with these extravagant claims - but I was wondering whether the Bill before us would cover such cases. </para>

                            <para>- Two or three, years ago the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Kelly)</inline> brought under the notice of the House the German trade mark &#34;Aspirin &#34;. I have never been able to see the need for objecting to the use of that word by Australian manufacturers. It was contended that the use of the word would keep alive the enemy interest in that commodity, and that, after the war, the Germans would again enter into&#39; full possession of the trade. But in Victoria one chemist has been for a number of years,, even when Aspirin had full sway in the market, manufacturing a drug  quite equal in quality to that made by the Germans. It is sailed &#34;Aspro,&#34; but purchasers know very well that it is just the same as &#34; Aspirin.&#34; </para>

                        <para>. - I do not claim to be a legal authority, but this clause appears to me to confer a certain right on the Royal Family, presumably the dominant member &#39;of the family, and in days to come that, or some other member of the Royal Family, on the ground of relationship, might seek to confer a certain benefit. In my opinion the amendment is distinctly in order, and would place us on safe ground ; and I shall support it if it is pressed to a division. </para>

                        <para>. I desire to put one view in support of the amendment. It is a well-known historical fact that if the war did not immediately arise out of a family dispute in connexion with the British Royal Family, the Kaiser William of Germany has never failed for one moment to assert his right to be. the reigning monarch of the BritisH Empire, on the ground that he is the descendent of the eldest child of Queen Victoria. Although we have no doubt in our mind as to the lack of any power on the part of William Hohenzollern to rank as a member of the British Royal Family, he asserts that claim, and we in Australia have perfect justification for specifying in our laws that he is not a descendent, and has no such right. I hope that an assertion to that effect will be made in this and every other Bill. The last British election was fought on the  cry,  &#34; Hang the Kaiser,&#34; and now those concerned are at their wits end to know how even to try him. And he is to be tried not as an individual, but as a monarch. - as the sovereign of Germany. He stands in the relation of cousin to our present honored King, and there is no doubt in the mind of the reigning House, at any rate, as to his claim to be the rightful monarch of the British Empire. We should assert ourselves in Australia, and exhibit our devoted loyalty to the Throne and Empire by repudiating at all times such a claim on. the part of William of Germany. </para>

At any rate, I cannot support the amendment, because I am quite sure that the clause as it stands is preferable to the clause as it would read if the proposal were carried. </para>

No particular virtue attaches now to loyalty or zeal for the Allied cause as displayed by the use of these emblems, because the war is over. Section 19 of the Trade Marks- Act 1905 prohibits the registration of any trade mark which contains - a representation of the Royal Arms, or of the national flag of the United Kingdom, or of the flag of the Commonwealth, or of the national arms of the United Kingdom, or of the arms or seal of the Commonwealth or any State. </para>
                    <para class="block">That provision is evidently a dead letter. I do not profess to be an enthusiastic advocate of national emblems, but I recognise that they stand for a great deal in our national life, and are worth something. To some people they appeal very strongly, standing for very high ideals and putting into symbolic form our pride as members of the British Empire. It is very obnoxious to me to see advertisements of all sorts using the Union Jack, the Royal Standard, the Royal Coat of Arms, the Commonwealth Flag, and the Australian Coat of Arms in order to push the sale of goods. Hoardings all over the country are placarded with these things. Newspaper advertisements nourish them freely. The only difference is that, in the newspapers, there is an absence of colour, whereas on the hoardings they appear in the gayest of colourings. </para>

                            <para>- My amendment will make no difference to the work given to the artists. I feel strongly that the sense of the community is against the present display of these emblems for trade purposes, by which our sense of proportion and reasonableness and the fitness of things is offended. They tend to lessen the regard and respect which we all more or less feel is due to our national emblems, and which some of us gladly and readily accord &#39;to them. In the question: I put to the; Acting Prime Minister last year- I quoted  Lippett&#39;s  wines, which, display on all their, advertisements the Union Jack and the Australian Flag crossed. Foster&#39;s Lager has an enormous representation,, clear, correct, and explicit, of the Commonwealth registered Coat of Arms, our heraldic emblem. Johnnie Walker whisky regularly uses the flag: The advertisement of John Bull oats is to be seen everywhere with the Union Jack as its distinctive feature.  Fluxite  also uses it, and in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald&#39;</inline> the other day I came across a most obnoxious use of the Union Jack, together with a reference to the Italian occupation of Fiume, as an advertisement for gin. The advertisement is obnoxious from the point of view of Italy, our respected and honorable ally, aud obnoxious  also  because of its use of the Union Jack. Advertisements of this kind are all over the country. Their objectionable features are patent to any one who; cares to take notice of them. If honorable members, when travelling in  trains or  trams, will watch the hoardings as. I have been doing lately, they will be amazed at the enormous number of goods that are advertised under cover of the flag and other national emblems. This practice is purely an exploitation of symbols which, ought to be held to some extent sacred. They are used now for purposes of personal aggrandisement and cash results, in order to parade the &#34; loyalty and zeal &#34;of the advertisers, to use the phrase of the Acting Prime Minister,, or to cover up any suspicion that the goods are not of local or British origin. In the streets one can see over shop, doors and in shop windows all sorts of advertisements of that kind, which are not there to, exhibit any genuine affection, or regard, or respect for these emblems, but purely for the purpose of attracting business, and for ulterior and&#39; sordid motives. I do not know whether this is the right place to insert a provision in the law against that kind of thing, but it is the only place that offers any opportunity for it so far as I have been able to see. I move this amendment now in relation to the Union Jack, or any ensign or standard of the United Kingdom. Later on I propose to move for the application of the same prohibition to the use of the emblems and seals of the Commonwealth.  </para>

                        <para>. - I .cannot see my way to accept the amendment. The object of the Bill is to amend the Trade Marks Act, which deals with the question of the registration of trade marks. The effect of registration in general is to give the individual a proprietary -right in a particular form of trade mark. Section IS of the Act of 1905-1912 empowers the Registrar to refuse to register a trade mark containing &#34; any representation of the Royal Arms, or Royal Crests, or arms or crests so nearly resembling them as to be likely to lead to mistake, or of the Royal Crowns, or of the British National flags.&#34; They cannot be the subject of a trade mark. The same thing applies to &#34;any representation of the arms, flag, or seal of the Commonwealth, or of any State, or any representation of the arms of any foreign State or country.&#34; Those are not allowed to be made the subjects of a particular monopoly. But, according to Halsbury&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Laws of England, &#34;</inline> the Union Jack may be flown on land by every citizen of the Empire, as well as on Government buildings.&#34; The use of the flag is the right not only of the Government of , the nation, but of every citizen of the British Empire. The honorable member seeks to prohibit the use of the flag iri connexion with business. I must confess I sympathize with a good deal that he says, and that when I see certain deleterious articles taking cover under the Union Jack I feel very much as he does. We must, however, look at the wider aspect of the question. The honorable member seeks to do something which is more than a mere matter of the law relating to trade marks. It relates to the carrying on of businesses, occupations, industries, or callings throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know of any. I made inquiries regarding one particular firm which claimed some right to a coa t-of -arms. I found that they had never registered it in Australia. The Registrar will not allow the registration of any of these emblems, so that no person can obtain a proprietary right in the use of a coat of arms or a flag. Under the Constituti6n we have power to deal with trade marks, but trade and commerce is an entirely different matter. We are limited under the Constitution there, although we have unlimited power to deal with trade marks, as laid down by the Court in the Brewery Employees Case, 6 C.L.R., 49. The honorable member desires to prohibit the use of these flags in business as a general policy on the ground that they are used for moneymaking purposes. It is fair and legitimate to encourage in the community a sense of patriotism in regard to articles made in Australia. I cannot see anything wrong in that, nor can I see anything wrong in a business man flying the Union Jack over his business premises, but the honorable member&#39;s amendment would not allow that flag to be used in connexion with any trade, business, or calling. I am not inclined to believe that it would be a proper thing to prohibit the use of the Union Jack in connexion with any business, calling, or profession. It would be an anomaly to prohibit the use of the Australian flag in that way, and at the same time to allow the United States flag or the French flag to be used in connexion with a business by way of appeal to the people. If our flag were prohibited, we could not have competition. There would have to be a general prohibition, or otherwise our own people would be put at a disadvantage by being unable to use&#39; our flag for the encourage.ment of our own trade and commerce, the fostering of our own industries, and the promotion of a national sentiment for the consumption of our own goods. I frankly admit, although I want to see Australian goods used and consumed throughout Australia, that I am not much in sympathy with the use and consumption of the specific articles which the honorable member mentioned. </para>

                    <para>The strength of my case is proved by the weakness of the Minister&#39;s reply. Let me briefly point out where I think his case absolutely fails. The honorable gentleman said that every citizen is entitled to fly the Union Jack. That is not denied; nor is it my proposal to limit that right. There is, however, a great difference between a citizen flying the flag and using it as part of a trade advertisement. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> points out that the Bill provides that the Royal Arms shall not be used in connexion with any trade, business, or calling. That is exactly the limitation- 1 wish to apply to the use of the flag. It  i3  foolish and futile to argue that because a citizen flies the Union Jack over his business premises he is using it in connexion with his business, trade, or calling. A doctor, for instance, flies the Union Jack over his chambers or residence, not as an advertisement, but with a perfectly legitimate and proper desire to exhibit his loyalty on a particular occasion. My amendment does not propose to interfere with anything of that kind. The Minister&#39;s contention that the right of every citizen to fly the flag is unlimited is recognised in my amendment, which conforms to the principle laid down in this clause, that no person shall have the right, without the authority of the King or other authority set out, to display or use the Royal Arms in connexion with any trade, business, calling, or profession. That is a proper and reasonable limitation, which should be extended to the flying of the flag. There are some business places which exhibit the Royal Arms by Royal Warrant. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. The reasonable interpretation of this clause is that the Royal Arms shall not be used in connexion with a trade, business, or profession as an attempt to advertise. I am merely asking the Committee in this case to subject the use of the Union Jack, and in a later case the Australian flag, to the same limitation. All that the amendment provides is that neither the Union Jack nor any representation of the standards of the United Kingdom shall be used to assist in advertising any business, or identifying it with the flag. It is the association of the flag with a business advertisement to which I object. </para>

                        <para>Having listened carefully to the objection raised by the Minister in charge of the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom),</inline> I am still of opinion that there is no good reason why the amendment should not be accepted. The Minister suggests that the use of the Australian flag in connexion with the advertising of Australian productions is quite unobjectionable. My desire is that Australian productions shall be as well advertised as possible, but the fact that goods are of Australian- origin can be manifested other than by putting our flag in close association with an advertisement relating to them. If everybody adopted that method of advertising their goods, it would come to be somewhat ridiculous. Apart from that point, there is good reason why wo should have a little reverence and respect for such emblems as the Union Jack and the Australian flag. We are beginning to understand their importance and value, in the conception that they give to the rising generation, of the country and the Empire to which they belong. We have the flag raised in our school grounds for the children to salute, and it is indicated to them that they should treat the flag, not as some fetish, but as representing that for which it undoubtedly stands. Many a time, during the war, when passing through our railway stations, my indignation was roused at the sight of the glorious Union Jack, no doubt perfectly drawn and magnificently coloured, but draped over something with which it ought not to be associated. I have known cases in which people who were justly suspected of disloyalty during the war hastened to make an indication of loyalty in connexion with some of their goods by plastering them with loyal emblems of this kind. In order that our children may have a proper conception of the honour that is due to these emblems for what they indicate, we ought to prevent the miscellaneous and degrading use which is being made of them in connexion with the ordinary methods of trade advertising. </para>

There is no reason why they should not use the map of Australia instead of the Australian flag, to indicate that their goods are made in this country.. These emblems have been used in such a degrading way for advertising purposes that the rising generation are led, instead of respecting them, to hold them rather in some sort of contempt. There  is a great  difference between  a  man flying the Union Jack over his place of business or private house and employing it as an advertisement for goods which degrade those who eat or drink them.

                            <para>- That is so. I see no difference between the use of the Royal Arms and the use of the Union Jack or the Australian flag in these ways. The great bulk of the people regard these emblems as something to cherish and admire, because of all they represent. The boys and girls in our State schools salute the flag when it is run aloft, and have an Australian sentiment for it. On their way to and from school, however, they may see in a bottle-gatherer&#39;s truck all sorts of bottles labelled with the Australian flag or the Union Jack. They axe given temperance lessons at school, yet they may see the Australian flag on beer bottles. The use of the flag in connexion with various trade advertisements is calculated to lower the, sentiment attaching to it. Let us make the same provision in regard to the use of the Union Jack and the Australian flag that we have made in this clause in regard to the use of the Royal Arms for advertising purposes. </para>

                    <para class="block">If honorable members approve of the provision in the Bill which stipulates that the Australiancoat-of-arms shall not be used in connexion with any business, trade, calling, or profession, why should there be any objection to the prohibition of the use of the Australian flag in the same category ? The argument used by the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> is very apposite - that it is impossible to keep active in the minds of the rising generation a respect and regard for national emblems if, while, on the one hand, they are held up to the highest respect and regard, on the other hand, and in juxtaposition, they are to be found employed in a humiliating and degrading way. Section 19 of the Act provides that no trade mark shall be registered containing representations of the Royal Arms or of the national flag of the United Kingdom, or of the flag of the Commonwealth, and so forth, and section 113 is much wider in its scope, inasmuch as it prohibits the use of coats-of-arms in  connexion with any business. And this is where the weakness of the argument of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> is displayed, for all that he claims in support of the present provisions of the measure can be equally advanced in support of the prohibition of the use of the national flag in any business, trade, profession, or calling. To me, the Australian flag is the best in the world. </para>

                            <para>- That is in a different category. I am speaking of national flags. The red flag is not a natk&#187;al flag. The mere fact that the Australian national flag embodies the Union Jack, and is symbolic of the Federation, invests it in our minds with some sacredness. Every honorable member who voted against the last amendment declared that <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> had no objection to the use of the Union Jack as a cover for a whisky bottle, a wrapper for soap, or packets of starch, or anything under the sun. We carry the Union Jack to the top of the flag-pole, and regard it as something demanding our utmost loyalty and devotion, and yet we permit it to be used anywhere and by any one for most degrading, humiliating, and despicable purposes. No limit is placed upon the use of the Union Jack by any citizen;but I now ask that some limit should be placed upon the use of the Australian flag. Are honorable members willing to put that flag in such a category that, for ulterior purposes or for personal aggrandizement, any mean-minded citizen may make use of it to advertise his business ? </para>

                        <para>.- Several honorable members have said that had it not been for the fact that the use of the Union Jack in business matters has been permitted for many years, they would have voted to prohibit its further use in that way; but I do not think the Commonwealth flag has been made use of in such a way. We could readily prohibit the use of it in business, and at the same time fix a time limit for the use of the Union Jack in connexion with any business. We have already provided that the use of the Royal Coat-of-Arms shall be prohibited. In future the Melbourne newspapers will be prevented from having the British coat of arms on their front pages. The newspapers parade the coat of , arms every day, and this clause will compel them to discontinue that practice. I am anxious that the Union Jack shall not be exploited for business purposes. </para>

                        <para>.- I see no objection to the free and constant use of the Commonwealth flag or Union Jack for advertising purposes, provided that neither be exploited for the trading purposes of any particular company or firm. I rather like the look of the Commonwealth flag, and I do not know why honorable members opposite should object to it figuring on the hoardings. I like, too, the Union Jack. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think it is attractive or symbolical, like the Australian flag and the Union Jack, of sentiments that make the heart warm. I understand that the purpose of the red flag is not to make a man&#39;s heart warm, but to make his toe itch. If the amendment aimed at preventing anybody having an exclusive commercial right in the use of the Union Jack or the Australian flag I would support it, hut I see no need for prohibiting its use in connexion with the advertisement of goods. </para>

                    <para>I  desire to call attention to a use that is being made of a Government Customs certificate or seal. I have here a copy of an advertisement which I took out of the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of the 26th July this year. It is not an unusual advertisement by any means, but is in common circulation in many of the newspapers of Australia, besides being quite a common feature of advertisement hoardings. It advertises Joshua&#39;s Boomerang whisky, and states that that is a whisky fit to carry this incontestable proof of superiority, namely, the Customs label. On each bottle, as advertised, is a replica of that seal, together with the picture of a crown, the letters &#34; G.R.,&#34; and the words &#34; Pure Australian Standard Malt Whisky.&#34; There is also circulated an advertisement of this firm&#39;s brandy, which is declared to be guaranteed by the Customs Department. I do not know what value this certificate may have from a Customs point of view - that is not perhaps the question at the present juncture - but it is evident that the Department does issue it. So far as I am able to discover the certificate only guarantees that the liquor has been  Under  test for a certain period. </para>

                            <para>- The firm advertises this Customs seal as giving to their particular product an incontestable guarantee of superiority. This is making an entirely mischievous and unfair use of a purely technical certificate as an advertisement to their prospective customers of the purity of their whisky. If there is any reason at all to be urged for the prohibitions which the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> has already accepted as part of the Bill in regard to coats-of-arms - if there is any justification for the prohibition, as a trade mark, of any duplication  of  coats-of-arms,  flags, emblems, and portraits of sovereigns, surely there is much stronger reason in the case of a Customs seal, which, so far as I can discover, gives no guarantee of purity or otherwise. </para>

                    <para>I do not know whether any other firm uses Customs certificates in a similar way or for a similar purpose. For all I know they may be used for starch, blue, soap, or kerosene; but I pin the Minister down to this concrete illustration of the objections I am offering to their use in an effort to secure business. Such a use of public documents seems to me to  carry  its own condemnation, because the public are not so much concerned about the relations between the manufacturers of products and the Customs Department as they are about the purity of the article supplied. The purity of an article is not based on a Customs certificate unless the Customs analyst makes a specific inquiry and issues a guarantee, or otherwise, of purity. </para>

                    <para>There is another thing to which I take exception. Under the present restricted Commonwealth powers, articles can be introduced, and are being introduced, into this country with certain reservations in order to protect the public against the purchase of articles that are not according to label. But immediately such goods are admitted through the Customs, they may be put in circulation in this country with any label, or with any admixture, that the importing firm may choose to adopt. The Customs Department deals with the importation into Australia, but after the goods are imported the Customs label is valueless, and the Commonwealth has no authority to protect the public against admixtures or the misuse of Customs certificates. Foreign matter may be introduced into goods that is quite destructive of the protection the Customs proposes to give. </para>
                    <para>I hope the Minister will recognise that, so far as this whisky is concerned, there is no reason why the public should not be protected. The protection of the public is, or ought to be, our main consideration in regard to trade marks and the purity of articles supplied under trade marks and certificates. I have not had an opportunity to consult with the Minister as to his views, and I should be glad to  know whether he thinks protection can be extended to the public in the way I suggest. </para>

                        <para>. - There are difficulties in what the honorable member <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson)</inline> proposes to do. We are dealing in this amending Bill with trade marks, and the desire, of course, is to confine the operations of the measure to the law relating to trade marks. Now, however, the honorable member is bringing in another general branch of substantive law - that is, the use of certificates, seals, and stamps, which is outside the general scope of trade marks legislation. He is really putting up a case for the regulation of the use of stamps, certificates, seals, and so forth by the Customs Department in the administration of its various branches; and it is rather in a measure dealing with that administration that such an amendment should be inserted. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The object of a Trade Marks Bill is, generally speaking, to lay down the conditions under which a person may acquire the right to a trade mark, and to prescribe the law by which that proprietary Tight may be preserved. In the circumstances, I cannot accept the amendment. A Government certificate or seal is quite a different thing from an ordinary trade mark. A trade mark is, generally, some distinctive mark applied to the goods, and a certificate is not that. These certificates are used by the Department in connexion with different articles on which they are required to certify as to  quality.  In the Spirits Act of 1905-7, for instance, it is provided : - </para>

                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <para>The law requires these certificates to be used by the Department for the protection of the public, and the advertisement to which reference has been made is an advertisement of the provisions required by law.

I did not take that attitude with regard to an amendment put forward by the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson)</inline> this morning. If the law requires that, before an article is put on the market, a certificate of a particular kind must be obtained, what is wrong with the man advertising the fact that he has that certificate when he is selling his goods? When we make a provision to safeguard the public health, and issue certain certificates, surely the man who sells the goods is entitled to the benefit accruing to him if he fulfils the prescribed conditions? </para>

                            <para>- Firms who advertise that they have received a Government guarantee lead1 the public to believe that the stuff sold by other people is not pure. It should be remembered that, if they comply with the Spirits Act, the whole of the goods have to be pure. It was found in England that the Government duty stamp was used by patent medicine proprietors to delude the public into the belief that their nostrums were guaranteed by the Government. That is shown by the report of a recent British Commission on patent medicines. On page 95 of the. report on Secret Remedies, presented ta this Parliament in 1912, it is stated that in England, in the- year 1908, no fewer than 33,037,202. patent medicines bore l&#163;d. duty stamps, and the price paid by the public for those preparations, at ls. and upwards,, was &#163;1,858,000. I do not say that they were all worthless, but it certainly was- found that, through the Government applying an Inland Revenue duty stamp to them, the proprietors conveyed to the public the impression that there was a Government guarantee attached to them. In our Spirits Act there is a provision that the spirits must be two years old before they are sold. They must be aged in the wood for that time. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George, in the House of Commons, said that the provision in our Act was a good one. The Government certificate showing that the spirits have been kept in the wood for- two- years is, how- ever, no guarantee of quality or purity. The amendment of the honorable member for Brisbane (Mr.Finlayson) commends itself to me, because we can and should give no guarantee. </para>

I trust the amendment will be carried, so that these people will be unable to employ a Government guarantee, which was never intended, when the Spirits Act was passed, to be used in that way, for private advertising purposes. </para>

                    <para>The consideration of this measure should not engage the attention of the House for many minutes. It is very simple, and purports to deal only with damage to lighthouses and marine marks. It provides that any person who damages or destroys any marine mark or lighthouse shall be liable to pay the Commonwealth the cost of repairing or replacing the lighthouse or marine mark, unless he can prove that the damage or destruction was not caused through wilful negligence, misconduct, or want of skill. Where such damage is the result of accident, and not due to negligence on the part of the person controlling the navigation of the vessel causing the damage, then the damage is not payable by the owner of the ship. It is. also provided that notice of the damage is&#39; to be given within forty-eight hours to the Collector of Customs at the nearest port by the person causing it. The penalty for failure to report the occurrence is &#163;100. </para>
                    <para>The Commonwealth Government have recently placed around the coast in the vicinity of the Northern Territory a large number of floating buoys, and if any of these buoys are damaged or destroyed it is essential that the matter should be immediately reported so that steps may be taken at once to repair or replace them. It is becoming the practice of the masters of a number of luggers trading along the north coast of Australia, when the wind falls, and the tide is running in a  direction opposite to that which they wish to take, to tie up to one of these buoys. Sometimes a buoy is thus carried away. It is most essential that if a buoy is dragged from its moorings or damaged in any way, the fact should be immediately reported, so that the danger to navigation caused thereby may be remedied at the earliest possible moment. </para>
                    <para>These are the only matters with which the Bill deals. It has already passed through another place, and I hope that honorable members will consent to its passage as speedily as possible, so that it may quickly become law. </para>
                    <para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para>
                    <para>Bill read a second time, reported from Committee without amendment, and, on suspension of Standing Orders, passed through its remaining stages. </para>

                        <para>.- When this Bill was last before the House we had the benefit of a concentrated debate upon it but the time which&#39; has since elapsed, and the return to Australia of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> who is practically the designer of the Institute, will somewhat alter, I hope, the future trend of the discussion. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Honorable members on all sides of the House, whether they are ardent supporters of this measure or not, regret the death of that eminent man, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gellatly,</inline> who, as the Prime Minister has announced, had, as Director, set his heart on the work of this Institute, and whose loss is indeed a very serious one to the Institute at its advent as well as to the nation. I was hopeful that upon the resumption of this debate we might have had a contribution to it from the Prime Minister himself. The right honorable gentleman could enlighten the House and the country as to what really is the scheme to be undertaken by what I might describe as those three harnessing Departments - the Board of Trade, the Department of Commerce and Industry, and the Institute of Science and Industry. Can the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> say whether the Prime Minister proposes to speak? </para>

                            <para>- I hope that he intends to do so, because in every political party and every Legislature, as well as on the part of the general public, there is to-day an absolute conviction that we must discontinue the duplication of political effort. The superimposing of Department on Department is something which the country will no longer tolerate. </para>

                    <para>When speaking to this motion on a previous occasion I said I had hoped that the Government would be able to tell us that it was bringing forward a predetermined plan of co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States, each governmental agency having defined the scope of its operations so that one would not be walking upon the heels of the other in relation to every subject to be dealt with by the Institute. We have had a sharp conflict quite recently between the Commonwealth and the States on the question of butter control. The Commonwealth seeks to place a veto on and to exercise a limited form of control over the Commonwealth&#39;s entire output of butter. The State of Victoria has had in operation for many years its own Department, with its own machinery and staff of experts and directors, with herd-testing branches, and, in fact, all the most modern devices, to put the dairying industry on a good footing. The control of the sale of the surplus butter of the States is something to which the Commonwealth&#39; aspires, and there is a sharp division of opinion between the Federal and State Governments on that point. I was hopeful that since the adjournment of the debate on this measure the Minister would have had an opportunity to confer with the State Ministers and Departments of Agriculture with the object of ascertaining whether or not definite fields of operation can be arranged. It is no pleasure to me to&#39; play the part of critic. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; but I propose to show how the United States of America Department sets to work in a keen, business way. Instead of giving the directors of the Department a roving commission to inquire into everything, from the cause of a lump on an  elephant&#39;s  knee to the best means of dealing with the prickly pear, it deals specifically in its programme with every one of the diseases common to the animal and plant life of the country. First of all, we have set out in the programme each disease, its origin, its investigation, and the cost of investigation. The Department is limited each&#39; year to a definite expenditure and a defined field of organization. It has a settled business policy, as clear and distinct as that of any business enterprise in this city. From one end to the other it follows business lines. </para>

                    <para>The object of my remarks is not to disparage in the slightest degree the value of scientific research or demonstration, or education resulting from, that investigation. I will not have it put in my lips by the Department, or by any Minister, that I desire to impede or restrict investigation. What I ask is that, as the question of finance is the most serious factor confronting us to-day, there should be some limitation in regard to the financial provision for scientific investigation, and that the two fields of operation - Common wealth -and States - should be distinctly defined, in order to avoid duplication of expenditure and duplication of staffs. We should not have State directors and Commonwealth directors, State supervisors and Commonwealth supervisors, or State demonstrators and experts as well as Commonwealth demonstrators and experts. In other words, we ought not to have two big staffs investigating the same subjects. </para>

                            <para>- I am hopeful that the effect of my remarks will be to prevent the Ministry giving a &#39;blank cheque to a Board of Directors. Of course, a Minister will be in ultimate control, but he will not be an expert in every branch in which scientific research may be carried on, and will not feel that he is able to say that this or that expenditure is not justified. Therefore, the whole of this work of investigation will be controlled by an outside body of men, who, while possibly they may be gentlemen of the keenest intellects, will more than likely be quite unaccustomed to the expenditure of public money. I do not say that they will be unbusiness-like ; I would not so designate professors in a young community; but, at the same time, I contend that we are not likely to get. the best financial results from the expenditure of public money when the full con* trol rests with a body of men with professorial minds. The object of my remarks, which may be resented by the authors of the Bill, is that we should set out upon this undertaking on more definite business-like lines. The linking up of science and industry with the everyday affairs of the country is a most desirable object; but, at a time like this, when the burden of finance is pressing so heavily, it is my clear duty to seq that we do not employ two people to perform one job. </para>

                    <para>Personally, I am not very keen upon the value that Australia will derive in the early stages of the proposed Institute from the application of science to  secondary industries, in regard to which we are still an infant nation. The manufacturing world is comprised of very astute people, who are keen in watching for the invention of mechanical devices to cheapen their output, while in adopting new methods of manufacturing or marketing they are ten times as keen as university professors would be. I have not a tittle of faith that any public Department can in this respect take the place of captains of industry. I have no faith in any professorial mind, or any individual in a State Department, having that keen sharp edge which the captain of industry displays, because the latter is a man who, by contact with the incessant competition of the whole world, is thoroughly trained in the application of modern scientific methods to business. </para>
                    <para>There is an immense field for scientific investigation and research and for the practical application of science. In Australia, for a quarter of a century past, we have been applying artificial devices to the growing of cereals, and the manurial system has achieved wonderful results; but the application of scientific methods to the growing of herbs and grasses has not yet been attempted, except in a few isolated cases, where wonderful results have been obtained. Australia &#39;has not yet tackled the problem of doubling the grass supply. I remember laying down in this House the doctrine of- </para>

                            <para>-Yes, where one grew before. I am just as keen a believer in it to-day. The United States of America depends upon the agricultural effort of the nation for the carrying of her great flocks and herds. On the other hand, Australia depends entirely upon nature. We are fortunate in having a small population to sustain, and a wonderful climate; but devastation exists in Queensland and New South Wales at the present time as the result of a total reliance upon nature. I know from my own experience, and from some of the large pastoral firms, that there are grand old families in either State just on the verge of ruin. We have no Department of Animal Husbandry attached to any State Agricultural Department. It is quite a new field of operations for Australia. At the basis of such&#39; a Department is stock feeding. </para>

                    <para>I , am hopeful that, as the outcome of the acquisition of Nauru Island and other discoveries now being tested, we shall be able to produce in Australia a cheap manurial treatment for our grasses. It would mean a new era for our wetter and coastal areas. For a quarter of a century we have been able to apply manurial treatment to the growth of cereals, and now the time has come when people, instead of reaching out all over the map for new areas, should set to work to fertilize the existing grasses and plant additional grasses, in this way giving the country a carrying capacity that would enable it, in good years or in bad years, to support ten times its present population. </para>

                            <para>- We have had to face similar problems in other directions.  After  thirty years&#39; experience on the land, I have come to the conclusion - starting with no capital - you can only take out of the soil in proportion to the amount of labour and capital you put into it, sensibly directed. The greatest hardship to which farmers and graziers are subjected arises from the fact that, so far, they have not been able to take full advantage of their opportunities. There  is great  need for an Institute such as that proposed, not only for the purpose of pointing the guiding finger of science to better processes and systems and to a higher standard of education, but also for the purpose of bringing forcibly home to us the necessities of our position. To the latter my attention has been drawn by a publication issued by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richardson,</inline> the Director of Agriculture in Victoria. He gives a very interesting comparison between the State of Kansas and the State of Victoria, and points to a moral we cannot possibly avoid. He shows that a real comparison may be made &#34;between the two States: - </para>

                    <para>Here are two States alike in size, population, rainfall, and material resources. Both are cereal and dairying &#39;States. The climate of western Kansas is even drier and more uncertain than that of north-western Victoria. Yet Kansas produces, approximately, six times as much wheat, several hundred times more maize, five times as much oats, three times as much hay, and raises 1,500,000 acres of dry-land crops - such as grain sorghums - as well as being far ahead in all live-stock, save sheep. Every bushel per acre added to Victoria&#39;s wheat yield would mean at least ?500,000 increase in annual income. </para>
                    <para>We cannot ignore those facts. While other countries are not producing as much as ultimately .they will do, yet have established means and methods by which the generations of farmers, as they succeed each other, will be infinitely better fitted by education and other aids to produce more, are we, because of a cry for economy, to refuse to give effect to  those  means and methods which will enable us to do what those other countries have done, and even to surpass their efforts ? . It is our proud boast that Australian soldiers and workmen, and even statesmen, are second to none in the Empire, and are we to lag behind for ever in the matter of education -and scientific training ?  Surely,  with the incentive which the necessities of the position, arising out of the war, have given to us, we should adopt those higher methods by which alone we can achieve success. &#39; </para>

                    <para>To-day we are engaged in a huge scheme of repatriation, upon which the prosperity and contentedness of a, section - not the least estimable - of our community depends. We are repurchasing large estates all over the country, and axe settling men  upon  much smaller holdings than have been considered in the past &#34; living areas,&#34; in the ordinary acceptation of the term. In New South Wales, of which I can speak with a more intimate knowledge, the Government are -endeavouring .by every means in their power to promote land settlement and the productivity of the soil. For instance, in connexion with the establishment of hundreds of returned soldiers in  the  fruit-growing areas, the best expert knowledge is being employed in laying out the ground, planting the trees, and educating the soldiers, and there is a promise of training in the best scientific methods of treating the surplus fruit, .either by canning or by conversion into jam. Ah immense scheme of scientific organization is being entered upon, in order to give those men a chance of success. Is it to be said that this National Parliament is careless of its duty, and refuses to take advantage of the best brains .and intelligence in the various  branches  of science, in order to blaze the .track and show for the benefit of, not only the soldiers, but of every deserving man and woman- who is willing to take upon himself or herself the responsibility for material existence, how things can be done &#39;better than by the present methods. </para>
                    <para>A-s a man who has worked his way up on . the land without financial means to start with, I know that the opportunities which came to us in the early&#39; days, when we could select, in large areas, good land having a reliable rainfall, are not available to-day for the men whom we are asking to go from the cities and help to develop the rural resources. Those who go upon the land to-day must operate smaller areas, and they  must  have those advantages which can be given only by higher .developmental systems &#39;being placed within their reach. The Government are to be commended for this forward movement, and no cry for economy and retrenchment ought to be allowed to deprive us of the benefits which would come to us from the initiation and teaching of methods of increased production. </para>

                            <para>- It is true that huge schemes for artesian boring are being launched in New South Wales, and I hope that they will prove a practical success, but with other schemes they involve the expenditure of millions of pounds, and the question arises as to whether these works should be carried out and maintained at the cost of the National Government, or by municipal enterprise. The water must be found, and when honorable members realize that with a 24-inch rainfall sufficient water falls in twelve months on 60 acres to pro vide an adequate supply of water for a population of 3,000, but that science has not yet developed a means of conserving that supply, they will realize how great is the scope for research and inquiry, even in that field. We have a thousand and one problems to solve in regard to the discovery and mining of minerals, and processes for the development of our primary and secondary industries. We must tackle those tasks. All the resources that the best brains and intelligence in Australia can produce to help us to realize our economic destiny ought to be fostered. </para>

                    <para>The only real obstacle I encountered in my effort to become an independent land user was the fact that I was hampered by my own ignorance of up-to-date methods and conditions by which I could improve the revenue producing capacity of my holding. Every man upon the land is hampered in much the same way. There are difficulties to be contended with in respect of which rio help is afforded in any way. We are required, to experiment on our own to a large extent, and whilst no man in this House is more sensible than I am of what has been achieved by the practical man, yet I realize that, after all, science is, in its highest expression, the channel by which truth can be best expressed in practice, and that, without its finger pointing the way, much of  our effort is misdirected, and therefore wasted. Whilst this measure has been attacked, and doubtless will be attacked, because it opens up a new avenue of expenditure, I say that such expenditure is warranted, and even though fifty failures were to result from the investigations, the country would be more than repaid for all its disbursements by one success. Above all, what we cannot afford to do&#39; at this stage is to sit still , without attempting to improve the old methods that will serve us no longer. </para>

                        <para>.- The consideration that weighs most with me at the present time in regard to a question of this kind is that of ways and means. This country is undoubtedly in need of many things, but one of the most crying of all is economy in Federal administration ; and there is very considerable ground to be covered in connexion with work of this kind. The financial position of Australia will be a very precarious one for some years to come; and there can be no justification whatever for launching out into new methods of expenditure unless we can see a compensating return. There is a great deal of talk about the advantages of science as applied to production, and no one here will dispute those advantages. We are all anxious to see the most scientific and up-to-date methods applied to production generally throughout Australia. We find that, not only in Australia, but throughout the world, people are more and more turning their minds to the utilization of brain power, where previously brute force and &#34; rule-of-thumb &#34; existed. But we must be careful that, in our desire to further scientific production, we are not merely imitating other countries in a feeble and ineffective manner. We in Australia can spend a very considerable amount of money on a Department of this kind, which may only be following up work that is being done in other parts of the world. When I say &#34;following up,&#34; I mean practically following in the footsteps of those who have already made discoveries. In the United States of America magnificent work is undoubtedly being done in connexion with the application of science to industry, particularly rural industry. A great deal of that work can be of immediate advantage to this country, and, indeed, has already been of considerable benefit. The conditions in some parts of the United States of America very closely resemble our own. </para>

                            <para>- I should say there is no very material difference between the soil of some portions of the United States of America, and the soil of Australia. If we have the same geological conditions, we have pretty well the same soil, modified, perhaps, to &#34;some extent, by local conditions. But my point is that, generally speaking, a considerable amount of the work in the United States of America is of immediate advantage to a country like Australia; and, therefore, we may dispense with scientific investigation which is being better done in that country than we can possibly do it here. I am speaking now of the amount of money and energy that can be applied, and also of the probability that in the United States of America there is a greater field of ability, though I do not for  a  moment wish to disparage the Australian intellect in this connexion. </para>

                    <para>There is a good deal of misconception and misapplied argument in this House in regard to scientific production, and we have had two instances of that this afternoon. The honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lynch)</inline> and the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> both spoke&#39; of the advantage of applying science to rural industry ; but they missed the point that, as a matter of fact, we have already all the scientific knowledge that is required to make a tremendous advance in rural production. Our real trouble is that our people will not apply that knowledge. The agricultural colleges are undoubtedly doing good work; and we are very far behind in regard to the attention that ought to be given to agricultural production and training in those colleges. </para>
                    <para>In this country it is not a matter of discovering or of making scientific advance, but of applying the scientific knowledge which is the common - property of the world. Take the matter of grasses. There is undoubtedly great necessity for the improvement of our pastures, which have been grossly neglected. I remember some years ago, in the Western District, talking to a squatter with a very fine run, who was lamenting the fact that for years the production and quality of his grass had been steadily declining. This he could not understand, and I said to him, &#34;I suppose you send a considerable  quantity of wool and mutton from this station every year?&#34; and he replied in the affirmative. &#34;That means,&#34; I said,  &#39; taking much out of the ground ; how much are you putting back into the ground ?&#34; He- agreed that it meant taking much out of the ground, but he stared at my suggestion about putting something back again. The idea had never occurred- to him that the sheep were extracting from the ground something that it was his duty to replace in some shape or form,, and that he could not expect to continue to he successful unless he took some steps in that direction. </para>
                    <para>In Great Britain, the artificial feeding of pastures is one of the most important factors in rural production. It may surprise many honorable members to learn the amount of money an up-to-date farmer in that country will spend in enriching grass pastures! There is nothing required in Australia in the way of discovery in regard to that kind of work. The scientific needs and necessities of pastures have been known for many years; and it is only a matter of getting the people to apply the knowledge, and this Department of Science and Industry will not be successful in that. It is going to embark on a considerable amount of work of a scientific nature, but it is not going to do what we require, namely, educate the people up to the advantage and necessity of applying to production the scientific knowledge that is already the common property of the world. </para>
                    <para>Those of us who look on this proposed Department as superfluous are regarded as being opponents of scientific &#39; production in Australia. It will take us many years here to reach the methods that are already being applied regularly in other parts of the world in regard to production. This is work that falls to the different States rather than to the Commonwealth, and it is work which undoubtedly some of the States are trying to do, but, in many instances, have failed lamentably. </para>

                    <para>I say, without hesitation, that I could find the Government a dozen ways in which this minimum annual expenditure of &#163;50,000&#39; could be utilized to more advantage in production. If we were to devote &#163;50,000 to the improvement of the country postal services, there would be more increased production than we are going to realize from an equal annual expenditure on a Science and Industry Bureau in half-a-dozen years. While we have demands for expenditure in these other directions of comparatively small amounts, we have no right to spend money on such a scheme as is now before us. If we desire theoretical research, let us seek for it straight out; let us subsidize the various universities where we can get scientific research equal to any in the world. As it is-, we are to have something that is neither scientific nor practical, and which will create friction and duplication rather than efficiency. If we desire practical work in regard to scientific production, is it not a fact that the States are doing such work to-day ? Each works in its own particular sphere, taking note of its particular requirements, and employing the most capable men. </para>
                    <para>We are often told about the prickly pear problem in Queensland, on which the people of that State have had their minds employed for some time. A great many people seem to imagine that by the application of science to some of those troubles in Australia, there is meant some kind of magic wand which has only to be waved to clear away all difficulties. We cannot expect the prickly pear, or any other pest, to be made to disappear in that way; but what we may expect is some method of profitably utilizing the pear. Such a method is already known, for the prickly pear could be so profitably utilized to-day as to be converted from a pest into a means of enrichment to the State. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I am speaking purely from a practical point of view, I hope; it would be no use talking of utilizing the pear on any other basis. If that be so, 1 suggest that, instead of incurring a minimum expenditure of &#163;50,000 a year on a Bureau of Science and Industry we offer a bonus for the production of industrial alcohol throughout Australia, at the same time releasing the industry from the restrictions that now hamper it. Then, probably, we should find the prickly pear regarded, not as a curse, but as a blessing. </para>

                    <para>I come now to the one claim that is being made for this Department, that it will co-ordinate the work of the various States. &#34;Co-ordination&#34; is a blessed and a useful word, and we hear it very often now. It sounds somewhat imposing, but it sometimes means very little. I could quite understand a bureau of a limited character doing some little good work in co-ordinating scientific production in the various States, but it requires the particular man &#39;that we do not seem to have got up to the present time. I am prevented by the sad death of the late head of the Department from saying much in that direction, but it has always been a great surprise to me that one of the most capable and practical scientific men in the Commonwealth has been left out of the composition of the Council of the Institute. I am referring to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson,</inline> of the Commonwealth Laboratory, a man of the most remarkable gifts, of high scientific attainments, and of a thoroughly practical nature as well.  His  work has been of considerable value to Australia in the past, and none the less valuable because it has not been advertised as it should have been. I have known him for many years in connexion with my work as a member of Parliament, and can assure the House that we have not , a more valuable official in the whole of the Commonwealth Service. </para>

                            <para>- Yet his name does not appear on the Council of the Commonwealth Institute of Science aud Industry. It is one of the most emphatic condemnations possible of the whole scheme that such a gentleman is not taking a prominent part in the work. I have asked what is precisely meant by the term &#34;coordinating the work,&#34; and I can get no satisfaction. If a scientist in Queensland is doing certain work, and another in Western Australia doing work of a different kind, what is the necessity of coordinating them ? It is not an advantage to coordinate their work if they are engaged on different problems. If they are working on the same problem there is no advantage in a third person coming in between, talking now to the one and now to the other, and perhaps distracting the attention of both. If these gentlemen find it to their mutual advantage to coordinate their work - and scientists of the proper frame of mind are never jealous of letting each other know what they are doing - it is better for them to co -ordinate direct without the intervention of a third party. As I look at this proposal carefully and impartially - and I had intended to support it at the outset - it seems to me that it is a superfluity and a luxury, and as at the present time we cannot afford luxuries I feel it my duty to vote against it. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to ventilate the question of the treatment of munition workers on the <inline font-style="italic">BahiaCastillo.</inline> On Wednesday I asked the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> if he was in a position to make a statement, and the honorable member replied that as the inquiries then being made had not been completed he was not in a position to say what was being done. The House did not sit yesterday. According to advices from Western Australia the munition workers are not prepared to return to the ship and continue their journey in her to their destination. They complained about the arrangements on board the vessel before they left Plymouth, and a special investigation was ordered by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> They say that, although they were promised that certain alterations would be made, the promise was not carried out. Further trouble was experienced at Durban, and, I believe, a special investigation was made by the officer in charge of another transport who happened to be in Durban at the time, and was asked by the Government of the Dominion of South Africa to investigate the complaints. Two days after leaving Durban there was trouble between the munition workers and the crew. The captain returned to Durban, where, at his request, a military guard was placed on board. I believe that in South Africa the promise was made to the munition workers of a full investigation on arrival in Australia. The vessel arrived at Fremantle a day or two ago, and I understand that an inquiry Board was constituted, and an inquiry held. The- Board was composed of gentlemen of the highest repute. They were Captain Burford, of the District Naval Staff of Western Australia; Captain Collins, representing the Military Department of Western Australia; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier,</inline> the Leader of the State Opposition; <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Williams,</inline> the Port Health&#39; Officer; and a representative of the agents of the steamer. That was a very fair Court to establish, but I have not seen its decisions. The 600 men and women are still waiting in Western Australia for some means of transport to the East, and the fact that there have been so many complaints justifies the most careful investigation and inquiry. I do not know whether there is anything in those complaints or not, but when men and women refuse to proceed further on a steamer&#39; it looks as if there must be some grounds for their action. I rose particularly to ask the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> whether he is in a position to make a statement to the House. At present the </para>

I am not going to criticise the members of the Australian Imperial Force unless I know all sides of the matter. I want the Minister to tell us what he knows, and he can do so much more conveniently on this motion than he could in reply to a formal question. There ought to be a special inquiry, and the Government would be well advised to appoint an independent tribunal with very wide powers. </para>

                        <para>- I would not care if the inquiry was held over there. The Government might arrange with the State Government for a Judge of the State Supreme Court to make the investigation. One of the demands of the munition workers is that a public investigation shall be made. If they are courting publicity, and if the position of the Department is quite sound, the Department ought not to object. The Returned Soldiers Association in Western Australia have asked me to see . that they are represented on any Board of inquiry, because they wish to be in a position to protect the interests of the men who were placed on the boat at Durban as a military guard. </para>

They were not responsible in any way for the trouble which occurred between the munition workers and the staff of the ship; but a full inquiry should be inaugurated by the Government without delay either in Western Australia or in Melbourne. We should have some absolutely unbiased, unprejudiced verdict with respect to this matter. Can the Minister tell the House what is being done in connexion with this particular trouble? </para>

                    <para>, - The whole trouble that has occurred on the troopship <inline font-style="italic">Bahia Castillo</inline> rests at the door of the Government. They have never seriously investigated the reports as to the bad treatment of soldiers and munition workers on transports. The naval and military authorities in no case will admit having made a mistake. Where a mistake has been made, they practically say, &#34; We must let it go.&#34; While the men returning to Australia on some transports have received not good, but fair, treatment, others have been not only badly fed, but underfed. No attempt has been made to get at the bottom of complaints of this kind. The men returning on a transport on which the food supply has been bad or insufficient, are landed at different ports, and scatter all over the Commonwealth, with the result that no complete inquiry is ever made. It is only because the owners and agents of these vessels have been allowed to treat men as they please - because of the inefficiency of officers commanding troops on board transports - that this trouble continues. In many cases the officer commanding is an excellent fighter and an honorable man, but he has no proper idea of effectively catering for the wants of his men on board ship. </para>

                        <para>- Then I shall say that the administrative capacity of many of these officers is not that which should be required of officers commanding troops on board a transport. I wish to be as sympathetic as possible in dealing with such officers, because in three cases where there was serious cause for complaint as to the food supplied the men on board our transports the officers commanding were brave and gallant soldiers. For these positions, only those who are specially capable of looking after the men should be selected. Recently I referred to the action taken by the officer commanding troops on a transport, who, on learning that the men were not receiving their full supply of meat, directed that the acting-quartermaster should attend at the butcher&#39;s shop and see each man&#39;s allowance weighed out. The acting - quartermaster shortly afterwards reported that the butcher had chased him out of his quarters with a knife. The officer commanding then appointed as acting-quartermaster the champion boxer on board ship, and ten minutes later was advised that a new butcher was required. </para>

Trouble often occurs between the passengers and officers of a ship, and I am well aware of the difficulties that sometimes arise between troops on board ship and the ship&#39;s officers. On three distinct occasions, as a youngster, I travelled with troops on board ship, and in each instance trouble occurred between the officers and crew and the soldiers. </para>

The supply of these extras has been stopped.

                <para>I have received to-day a letter from the Sydney branch of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, stating that 100 of its members were on board the <inline font-style="italic">Bahia Castillo.</inline> The members of that society can command a fair wage in all parts of the world, and are therefore accustomed to good living conditions. If they were supplied with bad food on board ship, it was only natural that they should kick over the traces. I repeat that it is impossible to imagine that 600 men would have left this ship at Fremantle unless there was good reason for doing so. Naturally, members of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers would expect civilized conditions to prevail on board. The determination of what are civilized conditions would not be left to them, and it certainly should not be left to the owners or -agents of the. ship. Ship-owners are out to make money, even if, in order to do so, it is necessary to underfeed or badly feed those on board. A week has elapsed since the trouble took place in connexion with the <inline font-style="italic">Bahia Castillo,</inline> and the Government have not yet told us what they are going to do. </para>

The Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> knows that they are disciplined as a guard, and they would arrest any man who came through for drunkenness, although they may have been arrested a month before for the same crime. Surely the Government could have altered the conditions which induced the people to leave the ship at Fremantle. The Minister is asking what I would do. I would have a full inquiry by a civil authority into all the circumstances. Up to the present, the Government have encouraged actions of this kind, because they have not taken matters into their own hands and dealt with trouble effectively.

                    <para>. -  I want again to direct the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation to the failure of the Government to keep their promises to those returned soldiers who wish to buy homes already, erected. Almost every mail brings complaints that soldiers have been induced by promises of the Government, made not only in speeches, but in the press, and circulated on the boats as they are returning to Australia, that returned soldiers would be assisted to purchase homes for themselves. On the strength of these promises, a number of men have made arrangements with owners of properties, and have undertaken certain financial responsibilities, but they can get no satisfaction from the Department. I brought the matter before the House some months ago-; but we have no information beyond the fact that the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank is taking up an attitude entirely different from the attitude of the Government a.&#34; outlined in their policy. Apart altogether from architectural schemes for the building of new towns and industrial centres, the practical thing to be done now is to assist soldiers who are here, and married, to get homes for themselves. These houses are available to them. They are being sold on the market every day, and a question of Government policy, as to future building, should not be allowed to interfere with the extension of assistance to men in these circumstances. It is nearly time this House had a definite Ministerial statement as to what promises, made over and over again, are not being kept. I have in mind one particular case ; that of a young friend of mine, who made application to the Department about four months ago. He came back to a wife and child, and naturally wanted to get a home of his own as quickly as possible. On the strength of promises made by the Government, he arranged with the owner of a house to buy the property, and, although he only wanted &#163;150, he could get no assistance from the Homes Department so he had to make other arrangements. I have no doubt that other honorable members have similar cases. This matter is urgent. Returned soldiers who desire to buy homes already &#34;built should, I think, have precedence. The erection of new homes with a flourish of trumpets and brass bands is, no doubt, very interesting, but it is not doing this job. The immediate work is to assist men who have made engagements for the purchase of homes already built. This phase of the business ought to be taken away from the Commonwealth Bank altogether, and dealt with separately by the man who is paid to deal with it. The arrangement with the Commonwealth Bank is not part of the repatriation scheme as put before honorable members, and it is apparent to me that a most serious blunder was made in the selection of a man to control the War Service Homes Department. Whatever that man&#39;s qualifications as a builder may be, as an organizer of this big scheme he is an absolute failure, because he has been in office for many months now, and these cases are still not dealt with. The matter is serious. We are breaking our promises to our soldiers, and the sooner the matter receives the attention it deserves the better it will be for all concerned. </para>

                <para class="block">I can quite understand how difficult it is for the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> to make a definite statement, in view of the lack of first-hand knowledge; hut I am particularly anxious to raise the question, in order to see that, whoever was responsible, be it a military or naval officer in London, on the ship, or in Australia, any inquiry held should be of such a nature as tq. sheet home to that officer once and! for all the responsibility for hrs neglect of duty which has brought about such a regrettable and unfortunate state of affairs. I have no doubt, as to the sympathy of the Ministry for the people who have been placed in this position. When the munition workers found it necessary to leave the vessel at Fremantle, they showed that their complaints must be thoroughly well founded. The information they have supplied, which is all we have to go on, is of such a character as to demand that any inquiry to be held shall be free and without any&#39; suspicion of bias or domination by military or naval officers, and such <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> to insure that its results will be acceptable to the public. Whether it is acceptable or not to the munition workers is, so far as I am concerned, a secondary consideration. I hope that the result of the inquiry will go a long way towards preventing a recurrence of these painful episodes. The honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates)</inline> was anxious to say something in regard to his experience on the <inline font-style="italic">Somali,</inline> but he had to catch the train for Adelaide. He has told us in the House, and privately, that a file of soldiers with guns loaded with ball cartridge was waiting on the wharf when that vessel reached Adelaide. We all admit that discipline must be maintained ; but there is a method of carrying it out which is effective and reasonable, and there is another method which is not only irritating, but also unnecessary. I hope that as a result of the inquiry asked for_ a Court will be constituted which will give absolute satisfaction to the public, and assure them that the best is being done, not only to investigate these particular complaints, but also to protect returned soldiers and munition workers on other troopships. </para>

One man has to make other arrangements before the end of this month, but, so far, has received no reply to his application, which has been before the Repatriation Department for weeks past. Unless he receives a favorable reply he will lose an opportunity of getting a home at a reasonable price. These delays are dangerous, and the men are beginning to believe that, after all, the repatriation scheme is not to have the good effect it was originally intended to have. If the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank is to be blamed for the delay, it is time he appointed more officers. I notice that he has opened a new office in- Collins-street, Melbourne, to deal with soldiers&#39; homes. I hope that this step will lead to more expedition. I can assure the Ministry that the complaints of the men are serious and are becoming all too frequent. The men are becoming disheartened, because they feel that the opportunity to secure suitable homes is gradually slipping through their fingers, owing to the departmental delays. </para>

                <para>The supply of potash for Australia is a most serious matter. One of the. Commonwealth line of steamers is now on its way to Australia from Rotterdam with a full load of potash, but there is an embargo on the landing of goods in Australia  containing more than 5 per cent, of the product of an enemy country. I cannot understand how one of the Commonwealth line of steamers should be engaged in this class .of work, unless she was specially sent to Rotterdam to bring this cargo to Australia. There is a good deal of misapprehension here, and I hope it will &#39;be removed before the vessel arrives. A supply of potash is essential for our agriculturists, and as soon as this boat arrives I hope that its cargo will be distributed, and put into use. </para>

There appears to have been what I was going to call the usual complaints about food and accommodation before the ship arrived at Capetown, and as I have had an experience of life on board a troopship, perhaps I may have a few words to say on this point. There is a tendency, not only among the men, but also among the officers and all sections .aboard ,a troopship to regard it in the same light  and judge it by the same standards as an ordinary passenger liner. That often leads to trouble. On the troopship by which I returned to Australia I persuaded the officers to allow the troops to parade the saloon deck while the saloon passengers were having breakfast. The troops have not much room for exercise, and I thought it fair that while we were having breakfast they should be allowed to parade our deck, where they would be in no one&#39;s way. They paraded our deck on this one morning. Next morning an officer told me he would object to that kind of thing occurring again. </para>

                        <para>- No; an Imperial officer. I asked what was wrong with it, and he said, &#34; There is little enough space now for the first class passengers.&#34; We forget that the first objective of such a vessel is to get the troops out to Australia as fast as possible and land them as healthy as possible, and not to give people all the habiliments of a first class passage. That, I pointed out, was a secondary consideration. These troop ships differ in many ways from the ordinary liner, and that may sometimes be the cause of some of the troubles that occur. </para>

                <para>In the case under discussion the complaints were made before the vessel arrived at the Cape. They were investigated, so far as that could be done, and the reply we got from the Cape was that, in conjunction with an Australian staff officer, one of our own men, at Durban, the vessel had been inspected and found in every way satisfactory. The only reasonable complaint was the condition of the potatoes. I may say that on the boat by which I returned the potatoes were not good on all occasions. It was the latter end of the year, and the potatoes would not all keep in good condition until new potatoes were procurable. That kind of thing happens at Home. Complaints reached me when I was in London, in consequence of which I visited one of our hospitals. The complaints were about the fish and potatoes. Mr. B urchell. - At Southall. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I went down there and told the doctor in charge of the complaints that were reaching me. He said, &#34; I know. There are two things wrong: The fish and the potatoes.&#34; He then proceeded to show me the papers, in which he had already recommended the prosecution of a man who had supplied bad fish. He had received two consignments of bad fish from this contractor for supplies. It was of no use to blame the officer in charge of the hospital. Ha was as much annoyed about it as any one else, and took steps to remedy the complaint as far as possible. We may get bad fish and bad potatoes occasionally at home, but I am afraid that we do not make the same allowance for public institutions as we make in connexion with our own families. I am not saying that in justification of this kind of thing, but only to suggest that these matters should be considered reasonably. </para>

                <para>The complaint of the munition workers was investigated at Durban, and it was found that there was nothing serious in it, and what little faults there were were rectified, and the steamer sailed. After she had sailed, she came back to port. The ship&#39;s crew refused to proceed any further on the voyage unless an armed guard was put on board. It seems that the munition workers had shown a threatening attitude; their conduct was reported as mutinous, and so the vessel came back to port. The naval authorities in South Africa had to put on a guard of seventy-four men, including four officers. These men, I understand, were taken from another boat that was on the way out to Australia. They were returning soldiers of the Australian Imperial Force. They were put on board the <inline font-style="italic">Bahia Castillo,</inline> and then the row began about the guard. Up to Durban, the complaint was about the food, and after leaving Durban it was about the guard, and so it continued until the vessel arrived at Fremantle, when the munition workers declined to go any further with the ship unless the guard was removed. </para>

                <para>On arrival at Fremantle, it seems that these people went ashore and would not proceed with the vessel any further. Arrangements were made for an inquiry to be held there by a Board, consisting of Captain Burford, Captain Collins; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier,</inline> M.L.A., Leader of the Labour Opposition in the Western Australian Parliament; <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Williams;</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carter,</inline> representing the agents of the vessel. The Board endeavoured to obtain evidence from the passengers, but the passengers declined, by a unanimous vote, to have anything to do with a Board of that kind, and demanded that their evidence should be taken on oath in open court, with the public present. So the ship&#39;s crew, refusing to sail without the guard, and the ship&#39;s passengers refusing to sail with the guard, the passengers had perforce to be left behind, and there the matter stands at present. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, every provision is made for that, but they will not go on board the ship. Although the munition workers would not give evidence before the Board to which I refer, there was an investigation, and, as a result, the report we get is that the accommodation on board the ship is ample, the cooking arrangements were for 2,000 people, the sleeping accommodation is ample and to spare, the messing accommodation is provided, not on the living and sleeping decks, but in the saloon, the food scale is ample, and the quality of the food good, with one exception, that the potatoes were not good on one day. The other food was good. Up to Durban, the complaints were against the cooking, serving, and food; and, after Durban, the presence of the armed guard. </para>

                <para>I do not think that we should take that armed guard off the vessel to please the munition workers, unless good reason can be shown. The guard consists of returning soldiers of the Australian Imperial Force, and I think we ought to know why this guard is objected to. The munition workers say that they will come home if there is another guard appointed from amongst themselves. </para>

When people have nothing else to do but think about their troubles, it is a very easy matter for one or two men to induce them to make trouble. At the same time I wish to say that the facts in this matter ought to be investigated, and, so far as I am concerned, there shall be a full investigation of it. </para>
