                        <para>- The honorable member was good enough to&#39;  inf01711  me that he intended to ask this question. When the Bill was under discussion the honorable member, who has taken a keen interest in this matter, raised the question of the right of soldiers to have applied to them the same privileges as are accorded private citizens under the General Moratorium Regulations in regard to an extension of the term of a mortgage on the ground of hardship: In the case of ordinary citizens, under&#39; the General Moratorium, after the expiry of the time specified, a further extension of twelve months may be granted in cases of hardship, and the honorable member urged that this extension should also be provided for in the case of members of the Australian. Imperial Force under the Active Service Moratorium.&#39; In Committee on. the Bill I moved an amendment of the schedule dealing with the Active Service Moratorium Regulation&#39;s, so as to give the soldiers the same rights in this respect as is given to private individuals. The honorable member&#39;s wish has, therefore, been gratified. Amendments were made to the schedule of the Bill in which these regulations are embodied for an extension of the prescribed dates in the General Moratorium, which ranged from August until June, 1920, so as to provide for a  sliding scale running from February, 1920, to July, 1920. These several amendments have been embodied in the respective War Precautions Regulations, so that they are now in operation. When the Moratorium Bill is passed those regulations, as amended, will continue in force by virtue of the Act. </para>

                        <para>- I have not seen the statement to which the honorable member refers, and know nothing as to its import other than what he has conveyed. I think my honorable friend is aware that a Royal Commission has been appointed to inquire into the basis of valuation of Crown leaseholds under the Land Tax Act. It is not correct to say that the revenue derived from those leases is insufficient for any purpose, since the collection of the tax has been held up pending the decision. It is not the intention of the Government to eliminate the taxation of Crown leaseholds; but it is desirous of embodying in legislation, if the recommendation of the Commission be in that direction, perhaps a more equitable method of valuation. </para>

                        <para>- I have not seen the statement quoted by the honorable member, and cannot imagine that the Premier and Treasurer of New South Wales would have made such a bald announcement without a fuller explanation. Condensation has probably produced the rough meaning of his statement without the necessary qualifications. The Premier of New South Wales is aware, as is the head of every State Government, that we have made proposals to the States to finance certain works of a repatriative kind that will lead to land settlement. The arrangement made holds good with regard to all the States that accept it. I do not know whether it embraces, in the case of New South Wales, &#163;2,000,000, more or less, but it is a general arrangement with all the States. </para>

                        <para>- It is easy to perceive the solicitude of representatives of rural districts -with regard to the distribution of further moneys from the Wheat Pool. I have endeavoured to explain before, that until the question of payment for the recent sales to the British Government by the Australian Wheat Board is settled, the Commonwealth Treasury cannot see its way to authorize any further payments. The Government, however, is desirous of clearing up the matter as soon as possible. We are still cabling the Imperial authorities, and will announce the policy to be pursued as soon as it is possible to do so. </para>

As soon as a port opens, which we are advised will accept deportees, the Russian aliens here will be deported.

                                <para>- No. I have tried to get from the Government what the Committee reported, and what was the Government&#39;s decision or what was the attitude of the Government; but the Acting Prime Minister has been unable, so far, to put the paper on the table, although he was under the impression that it had already been placed there. The report of the Committee has been kept back, and we desire to know why. The Government have said that they are prepared to take responsibility for the conclusions of the two Boards, the Special Committee of Magistrates and the Committee of Reference, in regard to the matter. It is all very well for the Government to be prepared to take responsibility for the action of any of the Boards, but my complaint is that the Government have not looked into matters for themselves, and that previous wrongs are being perpetrated. </para>

                        <para>Let me say at once, on behalf of the party I represent in this matter, that they do not desire that any German or Austrian enemy subject who is proved to have been disloyal to the Allies during the war shall be allowed to remain in Australia, but they do take the stand that even the most disloyal of those people is entitled to an open and public trial. The internees numbered 7,000, or 8,000, altogether, of whom I believe some 2,000, or 3,000, have been already deported at their own wish. Of these internees some were interned because they were advising people not to go to the Front. Some were charged with organizing an immediate armed rising of Germans, Austrians, and others to attack Australians in Australia as soon as an opportune moment presented itself, if the Germans got the upper hand. There can be no doubt about that, but there were also a number of unnaturalized Germans and Austrians, and also naturalized Germans and Austrians, who, owing to public opinion at the time, were deprived of their employment and their businesses, and asked the Defence Department to intern them because they and their wives and children were starving. They were interned, and their wives and children were humanely granted by the1 Government a sustenance allowance. In the internment camps, therefore, were all kinds of people. The Government have appointed a Board consisting of six magistrates to hear the cases. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West)</inline> will be able to deal with that matter himself. The internees then retire, and the Committee decides, in their absence and secretly, what they will do. In many cases the Committee has evidence which has been collected by the Defence Department, and which, it is alleged, proves that these men are disloyal, but the internee is not told what the charge against him is, nor is he told the name of his accuser. This could have been justified in time of war. I venture to say that no Government can conduct a war efficiently unless it has a secret service system. The Government of every country has its secret agents, and the Government can convince any reasonable person that in the midst of war there is no time to have trials, or to hold a public and open inquiry, because the moment you j?ive the name of your secret agent his usefulness is gone. We must bear in mind that, although these people were accused of being disloyal, they were not put in gaol. They were merely put in- an internment camp and supported there at Government expense for the safety of the Commonwealth. I am prepared to defend that action on any platform as unavoidable during the war; but now that the war is over, now that the Germanic Allies have been utterly defeated, Germany&#39;s former rulers are refugees in foreign countries, the Germany Navy or the greater part of it at the bottom of the sea, and the great German Army disbanded, the Government ought to be  prepared to give every man -whom it is proposed to deport a fair and open trial. I shall be interested to bear from the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> what justification there is for refusing such a trial. </para>

                                <para>- If there is any fear that party political animosities may be stirred up by my remark I withdraw it, and simply say that these people were brought here by the State Governments. They came to Australia, took up virgin forest land, felled the trees, cultivated the soil, married Australian girls in some cases, and reared Australian children. The greatest solicitude should be shown by every one inquiring into their cases to see that no injustice is done; but I think no Government can defend the methods adopted in dealing with them. </para>

The main object with which the honorable member addressed himself to the Chamber appears to have been to seek, first of all, a declaration of the policy and procedure of the Government in relation to the deportation of enemy aliens, and, if that was not satisfactory, to give a list of suggestions for the modification of the policy now being pursued. I want to set forth what the Governmenthave done in regard to this and other kindred matters during the last twelve months. </para>

                        <para>When it became plain - I speak from a recollection that has not been checked by reference to the files - that the war was either drifting to a close or had closed, the Government realized that a number of questions relating to enemy aliens resident in Australia demanded very careful consideration. Ministers were living a pretty busy life in the broken sessional and administrative work we were doing, and, therefore, we selected a body of the most experienced and competent departmental heads, and associated with them a member of the Senate, and we authorized them to inquire into all phases of the enemy question that would need treatment at the close of the war. That body was presided over by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn,</inline> and deliberated for many months. It brought to the Government, as it was requested to do, a very complete report. It looked into the question in the light of all the inquiries made in Great Britain and the other Dominions, and it had the advantage of perusing the discussions that took place at the Imperial Conference and all printed documents the British Government had circulated for the use of the Dominion Governments. I venture to think that hereafter the report of this body. will be regarded as a very complete and reasonable document. It was, as a preliminary step, referred to a subCommittee of the Cabinet, who, in their turn, for many weeks sifted all the matters covered by the recommendations. Finally, Cabinet considered the sub-Committee E report, and authorized both the report of the Committee and the recommendations of the Cabinet sub-Committee to be printed and laid on the table of Parliament. That was the position when, unfortunately, I was dislocated from work, and I imagined, as I informed the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> that the documents had actually been laid on the table; but on making inquiries from the Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> I found that this was not the case. There were so many subjects covered in the report beyond the question of the treatment of internees or aliens, that it was deemed inadvisable to lay the documents on the table until the Government saw the exact nature of tha Peace Treaty determinations relating to enemy property and other subjects covered. </para>

                        <para>I was saying that I was addressing the intelligent members of the House, and it is extremely difficult in the short time available to cover all that a Minister wants to cover in speaking upon a matter of this kind. If honorable members will allow the Government to place before them the information they seek to give they will see that the points exciting the interest of honorable members opposite are covered. In the meantime I am drawing attention to the procedure adopted by the Government in dealing with all the interwoven and interlaced enemy problems, amongst which is the question of internment and deportation. </para>
                        <para>The honorable member&#39;s questions deal with the &#39;&#39; clean -slate &#34; policy. At this stage I do not propose to elaborate that policy extensively, but simply say that, at the conclusion of a great struggle of this kind, it is apparent to all the belligerent nations, victorious or otherwise, that there must be a reckoning between the Allies and their enemies in regard to the debits and credits existing prior to the war, or evolved during the war, between the nations of the central empires and their allies, and the great nations and their allies opposed to them. All these have to be written down against one another, and one of the greatest problems which statecraft and accountancy have to face is that of ascertaining the facts of debits and credits, and making due allowance for them. If enemy aliens, residing in Australia, owe us money, if Germans, residing in Germany, owe us money, or if Australians, residing in Germany, owe that country or Australia money, it may all have to come into the sum. It is perfectly plain that the different nations will have to establish a great counting-house to properly mark the debits and credits existing prior to the war, and developed during the war, for satisfactory settlement in accordance with the treaty terms at the conclusion of the war. That &#34; clean-slate &#34; policy is affected by the report of the Committee, presided over by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn,</inline> and the findings of the Cabinet sub-Committee, so also are questions of enemy aliens residing in Australia, who own property here, and owe no debts outside Australia, and enemy aliens residing in Australia who own enemy shares. These are the problems that demand attention, possibly followed by important legislation. </para>

Of the approximately 7,000 persons who have been interned, the majority were interned long before the present Government assumed office. We became merely the custodians of them by virtue of our Ministerial responsibilities. </para>

                                <para>- I am not putting a party colour upon this question, but I say that the internment machine invented by a Labour Government was worse than the machine which the present Government has devised, because the former Administration left the whole matter entirely in the hands of the Defence officers. We considered that there was a grave danger in that arrangement, that it was not proper to allow the officers of the Defence Department, who had placed these people in internment, to decide whether their applications for release should be granted. We thought that a specific and well-chosen tribunal, and one more representative of civilian thought in this country, might well deal with all appeals, and we created a Committe of three, comprising a gentleman who was at that time a prominent barrister in Melbourne, and is now Judge Williams, of the Victorian County Court; Brigadier-General Williams, a civilian soldier, who filled the position of Commandant of Victoria with such conspicuous success for a long time during the war, and who has lived a life that has kept him in touch with the people ever since he was a boy; and a representative of the neighbouring capital of Sydney, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teece.</inline> We arranged that all applications for release from internment should be made to the Minister through that body. That was a reform which ought to have been, and, I believe, was, gratefully accepted by the internees, and every release granted since then has been on the recommendation of that tribunal. We were called upon to deal with the question of deportation, in some cases suddenly. Under the conditions of the Armistice and the arrangements which followed, the exchange of prisoners of war and of civilian prisoners interned had been arranged amongst some of the nations, notably Britain and Germany, and various ships were sent from Britain to take away those men whom the British Government had contracted to return to Germany. </para>

The people who desired to be repatriated to enemy countries, the voluntary deportees, were put on the ships quickly, but in case there should be enemy internees who were being deported against their will, such objection not being known to the Government, we asked the State Governments to nominate six magistrates to whom all cases of enemy aliens who were being sent away against their will could be referred. Speaking from memory, three magistrates were nominated in New South Wales, where the principal internment camp is, and three others in other States. We decided that these magistrates should take into consideration all relevant facts relating to men who were being deported and who might wish to remain in the country. By an instruction prepared by the Commonwealth Crown Law Department, the magistrates were directed to have regard to the following conditions: - </para>

                                <para>- Freeman was not deported under the arrangements to which I am referring. There are others who have been dealt with under the Unlawful Associations Act, but they were not proceeded against for being enemy aliens; also other undesirable aliens were deported. For merely being an enemy alien, no man who has not been interned has been deported, certainly not at the will of the Government. I repeat, that the Government have been acting as the custodians of internees whom it was our duty to guard, although we had not the initial responsibility for their internment. I believe that an analysis would disclose that the bulk of the 6,000 or 7,000 persons interned were arrested and segregated during the first few months of the war. They have been kept in internment, apparently for reasons that appeared good and sufficient to the various Administrations that have controlled the affairs of Australia during the war period. </para>

                                <para>- I am dealing now with the question as to whether, there should not be, as the honorable member for Capricornia has suggested, an open public trial. The honorable member said, amongst other things, that it would have been imprudent for any nation or Government, during the war period, to expose the operations of its secret service. I quite appreciate the very vivid way in which he made that point, and may say that the bulk of honorable members all through have taken the same view. They have realized that it is an absolutely indispensable pre-requisite to weapon a Government with the right to examine its community, to find out any hostile internal movement, and the Government which did not do that would be leading itself blindly up an alley to slaughter. Why were these persons, in the bulk of cases, subjected to internment without public trial ? Let us look at the facts broadly, and, for the present, without sentiment. Sentiment is a powerful operating feature in all the public affairs of this country, but safety is more important than sentiment, and the safety of the nation must be the supreme law just as it was in ancient Rome. When the Intelligence Department and the Police Force brought them information about hostile movements of Germans or pro-Germans why did not the Government grant such persons a public trial ? The reason was, plainly, that it was possible to get a great deal of information if the people in German communities throughout Australia were not obliged to face the German communities in which they lived. I know districts in Australia - I am particularly familiar with one - where it would be absolutely unsafe for any Britisher or Australian to stand up and say in a public Court, &#39; &#39; That man has uttered sentiments that are disloyal to Australia.&#34; If it is true that that kind of fact recommended itself to the interning Administration as all-sufficient it is equally true now with regard to releases. If we were called upon to grant a trial in open Court to the appeal cases - there are nearly a thousand appeals - it would take months, or years, to hear them, and the intimidation that would be exercised on the original or subsequent informers would be so unendurable that the authorities would not be able to obtain their evidence. What has been done generally by all Administrations that have had to deal with this matter of interning Germans, is this- </para>

                                <para>- One might describe them as punctures! This information, so far as my information goes, was not acted upon, and certainly it has not been acted upon for the last two and a-half years, during which I have had a personal knowledge of the procedure, unless it was confirmed by a reference to the State authorities, known as the police. If the information came originally from the police it was not acted upon unless confirmed by the Intelligence Departments of the. Navy or the Army. It was upon that kind of inter-related information that the Departments and the Governments of the day were satisfied. That is the only information the Departments have, and it is the kind of information which the magistrates have nut in front of them to show the cause of any internment. The internee, on his part, can ask why it is proposed to deport him, and he has every opportunity, by documentary or personal representations, to show why he should not be deported. </para>

                        <para>My honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> says that now that the war is over and the German Navy lies on the sands of Scapa, we might safely do a number of things that we could not do during the war. That is true of some things, but not of others. It would be extremely injudicious now that the war is over to subject to terrorism either the Intelligence officers, the Police Force, or patriotic citizens who have come to the aid of the several Governments that have been in office during this period. I say plainly that the Government is possessed of information which shows clearly that, notwithstanding the overwhelming and crushing defeat of Germany on land and sea, there are in certain German communities in Australia to-day Germans and GermanAustralians who have been allowed to roam at pleasure, and who are as truculent as they were in the early stages of the war. This community must protect itself. Even if there is a slight injustice in some part of the procedure adopted, the safety of. this community is more important than the display of sentiment towards a particular class of people. I do not hesitate for one moment to say that the procedure adopted, while not customary in time of peace or in connexion with civil matters, is the inevitable concomitant of the war, and that it can be operated with moderation and tolerance, as it is being operated to-day. The members of our party, and I believe, the members of the Opposition, have no vendetta to ply against Germans generally. But we will not allow Australia to be subjected to dangers and hostile influences by permitting to remain here men who ought to go back to the country from which they came. We are determined, whether honorable gentlemen here or elsewhere like it or not, to follow what we believe to be a considered line of policy and procedure, so that we can safely say to the people whose servants we are that we have done this thing because we considered it to be our duty. We have followed this course without undue cruelty, but with resolution and determination to the end. </para>

                                <para>- I am not dealing with the past. That is a generalization which might hit any kind of Administration. I am dealing with matters for which the Government of to-day are responsible - with the inauguration of the machinery and policy in relation to deportations and releases. No political pressure is recognised or exercised in relation to those important matters. If we found that an officer had yielded to such pressure he would receive the swiftest treatment. </para>

This nation cannot expropriate these people without regard to the compensation features of the Treaty. </para>

                                <para>- It is a question, not of safeguarding property, which has neither feelings nor soul, but of safeguarding the  interests of certain people in property which is a human interest, and not an interest of shares or bricks and mortar. Honorable members are aware that enemy shares were placed in the hands of a receiver, not that the holder should not get the money again, but that they should be held in trust until after the war. The Peace Treaty provides for such settlements, and to its terms we shall become subject if we adopt it in this Parliament. Certain honorable members made representations wider than those advanced by the honorable member for Capricornia. It was said by them that we ought to release a great many more internees than we were releasing. I want to deal with only one phase of that contention, and not to traverse the whole of the ground. Certain Australian and British-born men are in the internment camps with enemy subjects, but under the promise made by the then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fisher)</inline> as to the administration of the War Precautions Act, every Government has taken care that before any of this class was interned his case should come before the Cabinet. Those who have been Executive Councillors during the war period know that that has been so. We are anxious to release the Australianborn, because we do not propose to deport them under the same conditions as enemy aliens, but to keep them here. We are awaiting the time when Britain will announce to us that the Peace Treaty has become binding on the requisite number of principal Powers, and is an actual fact in the life of the United Kingdom and the Dominions, when we will release all these men. In regard to the others, the more honorable members are familiar with the motives and procedure adopted by the Government in relation to the release or deportation of men who have been or are interned, the more they ought to approve of the improvements made by the recent alterations. If honorable members can show me that the principles I have enunciated have not been followed, I shall welcome the information. I shall follow up, as far as I am capable, any cases that are supposed to be exceptions to the determination of the Cabinet, and involve personal injustice. </para>

                            <para>.- I was not aware this question was to be discussed until I entered the House this morning, and if I rise now it is not to make any affirmation against the Government. I wish it clearly to be understood that I have not a word to say in defence of the Germans interned. The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> is quite right when he states that this is not a party question. My objection is not to the internment of Germans, but to the fact that many men in the country, of German origin and birth, have been able to escape internment because of their wealth and social standing. On the other hand, there are many men and women of Australian birth, with fathers and mothers also of Australian birth, who have been dismissed from the Public Service because of their German origin. Is the Minister in charge of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> aware of that? </para>

                            <para>.- The address of the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> lacked nothing in clarity and sympathy, and if it were a literally accurate statement of the position as it is in Australia to-day in regard to aliens and others, no  possible exception could be taken to the position of the Government. In view of the very brief time at my disposal, I challenge the honorable gentleman at once upon the two main statements he put before the House. He alleged that nobody was to be deported from this country who had not been interned, and also that there would be no inhumanity - notably in connexion with old-age pensions - to any person by reason of his racial lineage. I have to tell the Government and the country that I can quote one instance which has just recently come under my notice, which appears to be typical of many. It is that of a Bendigo man who has never been interned and against whom no charge has been made, who is known to have been a useful resident of Australia, if not technically a citizen. This man has been notified&#39; that he must present himself  at once in Melbourne for deportation. The Acting Prime Minister, apparently because he does not know, and the Defence Department does riot&#39; think it necessary to inform him, complacently takes his place in this House and tells us that no injustice will be done with the Government sanction. My complaint is that the Government do not appear to know or care to attend to what their Defence officers are doing. While the Government declares that it take3 the responsibility, it suffers this abuse to go on without protest. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>What is the use of the Acting Prime Minister telling us that no man will be deported unless he has been interned or has given some evidence of disloyalty? Every honorable member knows, if he is honest with himself, that there is injustice in spite of the solemn protests of the Acting Prime Minister. I will take it that the honorable gentleman is candid in what he has said, aud that he does not know of these occurences. .But is it not worth his while to investigate? Is it becoming in him, as Acting Prime Minister, on a motion of this kind, to disclose his ignorance on a vital matter affecting the liberty of people whom we are pledged to guard so long as they are residents within our shores? It is in my own knowledge that an old man, getting into the seventies, with probably a residence here of thirty or forty years, and nothing against his character as an honest, hard-working person, is to be deprived of his old-age pension. And this, although he is naturalized, as he must be to get that pension. When. I asked for an explanation as to why this old man is robbed of his only means of sustenance, I was told, officially, by a departmental officer, that a person in such case must prove his loyalty. How is he to&#39; prove his loyalty, and to whom must he prove it. He has never been called upon to prove his loyalty, but he has been harassed and chased away from Queenscliff, where he has lived for a number of years, and is left to starve in hie old age. We are making the vital mistake of endeavouring to live up to the standard which we have imputed to the enemy we have been fighting. We have declared that the enemy does this kind of thing, and we have held it up to pU D110 reprobation, as something for which the enemy ought to be punished ; but we imitate an example which we, in other times, declare to deserve our strongest condemnation. </para>
                        <para>As to the Secret Service, the honorable gentleman who leads this House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> has spoken of the national safety - told us that the safety of the nation is the highest law. I do not grant that, sir. I challenge the complacent view of those who are content to say that, in the interests of safety, we must do this or that. In the interests of safety you may not invade a sacred principle, or do injustice to a single individual in the country. We have to buckle on our armour, throw out our chest, and, like men, run the risk of doing the right thing. It is idle to open our proceedings with solemn prayer to the Deity, and then disregard the equally solemn injunction that religion imposes on every man to do justice to his fellow-citizens and fellowmen. We should not be afraid to do the right thing. Would, however, the safety of the country be jeopardized by doing the right and honest thing by the men whom we are now wronging? Not a bit of it. Every one of those men to whom we do an injustice, and to whom we deny the application of the fundamental principles of British justice, will, through his friends and relatives, become, so far as the Government can make him, an active propagandist of disloyalty. Instead of safeguarding the interests of Australia by doing obvious injustice to any residents in the country, we are really doing our best to spread disloyalty and. disaffection. </para>
                        <para>The- Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> spoke of the means taken to inquire into the loyalty or otherwise of men who have been interned, and he sought to justify the Secret Service on the ground that it is an immemorial practice in war time, and after war time, to avail ourselves&#39; of this means of knowledge in order to safeguard the&#34; nation. The honorable gentleman mentioned the German communities ; and I ask, What are the means adopted in their case? The means are, through the Defence Department, to make use of every tittle-tattle, gossip or malevolent whisper, probably from an interested party, in order to make out a case against a man who is to be put behind prison bars without himself getting a hearing. The honorable gentleman says that we must adopt this means because, forsooth, if I, or any one else, were to publicly accuse a man of disloyalty, the accuser&#39;s life and property would not be safe. Such a statement applies to every court of justice and every tribunal that was ever erected in a free country; but it has been found, as the result of years of experience, and particularly has it been found in Britain, that it is worth while to do these things in public - to do the right, even at the risk of its resulting indirectly in injury to somebody else. I make bold to say that there axe men who have been interned on this secret evidence and to whom gross injustice has been done. What happens ? A man may have a grudge against one of those unfortunate persons of so-called enemy birth ; it may be a private grudge, caused by personal spite arising out of a business deal or a private estrangement between families and relations, but a case is built up in secret, and the man has no chance to answer the charge. Some have had a chance, because they had sufficient influence, political and private, to enable them to go to the Minister in charge and protest their loyalty. These have succeeded in having trials, if not in public at least with the ordinary forms of justice, and, to my knowledge, as a result, some have been liberated. But what about an unfortunate wretch who has no such influence? He gets no trial, never sees the document or his accuser, and has no opportunity of having the merits of his case examined. </para>
                        <para>The Acting Prime Minister the other day, said that the Labour party was very likely to get the reputation of being defenders of Germans; and honorable members deprecated the statement. We should hesitate, he said, before we allowed a character of that kind to attach to us. What do honorable members suppose that I can gain in my electorate or in this House by appearing to be the defender of Germans or Germany? I have nothing to gain and all to lose. But, from the very beginning of this war, from the moment that I thought it was going to result in a vendetta and acts of revenge against men who had done no wrong in this country, it is true that much of my public activities have been directed to correcting that injustice. It is not because it will redound to my advantage or disadvantage, or because it will do this party harm or good, that my conduct will be influenced. It will be influenced only by the best traditions of the administration of British justice, which have been brought down to this country and which, instead of abusing, we should hold more sacred to-day in a free Democracy than even our forefathers did in the years gone by. </para>
                        <para>The honorable member who moved this motion <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> &#39;has rightly pointed out that the deportees who are principally affected are men who were invited here, not so much by the Labour party as by the Liberal and Conservative parties. On the platform those gentlemen were accustomed to hold forth at large about the protection that would be given, under the British flag, in this country to immigrants so long as they were obedient to the country&#39;s laws. Now, forsooth, because of the war, which took place in another part of the world, men in this country, who left the Central Powers because they hated the military traditions of the country in which they were born, and who were making, or were likely to make, good citizens here, are to be turned out. This will create amongst their friends and relatives a feeling of hostility and disloyalty which is likely to live many years after the war is over. The honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> tried to get a moment&#39;s attention to the fact that we are driving out of our Public Service young Australian-born men - not only young men who were not born in enemy countries, but young men neither of whose parents was born in enemy countries, and to whose ancestors of three generations back you have to go to get what is conceived to be the taint of enemy blood. What will be the effect of treating these young men! in this way ? What will be the effect of throwing a young Australian out of the Public Service, in which he has won in competitive examination his right to work and live? He will go out into the general community hating the Government that treated him in that way, and teaching others to hate the Government also. So far from the Government safeguarding the interests of the nation, the interests of the nation will be, to a great extent, jeopardized by these acts of injustice. </para>

I regret that the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> has confined his reply to the question of the deportation of enemy aliens. In answer to an interjection by me he said that the mover of the motion had dealt only with that question. I am much more concerned with the deportation of men, more particularly members of the working class, who were not enemy aliens. The Acting Prime Minister and the rest of the Cabinet have throughout refused to give us information about those cases. I have received the following letter: - </para>

                        <para>I know of two Germans who were interned at Holdsworthy because they were unable to earn a living. When the war broke out there was strong national antipathy manifested towards German aliens, and it was impossible for a number of men belonging to the working class to follow their usual occupations. For them the only alternative to utter starvation was internment. They had to give themselves up in order to obtain sustenance for their wives and families. During the war we had introduced here a modern equivalent of the Lion&#39;s Mouth of Venice. Anybody with feelings of hostility or more sinister motives could impute disloyalty to others, and send the accusation in to the Intelligence Branch of the Defence Department. Those aimed at never knew who their accusers were, and had. no opportunity to contradict the allegations made against them. Such a system is absolutely disgraceful, and I cannot understand how honorable members opposite could sit down and allow so monstrous an injustice to be perpetrated. There can be no excuse for it now, no matter what may be said about the necessity for an espionage system in time of war, and no matter how members may defend the devious methods used by every Government when war is declared. There can be no reason now for not giving every one of the men or women who feel aggrieved an open opportunity to face their accusers, to see the charges laid against them, and to answer them. That is what is being asked for; but what are the facts? Apart from the deportation of enemy aliens, we know that men of British birth - English, Scotch&#39;, and Irish - have been deported from here during the whole course of the war without trial. Men are picked up and charged and left in gao. - as Marks was left, and as others have been left - and then deported. I believe that Paul Freeman has again been deported, this time as a German. I understand that, on Friday last, he was brought before the so-called tribunal ; but what chance had he? The Government put him in Holdsworthy, and said, &#34; You are a German; prove that you are not.&#34; I honestly believe the only reason why the Government deported him was that he had come into conflict with the mining companies in Queensland after discovering a valuable copper &#34; show.&#34; </para>

If Paul Freeman proved to the authorities that he was an American it would not prevent his deportation. The Government are determined to deport him in any case. If he proved he was not a German, the only difference would be that he would be deported to the country of which he proved that he was a citizen. </para>

                                <para>- Whether one nationality is more vicious than another is a different question. The point is whether an injustice is being done, not only to Freeman, but to other citizens. Many people were deported during the war, and many others will be deported now that the war is over. Not a man is safe while this system of persecution is permitted. Any honorable member who did not happen to be born in this country, and who &#34;misses the bus&#34; at the next election, would be just as liable to be deported as anybody else. The man who does not raise his voice in protest against this damnable system deserves deportation. I am actuated only by the desire to obtain justice for these individuals. There is no justice in the methods employed up to the present time. It is quite clear to those who examine the social status of the men who have been deported, keeping in mind the system introduced in other countries, during and since the war, that there is a concerted movement to deport people who are opposed to the prevailing economic system. </para>

All claims reaching the Department receive prompt attention. As the late Recruiting Committee cannot furnish a statement of outstanding claims, it has to be left to claimants to make application.

                        <para>.- In considering this Bill we are handicapped by the knowledge that the Government have forestalled the consent of the House by entering into certain negotiations and making appointments in connexion with an Institute of Science and Industry. It is but another example of the bad effect the use of the War Precautions Act has had, not only upon Ministers, but also upon Parliament itself. Everything is carried out by Executive act. Parliament is considered as nothing. It seems to me we shall need a new generation &#34;of Ministers, and possibly a new generation of legislators, before we rid ourselves of this virus of the Ministry desiring to do everything on their own - flouting Parliament, and, through Parliament, flouting the people. We are also handicapped by the fact that no scheme is set out in the Bill itself. There is practically nothing before honorable members beyond the fact that certain gentlemen are to be appointed to draw up and carry out some scheme for the formation of an Institute of Science and Industry. The scheme itself is not put forward by Ministers. They propose to hand over to certain directors, some of whom have already been appointed, the task of drawing up a scheme which will be acceptable to Parliament and to the country. The Government have not presented to the House any financial statement or told us how much the Institute will cost Australia. They have not in any way taken the House into their confidence, or stated how they will collaborate with the States, which already have big agricultural bureaux carrying out a similar class of work. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> made great use of the words &#34; co-ordination &#34; and &#34; co-operation,&#34; which seemed to me to mean in this case the squeezing out of the States and the Commonwealth doing everything on its own. In effect, the Government say that one man trying to find a road through a jungle has a better chance of success than half-a-dozen men would have. You cannot set one man to make a certain discovery. Great scientific problems are solved only by many minds working from different points of view to achieve the same end. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister has said that the Commonwealth Institute; by coordinating the work of the States, will have a better chance of solving these problems than will all the different States working independently. I doubt that very much indeed. Many years&#39; experience of science has shown that the big results are achieved by various minds working independently on the one problem. </para>

                    <para>After reading the Bill and the speech of the Minister, I am impressed with the fact that the principal services of this Institute are to be rendered to primary production. The very work which the Minister has emphasized is that which is now being carried on by the States. Many of the States have very big Departments, with well-equipped laboratories, and headed by distinguished men who have been very successful in working out problems in connexion with our primary industries, including the breeding of new varieties of wheat and the treatment of diseases in cattle. </para>

I do not know in what way the Commonwealth will be able to supplement the experiments which have been already made in that connexion. </para>

                    <para>I look upon the scheme represented by this Bill as flamboyant and impracticable. I have always found that the people who go the whole hog on education, and regard it as the beginning and end of everything, are divided into two classes - firstly, those who have not had the advantage of education; and, secondly, those who have been so overeducated that they are not able to make their living in the practical walks of life. So it is with science and technical education. Those men who are the greatest sticklers for technical and scientific education are those who have not had the advantage of training in technical schools or workshops, or those who have gone in for extra scientific education to such an extent that they are incapable of appreciating the commercial side of industrial enterprises. </para>

                            <para>- No. Some have regarded as a blot on the Bill the fact that the man who has been appointed  chairman  of directors is not a scientist. I regard that fact as a distinct advantage, because on a board of directors we want not so much scientists as organizers. The fact that the  chairman  of directors is not a scientist is the one good feature I have discovered in the scheme. </para>

                    <para>During the debate a good deal has been said about what Germany has done with the aid of science. The great commercial advance of that country has been ascribed to the use of science in industry. I differ altogether from that point of view. Germany became commercially great, not by reason of the scientific education of its workmen, but because it harnessed finance to industrial and business concerns. </para>

                            <para>- Almost every one of the scientific methods which Germany uses were discovered by other countries. The Germans saw the advantage of placing those methods at the service of their industries, and the Government, not only provided the money, but insisted upon the controllers of industries using science in their work. I find not one provision in the Bill for the harnessing of science to industry. In the country districts I have seen an old horse harnessed to a jinker with a few bits of twine; but in this scheme, not even to that flimsy extent is science harnessed to industry. As a preliminary step in this project, the Government should have said to the big industrial concerns, &#34;We are prepared to help you in your industry by placing science at your disposal, if you will do your part by providing some of the wherewithal.&#34; Under this Bill the Government adopt the very opposite policy. They propose to setup a big Institute, appoint directors at &#163;1,200 per annum, and spend money in ail sorts of ways; but in only one small clause of the Bill is provision made for industries to pay for the scientific aid to be provided by the Government. </para>

                            <para>- On the contrary, my observation has been that the money has been practically all spent before the Government, at the close of the financial year, ask Parliament for approval of the expenditure. That is what will happen in connexion with this Institute. Again, if grants are to be given for travelling scholarships, they must be given to cover a number of years. What is the good of saying that a scholarship has been granted for research for a period of ten years, if in the second year the payment of the money is to be subject to a parliamentary appropriation? Does the Minister expect that scientists trained in a university without relation to ordinary business, will make an immediate success when they become associated with a commercial enterprise, and attempt to graft business methods on their scientific training. Id a small way I am a captain of industry; that is to say, I am engaged in manufacture which requires a certain amount of scientific research. The big discoveries and improvements in industry are made little by little. No man can become associated with an industrial concern, and in a month, or even twelve months, put it on the high road to fortune. </para>

                            <para>- I can do so. I would remind honorable members that at the very forefront of .a recent number of <inline font-style="italic">Science and Industry,</inline> the journal of the  Institute,  there was set out as a big achievement on the part of the Advisory Council, its discovery of a substitute for tin plate.. My association with .a business in which, the use &#171;f tin plate is involved led me to .ascertain that their final conclusion was that the only .substitute for tin plate which they could nominate was a material, .the price of which was very much higher than even the enhanced price of tin during the war period. And this was placed before the people as a very great .achievement. The Advisory Council could have learned from a dozen different manufacturing establishments in Australia at the very outset of its investigations that the material it recommended would be suitable but for its price. It began, however, with the very ABC of the investigation of the subject, and, working from the bottom, prosecuted experiments which had been made long before by various private firms. </para>

                    <para>I recognise that in opposing a scheme of this kind one lays oneself open to the charge of being unprogressive, and of not being anxious to expand the industries of Australia. My objection to this Bill is that I see no future for a scheme based on the principles for which it provides. The Government should not have entered upon this project, nor should it have made appointments to the Institute without first consulting Parliament. In the second place, I see no evidence that the Government have endeavoured in any way to cooperate with the&#62; different States, which are already spending large sums on scientific research work in relation principally to our primary industries. </para>

We have already in the States adequate laboratories and many scientists carrying out investigations designed to assist our primary industries. It seems to me that the title of this Bill is a misnomer, and really a fraud, since, in framing it, there has not been any attempt to provide for the harnessing of science to industry. Doubtless, several scientists with  high  .degrees will be .appointed to the Institute, but not one of them will have had any experience of ordinary working conditions. Those of us who have had experience as workers in for controllers of factories know full well that big scientific discoveries are not made in a day. They represent gradual accumulations of minor discoveries, and the steady building up of small improvements. Unless we are going to get these chemists and scientists right into our factories, workshops, and chemical laboratories, no good will result from this Bill. If we put the scientists into private workshops and factories and called upon the industries benefited by their work to subscribe to the cost, the position would be different; but, as it is, we shall not  obtain  any advantage from the Bill. </para>

                    <para>I protest against this Bill, in the first place, because no definite scheme has been placed before us, and because we are asked to commit ourselves to an unknown expenditure in connexion with it. It is all very well for supporters of the measure to say that Parliament will have annually to appropriate the money necessary to provide for the maintenance of the Institute, and that, therefore, we shall have full control over its expenditure; but my experience is that, once a Parliament commits itself to such a scheme, it will not stop at an expenditure of &#163;10,000, &#163;20,000, or even &#163;50,000 per annum. We know how quickly a new Department grows. Every head of a Department wants to boom it, and to make it appear to be the most essential of all. A Department is no sooner created than the officer placed <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> charge of it requires a staff of secretaries, filing clerks, and others, and it speedily becomes a vast spending body. It is fastened on the people, and we are unable to get rid of it. Because the Government have not formulated a proper scheme, because they have not submitted a statement as to the cost which this scheme will involve, and also for the reason that they have not attempted in any way to provide for the extension of scientific research to the workshop and the factory, I am utterly opposed to this Bill. </para>

                        <para>.- While I am opposed to the motion for the second reading of this Bill, I give place to no honorable member in the belief that it is absolutely necessary to bring to bear on our primary and secondary industries the best scientific knowledge. I recognise that we shall have to improve our methods of business in order to hold our own in the fierce trade competition that must follow the war. We shall have to go, not only to Great Britain and to the United States of America, but particularly to Germany in respect of some matters, in order to learn the best system of conducting our industrial enterprises. I do not wish to be considered unprogressive, but I am opposed to this Bill, because I can see in it nothing more than a proposal for a useless expenditure of money. We are told that the object of this Institute is to stimulate production. With such an object we must all have sympathy. Honorable members, and the people generally, have again and again urged that we must increase our production in order to meet our war expenditure, and to balance the financial ledger; but this Institute will help us very little in that direction. </para>

                            <para>- That is so, but we have had some indication of what it is likely to do, and I can see nothing more in this Bill than an attempt to set up another Department which will be superimposed upon the scientific bureaux already carried on by the States. It is useless for the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> to tell me in a light and airy way that the work of this Institute and the State bureaux will be coordinated. As a member of the Public Accounts Committee I have learned of what has happened in connexion with schemes of this kind, and I know what will happen in this case. I am surprised that Ministers do not profit by experience. They do not seem to realize the rapidity with which Departments grow. We have seen an unnecessary Department established and rapidly assume vast dimensions. One may enter such a Department and find it impossible to fault it, yet it ought never to have been created. We have for instance the Prime Minister&#39;s Department. This is the only part of the Empire in which there is such a Department, and it is certainly an anomaly. Some one got on the blind side of Mr. Fisher , who apparently thought he would be justified in creating a precedent, and he set about establishing a Department of the Prime Minister. That Department is not wanted in Australia. All the work that it did even during the war, when the Prime Minister was certainly a busy man, could have been done very much better by means of temporary additions to the staffs of other Departments. </para>

                    <para>In regard to all these Government enterprises, the position is the same. Parliament is induced by Ministers to consent to the setting up of an establishment, and the expenditure on that establishment increases from year to year. Government factories are generally started without any satisfactory preliminary business investigations. Such a thing would never be done by, for instance, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. If a scheme is submitted to that company, it takes steps at once to secure the bast possible advice with regard to it, and once it has ascertained that it is likely to prove a sound and payable proposition, it sets to work upon it, with the result that within two or three years the shareholders get some return for their money. When we inquire into the position of a Government enterprise like the Small Arms Factory, we see that Parliament has not got what it intended, and that the expenditure upon it has grown beyond all anticipation. If ordinary business methods had been followed, if a thorough preliminary investigation had been made, we should have got what we wanted, and with much less expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members have indulged in the expression of a pious hope that the Institute will prove of great value, but we have had no concrete case showing that its establishment is likely to have an important bearing on any industry. We could get better results by devoting the best talent available to specific propositions. Could an Institute of this kind add anything to our knowledge of nodules in meat, or any other pest? The present organization has done little or nothing in this direction, except in a  perambulatory  sort of way. Of course, in the case of a pest like the fly, it would not matter what the cost of the investigation was so long as we got results; but we are not likely to get any &#34; forrader &#34; in the way that this Institute will probably act. It would be far better to pick out special subjects and allow the States and the Commonwealth together to devote the best talent obtainable to them. Professor Reid came out some time ago on behalf of the British Government to investigate matters concerning wheat, and, on request, devoted some attention to the fly pest, for which, he says, he has already discovered a remedy. Whether or not that remedy will prove efficacious, we are more likely to attain success in this and other similar directions by selecting particular subjects for investigation. Most inventions and discoveries do not come from organized or applied science, but from men who are practically engaged in the industries concerned, and who submit their ideas to the scientists for development. </para>

But, apparently, we are going to do much more than co-ordinate and co-operate ? The present Commonwealth Bureau has already sent out reports, and issues a monthly journal containing more or less interesting matter. The States, however, were doing all this kind of work, and, if I may say so, were issuing much better journals. </para>

As to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth,</inline> I do not think he is better qualified for a position of the kind than many men who could be found in Australia; besides, he has just left a Commonwealth position, and it would appear as though the Government were hunting for another for him. At a time like this, the Government ought to give Parliament some say  in matters of the kind, or, at any rate, conduct them openly, and allow for competition. </para>

                            <para>- That was a flagrant instance of the way in which the public interest was sunk amidst the squabbles of public Departments. But the quarantine business is not over yet. What about Tasmania and the Commonwealth? Tasmania, as a clean State, stood out for seven days&#39; quarantine, because that was the period agreed on at the November Conference. The Commonwealth, however, tried to compel Tasmania to accept the Commonwealth view, although the Commonwealth doctors know no more about the disease than do the State doctors. </para>

                            <para>- No ; but I am pointing out the position, and showing what fudge the Minister was talking about co-ordination. Ministers come down at a time like this and make statements in an airy way, when they ought to be discussing business. The time is most inopportune for the establishment of an Institute of the kind proposed. Unfortunately, our financial position, like that of Great Britain, and most other countries, is very critical. </para>

                            <para>- Show me how we are going to get it. All this maudlin talk at a time like this sickens practical people. It is imperative that the Government should be economical, and set their faces against any unnecessary expenditure, not because we do not want this Institute, and many other things, but because we cannot afford them. At the same time, the Government should have, what I am afraid they lack, enterprise and business acumen, so as to be prepared to take a proper risk in seizing an opprtunity to stimulate production. There are many ways in which this could, and ought to be, done, and if a little money were lost here and there, no blame would attach to the Government. </para>

                            <para>- Good heavens! Here is an honorable member asking me how the standardization of iron and steel can be brought about without an Institute of Science and Industry. Does the honorable member think the Broken Hill Company and the great steel concerns cannot take advantage of all the best knowledge existing in the world? Does the Colonial Sugar Refining Company go round holding out its arms for some one to come and help it? No; it employs and pays the best chemists good salaries. </para>

                    <para>I object, further, to the way in which this business was started. During 1916 the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> had a column or two in the papers on the subject of an Advisory Council of Science. Probably some one had caught him on the hop when he was busy, and obsessed him for the moment with the idea; but I do not suppose that even he at that time expected the scheme to develop in this way. Science at that time was very much in evidence. We were attributing the great success of Germany to her scientific activities, and science loomed large in the public mind. The war is over now. </para>

                            <para>- I stated earlier that I did not object to the application of science to industry. We should go to science, but the Government, in this Bill, are founding a body that will give us anything but science. It will give us reports that will lead nowhere so far as practical business is concerned. I want to see the proposal remodelled before I support it. Probably the Prime Minister never intended that the Advisory Council should develop into an Institute in this way without Parliament being consulted and everything being done above-board&#39;. There have been far too many instances lately to show how this Chamber is losing its grip of the purse-strings of the country. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> cannot even tell us what he expects to spend on the Institute. </para>

                    <para>This is another instance of the expenditure of money without parliamentary sanction. Not long ago we had a debate on the question of spending money on ships without parliamentary sanction. I tried very hard to catch your eye, sir, during the time allowed for that debate, because I wished to say that I considered that the Government had acted unconstitutionally, but that I could have overlooked it if, on the very first opportunity, they had admitted the fact to Parliament. Everybody knew when the contract for those ships was concluded, and it was the duty of the Government, before any question was put on the subject, to tell the House of the proposed expenditure. No Minister, however, took that course. When objection was raised, the Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> pointed to the fact that the House had adopted the Ministerial statement of policy. </para>

If Ministers had come to the House, as in duty bound, as the trustees of the public purse, and told the House that they had done things irregularly in England, but that they had been forced to that course because their actions had to be kept secret to prevent interference by the Shipping Ring, the House would have been satisfied, and we should never have heard anything of the motion for adjournment moved by the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd),</inline> which was so strongly supported. </para>

                            <para>- My contention is that we should have had a thorough understanding with the States; looked into the whole proposition with them, and seen what was best for the whole of the people of Australia, because, after all, it is the one taxpayer that keeps both authorities going. We sometimes forget that we are one agent and the States other agents for the same people. We should all look to the general interests of the community. If that had been done, we could have started a bureau on something like sound lines. One bureau is enough for Australia. We should have a good central bureau, and then we could have  our officers in all the States. That would secure co-ordination. </para>

                            <para>- If we have a good, sound bureau we do not need a lot of competition. Does the honorable member think that Western Australia is trying to outdo Queensland in knowledge of tick or prickly pear? As soon as any State finds the best remedy for a pest all the other States will adopt it, after its value has been proved. If we had one bureau, with a sub-department in each State, we could do all that the Minister expects to do by means of State and Federal bodies at very much less cost and in a far more progressive way. We should found our bureau on very different lines from those now proposed. Australia will not grudge the money so long as anything like satisfactory results are obtained. </para>

                    <para>I am so convinced that we are on wrong lines in this measure that I shall oppose the second reading. I want to see the Bill thrown out, so that we may get on to the right path. From a bureau such as I have outlined, people interested in industries who required assistance to work out their problems would be able to obtain assistance just as well as they could from six or seven bureaux. We are not starting on business lines, and we shall not succeed if we do not. We do not want our scientific men necessarily to be business men. We want them to be good at the subjects with which they have to deal, and we require a good organizing business head.

                            <para>- If that is the case, I am opposed to the proposal of the Government on the ground that it is altogether too big. If it is merely a question of co-ordinating the Departments of the States and the Commonwealth in regard to science and industry, we can do very much better than we shall do by means of this Bill. It is all very well to talk about what has been done in other parts of the world. But there is no evidence that we are starting our Institute in anything like the way that the Federal Institute was started in the United States of America. To me it does not matter what some conference may have determined. My objection is that there has never been a proper attempt made by the Federal authorities to get the States into line on this matter. </para>

                            <para>- When my honorable friend gets his speech properly corrected, doubtless I shall agree with him entirely. This Bill is not intended to sanction the creation of a Bureau of Science and Industry. It is a measure relating to a Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry, and, following their usual tactics, the Government have first created the Institute, and now come to Parliament to sanction their action. I am sick of this sort of business. The Government cannot blame its supporters if they speak out, and say that it is time this sort of thing came to a stop. I believe in the creation of a Bureau of Science and Industry, but I also believe in doing things decently and in order. This matter has not been brought forward in accordance with the best traditions of Parliament, and Ministers are asking their supporters to carry burdens which they ought not to be expected to carry. If the Bill is not put in its proper place for a time, until some better scheme is forthcoming, I shall vote against the motion for its second reading. </para>

                    <para>I am strongly of opinion that it is essential we should create an Institute upon the lines of similar organizations in America. But I believe it would be useless to create an Institute of this character to act independently, and to overlap the activities of the different State Departments. We have had many of these activities in existence for years, and they have accomplished excellent work. They struggled during their initial stages against prejudice of every kind, and many of them are only now overcoming that prejudice. Science, particularly as applied to our primary industries, has justified itself a thousand times over. We have been told that it is intended to co-operate with the States, and that all State activities, with this Institute as a nerve centre, are to be organized upon proper lines. I am sure that any such organization would produce results that, from a monetary standpoint, would justify a very large expenditure. But I ask the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> whether the co-operation of the States with the Commonwealth in these developments was not determined upon before this Department was created by the Commonwealth. </para>

I am pleased that there is an inclination in that direction in some of the States, but that circumstance does not remove any objection to the action of the Government in first establishing this Department, and afterwards coming to Parliament to justify its action. It is simply belittling the States, saying to them, &#34;We have launched this enterprise, and now we want you to co-operate with us.&#34; &#39; </para>

                    <para>Two or three years before he left public life that splendid Leader of this House for many years, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> was exceedingly anxious to see his ideas as to the creation of an institution of this kind, of which he was enamoured, come to fruition. Later on, the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> became fascinated with the same project. He told the people on several public occasions that he intended to develop a scheme at the proper time. In fact, on one of his days out, when he was having a good time, he said that he was prepared to justify a scheme that might develop to the extent of spending &#163;500,000 a year. I would not object to that amount of expenditure if, in the successive stages of its development, such an Institute would fully justify its existence. This may well happen ; but, for Heaven&#39;s sake let us do the thing decently, .and let us put an end to the Parliament and the country being continually committed to big schemes involving possible heavy expenditure without being consulted. </para>

                            <para>- First of all, I would settle with the States the matter of co-operation. The first steps towards that end were only taken by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> at the last Premiers&#39; Conference; when, upon the outbreak of influenza, there was a rush of business which caused it, and many other matters of importance, to be set aside. It was not showing sufficient respect and courtesy to the States, and to the Commonwealth itself, to submit a question of so much importance, practically without notice, to a conference that was unexpectedly interrupted. The scheme had been launched previously without seeking a conference with the States. </para>

                            <para>- The main question is whether we propose to do things in the proper way - by cooperating with the States. When they are treated in this way, can we wonder when we hear so much from Ministers about the hopelessness of co-operating with the States, or about getting the consent of the States to certain proposals? If the Institute is launched in its proper form, with the State Agricultural Bureaux, the Agricultural Schools, Workmen&#39;s Colleges, and other institutions all properly co-ordinated under it, the Commonwealth Institute, the central activity, may lead Australia excellently well in the application of science to industries, primary and secondary. One of the greatest requirements of the Commonwealth is the further development of chemistry in relation to the soil, and in regard to its application to manufactures. </para>

In order to get out of a difficulty he was allowed to remain there until the war was over. This man who made such a failure of the Northern Territory, and who has been ridiculed in both Houses of Parliament for years past, has now been sent abroad upon some mission. Is this true? !&#62; it true also that his expenses are being paid ? If he had been appointed to this Institute of Science and Industry it would have damned the whole business from A to <inline font-style="italic">Z.</inline></para>

As a poor man at the plough Professor Lowrie won his way to the University, but even after he had obtained his degree, and entered upon his profession, it took him years to remove prejudice from the minds of some of the farmers. </para>

                            <para>- Farrar was a university man who became a practical farmer, and if he had never done anything else but breed Federation wheat would still have been regarded as one of the greatest benefactors to this country. Things are different to-day. The foundations for higher scientific education have been laid, and farmers are ready to listen to scientists with the practical side of their education fully developed. But if they are expected to listen to the type of man that was administering the Northern Territory - if he is placed on the staff of the Institute of Science and Industry - then farewell to progress. </para>

                        <para>-It was no slip. It was specially designed to trap honorable members opposite. We do our work without exhibiting our mobility. Honorable members of the Opposition should not think, when they see honorable members on this side reserved, placid, and confident, and not throwing their arms about, that we are not accomplishing things. During the Prime Minister&#39;s absence of sixteen months, important things have happened. The war has terminated, and the actions of Parliament and the Departments should be made known to returning Ministers. </para>

                <para>During my somewhat extended occupancy of the position of  Deputy  Leader of the House, a position not sought by me, and one which I have no desire to continue to occupy, I have received from honorable members on both sides of the House nothing but consideration. I wish to openly and publicly acknowledge that, and, as I shall not be in a position to express that feeling in quite the same authoritative way later, I take this opportunity of doing it. Government members have realized, perhaps more than Opposition members have allowed themselves to do, some of the problems the Government have been dealing with, and the pressure put upon us, and they have extended to us a sympathetic consideration which we have appreciated. But to honorable members of the Opposition, whose function is to oppose and fight, I render a similar acknowledgment. I can imagine that they might have made the task of the Government more irksome, but during the strenuous period through which we have passed they have shown to me and other Ministers a courtesy that is all too rare in public life. </para>

                    <para>.- While the Acting Prime Minister has occupied the position of Leader of the House, I have got along with him very well. Members on this side have extended courtesy to him, and we have received courtesy in return. Although honorable members may disagree upon many matters, we should at least give each other credit for sincerity in the opinions we express. I support the request of my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs),</inline> that the speech of the Acting Prime Minister, an regard to the deportation of enemy aliens, should be made available in pamphlet form. It contains a statement of the principles which dominate the Government policy in that regard, and copies of the speech will be handy for distribution. The  deputy  leader of our party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> made a speech extending over less than half -an -hour in which he set out. reasons why a certain course should be followed, and I should be glad if the Government would arrange for a few copies of his speech, and the speech made by the Acting Prime Minister in reply, to be distributed. Honorable members would then be able to follow the complaints and suggestions made, and the answers thereto by the Government. </para>
