I received that request this morning, on my return to town, and have already had an interview with representatives of the Industrial Disputes Committee and the Seamen's Union. We discussed the question fully in all its many bearings, and as a result I am instructing the Controller of Shipping this afternoon to take steps to have convened another compulsory conference. </para>

Matters of this kind, to some extent, impede the taking up of land by returned soldiers. I can supply the honorable member at any time with full particulars. </para>

                        <para>- The matter of the disembarkation of troops has been under the consideration of the Naval and Military authorities for some time. An arrangement was made that disembarkation should take place at 9 a.m. and 2 p.m., and that if in any case it was found impossible to disembark troops by 2 p.m., the men should remain on board until the following morning. The. Military authorities state that they are not responsible for what happened on Saturday last, because the transports are wholly under the control of the Navy. Negotiations are now pending between the two Departments to prevent any recurrence of the trouble. An end certainly should be put to such a system. I think the original arrangement as to the hours of disembarkation is the only suitable one for this time of the year. "Where troops cannot be landed by 2 p.m. it is far better that they should remain on board until the next morning, rather than that they should be disembarked as they were in the instance referred to on Saturday night. </para>

As a matter of fact, we are prepared for construction to the boundary, but the starting point to Yass is not determined.

                    <para>- I would not have risen but for the extraordinary remarks of the honorable member under the guise of a personal explanation. I say in reply to those remarks, and by way of personal explanation, that the honorable member's primary question was, " Would the Government appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into certain matters?'' The answer of the Government to that question was " No." I then went further and explained why that answer was given. It was because we thought that it was a matter for the consideration of the States, and not of the Commonwealth. Then I said that the practice of submitting questions in the way adopted 'by some honorable members - and they are on both sides of the House - should be discontinued. I did not question the motives of the honorable member. I questioned the method adopted by him in advertising his political views. I say frankly and sincerely that I am sorry if I have hurt the honorable member's sense of propriety or injured his personal feelings, but I take it that the Leader of the House, which I temporarily am, has a perfect right to offer criticism, not as to the motives of an honorable member, but as to the methods adopted by him which, I think, are against the highest traditions of parliamentary procedure. </para>

                        <para>- The whole subject of the supply of jute goods to Australia is now under the consideration of the Government. Having some considerable knowledge of the present position, I can say, without hesitation, that the rumour the honorable member has heard has no foundation, so far as Government officials are concerned. There is a ring in regard to jute goods, but it happens to be in India; and I am sorry to say that it is operating at the present time detrimentally to the interests of the producer here. However, the whole position is receiving the serious consideration of the Government. </para>

                        <para>- In giving replies to questions, Ministers sometimes intimate that they will lay certain matter incorporated in the reply upon the table, - to save the time of the House. I take it that that matter is to be regarded simply as an answer to the particular question concerned, and not as a paper laid on the table of the House in the ordinary way. At this stage of the proceedings, when questions upon notice are being answered, an answer laid upon the table in a written form, for convenience, in the way I have described, cannot be made the subject of a motion " That the paper be printed." </para>

I have no wish to embarrass the Government by moving the motion, but the Acting Prime Minister and honorable members generally will realize, on reflection, that the public have a right to be protected against deceptive information. The Minister ought to have been able to give us a proper explanation, which he could make public. If the printing of this document is not in the interests of Australia- </para>

Prices at present are very high. A cablegram was recently despatched to the High Commissioner asking him to advise immediately supplies are available, and to quote quantity, grades, and prices. A reply has now been received, stating that Australian agents have been appointed. Supplies should, therefore, soon be obtainable through the ordinary trade channels. </para>

                        <para>For the information of ex-soldiers, the final account shows clearly in summary form all transactions, and thus fines are shown in the final account, even though (as in the majority of cases) the amounts of the fines had been recovered from the soldier's drawing rate in the field, thus merely reducing their spending in the past. It is not proposed to remit the fines now, as it would result in the soldiers fined suffering no punishment for offences which have, in many cases, largely reduced the value of their service, and placing such soldiers, upon discharge, on the same footing as soldiers who have committed no offence; in fact, they would generally have more money to draw upon discharge, because nearly all soldiers have spent the whole of their drawing rate abroad. </para>

                <para class="block">Honorable members will recollect that when the Bill which was designed to extend the operation of the War Precautions Act was before this Chamber, certain announcements were made by Ministers. It was definitely stated that, even though the War Precautions Act was to be extended for a further period, the Government would immediately take steps to inquire into the existing regulations with a view to seeing whether a number of them could not be repealed before the time for the expiry of the Act itself. During the recess we have acted upon that promise, and have examined quite a number of these regulations. As a result we found that we could repeal many of them, and we have acted accordingly. The commercial restrictions embodied in some of the other regulations which have been continued have been re moved as rapidly as the Government could remove them. It was also announced during the debate in the House that there would probably be a necessity to operate some of the regulations even beyond the period for which the War Precautions Act was extended, and a definite promise was given that wherever it was desired so to extend any regulations a measure with this object in view would be submitted to honorable members, . who would be afforded an opportunity of pronouncing judgment in each case. It has been found necessary that a number of the regulations should be continued until the Act itself expires. </para>

That has been the practice in not only this House, but other legislative assemblies. </para>

The Bill also gives authority for the making of certain agreements that have already been entered into by the Commonwealth with the Governments of the States and the several banks with reference to the past wheat crops, while it purports also to give authority to enter into a further agreement in respect of the 1919- 20 crop. Communications have passed between the States and the Commonwealth Government, and an agreement has been arrived at in regard to the latter crop'. </para>

                <para>The first part of the Bill deals with the dairy produce regulations. The object of the action taken by the Government in connexion with dairy produce was to control the supply of butter for consumption in the Commonwealth and the shipment of the surplus to the United Kingdom. The Imperial Government purchased the surplus produced during the period of the war and during one season on the termination of hostilities. This season will terminate on 31st August, 1920, and the Bill provides for the extension of the regulations up to that date. Early in 1917 it became apparent that supplies of fresh butter would not be sufficient to meet all requirements during the winter months, as production in certain of the dairying States appeared to be likely to fall below normal. It was decided, therefore, to form a Pool to provide against this expected shortage. Committees chosen by the dairying and commercial interests concerned were set up in the various States, with a central committee, of which' the Chief Prices Commissioner in Melbourne was the  chairman.  A conference was held in Melbourne, and another, later on, in Sydney, at which certain recommendations were made and approved by the Government. As a result, a quantity of butter was purchased by the Government, put into cool stores, and resold as required through the ordinary channels. By this means the consumers were protected against any danger of shortage of supplies, and at the same time prices were kept within reasonable limits. This Pool was again revived to provide for the winter of 1918, with similar satisfactory results. Although the object was to secure continuity of supplies, and not to make a profit, the transaction in connexion with the two Pools resulted in a substantial profit to the Government, after paying all charges incidental to the administration. Since the closing of the 1918 Pool the pooling system has been continued by the newly-constituted Commonwealth Dairy Produce Pool Committee. </para>
                <para>In 1917 all surplus butter up to 30,000 tons was purchased by the Imperial Government at 151s. per cwt. for 90-point butter, with1s. up or down for every point above or below, as the case might be. At a later stage, the Imperial authorities agreed to pay half the profit realized in Great Britain. The amount of such profit has now been realized and distributed among those entitled to receive it. In 1918 the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> effected a further sale of all surplus butter during the term of the war and for one year thereafter at 175s. per cwt. for 90 points, with1s. up or down. </para>
                <para>This contract will run until 31st August, 1920. The control of the whole of the butter supply was vested in a Committee, as it was absolutely necessary to provide for a sufficient local supply as well as establishing an equitable apportionment of the export trade. The Committee consisted of the Minister - who is chairman - a deputy chairman appointed by the Minister, three nominees of the Commonwealth Government, the Commonwealth Dairy Expert, two representatives for each of the States of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland in respect of the butter factories in those States, one representative for each of the States of South Australia and Tasmania in respect of the butter factories in those States, and one representative for each of the States of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland in respect of the cheese factories in those States. The representatives of the producers in the various States were elected' by ballot held on 14th October, 1918. Immediately upon the ballot being taken the Committee formerly in existence voluntarily retired and handed over to the newly-elected body. Early in 1919, as the season did not promise to be too satisfactory, a winter Pool for local supplies was also established, and butter for those States which have not a full supply is being supplied from this Pool. </para>
                <para>The pooling arrangement that applies to butter also applies to cheese, and an arrangement, similar to that existing in regard to butter, was made with the Imperial Government, the surplus having been sold for the same periods, 1917-18 and 1918-20, the prices obtained being as follows: - 1917- 18-90 pts., 9½d. lb., plusd. up to 94 pts. 83-89 pts., 9¼d. lb. 82 and under, 9d. lb. 1918- 20-90 pts., 10¼d.,plusd. up to 94 pts. 83-89 pts., l0d. lb. 82 and under, 9¾d. lb. </para>
                <para>The Pool arrangements as to cheese are managed by the Committee, to which I have already referred. All butter produced anywhere in the Commonwealth (except in Western Australia) is acquired by the Committee, with the exception of butter manufactured by small manufacturers, and butter sold direct to suppliers - which the Committee may exempt from the regulations. After the requirements of the Commonwealth and certain Eastern trade have been provided for, the remainder of the butter is stored until freight is available to enable it to be shipped to England. As the Australian requirements in winter exceed the production, a winter Pool is formed consisting of all butter graded 92 points or over. This is placed on the local market as required. Any surplus is transferred to the Imperial Purchase Account. If the quantity stored in the winter Pool is insufficient for local requirements, the butter purchased on Imperial account is drawn upon. </para>
                <para>The method of finance is for the butter factory to supply butter and obtain a certificate of an official grader and a storage warrant. On production of these, with an invoice, to the Commonwealth Bank, the factory is paid. Arrangements are made by the Commonwealth with the Commonwealth Bank to meet all claims made under the regulations. </para>
                <para>Thus the regulations involve: - </para>

                </list>
                <para>As the season in relation to which the sale to the Imperial Government has been made does not terminate till 31st August, 1920, it is necessary to continue the operation of the regulations, together with so much of the War Precautions (Prices) Regulations as is required to enable the price of butter to be controlled, until that date, and thereafter to have authority to make the necessary financial adjustment of the Pool's operations. As I have already stated, the Pool's activities apply also to cheese, which is dealt with in substantially the same manner as butter. </para>
                <para>It will give some idea of the quantity handled by the Dairy Produce Pool Committee if I read the figures showing the butter and cheese purchased for 1917-1918 and 1918-1919, remembering that the latter figures are only up to the 30th June, and do not represent the products of the whole season : - </para>

                <para>The next important activity is that relating to wool and sheepskins. When negotiations were completed in December, 1916, for the sale to the British Imperial Government, through the Commonwealth Government, of the balance of the Australian wool clip for the season 1916-1917, it became necessary to bring into being an organization for the carrying out of this huge transaction. To this end the War Precautions (Wool) Regulations were promulgated in Statutory Rule No. 322 of 1916. Under these regulations was appointed a controlling body of nine persons (including a nominee of the Commonwealth Government) styled " The Central Wool Committee." </para>
                <para>Provision was also made for the appointment of a subsidiary Committee in each State, such Committees to have the supervision of matters of detail within their own State, but in all matters of policy and general administration to be subject to the direction of the Central Wool Committee, the sole executive body. The <inline font-style="italic">-personnel</inline> of the Central and State Wool Committees is representative of the various branches of the wool industry in the following ratio: - 2 wool-growers; 3 wool-sellers; 1 wool-buyer; 1 manufacturer; 1 scourer or fellmonger. </para>
                <para>In addition, the Central Wool Committee has a Government nominee, who acts as chairman. Prior to the close of the 1916-17 season the sale was extended to the season 1917-18, and has since been further extended, the present position being that the disposal of the wool clip to the Imperial Government under the existing arrangements will terminate on the 30lh day of June,' 1920. </para>
                <para>As an indication of the magnitude of the wool purchase scheme, the following figures are given : - </para>
                <para>From the initiation of the wool scheme to date, the number of bales of wool appraised under the direction of the Central Wool Committee totals 5,008,816. Of this quantity, 164,598 bales were purchased by Australian woollen and wool tops manufacturers, who have priority of selection of their requirements before shipments are made overseas. </para>
                <para>In order that wool-scouring works, fell.mongeries, and the re-classing section of the wool industry should not suffer as a result of the sale of the clip, special arrangements were made with the Imperial Government, whereby sufficient wools were to be set aside for scouring or re-classing on their account. The number of bales so treated to date is : - </para>
                <para class="block">
                    <graphic href="088331191907022_15_5.jpg" />
                </para>
                <para class="block">The amount of £113,425,488 has been received from the Imperial Government to date, and as the estimate for the season 1919-20 is from £45,000,000 to £50,000,000, the wool and sheepskins transactions with the Imperial Government, administered by the Central "Wool Committee, should approximate £165,000,000 sterling, including payments to wool -selling brokers for distribution to wool-growers for settlement of scouring and re-classing accounts, and to cover other expenses incidental to the scheme. </para>
                <para>As already mentioned, the present contract will terminate on the 30th day of June, 1920, but this date will not see the end of the functions of the Central and State Wool Committees. Although we keep the regulations in force up to the dates I have specified, authority will have to be given to the respective Committees, as provided in the Bill, to wind up their respective businesses as in  the case of an ordinary liquidation. </para>

                        <para>- New Zealand has no duty on sugar. With the exception of New Zealand, no country in the world has been nearly so favorably situated in the matter of sugar as Australia has been during the past few years. Honorable members know what is the accepted policy of the Commonwealth, 'and I think that we can congratulate ourselves that our foresight in respect of that policy has put Australia in such a position. However, I have no wish to be led into a discussion of that policy. </para>

                <para>In 1914 the Australian crop was sufficient to meet consumption, which was then estimated at about 265,000 tons, but in April, 1915, it became evident that a serious shortage was likely to occur in the supplies of sugar, as, owing to the effect of the drought, the Queensland cane crop was estimated to yield a much diminished quantity. Moreover, it appeared, owing to the conditions created by the war, that a serious shortage of sugar supplies was likely to arise, and, therefore, it became essential to make provision for Australian supplies. On the 26th June, 1915, the first agreement was made with the Queensland Government, and on the 6th July, 1915, the first agreement was made with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited. The price originally paid for raw sugar had been under £14, but by the 1915 agreement £18 was paid. In 1917 the price was raised to £21 per ton, at which price it still continues. The retail price, 3½d. per lb., for 1A sugar was fixed on the 17th January, 1916, and still continues. The price of £21 per ton, fixed by the 1917 agreement, has materially stabilized the sugar cane industry. The consumption, however, is now increasing, and is approaching 285,000 tons annually - equal to about 128 lbs. per head of population. The annual turnover of the sugar in Australia represents about £8,000,000 sterling. The price of refined sugar in Melbourne is £29 7s. <inline font-style="italic">6d.</inline> in America £46, and in England £57. </para>
                <para>I have shown all the different elements of the scheme by which sugar is supplied and controlled, and how prices are fixed. The only thing necessary in order to keep our powers in regard to sugar in existence to the 30th September, 1920, the date on which the Queensland contract expires, is the fixing of prices, and that is the only point dealt with, so far as sugar is concerned, in this Bill. </para>
                <para>The next matter I wish to refer to is flax. Prior to the war, Russia supplied no less than 80 per cent, of the world's output of flax fibre. With the . Baltic provinces and the flax-growing districts of Belgium and Northern France in German hands, the shortage of flax fibre among the Allied nations had by the middle of 1917 become very acute. The Imperial Government offered, and is still offering, special inducements to farmers in the British Isles to increase the cultivation of this crop, recognising that it was extremely undesirable that the Empire should remain dependent upon outside sources of supply for the raw material of such an essential industry both in peace and war. On the advice of the Advisory Council of Science and Industry here that flax could be successfully grown in many parts of Australia,' the Commonwealth Government entered into an agreement with the Imperial Government in the latter part of 1917, whereby the latter agreed to purchase the fibre from the 1918 flax crop at £170 per ton. The Commonwealth Government then appointed a Flax Industry Committee under War Precautions Regulations to carry out a scheme pf development, and guaranteed the Australian farmer £5 per ton for  unthreshed  flax of standard quality. Through the Committee's efforts the area under flax was increased from 300 acres in 1917 to 1.400 acres in 1918. This crop is now being treated at various mills in Victoria, to which State the first year's efforts were necessarily confined,  owing  to the lack of .time and. seed at the Committee's disposal. The cessation of hostilities has not, however, ended the difficulty of the British linen trade to obtain its raw material, but has rather accentuated it, as the world's stocks of linen and other flax fabrics had become practically depleted, and moreover, the conditions in Russia were, and still are, such as to postpone indefinitely the restoration of agricultural and commercial activities in that country. On the Committee's advice the Commonwealth Government has guaranteed £6 per ton for flax grown in 1919, and has accepted the British Government's offer to purchase the resultant fibre on the same terms as before, viz., £170 per ton. To enable the Government to carry out the commitments under this guarantee both in regard to the purchase and treatment of the flax and to the disposal of the resultant products, it is necessary to provide for the continuance of the powers and functions of the Flax Industry Committee as at present held under War Precautions Regulations. The area sown this year is between 2,000 and 3,000 acres, and the estimated, value of the products that will be obtained from this crop is, with a normal season, about £50,000. Considering that the value of flax products imported annually into Australia is, approximately, £500,000, the desirability of encouraging the cultivation of this crop must be apparent. In addition to the area grown commercially,, the Flax Committee is conducting a number of experiments either on its own behalf or in conjunction with the Agricultural Departments of the various States. </para>
                <para>The position is that we find ourselves bound by the compact with the Imperial Government, and we have given guarantees in connexion with the 1919 crop. It is, therefore, essential to continue the War Precautions Regulations dealing with this matter, and continue the powers of the Flax Industry Committee to deal with the obligations to ' which we are already committed. The Bill purports to confer that power. </para>
                <para>The final matter dealt with in the Bill is wheat. The commencement of what is known as the Wheat Scheme was due primarily to the shortage of freight caused by the war. At the inauguration of the scheme farmers were in bad circumstances owing to a recent drought, and to the fact that the record crop following the drought could not be disposed of overseas owing to freight shortage. The Wheat Scheme was devised in order to overcome, as far as possible, the freight difficulty, and to insure that all growers should have an opportunity of participating equally in the net returns of overseas business. In order to carry out the scheme, a Wheat Board was appointed, of which the Prime Minister, the Right Honorable W. M. Hughes, was the  chairman,  and the other members were the Ministers for Agriculture, respectively, representing the following States: - New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia, and representatives of the growers were added at later dates. The States of Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia have legislated to place the Wheat Pool on a statutory footing, and New South Wales has undertaken to do so. </para>
                <para>It was decided to pool all wheat for the purposes of shipment, local sales, and realization, there being local Pools in each State for local sales, and a general Pool for oversea realizations. </para>
                <para>As regards the 1915-1916 crop, an agreement was made between the Commonwealth, the States, and the banks, whereby the banks agreed to provide funds ip anticipation of realization. The moneys received on realization were agreed to be placed with the banks, and applied by them in settlement of the advances. Each State Government which was a party to the agreement guaranteed to make good its liability to the banks, and, in addition, the Commonwealth gave a guarantee that each State Government concerned would make good its liability. </para>
                <para>For the 1916-17 Crop:- There was no formal agreement as in the case of the 1915-16 crop, but the financial arrangements were made through the Commonwealth Treasury and the Commonwealth Bank. </para>
                <para>For the 1917-18 Crop:- A similar agreement to that made as regards the 1915-16 crop was entered into. The Commonwealth and States agreed to guarantee advances to the growers to the extent of 4s. per bushel f.o.b. (on f.a.q. basis) - the liabilities of States and Commonwealth in respect of those advances being - <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> State Governments are responsible for 3s. ; (6)' in each State the responsibility for the difference between 3s. and 4s. f.o.b. (on f.a.q. basis) is to be borne equally by Commonwealth Government and the Government of such State. </para>
                <para>For the 1918-19 Crop: - A similar agreement to that made as regards., the 1915-16 crop will be entered into, but in respect of this agreement it is desired that there should be statutory authority for the Prime Minister to enter into the agreement on behalf of the Commonwealth. Meantime action has been taken on the assumption of the agreement being entered into. </para>
                <para>The price guaranteed for this crop is, in New South Wales, 4s. per bushel delivered at country railway stations, and as regards the other three States 4s. 4d. per bushel, less rail freight  from point of delivery to seaboard. The responsibility is apportioned thus : - <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> To the State Governments for 3s., plus all charges, including handling charges, rail freight, administration expenses, interest, and any cost due to calamity or pest damage. (6) Equally between the State (in each State) and the Commonwealth Government - the difference between 4s. 4d., less rail freight, and 3s. </para>

                        <para>- The task of the Wheat Board has been of great magnitude, not alone as regards the financial transactions involved, but also in connexion with the transport, overseas of such vast quantifies. Wheat is a low-priced commodity, worth here only a penny a pound. Payments made to growers and to meet expenses have reached a total of £101,250,000. The problem of finance, however, is only one of those with which the Pool management has had to contend. During the operations of the scheme there has been received for realization 468,000,000 bushels, or 13,430,000 tons, to be held for local sale or for over- &gt; seas shipment. In these circumstances, storage arrangements on a most unusual scale have had to be made by the States, and the Wheat Board has been confronted with a task of the utmost seriousness to provide freight. .Sales overseas by the Board have amounted to 6,050,000 tons, and of this quantity there has been shipped 5,200,000 tons. Allowing for local consumption to the end of the year, we have still for sale 2,000,000 tons. Advances have been made, however, against the wheat, whether sold or not, with the result that the Board's overdraft at the present time amounts to £18,300,000. </para>

                <para>When we look over the great activities carried out by the Commonwealth during the period of the war, we have reason to be grateful to all those business men, and others connected with production, who gave such material assistance to the Government in enabling our industries to be carried on. These activities were due solely to the war. The Government intervened only on account of war necessities, and, as the result of the organization of these industries material assistance was given . to the Empire at a most critical time. The result of the operations has been to enable production to be carried on steadily throughout Australia during the most trying time in our history. Seeing that this was successfully accomplished by the advice of those gentlemen who gave up unlimited time for no remuneration at all, and actuated solely by a patriotic desire to help their country, we may well, at the conclusion of the war, express our gratitude to them, and our deep sense of thankfulness that we had in Australia such men to help us to carry the war to a successful conclusion. </para>

                    <para>.- I am rather surprised that this motion is being allowed to go through so quietly. It was impossible to follow the Minister in his long address, but the point I wish to emphasize is that, if this and similar measures on the notice-paper are allowed to go through, extending for one year the operations of certain actions of the Government under the War Precautions Act and other authorities, there is nothing to prevent them from being extended for twenty or even fifty years. Once we admit the principle, there is absolutely nothing to prevent the Government from coming down with an additional Bill extending the censorship, for instance, for another five or ten years. I am one of those who believe that the War Precautions Act itself was illegal in many respects. If it is possible now to do these things under the authority of separate Bills brought before this Parliament, I submit that the Government could have obtained their authority previously in a similar manner. Why was that course not followed? I shall hot debate this motion further than to say that I can see very grave danger in passing the Bill, because I believe that the Government can use it as a precedent for taking similar action regarding all the powers they assumed under the War Precautions Act and its regulations. </para>

                            <para>- There are several paragraphs in the Ministerial statement about demobilization, and I shall refer at some length to the Government plot in that connexion. There are paragraphs concerning the unsold portion of the wheat, and the metal markets. The actions of the Government in that regard will, no doubt, come in for considerable criticism from their own supporters, if they have not already arrived at a decision, in the interests of themselves at the next elections, that there should be unity. </para>

                    <para>At the end of the literary paragraphs, if I may so call them, there is a list of measures which the Government can have no intention whatever of attempting to pass, if we may observe the signs of the times, and the remarks of gentlemen like <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alexander</inline> Peacock and others, who say that a general election is imminent, and that they must be ready, " as they never know what may happen." That was the statement made the other day at the meeting of the National Federation. </para>
                    <para>I propose, first, to speak about the Federal regulations, and, in any criticism of the Government this afternoon, I shall not make many statements of my own, but shall bring before the House and the Acting Prime Minister statements by members of his own party. Take the regulations drawn up by the would-be autocrat, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> M. Higgins, approved by the would-be autocrat the Prime Minister, and tolerated by the would-be autocrat the Acting Prime Minister.. The effect of these regulations is to play into the hands of the big companies, and to punish the small producers. That appears to be the policy of the Government, and of a majority of their supporters. Take, for example, the export of ore, and the Federal embargo upon it. The testimony which I have here is not that of a Ministerial supporter - it comes from an opponent, in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones,</inline> the Queensland Minister for Mines, who, in an interview of recent date, said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The Federal regulations had had exactly the effect predicted - the small producers had no alternative but to sell their ores to one of the few large Australian mining and smelting companies on these companies own terms. During the period of the war, £42 on each ton of copper in one transaction was taken by the smelting company for smelting treatment and realization in London. Even after every allowance for war increases, £42 per ton of copper was far too much to take from producers for realization costs. The unsatisfactory condition existed not only with regard to copper, but also with regard to silver lead ores, there being one smelting company which, under the regulations, practically got a monopoly in Australia of the purchase of silver lead ores from small producers. Again, a case in point was that a parcel of ore containing a little over 6 tons of lead was paid by the company for the silver lead in the ore, after deductions, £105 10s. The metal market value of the lead and silver on the day of purchase was £200 10s. Thus it would be seen that £95 was taken by the company for treatment, realization, and profit. </para>

                    <para class="block">The small producer has been sacrificed for the big man, and yet the National Caucus meeting, which was held in secret in our parliamentary buildings, on 24th June last, carried a resolution expressing its hearty approval of the admirable manner in which the Acting Prime Minister and his colleagues had administered the affairs of Australia. This resolution was seconded by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Corser,</inline> of Queensland, who, no doubt, called for three cheers for the Government, or, at least, felt inclined to do so: <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones,</inline> the Queensland Minister for Mines, proceeded - </para>

                        <para>The Federal regulations were, and are, more keenly felt in Queensland than elsewhere. They deprived the producers of a considerable proportion of the value of their product, which they justly should receive. The case of the molybdenite producer was harder even than the copper producer. No less than £63 10s. per ton of 00 per cent. ore was surrendered to the Commonwealth agents. Dalgety and Company were the sole agents appointed by the Commonwealth. </para>

As a matter of fact, our production of rare metal for one year of the war' was 513 tons, comprising 11,000 bags, and it cost £18,000 to hand this quantity over to the British Government. . The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> promised an alteration, and succeeded in giving the producer a slight increase by paying for the metal at the place of production, and displacing one monopoly to create another, and that not a State one. The Thermo Company replaced Dalgety and Company. Dalgety's, at least, were agents, whereas the Thermo Company were large mine owners and producers, and on that company the small producers had to rely. </para>

Other countries and other Dominions were getting a better price. Our wool was sold at 15½d., but it was now worth 120 per cent. more in the open market. Our best butter was sold at 178s. a cwt., while Irish superfine butter was now. sold under a just concluded contract at 263s. a cwt.

The sale room was thronged to its utmost capacity, buyers having literally to fight their way for seats. The spectators included numerous Australian and New Zealand soldiers who are undergoing a wool course at Bradford, and who were intensely interested. The sale was a very protracted one owing to farthing bids being accepted. Many of the buyers would prefer1d. advances in bids above 20d. per lb. </para>

                            <para>- The offence of the Government merits the use of a term so much stronger that I thought the term "plot" would be regarded as permissible. But, as exception has been taken to it, I will say that the unworthy arrangement by means of which the Government endeavoured to keep our soldiers in the Old Country merits our censure. I have obtained from very good authority the rate at which our soldiers were being sent from London during December of last year and January and February of the present year. I learn that in December last 13,305 men were demobilized, that in January the number was13,562, and that in February it was 5,387. This accounts for a total of 32,254 men in three months, or an average of about 11,000 per month. It seems to me that this was a deliberate attempt on the part of the Government to keep our soldiers in the Old Country over the next election. </para>

                            <para>- I have no doubt that the revolt of the Canadians also influenced the Government in their action'. As I mentioned before, a defeated candidate for the House of Representatives told me that he was defeated because " Billy did not stand to me with the soldiers' votes." I do not attempt to say precisely what he meant. But it is a curious thing that at the elections any candidate from this side of the chamber who had a majority of only 500,' in the absence of the soldiers' votes, was defeated. It has since been explained to me by a soldier who assisted a presiding officer overseas that the ballot-papers of our. men at the Front were put into a square-shaped envelope, which was gummed only on one side, so that it was thus possible, by crumpling up the envelope, to extract the ballot-paper. </para>

                            <para>- What explanation have the Government for the instructions which they gave to the authorities in London not to bring our soldiers back ? I apprehend that the Acting Prime Minister may furnish some explanation, although he at one time denied that any such instructions had been issued. What happened was this: The soldiers in the Old Country were revolting against being kept there. This circumstance got to the ears of various people, and the correspondent of certain Australian daily newspapers took the matter up. On Tuesday, 25th February last, the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> published a cable message saying, " Australia cannot take back her men because the Department is not ready." On Wednesday it published another cable message, in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Keith</inline> Murdoch declared that there was a ' ' strange insistence of the Melbourne Departments that demobilization must accord with employment at Home." The article in which these cables appeared was published under the headings " Back to Aussie," " Deliberate policy of delay," " Can Australia absorb men," " Strong pressure would get ships." The Acting Prime Minister on 27th February said that these cables were " a gross misrepresentation, founded on either ignorance or malice." That was a very strong statement to make, but. it was only in keeping with other assertions by the honorable gentleman when he desires to destroy an argument or to cast doubt upon the authority of any statement made against the Government. </para>

Mr. Keith</inline> Murdoch proceeded to quote General Monash' s speech as follows: -  " What is more, a great majority of the men now in camp won't be able to find employment until raw materials are obtained. The carrying of the men and the raw materials must go hand in hand. This is a matter of high policy, and you can take it definitely that the actual period of transport is likely to spread over a period of twelve months, so that if the first man gets away in February, 1919, the last won't go before February, 1920, not because of the fact that shipping is scarce, but because of the inability of Australia to absorb the men." </para>

What is more, how did he obtain the names of these mothers of soldiers? Were the authorities of the Defence Department in league with the Prime Minister to defeat the Australian Parliamentary Labour party at the polls, and to keep his Government in office? If they were not, how did he obtain these names? If I, or any other honorable member, asked the Defence Department for the names of the mothers of all Australian soldiers, would I be supplied with them? Then, again, one might very well ask, "Who paid for the printing and posting of the circular ?

                        <para>Sydney, Sunday. - <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans,</inline> Commissioner in New South Wales under the Commonwealth War Service Homes Act, said to-night that he was severing his connexion with the Commission in disgust. " The War Services Homes Act of December, 1918," he said, " was passed to provide machinery for the erection of 100,000 war homes and for expenditure placed at £50,000,000. Applications from soldiers desirous of taking advantage of the Act poured in. There were soon 2,000 in hand. The number to-day is about 3,000. Every application has been hung up; every applicant has been utterly disappointed. We have done nothing except tell these people to ' wait ' or ' call ' again. In most cases it was pathetic; in many it was tragic. There is not even a valuer or a building surveyor - not a single technical officer. We have been aimlessly marking time. The position now is , that under the scheme launched at the beginning of the year nothing has been done in New South Wales except to receive applications. Not one home has been built, nor one purchased. I feel that I have been fooled and that soldiers are being fooled. I will have nothing to do with it." </para>

Sustenance payments now reached £10,000 a week. But to pay a man sustenance and to repatriate him into a place in civil life were two widely different things. Men were being sent to shire councils who were spending grants obtained from the Government. They were making a few roads and drains; but at best that was only temporary labouring work, and, after a time, the men would be again out of employment. That was the paltriest sort of repatriation. Vocational training was not satisfactory, judged by its results in obtaining work for men when trained. Men were being taught wool-sorting and wool-classing, though it was doubtful if the wool industry could absorb them. Eighty-five per cent. of the wool purchased by the British Government was to be exported in its greasy state. Members of the Australian Imperial , Force were being trained in different phases of the wool business in Bradford. Would positions be found for them on their return, or would their lot bo the same as those taught electroplating in Melbourne? Sixty-nine men were trained, but only twenty-five were able to find positions. Returned men were taught branches of engineering, but, he believed, the Victorian Railway Department, which' might have been expected to help at a time like this, had not yet employed one of the trainees. </para>

What is the reason for the secret conference now being held in Melbourne? Whoever heard of delegates being asked to come to this conference? Who appointed them? I notice there are six from each State. Did the farmers have anything to do with their appointment? I find that the only plank of any importance before the conference yesterday was that of preferential trade, and it was postponed until the return of the Prime Minister ; and the only two resolutions that seem to' have been agreed to unanimously embodied the agreement of the conference on a party name, and declared their loyalty to the Empire. </para>

                        </quote><para>As my time is nearing a conclusion. I am obliged to hurry, but I would say to honorable members of the House who are supporting the Government that they have no excuse for voting against my amendment. It may mean the defeat of the Government if it is carried, but there are fifty-two members on the Ministerial side to twenty-three members of the Opposition, so that honorable members on the Government benches can oust the Government and put another in its place if there is a sufficient majority to carry the amendment. There is no reason why we should change positions in the House. Let honorable members form their Government on the other side, and they will get reasonable support from this side, provided they bring forward legislation which honorable members on the Opposition believe to be in the interests of the Commonwealth. I cannot see why certain honorable members should continue to support the Government. What would the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pigott)</inline> say to his constituents ?

Preferential voting, which, the Government passed in order to keep them in power, will be their salvation.  Colonel Knox,  who got a party nomination for Corangamite, was defeated. Honorable members need not mind if they  do not get the Government's nomination. They will be better without it. Victory will be an easy matter for them with preferential voting. But they must be prepared to show that they are opposed to the maladministration of the Government by supporting the amendment which I now move. - </para><quote>

                            <para>. - I have had some little acquaintance with want of confidence motions, but I have never before heard one proposed by a Leader of an Opposition or his  deputy  with the galleries so empty and to so thin and listless a House. Evidently, honorable members generally take not the slightest interest in the amendment moved by the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs),</inline> and see quite clearly its transparent and theatrical nature. I was rather amused at the mingled terms of invitation and threat which, adorned the honorable member's peroration - if it can be dignified by that name. First of all, he endeavoured to woo some of the staunchest Nationalists of Australia, present or absent, in the hope that, like our ill-fated parent in the Garden of Eden, they would listen to the temptation of the serpent. It is perfectly plain to honorable members on this side of the House that, notwithstanding all the disadvantages there may be in continuing to support the National Government, they are not likely to avoid them by facing the sudden death which would be their fate if they supported the honorable member. </para>

The speech of the honorable member for Capricornia, as his <inline font-style="italic">locum tenens,</inline> illustrates what an industrious recess he 'has passed. Ministers thought they were leading the most irksome time of any members of the House, but the time the honorable member for Capricornia has spent- in ransacking the dust-bins of rumour and gossip, in collecting the jargon of the constituencies and the press, proves that he must have lived days of perspiration, labour, and anxiety. But all that the honorable member has shown as the result of his unexpected industry, which blossoms only in Opposition, and. was not apparent when he was occupying this bench- </para>

I am dealing with him only as a press propagandist, and I say again, after care and thought in the examination of the problem,, that the statements he made, upon which the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition relied, in regard to the demobilization policy of the Government, were as false as they were malicious. . There are men in this House who can quote from first-hand knowledge, superior to my own, what took place in London during November, December, January, February, and March. If the House is sufficiently interested to continue the debate, I would ask the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Burchell)</inline> to tell the facts as he knows them, as a man who was on the demobilization staff, well acquainted with the intentions of General Monash, the chief of the demobilization staff, and well acquainted , also with the way in which the civil administration, under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> linked up with that staff. He can tell his own story to the House. He can tell, also, the difficulties which were encountered by the demobilization staff in securing shipping, and bow those difficulties were overcome, much to the advantage of the Australian artisan soldiers' who equipped our ships, and much to the disadvantage of certain militant trade unionists of Great Britain, who struck at the critical time and prevented the shipments of our men from leaving. </para>

Unfortunately, I am not like the honorable member, who gets muddled while trying to deal with three or four at once. i do not know that, after all, it is necessary for the Government to spend much time on the statements that have been made by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition. He complained very much that the Ministerial statement, to which he is endeavouring to attach an amendment, is a long one. That is true. A number of other adjectives might be applied to it. It is a frank one, it is a. necessary one, it is an informative one, it is an educative one. Parliament, instead! of complaining of the length of it, should study, not merely its quantity, but its quality, and all that it tells to both sides of the House. </para>

The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition complained, for example, in submitting his amendment that we have not laid the Peace Treaty on the table. We have not. We have not got it, and we say so in the statement made to Parliament. We tell Parliament that the information at the disposal of the Government is insufficient to warrant the introduction of the consideration of the terms of peace. As soon as we get them, or are in possession of information to enable us to define exactly what they are, they will be brought to Parliament for the determination of Parliament, as we indicate in our statement. </para>

If my honorable friend reads again, and endeavours to get the truth and not merely selected facts to punish the Government with, he will see that many of the vital modifications have never yet been published. In the original publication - which was given by Reuter to the world by the wish of the British Government, and of which we got only a copy - there were huge gaps relating to the indemnity and the economic conditions which have never yet been filled in by the published records of the Treaty. I say frankly to my honorable friend that we have no authoritative information that would enable us to place the paper on the table of the House. The moment we get it it will be laid on the table for the information of honorable members and the country. </para>

If he is guessing in his sleep, or if his mind is still filled with the visions of the war period, I ask him to believe that, so far as we are able to judge from what is published, the statesmen of all the Nations engaged in that Conference have done their best to settle the most difficult problem that ever was thrown upon the shoulders of mortal men to settle. It is very easy indeed for us to sit, 12,000 miles away from the theatre of debate, and criticise the determinations of the Conference. Wise men will hold their tongues until they are able to get the whole thing in perspective and proportion. When that is possible this Parliament, with its ordered and considered opinion, can proceed to decide whether the signatures of the Australian Ministers attached to that Treaty shall be ratified by the deliberate vote of its members. </para>

He first of all coupled me with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Higgins as three of the would-be autocrats of Australia. A man in office in the troublous times from which, I trust, we are now emerging, is called all sorts of terms. I was called by some members of the Government party, as reported in the press, a bully. I was called by another group of men, who should be qualified to know, "too weak-minded to hold office." The only comfort I had was that both statements could not be true. Whatever contemporary opinion may be, or whatever the opinion of posterity, if we are ever to have one, I am content to say that I am going on doing the job that caine to me accidentally, and doing it as well <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> I am able. The Ministers associated with me in this task are doing exactly the same, and doing it with more than measurable success - better, I venture to say, Than my honorable friend opposite would have done it if he had stayed in office. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> disagrees with a great deal which has been done by the Government. But <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Higgins laboured with Government after Government, and Minister after Minister, in the pursuit of a policy which was perfectly definite, and which was of a two-fold character. That policy was produced by the Prime Minister himself, and will be indorsed by the public opinion of this country. The main purpose of his metal policy was to place under the control and direction of the Allies, through Britain, the chief forces of munitions development in this country for the period of the war. Surely nobody will deny the rectitude and wisdom of such a policy as that? The second plank in that policy was that, during the period of the war, Australia should work up the raw metal materials into manufactured articles, as far as she could do so. That meant the encouragement of new industries, and when the Tariff is introduced, my honorable friend will hear from the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> some record of the work done in establishing and stabilizing those industries which arose during war time. </para>

                    <para>As to wool, it is so very easy to be wise after the event and after hostilities have closed. But when our wool was sold during the Prime Minister's absence, and with the consent of his colleagues in Australia, almost every pastoral industry arose and said, " God be thanked." The men here who know that industry far better than I do, realize that but for that second sale to the Imperial authorities at the 15½d. flat rate, the financial condition of Australia, and of all our great pastoral-producing interests, would have been seriously jeopardized during the remainder of the war. To say that we should now break contracts because the war has closed is surely not the spirit of a British community. If the pastoralists came to the Bar of this House and asked us to cancel the sale on the ground that they could secure higher prices for their wool, I would say that this Parliament should frown down the suggestion. </para>

Quite unexpectedly, a body which is supposed to be hostile to some of the methods of the National party gave us that free, unsolicited, but welcome testimony. It merely goes to show that the men on the land who know what was the effect of that contract, are all pleased with it. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know what percentage of pure wool those figures include, or what quantity of greasy wool is covered by them. I do not know- whether they refer to the picked samples of the highest grade of wool. But a comparison between the flat rate which embraces all Australian wool and the peak price of the highest grade of wool is an unfortunate one, and can only have been instituted by one who was either ignorant of the methods employed or was hopeful of deluding his hearers. </para>

That contract in regard to the sale of our wool was entered into with the full concurrence of all the interests concerned, and even though the war " crashed " earlier than we expected, at the time it was made the men associated with that industry came forward and testified to their appreciation, not only of the contract itself, but of the way in which operations had been conducted. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member also attempted to show that the National party was a divided and a united party. Out of one side of his mouth he sang as a burden or refrain one part of the resolution of appreciation which was passed by the assembled Nationalists last week. He was careful not to quote the other part, which showed that we were united in everything - not merely in reference to the deeds of the recess, but also in regard to the policy for the current session. Hence he got into a morass of contradiction, from which he never emerged, but in which he wallowed like a bullock in a bog. If I may be permitted to make a comment on behalf of the independent gentlemen who sit behind the Government, I would say that it is the most natural thing in the world for honorable members opposite to sing the same song, because they have to do so. They have to learn only one tune, and it is like the Old Hundredth, in that it is used for all occasions. </para>

                            <para>- We can do that. But that is not the question. Let me put this view to the honorable member: When the Prime Minister is in London, the only way in which we can confer with him' is by cable. That conference is precisely the  same kind of conference that would take place if he were here in Melbourne. Up to a certain, stage, I regard communications dealing with matters of that kind as Cabinet communications, and as being precisely on the same plane as conversations which pass between Ministers who are not severed by the ocean. But, as a matter of fact, no misunderstanding has occurred here. Demobilization was never ordered to proceed slowly, either here or in London. The difficulty which confronted us made us really believe that our soldiers could not all leave London until about the end of 1919, and it is due to the insistent pressure of the Prime Minister, the skill of the demobilization staffs organized by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir J</inline> ohn Monash, with his Chief of Staff, and eventually to the help of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> that we are able to say that, with the exception of the depot staffs, all our men will have left London by July. That, I think, is a testimony of the excellent demobilization work of the Government. There are' in this Chamber to-day men who can speak from their own personal knowledge of matters at the London end, and I shall be glad if they will speak quite frankly of what they know, and not of what has been whispered into their ears. </para>

                            <para>- Demobilization does not take place in France. The demobilization problem that we were bound to attack commenced from the time that the men landed in England. We had to solve how those who were to be trained could be trained during their enforced idleness, and to learn how shipping could be satisfactorily organized, together with the many other problems that are attendant upon it. It is very easy to pick holes in any system, as the honorable member for Capricornia has tried to do in respect of repatriation. He spent about ten minutes in showing neglect and abandonment of promises on the part of the Government in regard to their repatriation objective. I say that to take in hand a job involving the demobilization of 300,000 men, as they did- </para>

We have relatively fewer men on the books of the Repatriation Department seeking relief than are to be found in the Mother Country. Indeed, amongst all the belligerent nations, Australia has developed the widest and wisest repatriation scheme, when it is considered in all its phases. If we do not meet with a larger proportion of failures in the future than we have done the scheme will have worked up to the expectations of its founders. In saying that, I do not profess that it is perfect, any more than any human scheme could bc : but due credit should be given for its proportion of successes, and all attention should not be focussed on its comparatively small percentage of failures. </para>

                                <para>- Judging by the published ritual of my honorable friends opposite,  judging by historic episodes/ which admit of no qualification, the difference between our party and the Official Labour party is that if a man disagrees with the Labour Caucus he goes out, either dead, or marked for slaughter, but never buried in any case, although consigned to everlasting damnation. In our party we can differ, reverse our judgment, and exercise our individual freedom. That is the difference between bond and free. </para>

                        <para>Before I conclude, may I comment, in passing, upon the plea which the honorable member for Capricornia uttered with respect to those of enemy origin or descent in this country. Judging by observations that have fallen from honorable members opposite during this and last week, it seems to be their set intention to make the cause of the Australian Germans their own. That is a dangerous policy. This Government is not after punitive measures with regard to men who live in Australia and who were born in Germany, or born of German parents in Australia, but it has determined to make the safety of this country the supreme law. Honorable members must recognise that that is the obligation of whatever party is in trusted with responsibility; it. must react upon the people as well as upon their trust. It is an absolute obligation which rests upon any Government that may be in power. When Parliament is informed, as I hope to inform it by means of papers laid on the table during the course of the next few days, of exactly what is proposed with regard to certain enemy interests, it will be very hard indeed, I think, for the Official Labour party to say that the Government are wrong in taking the course they propose with respect to certain German interests. </para>
                        <para>I trust I shall never have in Parliament a harder task than the answering of this amendment has proved to-night. It is so empty, a proposition - not designed to waste time, although it will inevitably have that effect - that I have no hesitation in asking a unanimous National party to vote against it. </para>

                            <para>.- This afternoon the  Deputy  Leader of the Labour Party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> gave us a very fine exposition on the maladministration and other shortcomings of the Government, an exposition calm, dispassionate, logical, well-reasoned, and last, but not least, unanswerable. The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> did not even attempt to answer it. When that honorable member rose in his place, we on this side of the House, and, I have no doubt, many honorable members opposite, thought that at least some attempt would be made - though, of course, it could not be successful, with the very meagre material he had at hand - to reply to the charges of maladministration, and worse, which were levelled against the Government ; but he met the position somewhat after . the manner of a Salvation Army captain. After he had contemptuously dismissed many charges, he began to single out certain -members of the House to give their testimony. He, himself, repeated several testimonials, which had been splendidly stage-managed by the National party, such as resolutions from farmers' conferences. It was a very fine effort," indeed, and represented a policy as old. as the hills, but still of use in the way of securing publicity for hi§ Government and party. The farmers at Ballarat cried aloud to Heaven that the National Government was the best they had ever known in their lives, though this is the only time they have said <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> since the creation of the Government. Because of the nearness of the elections, the astute organizers and leaders of the party deemed it necessary that certain well-managed testimonials should be given, and every day and every week they will come to us, emanating, no doubt, from the room of the Acting Prime Minister or some other Minister. After the honorable gentleman had given testimony from outside people, he called upon brother Jowett for his testimony in regard to wool, the honorable gentleman freely acknowledging that he knew nothing about that business himself. In reply to charges in connexion with the demobilization and transportation of troops, he called on brother Burchell, from whom, no doubt, we shall hear in due course. Then, apparently, he could not see any other on his side, so he called upon brother Anstey, from Bourke, to testify what a great man the Prime Minister of this country <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> is. Then the Acting Prime Minister sat down, having delivered an empty speech, in which there was not even the slightest attempt to answer the charges made by the  Deputy  Leader of the Labour party. </para>

                        <para>I desire to deal with the deportation of certain citizens from this country, and to make my position clear to the House and the country in regard to these deportations generally. I do not care what crime may be charged, no man or woman should be deported without trial. It may have been necessary during war time, though, personally, I am extremely doubtful, to have secret deportation without trial, or without reference to any tribunal other than that probably of the Cabinet Minister or a number of Ministers ; but surely the time has passed when we cannot allow the full light of day to be thrown on every individual in this community against whom a charge is made. I know perfectly well that many citizens of the community have been charged, and, in most of the cases that have come under my personal notice, the charges have been purely political. If there is an ardent anti-conscriptionist in a district, and he has the slightest trace of German blood or other foreign blood in his viens, he will, in 99 cases out of 100, be thrown into Holdsworthy or some other internment camp. In this matter the Government discriminate between the wealthy and the poor, and between those with National party leanings and those with Labour leanings. A German with National party leanings is not imprisoned, and, if he has money to spend in fighting Labour, is allowed' to go free. </para>

                                <para>- Their support of the National party constituted their loyalty - the fact that they were prepared to put hundreds of pounds behind the National candidates -but immediately a person with the slightest trace of German blood went behind the Labour party he was deemed disloyal. That in ' itself was nothing, because we, on this side, according to the Government, are. all disloyal. Honorable members opposite have termed me, and also the  Deputy  Leader of the Labour party, disloyal ; there is not one on this side who has not been so described. Australian citizens, born of German parents, have been put into Holdsworthy, or some other internment camp, if they favoured anti-conscription, and if they were supporters of the Labour party they were disfranchised. That is the way in which the National party and Government have dealt with the alien question in this country. </para>

                        <para>Much criticism was current in the newspapers and political circles as to the attitude of the Government and their party in their treatment of wealthy Germans. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> came before the people and said that the Government were going to intern all Germans; and almost immediately a brewer named Resch was interned in New South Wales, amidst the great applause of the National party. Everything was going well, and the war was being won- one wealthy German had been interned ! But how long was he interned ? No longer than it took to complete the elections, and immediately these were over he was released. No more wealthy Germans were interned unless they happened to be anticonscriptionists, and there are still wealthy Germans going about this country. If I am informed rightly, the Consul-General for Germany was left quite unmolested during the war. </para>

                                <para>- In this connexion, the case of Paul Freeman comes into my mind, and I intend to lay a little information before the House with regard to it, because it is typical of quite a large  number  of other cases. At the present -.time the National Government are dealing with the deportation of Germans. If the wife is German she must go out of the country, but her children, if born in Australia, need not leave. In their clemency the National Government have said to the German mother and father, who may have been here for twenty or even fifty years, that they must be deported, though their children may stay behind if they desire. Some of these children, Australian born, have reached the age of manhood and womanhood, and many of the men have served at the Front; and yet this is the treatment meted out to them. No person, whether. <inline font-style="italic">s,</inline> German, Austrian, or any 'other nationality, should be deported without trial. Is it that the National Government are afraid because their case is so weak that they dare not face a trial ? Is the evidence they have of such a character that it will not bear the scrutiny of a Court? Personally, I believe that that is the reason, for, if not, what is it? </para>

                        <para>The case of Paul Freeman is an interesting one. So far as one can learn, he put in most of his time prospecting for gold, silver, and other minerals, and eventually discovered three or four claims, one of which was earning him about £3 per day, 80 miles from Cloncurry, in Queensland. He had something like '£500 worth of tools, munitions, and other material used in mining, together with pack horses and gear; and he had a fine home well stocked with food. One night he was awakened bv a noise outside his camp, and heard the question, " Are you in, </para>
                        <para class="block">Freeman?" When he replied in the affirmative, the voice continued, " Come outside, I want to speak to you." Freeman lit his candle and said, " Come inside." A policeman, accompanied by a blackfellow, stepped in and said, " I have come to arrest you. I want you to come with me." Freeman said. " Where is your warrant?" The policeman 6aid, " I have no warrant but I have a wire." A' wire from the Commissioner of Police in Brisbane was the only warrant for the arrest of Paul Freeman. At Cloncurry, where he was taken, Freeman was put through the usual treatment given to criminals.  His  finger prints were taken, and he was stripped, and all bodily marks were noted. He was told he was to be held for the purpose of deportation. Absolutely no charge was laid against him then or since. At Cloncurry he asked for sufficient time to allow him to fix up his affairs. He was given four days only, but in that time he -failed to arrange matters satisfactorily. As I have shown,  he owned, or had an interest in, four fairly good claims. It was probably because of the fact that he had discovered payable minerals in the vicinity of the Mount Elliot mines at Cloncurry that he was got out of the way. Certainly it. was openly stated in Queensland that it was owing to a visit of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Corbold,  manager of the Mount Elliot mines, to Melbourne that Freeman was arrested. At any rate, it was a strange coincidence that a couple of days after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Corbold</inline> arrived in Melbourne Freeman was arrested and ordered to get ready for deportation. </para>

                                <para>- That is how the National Government manages things. From Cloncurry he was taken to Townsville, and thence to Brisbane and Sydney. Immediately he arrived in Sydney I wa6 notified and asked to intervene. I got in touch with General. Lee, the State Commandant, and asked for permission to interview Paul Freeman. The Commandant said he could not grant me that permission. He told me that his instructions merely were to keep the man temporarily, and that he had no control over him-. He said that. I would Have to get in touch with the Minister. I telegraphed to the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> asking to be allowed to see Freeman so that he might get legal advice. Back came probably one of the most astounding replies any person could get to a communication forwarded to a responsible Minister of the Crown. It was to this effect - " See Consul-General for America for information Paul Freeman." This man was arrested at the instigation of the Government, and yet when one asked the head of the Government for information concerning the person arrested, he was referred to the Consul-General representing another country, which has nothing to- do with Australia or its laws. After three or four days I got this reply, and I went down to see the Consul-General for America. I told him I had been referred to him by the Acting Prime Minister for information concerning a person who had been deported by the Government of this country. Bie said, "I know nothing about him except that he has been deported. " </para>

                                <para>- The day after I had spoken to the Commandant, Freeman was spirited away, put on board a vessel, and sent to America. He was brought back again, but no one knew  anything  about it. He was again taken to America and brought back again. It was then an outcry was raised. Freeman had decided that the only way in which he could draw public attention to the treatment meted out by the Government of this country was to "hunger strike," and he had " hunger struck " to such an extent that his method drew the attention of the whole of Australia, with the result that a protest came from all parts of the Commonwealth, and feeling in Sydney, at any rate, ran remarkably high. On more than "one occasion the situation was extremely critical. If an attempt is again made to deport Paul Freeman the Government will have to take the responsibility for anything that may occur. I saw the temper of the crowd in Sydney. I saw 10,000 people going down to Circular Quay, evidently prepared, if necessary, to take this man off the boat, and I believe that if the Government adhere to their resolution to deport him without a trial they will have more on their hands than they can look after. This is no threat or intimidation. It is simply a plain statement of facts as I see them. I went into the whole question, and I claim to know something of the temper of the crowd which went to the boat on the night that Paul Freeman was taken, off.

                        <para class="block">Dear Friend, </para>
                        <para>Am in a hospital prison cell, and as closely guarded as ever I was. According to orders, only three persons have a right to speak to me, namely, a doctor, a nurse, and a man with a bayonet. My demand (as I expected) to see the American Consul-General or any of my friends met with a refusal. I enclose the letter to Captain Lloyd, which he returned to me. </para>
                        <para>Things; in my opinion, look ugly for me, for as soon as they brought me from the boat mi an exhausted condition, a warrant officer of the Hospital Corps, named Rose (I think he is a; daisy), took every opportunity of coming into my cell pestering me with impertinent questions, and passing insinuating remarks. X could see his unmanly and dirty intentions.. Following day, when he resumed his unwelcome attentions, and made me think as if he were trying to pump me so as to be able to pimp, seeing that he was a big bully bouncing individual, with intention of unmasking him, I told him to <inline font-style="italic">go</inline> to hell and leave <inline font-style="italic">me</inline> alone. At any rate, I could not stand his insults much longer. That done it. He told me he would cut my throat in a minute; but when I quietly (being helpless to resist) offered him my throat to* operate upon with his bayonet, he fumbled at. his belt, and then wanted to pull me "out of my bed and to trample upon me. He fumed, an'o&gt; used very bad language for some time before leaving my cell. However, I told him that the exponent of Prussian militarism was in Holland at present, and that it would be advisable for him to join the ex-great Willie K. I don't know whether the man showed his personal enmity, or was inspired by someone else. It looks to me as if the Department for Oppression are trying to nurse me back to health, so as to be able to smuggle me out of the country, or else, perhaps, to force me, by the above described methods, to commit a rash act. I cannot trust them, and somehow feel there is something on foot. You see, as yet, they have not showed the slightest of desires to give me a trial, and are trying their best to prevent me from communicating with anybody on the outside. Please do not trust the official statement of the military authorities too much, for I can already see by the newspapers where it tends to. To-day, at noon, as a protest against being kept  excommunicado,  and not allowed a trial, I will commence a hunger strike, and will keep it up until the Department of Oppression will relax their torturing grip by giving me a trial and allowing my friends to see me. Somehow I think they will not give me a trial, in which case, of course, I- will be obliged to kick off to Jesus. Please convey my profound gratitude to all those who combined their efforts to relax the strangling grip of Prussianized militarism in Australia on liberty and justice. </para>

                        <para>With reference to your telegram of the 10th inst.,' respecting the case of Paul Freeman, -I desire to inform you that this matter was recently considered by Cabinet, which decided that no trial be authorized. Pending inquiries from the authorities of United States as to his nationality, Freeman is to be detained in custody. </para>
                        <para class="block">For what reason is Paul Freeman to be detained in custody? The most extraordinary thing about this case is that on one occasion, when the outcry became so great that the National party were afraid to remain silent any longer, the Acting Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> came out with a statement that Freeman was alleged to be a member of the Industrial Workers of the World. Even if he was, that is no reason why he should be deported from this country without a trial. Whoever he is, he should be given a trial. As an afterthought, some two weeks afterwards, the charge was laid that he was of German parentage. Freeman says he is not, and I would just as soon believe Freeman as I would any member of the Government. After all, it is one man's word against another's. The National Government of Australia have completely upset that theory. <inline font-style="italic">Magna Charta</inline> of 700 years ago means nothing. There is no way in which one can help Freeman or any other person in such an unfortunate position. The Government have suspended the <inline font-style="italic">Habeas Corpus</inline> Act, and they have suspended <inline font-style="italic">Magna Charta.</inline> All the liberties which have been fought for down the ages have been abrogated by the National p&gt;arty in their desire to .win the war, and I suppose they think the war will be won still further by the deportation of Freeman 'and many other people. No person, no matter what his origin, no matter what his beliefs or views, no matter what his nationality, should be deported from this country without an opportunity to have an open trial, to be faced with his accusers, allowed to call witnesses, to cross-examine his accusers, and to have legal advice'. </para>
                        <para class="block">That is not allowed to Freeman, it was not allowed to some 200 who have already been deported, and it is not allowed to the Germans who are being deported to-day. If a German has lived in this country for fifty years, and, so far as can be seen, has done nothing to injure this country, he should not be deported. So long as he is a law-abiding citizen, and leads a good life, neither the National Government nor any other Government has a right to deport him, unless it can prove him guilty of some crime against the country or its laws. </para>
                        <para>The administration of German New Guinea calls for the earnest consideration of the House. I have been told by people who come from New Guinea that many there have said, " If this is the way the National Government are going to govern this country, for God's sake give us back German rule." </para>

The strange thing, according to the Minister, is that a general revision of the laws of German New Guinea cannot take place until the future of the Possession has been determined; and yet the Government revised one law, that dealing with flogging. No matter how small the offence was, if a planter was not satisfied with the work one of his boys was doing, it was only necessary for him to send along the offender and a note to the officers of the Australian Army, and those officers would carry out the flogging. They would bare the back of the native, stretch him across a stool, two niggers would hold his legs, and two his hands, and another nigger would stand by and ''lay it on" under the direction, and at the instigation, of officers of the Australian Army, evidently with the cognisance and blessing, until the practice was exposed, of the National Government of Australia. </para>

                    <para>The' <inline font-style="italic">Mirror,</inline> of Sydney, laid most astounding charges against the administration of German New Guinea. One of its statements concerned debauchery at Government House, yet the <inline font-style="italic">Mirror</inline> has not been indicted for it. In another place the same paper charges the Administrator, Brigadier-General Johnston, and his aide, Lieutenant Gwynne, with having a stand-up fight on the lawn of Government House after a certain function had taken place. Yet nothing whatever has been done by the Government. In this article the paper says that because Nur*e  Deever  was not amenable to the wishes of the Administrator of the Territory she was "sacked." Nothing has been said or done by the Government in that matter. If the Government will stand by and see their officers charged with such things, words fail me in expressing my contempt. Nurse Deever, after being dismissed, was put in a boat with a number of internees, and sent to Sydney. She was the only woman on board the boat. Protests were made at Rabaul against the treatment Nurse Deever was receiving. Nevertheless, she was sent away in the manner I have described. </para>

                            <para>- It follows that the Government are evidently afraid. Until I exposed the flogging practices at Rabaul, nothing was done by the Government. Up to that time floggings were carried out upon the unfortunate natives with the cognisance of the Government, but when I spoke the Government ordered a thorough and searching investigation of the charges I had made. The Administrator found himself " not guilty," and the National Government accepted the acquittal by himself of the person who was charged. It was a case of appealing from  Caesar  unto Caesar. The National Government must appoint a Royal "Commission to investigate the whole of these charges. If they 'are not true, the sooner they are- cleared up the better. If they are true, a good many people want "sacking" from the positions they occupy at Rabaul. Another charge made is that one of the Commonwealth boats, costing £100 a day to run, was sent to Sydney for no other apparent reason than to take a lady to the Territory. This lady was given the hospitality of the National Government. A motor car, which had previously been at the disposal of the malarial convalescents, was taken from the hospital. Up to that time six or seven of the patients would go out in this large car in the afternoons for an airing; sometimes three or four batches would be taken out and brought back to the hospital. But when this lady arrived it appears that the car was taken from the convalescents and given to her, and, ultimately, she was given a Government ' residence. I am not going to set myself up to judge other people's morals, but I claim that if- people are going to use the money and the boats of this country for their own pleasure, it is time somebody kicked up a row about it. Two nurses were badly wanted at Rabaul, and the authorities sent to Melbourne for them. Two barmaids were sent up, and did no nursing, but the people of Australia paid. </para>

                    <para>I have nothing further to say respecting the maladministration of German New Guinea, except that these charges are so grave and shacking that the Government cannot afford to allow them to go either unrefuted or unproved. They must take steps, by means of a Royal Commission, or some inquiry carried out, not by the persons accused, but by a body quite apart from the Service altogether, to ascertain the facts. </para>
                    <para>I come new to another phase of the flogging question. Not only do the National Government allow floggings to be administered at Rabaul, but they also had a very bad system of punishment in operation on ' board the training ship <inline font-style="italic">Tingira,</inline> in Sydney Harbor. Much to the surprise and astonishment of many representatives of New South Wales, it was learned recently that flogging was a com- mon occurrence on board this training ship. Representations on the subject were immediately made by the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahony),</inline> the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West),</inline> the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wallace),</inline> and others to the Acting Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton),</inline> but the honorable gentleman said that he saw nothing wrong with the system. He held the opinion that a little caning now and again did no harm, and thought that unless caning were resorted to it would be impossible to maintain discipline on board. But again public opinion became so strong that the Minister gave way, and it was not long before flogging was discontinued on the <inline font-style="italic">Tingira,</inline> owing mainly to the action of the Labour party. But for the exposure brought about by our party I have no doubt that it would still be continued on that vessel. </para>
                    <para>The <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> has recently arrived in Australian waters, and it carries practically a full complement of men who are absolutely tired of the Australian Navy. It is very hard indeed to find on board any of our war-ships that have returned one of the rank and file who will again sign on with the Australian Navy. </para>

                            <para>- It is, at all events, under Australian regulations and, to a certain extent, under Australian supervision. The <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane,</inline> as I have said, arrived in Sydney Harbor recently, and I was given certain information with regard to an incident that fairly illustrates the way in which the Australian Navy is conducted. The system is much akin to that of the Australian military system. Two men on the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> were given leave to attend a cricket match. They attended it, and were returning, chatting, as they walked along the road, when suddenly they heard a voice behind them saying, "' Get out of the road, damn you !" One of the men at the same moment found himself thrust on one' side. It was the captain of the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> who thus treated him. This reminds one of the many tales of the brutal tactics of German officers. </para>

                            <para>- Ask for the papers in connexion with the case. The honorable member must accept the evidence of the men as being equal to that of. their commander. Some time after this incident occurred, one of the men - not the man who was pushed aside, but the other - was called before a court martial and charged with contemptuous treatment of his captain. During the hearing, the man who had been pushed by the captain was called as a witness. He would not see his mate wrongfully charged, and he therefore said, "It was I, and not my mate, who was pushed aside." One would have thought that in the face of such evidence the case against the man wrongfully charged would have been dismissed. That, however, did not occur. Almost immediately after the court rose, the man who had been pushed, but had not been charged, was. arrested, and both were fined on the charge of contemptuous treatment of the captain. The English commander who was in the company of the captain at the time said that the latter spoke three times to the men. If the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)</inline> is in earnest in his protestations, he will call for the papers. The English commander gave evidence that the captain spoke three times to the two blue jackets, but that they did not move. They were walking along a road, but did not get out of the way. The captain then pushed one of them aside. The evidence is on record in the books of the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane,</inline> and I defy the honorable member for Henty to dispute my statement. Why should the captain of the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane,</inline> or of any other Australian vessel, dare to say to another man, " Get out of my road " ? </para>

                    <para>The rules and regulations of the Australian Navy provide that every man shall be entitled to twenty-eight days' leave per annum ; but there is a proviso that if the leave be not taken in the year in which it is due, it shall be reduced by one-half. The men on the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> have been on active service almost continuously for something like four years, and during that time they had practically no opportunity to take their leave. They had thus nearly 120 days of accumulated leave coming to them when they reached Sydney. The benevolent authorities controlling the Navy, however, have decreed that they shall be granted only 60 days' leave. That is to say, they are to lose 60 days' leave because of their inability, arising from no fault of their own, to take it as it became due. Last week, in Sydney, when the men were being paid, the paymaster had the effrontery to lay before them a form of receipt setting out that they had no further call upon the Navy. In other words, each man was to give a receipt in full. The men rightly refused to sign such a receipt, except conditionally. I put it to the Acting Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> that these men who have accrued leave should not have any deductions made from it because of their inability to take it as it fell due. They ought certainly to be paid in respect of the leave of which they have been deprived. Another incident in connexion with the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> is detailed in a letter from a boy of seventeen, under date of the 26th ultimo, as follows: - </para>

                <para>That boy, it appears, is now in Garden Island, where there has been adopted the Prussian methods of giving men loaded drill. It is called the " coal-basket drill," and consists of forcing the unfortunate prisoners, for four hours during the morning and four hours in the afternoon, to uselessly carry baskets filled with bricks from one point to another. This is done to this boy because he resented his treatment in good Australian fashion, and he will suffer on Garden Island for ninety days. I do not know whether the " goose-step " is inflicted on Garden Island; but, if not, it is about the only German practice not found there. </para>

                        <para>.- The speech to which we have just listened is hardly likely to carry weight either in this House or in the country. It had not been my intention to refer to my experiences on the other side, but since the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley)</inline> has stated that I lay entrenched in London, I think it worth while to deal briefly with the facts. I think it was on the 18th October that I left Peronne with the last Australians to leave the Front; and I should like to mention one little incident that then occurred. When we were travelling down the valley of the Somme in the cattle trucks which constituted our conveyance, a man in the brake van signalled to me, and I found him to be one whom I had known for many years in the back country of New South Wales. He and another had some bread and cheese, and, at their invitation, I joined in the meal. One of these men, whose name I could easily furnish, was at one time an organizer for the Shearers' Union, in New South Wales.' As we went along, we could see the little crosses over the graves, and sometimes clusters of them, where our boys had fallen. Often the rifles of the men who occupied these newly-made graves were stuck in point down, and their helmets lay on the mounds. This man said to me, " <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fleming,</inline> you knew me years ago, and know that for long I gave my life to the Labour party. You know that I gave up a good position to come to the war; and now just look at those little crosses, and think how I feel, after having given my life to the Labour party, to know' that those boys arc lying there because the party refused to send us reinforcements." </para>

There are many matters with which one could deal, apart altogether from matters personal; and I wish to say that on my return I find, as a looker-on, that the actions of the Government are not all perfect, though they are certainly very much better than any we could have expected from a party which allows an honorable member to make such statements as we have heard within the last half-hour. </para>

                    </continue><para>I desire to say a word or two about the work of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> in the Old Country. It is well known, that up to the time that honorable gentleman showed his spirit of Empire - until he showed that he understood and fully realized the danger in which this country and our whole civilisation stood - I was about as bitter an opponent as he had. But his most bitter opponent might have been convinced by his actions in the Old Country that he is an extremely worthy representative of Australia. Not only does he do everything in his power to help the soldiers, but he has represented us in the finest possible manner at the Peace Conference. "We are hearing a good deal to-night about the slackness in the returning of our boys. When I was at Home, and had just come out of hospital after being a little while back from Prance, I had an opportunity to talk with the Prime Minister, who .asked me what I thought about the returning of our men. I asked him, "What time can you do it in?" and he replied, ' ' We cannot get ships to do it in much less than eleven ot twelve months." I told him that, in my opinion, that was not half fast enough, and that the time would have to be reduced by one-half. He said he was advised that it was impossible to get the shipping; and I replied that no matter what he had been advised in that regard, if he got to work he would be able to reduce the time to the limits I had stated. The Prime Minister did got to work, and did cut the time down by half; and the point is that the Prime Minister had been told by those in responsible positions at Home that what he has achieved, or is achieving, was absolutely impossible. . </para><para>The honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates)</inline> told us the other night that there is going to be trouble amongst the soldiers in this country in regard to their demobilization and treatment; but my opinion is that most of the soldiers who have returned are well satisfied with their treatment in this country. I have mixed with, and have in my own electorate, soldiers of all ranks and classes, from the coal miner to the wealthy grazier ; and I am firmly convinced, knowing them as I do, that the majority of them think that Australia is doing well by the returned men. I do know, however, that there are things in this country against which the returned soldier has to fight. Trade unions are not the only things which are up against the returned men, and I wish to see this Government do its utmost to make the way as easy as possible for those thousands of men who are unfit to carry on their usual occupations. Many of them may appear to be in the best possible condition, but are not nearly so well as they look. It ought to be remembered, even at times when people begin to feel doubtful about the actions of many returned men, that their appearance is very often deceiving; and I hope that the Government will extend, and continue to extend, the most sympathetic treatment to them. </para><para>The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corboy)</inline> told us. the other night that there is Prussianism in Australia; and, in order to prove his statement, he gave us a case which he said occurred in the unit to which he belonged. He told us how a man had been ill-used by his colonel at the Front; but he discounted the whole of his statement about Prussianism being in this country when he told us that this colonel could not live in the State from which he came. Surely that is abundant proof that such punishments as were described will not be tolerated in Australia ! There is no doubt' that, under special circumstances, and with the usual military spirit, there were punishments inflicted on men abroad that were unfair, but you can never get a big organization, such as the military, under the stress and strain of a long war, without some blemishes. However, the honorable member proved as conclusively as possible that Australia will not stand for the unfair treatment of our soldiers; and I am convinced that those guilty of such treatment will find the proper punishment. </para><para>We hear a good deal at the present time about the cost of living, and its increase is, in my opinion, due to four causes, the first of which is the inflation of our currency. I am convinced that, until we can reduce the superfluous currency, prices cannot come down in any great degree. I point out, however,  that in no country in the world are the necessaries of life so cheap as in Australia to-day. </para><para>The Government have put forward what seems to me to be a good scheme in connexion with our war debt. But it would he 'better, to advance even a step further, not only to have a Commission to attend to all the war loans, as our Government have suggested, hut also to convert them into a common stock, each country being responsible for underwriting its particular portion of the debt. I am convinced that by this means Australia would be saved many millions of pounds 'before the war debt is liquidated.  I  believe that the scheme for the allotment of the finances between the Commonwealth and the States, which was put forward in Sydney recently by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman,</inline> the Premier of . New South "Wales, is better than any other I have heard put forward in this House. The taxation powers of Australia are duplicated too frequently, and  Mr.Holman's  scheme, whereby this Parliament would retain to itself the indirect taxation, while allowing the State Parliaments to impose all direct taxation, would be a fair way out of the difficulty. It would not be a permanent way, but it would be a temporary expedient until the Constitution of Australia is 'amended. There can be no reasonable doubt in the mind of any man that we are moving fast towards an (amendment of the Federal Constitution. But, until that takes place, a definite line of demarcation should be drawn between the taxation powers of the States and the Commonwealth. I have a report of the Midland Railway Company of "Western Australia. It shows that, the company is being taxed on its lands to the extent of 230s. in the £1. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- They are endeavouring to sell it as fast as they can. That is my point. They are bringing out settlers from the Old Country to place on the unoccupied lands of Western Australia, but the treatment which they have received, and the lack of sympathy displayed towards them because they happen to he a private concern, has tended to freeze these men out. If we are going to do our duty to Australia, it is absolutely essential that we should adopt a better system of treating the British firms. "Until we are willing to reciprocate with the Old Land to a certain extent in our taxation proposals, so long will our finances be in a bad position. One of the results of the war will be that Great Britain will do its utmost to keep its people within its own boundaries. I know, from my own experience, that there are thousands of good solid English men and women who are looking to Australia as their future home. </para>

Australian soldiers, and the conditions of the war, have given us an advertisement in the  Old  Land and other countries,, which only one who has been there lately can appreciate. In the United States of America and Canada I met hundreds of people who are turning their eyes to a country which could send out such soldiers and equip them in such a manner as Australia did during the war. If we can only give ordinary consideration to the' firms in Britain who are concerned in the development of Australia, we shall have in this fair land of ours thousands and hundreds of thousands of the very best stamp of those people from whom we 'ourselves sprang. Australia's problem is to people this continent, and even to-day, with the shadow of a war just past, we know well that another shadow already looms on the horizon, and that unless Australia is filled with white people we cannot hold it. </para>

                            <para>- No. High wages are not a cause of the increased cost of living to anything like the extent many people imagine they are. I have always been in favour of a country paying high wages, because it means that the purchasing power of the people of that country is enormously increased. But one qf the chief causes of the increased cost of living in Australia is the go-slow policy, which, for instance, can be seen in operation in North Queensland, of which we have heard a good deal to-night. </para>

                            <para>- I have it on the authority of a man concerned in one of the biggest industries in Queensland, a man sent up there specially to inquire why some of the mines were not paying as they formerly did, that he found on an actuarial basis that, while wages had increased 64 per cent., against which no one with a sense of justice would declaim, efficiency had decreased by 44 per cent. Inflated currency and the go-slow policy are the principal causes in the increased cost of living. </para>

                    </continue><para>I am also convinced that the fixing of prices has had a good deal to do with the increase in the cost of living. For one thing it has restricted the amount of work which was put into primary production, and has allowed the trader to run free with the manufactured article. Nine-tenths of the increases in prices occur in connexion with manufactured articles. The cost of primary products has not risen in anything like the same proportion. The primary producer and the workers of the country have been penalized by the fact that prices have been fixed on primary (production while the trader has been allowed to run free with his manufactured article. We. are suffering from the loss of a great deal of money which should have come here. There has been talk of dissatisfaction among the workers, but there is also considerable dissatisfaction, as well as general unrest, among the producers of this country, and with, much more reason for it. The progress of Australia depends on a fair deal being given to the primary producers. For that reason I wish to lay before the Government as briefly as possible the position as it appears to one who has come back to Australia and regards it from a fresh point of view. In an Australian newspaper of the 15th May last there is a page devoted to the interests of the  primary  producers. It mentions that they are not getting a fair price for their wool, which, in the ope'n market, they would get. There is no doubt the Government could make out a very good case in answer to that claim. They certainly saved Australia from a very stringent financial position by  making  the arrangement with the British authorities, and at the same time they put Great Britain in a very much sounder position in the matter of obtaining supplies than it could have secured by any other method. But as every good thing must carry a certain burden with it, we are now, to a certain extent, paying for the advantage we obtained during the years of war. I think the Government should make more plain to the wool-growers of Australia, those who are comparing the prices we are obtaining for our wool .with the prices obtained in the Old Country, that it is only a fair thing to even up on the whole deal. I have heard it said to-night that Great Britain took no risks in connexion with the wool deal. But honorable members know that quite a quantity of wool was lost in torpedoed vessels, and Great Britain bore the whole of the risk of the loss of the wool, or any deterioration that might take place. Any risk except for the 50 per cent, we got out of the profits was to be borne by the Old Land. Is it fair now that the war is over, and we have returned to the ways of peace, to say that the British authorities took an advantage over us? </para><interjection>

                            <para>- Yes; but the British people had to pay for the insurance. A little while ago some of the manufacturers of Australia waited on the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> for whom I have the greatest respect, and asked him to. consider the advisability of placing an export duty on wool. I noticed in a newspaper report that the Minister replied to the effect that the representations of the deputation in favour of an allotment of more wool for local scouring would be brought before the Acting Prime Minister, and that he was impressed with the views of the deputation. </para>

                            <para>- New Zealand exported some of its wheat and gave its farmers a guarantee of 5s. Id. in the early period of last year, and gives them now up to 6s. a bushel. Yet we are told that our Government can give our farmers a guarantee of only 4s. 2d. a bushel, and they are being paid in such a slow and uncertain way that some of them are realizing on their scrip at a price which brings them in only about 3s. lid. per bushel. With all due deference to what has been done while I have been away, as suggested by the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Foster),</inline> there must be a screw loose somewhere, and there must be some better method of arriving at a fair distribution to our farmers, who have been compelled by stress of circumstances to realize on their wheat scrip at a price which represents only 3s. lid. per bushel in the aggregate, while our neighbour, New Zealand, is now giving its farmers -up to 6s. While I do not pretend to know all that has been going on in the last two years in this country, I assert that things of that sort make the farmers naturally somewhat discontented. If the Government can by any means find .out where the trouble is, and put our farmers more nearly on an equality with New Zealanders, things will be very much improved from the producing point of view. Our farmers are becoming disgusted to a certain extent with the prices they have been obtaining for their produce, and I know for an absolute fact that a good deal of the country has gone out of cultivation. That is a serious thing for a young and growing community such as this is. If the farmers of New Zealand are guaranteed 6s. a bushel and the farmers of the United States of America and Canada 9s. 2d. a bushel- </para>

                        <para>Australians say their bread is the best in the world, and we have frequently sampled bread made here from an all-Australian grist, which left nothing to be desired in the way of flavour, colour, pile, and yield. We do not say that all Australian wheat is equally good; but there is not another white wheat in the world possessing better all-round bread qualities. This is saying a lot for any wheat - white, red, or yellow - but Australian has other virtues besides those of good bread-making. To the miller it is " one of the best." It will stand more abuse and treatment than most white wheats. The miller is not afraid of wetting it, as he is with the Californian and Blue Stem, or any white wheats, outside Indian. And after he has washed it he is not troubled about grinding it. We have seen it carry 6 per cent, moisture and mill into semolina. Its bran will always fetch a superior price, and because of the pale, creamy tint it will stand more scraping with less colour degradation to the flour than red wheat will. </para>

If we receive a reduced price for our wheat compared with other wheats, it is not on account of the quality. I have not travelled a great deal about Australia during the last three months, since I came back, but I have been about enough to see that in some of the districts with' which I am acquainted not more than one-third of the land that was under cultivation three years ago is under cultivation now. If we are going to encourage the wheat production of this country as we should - for primary production is the only way in which we can pay our war debt - we must give the producers who have been suffering from bad times, shortage of shipping, and the actions of the Labour party, some better inducement for the future than they have had in the past. </para><para>I hope the programme as put forward by the Government will be carried put to the full, and in the most sympathetic manner possible.

I feel sure that if every Australian soldier had done as much for his country as the honorable member has done,  ever 1  German would be dead. I am not one of those who stopped in this country, and the honorable member  i6  not the only member who left his country for his country's good. I left my country also. I also have been at Villers-Bretonneux, and gazed on Amiens. I have been to the Somme, and looked down the Somme Valley into Peronne, and I can assure the House, since I must pay my testimony to the honorable member's valour, that everywhere along that valley I found the graves of the  Germans  whom he had. slaughtered. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, such</inline> valour needs no commendation from me. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Speaking, not as one of those who stopped at home and know nothing, but as one" who went away, I feel it is only proper that I should also place on record what I have done for my country and my Empire. Let not what I have done go unrecorded. Does any one here realize the change that took place immediately upon my arrival Iri Europe? Before my arrival, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Douglas</inline> Haig issued his famous order, "Englishmen, our backs are to the wall." When I arrived, our backs were to the wall no  longer. The Germans began their retreat. Before my advent, scarcely a ship could, pass up the Channel. After my advent, the Channel was safe. Before I was there, British cities were bombed from aeroplanes. Once I got there, they were bombed no more. Thus the change took place everywhere. My honorable friend has also told the House of the magnificent advice he tendered to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> It is evident that we sent the wrong mau. We should have sent, not the Prime Minister, but the man who is capable of giving him advice, to negotiate on behalf of this country. I also tendered my advice, and that also was accepted. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member has dared even at this late hour, and with the experience of this war, to cast a slander upon a body of Australian citizens by saying that Australia failed in its duty and its obligations to the Empire in this great crisis. Whatever may have been the shortcomings of this country, at least it did its duty as much as any other part of the Empire. Regarding the great throw-Back of the Fifth Army, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Douglas</inline> Haig, in his communication to the British Government - a communication that was then suppressed, and only published at a much later date - admits, speaking not of the Australian Army, but of the Army of Great Britain, where conscription, was a fact, that the Fifth Army was at less than half its strength. Was that our fault ? It happened, and it simply proves that it is impossible, even under the best administration, to keep a particular line always at its full strength. No man discredits Australia more than he who dares to say, at this hour of the day, that this country, far distant from the scene of battle, did. not contribute a6 much, by means of a voluntary system, in manly vigour and valour, in dead and wounded, as any other country that took part in the great struggle which has just ended. And what has been the reward? I assert still that militarism does engender evil. It brutalizes men. While there are many fine officers in every army and on every ship, there are also men who are not so good and not so humane. I say deliberately, without going into details, that it is a demonstrable fact, upon which there is a multiplicity of evidence, that many of the soldiery, after honorably fulfilling their obligations to their country, have been brutally ill-treated by their superiors. After risking their lives for their country, they have been subjected to the most ignominious punishments, for offences which, compared with their records, should have been regarded as trivial. Take the case of those young sailors on a warship which recently returned to Australia. After four years of tense struggle in the North Sea. they returned to Perth. Something happened there which made them feel discontented. They thought they were not being treated properly. The officers could go ashore and fly around, but had absolutely no con'sideration for the large tody of men who had been penned up on the ship week after week. One man who won the honours and decorations of his country for his valour at Zeebrugge was stripped of every honour, and at this very hour is in one of the penitentiaries of this country simply because he violated an order given to him. He offended against the rules and regulations by which alone order can be maintained; but, after all that .these men have done for their country, the punishment for a violation of regulations should be tempered with wisdom and humanity. Honorable members opposite do not say that. ' They have no protest to make. They have neither interest in nor sympathy for these poor devils. This is their Government, and they support it. Amongst all the great newspapers of this country, not one raised a voice for these men. That fact stands to the condemnation of the newspapers of Australia, and of every man who occupies a seat in this Chamber and remains silent upon this issue. Not one of us who fails to protest against the treatment of those men can hold himself free of responsibility. I put my protest on record. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley)</inline> referred to the Paul Freeman  case. I do not propose to take up time  in dealing with the grievances of an individual. I have no complaint to make ; no denunciation to offer. I merely present a few facts, which also go on record. We have in this country for years invited men of all European nationalities to come here and enjoy the liberties of this land and the riches it has to offer. We have said to them, " Come and help to build up this country," Then the Government step in and say, " "You can stay here so long as you are silent, or, if you speak, you must speak only as we wish you to speak. You may ' scab ' on your fellow workmen, and we shall support you with the bayonets cf our soldiery and the batons of our police." On the other hand, if a man holds an opinion contrary to those of the ruling classes of this country, if he dares to offer opposition to their opinions and aspirations, and to take a part in the struggles of the working man, he is treated as an alien. The governmental authorities take him out of his bed at night, tear him away from his women .and children, put him on board some ship, and transport him where no man knows. That is one of the acts of which the Government are guilty. </para>
                    <para>Let us come back to the plea made in regard to the treatment of Freeman. What is the matter with Paul Freeman? I asked in this House the other day whether the man had been afforded an opportunity to prove his innocence. To that inquiry there was mo answer. Ministers will not answer the question. They simply say that he has been suspect ; that he has offended. They say that he has represented himself to be an American, and that he has offended against the laws in -regard to registration. In that respect he is in the position of thousands of others. Many hundreds of men have failed to comply with the law as to registration, and for that failure have been properly fined. Neglect to comply with that law is a punishable offence, but it is not one that makes a man  seizable  and liable to be deported without resort to law or trial before Judge or jury. When they have no further excuse, the authorities say, "We have reliable testimony that this man said so-and-so and so-and-so; that he said that a man who went to the war was lower than a dog." If he made such a statement, he should be punished. It was an improper statement to make, and the person uttering it should be punished, but by due process of law. </para>
                    <para class="block">There should be some regard to that principle of British justice which decrees that every man charged with an offence shall at least have the right to defend himself. It would seem, however, that every man is to be the subject of a mere spy system carried on by somebody who behind the door whispers the name of a man and condemns him. Under such a system we have perpetrated here all the horrors of the Inquisition - all the horrors of the star chamber system re-enacted in the name of liberty ! </para>
                    <para>In this very city a man was sent to gaol for six months because he said, in course of private conversation with another man, " If you are going to- the war you are sillier than a rabbit." For that statement he was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. If Freeman, made the statement attributed to him, then he, too, should receive six months' imprisonment. The authorities say, however, in further explanation of .their treatment of Paul Freeman, " We have reliable testimony that this man is not an American, as he represents himself to be. We have reliable testimony that he is a German." If he is, then by all means punish him. If the authorities had reliable testimony that he was a German, although he represented himself to he an American, why did they not put him into an internment camp? If they had reliable testimony that he had given false testimony in declaring that he was an American, why did they send him to the United States of America? They sent him there because of the evidence they had, and now, having asserted that they have reliable testimony that he is a German, they are proceeding to make inquiries. What for? They are making inquiries to ascertain if he is what they say he is, and until they get some evidence from overseas this man is to be kept in gaol. </para>
                    <para>This is the sort of thing to which the supporters of the Government give their indorsement. This kind of treatment is applied, not merely to the alien population of this country, but to Englishmen. It applies to men of our own race and blood. The authorities, for some unknown reason, and without any explanation, have seized upon sons of our own soil, and by the exercise of an arbitrary authority as bitter and savage and ferocious as anything ever heard of have put them into internment camps, together with Germans. In this way these men have been condemned at once in the. eyes of their fellow men, and have been subjected to brutal treatment by people who have feelings of national hostility towards them. Then, again, in this country men have been seized and brought before a Court, and when that Court has held them innocent - when it has been impossible to find throughout the length and breadth of Australia a Judge to condemn them - they have been taken at dead of night and transported to different pants of the world. This is what the Government have done. </para>
                    <para>Take my own case. I refer to it, not because I need any sympathy or because I worry over the treatment to which I was subjected, but because it illustrates, the actual position. I walked into the' city where I was born, where the mother who bred me lived, where my own brothers and sisters were living, and was suddenly called upon to submit to an interrogation. And why? -Because some unknown individual in Australia, who, as I discovered afterwards, represented himself to be the secretary of a Discharged Soldiers Association and a member of the Commonwealth Public Service, sent a communication to the Old Country. Because of that communication I was called upon to get on the grid-iron. A most peculiar feature of my case was that, apparently, the authorities did not seem to know that I was a member of the Commonwealth Parliament. My public position saved me, but God help the man who had not that status or means to call upon. Before I had even been interrogated, before I had been called into Scotland Yard, and subjected to examination by the military and private detectives of England, I had been recommended for deportation by an Australian officer in London. And this before I had even been asked for an explanation. I was to be deported from the land in which I was born, to the land in which I had spent a life's domicile. That which England could do to me this country can also do. This Government can send a man out of this country on the ground that it is not has domicile. They can send him to the land of his birth, or wherever they chose to cast him. Thus an Englishman, whose blood has been spilt in building up the Empire, because he has dared to stand up against their odious institutions, because he curses that particular system that has condemned millions of Englishmen to the most abject poverty, may be subjected to an odious inquisition by the classes that rule. Heaven help the man who occupied the position that I did - who had been recommended for deportation without even an explanation - if his position were less fortunate than my own. </para>
                    <para class="block">As with me, so with other poor devils who have been in this country. What have the Government done with Thomas Barker, an Englishman, a man. who had been a soldier, who had served his Empire under Indian skies? He came to this country, identified with a particular doctrine. According to British traditions that man should have had- freedom of opinion; he should have been free to express his opinions, however odious they might be, and if his opinions had been accepted by the majority, then, however odious, they would have become the law of the country. Thomas Barker practised, talked, and promulgated doctrines which others have taught in England, and for which others have suffered. The authorities prosecuted him on two counts. He was proceeded against in respect of the issue of two cartoons. One of these cartoons was accompanied with the declaration, "  Capitalists,  politicians, and others go to the war, and the working man wall follow." The other showed how Australian soldiers were subjected to a system of crucifixion. He created a strong public protest in this, country against that system. He was the origin of that protest. He knew of the system because he had been a soldier, and out of his actions sprang a public agitation against it. The Government at last had to make overtures to the British authorities, and Lloyd George promised that the punishment of crucifixion should not be imposed upon Australian soldiers. Tom Barker, however, was sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment in respect of each charge. In the one case the outcry against his imprisonment was so great that the Government released him, and in the other the Supreme Court ordered his release, because the charge preferred against him was without legal foundation. Then the Government, finding that this man had committed no offence against the laws and institutions of this country, seized him at dead of night and transported him to an island in the South Pacific. </para>
                    <para>Take the case of the man Simonoff. For what does he stand? What has he done? It is true that he is a Russian. It is true, also, that he was invited to this country, and that if he had been a " scab " or an anti-Radical he would have been supported and protected by the batons of the police. Had he been the representative of Czardom he could have remained here. As it was, he was the representative in this country of the Soviet Government. And what did the National Government do with him ? They cast him into gaol, and there they have kept him. I make no complaint. Some supporters of the Government propose to amend the law. I say, " Don't." This modern system of official capitalism, which is more odious in its operation upon freedom and Democracy than anything of the Dark Ages, is a violation of all the traditions of British liberty. It is a violation of the principle of British law that a man accused shall be delivered up for cross-examination, and shall have the right to defend himself. Even England in the darkest hours of its history was never guilty of that which in free Australia and in modern England is being done to-day. In the bloody days of Castlereagh, in the days of the Star Chamber, in the days of the Inquisition, every man had the right at least to ventilate his views; but here there is no such thing. </para>
                    <para>It is useless to cry or whine about this law; it has been enacted. In the very first year of the war the War Precautions Bill was introduced. I opposed it, and because of it sat apart from my own party, which was then in power. The then Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> said that my objections were preposterous, and so described the agitation against it which was carried on by a few. of us. At last the Bill was passed, and became law. </para>
                    <para class="block">But it is supposed to be a fundamental principle of even the War Precautions Act that every man charged with an offence under it shall have the right of trial. If I remember rightly, some of the amendments which we moved with that object in view were recast for that very purpose. One of the condemnations made of me was that I would not accept a promise. But what was done ? </para>

The Government, however, have twisted and distorted that requirement of the War Precautions Act by means of the Unlawful Associations Act. I do not resent it. I say to the Government, " Keep the Act on the statute-book, not merely as a war measure, but as a peace measure.." I declare, however, in the name of God, that if ever I get power in this country that measure, if repealed, shall be re-enacted. And, by God ! those who support it to-day shall have the benefits of its principles. </para>

This is not a day merely of legislation; the world is a marching army. Our soldiers are coming back, and the Government cannot cope with them. The honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming)</inline> has told us about fields going out of cultivation ; and that also is just one of the processes of the war. In the older countries there has been a vast absorption of capital into wasteful processes, and, with the disappearance of that capital, the supervision of industry has disappeared. The present system cannot meet the situation; and since work cannot be found for the growing masses, we are inevitably confronted with revolution which neither this Government nor any other can. avoid. </para>

                        <para>. - It is one of the evidences of the bad case of the Government that they have no reply to such a charge as the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> has laid against them. Ministers sit opposite in sweet, smug complacency, . smiling when incontrovertible evidence is submitted of the introduction of Prussianism into Australia, and of such occurrences as give the lie to every statement they have made in favour of Democracy. There is, I say, no reply, except a resolution  of the party congratulating the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. "Watt)</inline> and . his Ministers, on the " admirable manner " in which the affairs of the country are being administered. The Acting Prime Minister this afternoon was quite in his best form, so far as regards the Government attitude towards those great questions which are agitating the public mind. He had nothing but insults, sneers, and gibes for honorable members On this side, and so with his henchman the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming).</inline> The Acting Prime Minister said that the motion of no-confidence submitted on behalf of the Labour party, which is a reply to the Government party's resolution to which I have just referred, is a waste of time, a theatrical display, and an empty proposition. That is the attitude that is going to bring discredit on this country, for it shows that the Government refuse to take the business of the country seriously. We are told that it is a waste of time for this Parliament to talk about the cost of living and of how people are being robbed, to discuss the question of deportations of Australian people without trial, the imprisonment of men without trial, and the arrest of men without any charge being laid against them. The Acting Prime Minister says that it is a waste of time for' Parliament to consider the treatment of returned soldiers. There was plenty of talk on the Government side about the bravery of the men when they went away, but we receive nothing but insults and sneers when we wish to discuss the circumstances of their coming back. We are told that it is a waste of time for Parliament to discuss what ought to be considered to-day more than anything else, namely, how to so adjust the affairs of the country as to bring about peace and harmony instead of discord. It is said to be a waste of time, to talk about the flogging of Australian sailors on the <inline font-style="italic">Australia,</inline> or their treatment on board the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane,</inline> or to discuss the flogging of natives in Papua. The amendment we are told, is an empty proposition; and yet the Government warty pass a resolution expressing hearty approval of the  ' admirable manner ' ' in which the Acting Prime Minister carries on the government of the country. </para>

                    <para>I am most anxious to-night to confine myself to one particular point. This debate offers very attractive and tempting opportunities to discuss many aspects of what I consider to be, not only maladministration, but government' distinctly inimical to the  welfare of this community. There is no doubt that today we are living in circumstances that cause the most , careless or indifferent citizen to wonder what is going to be the end of the troubles confronting us. This Parliament has re-assembled in the face of industrial unrest and economic disturbance throughout the whole community ; and Australia is not alone in this respect, because the whole world is convulsed. The war is over with Germany, but there has been a transference of the war spirit to other issues. We meet with full knowledge of all those unfortunate events that are stirring the heart of the world, and causing no end of trouble, disturbance, and bloodshed. There is no appearance of peace, and yet there is not one statement in the whole of the proposals put forward by the Government that makes for peace in this country. That is the point to which I desire to devote myself. </para>
                    <para>There are no fewer than fifteen items referred to in the statement submitted by the Acting Prime Minister when the House re-assembled. We are told of the Peace Conference, demobilization, repatriation, influenza, war debts, Commonwealth, steamers, the visit of Admiral Jellicoe, economy in administration, wheat matters, metals, arbitration, price fixing, War Precautions Act, the coal business, and also of proposals in regard to new legislation. But in the whole catalogue there is not one item that makes for peace in this country, or one that even gives the semblance of helpfulness towards that harmony in the community which is so absolutely essential at the present time if Australia is to do her best and be able to overcome the handicaps imposed by the war. We have these peculiar conditions prevailing all over the world, and our only hope of overcoming the difficulties is to find out what is at the root of them. There must be some reason, some fundamental principle at stake that sets the peoples of the world at each other in the manner we have evidence of to-day. There must be some violent conflicts of opinion on great questions that cause the people of Australia to be divided as they are at present. What are those? I think the principal is what the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> mentioned- that there is only one opinion to be tolerated, and only one view of events to be allowed, only one voice to be heard, and only one song to be sung. We have evidence that the Government of this country is carried on, not to try and discover the best that is in the country or what is for the safety of the country, but to discover that_ which is for the safety of the Government. It was freely said, and quite openly claimed, that the war elections, although designated the win-the-war elections, were really a matter of winning the elections - that was all the Government cared about. Right through the whole of this Government's control of affairs they have not sought to discover how they can reconcile the conflicting elements in the community; and, whether intentionally or otherwise, they have succeeded in intensifying every feeling of opposition and antagonism that is rampant in all sections of the community. There is not a section of the community, religious, social, political, moral, economic, or any other, in which the Government have not intensified and embittered these antagonisms. </para>

It is said that this Government have conducted public affairs in an " admirable manner," but this admirable manner has made Australian politics stink in history, and not only abandon every principle for which it ever stood, but fall a victim, to bitterness, strife, and division, which will require a century to remove; indeed, we shall never remove these feelings so long as a Government like the present is in charge. </para>

                    <para>Let me now give some positive statements. During the 1917 election, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> was very careful in pointing ' out that not one stone in the temple of Labour legislation would be interfered with, and those who supported him, especially those who had left the Labour party, were very effusive in their promises of adherence, and loyal adherence to Labour principles. They won the election on this misleading attitude - this camouflage of loyalty and patriotism. There is not an action by the Government, by the Prime Minister, or those honorable, members who once "belonged to the Labour party, that has not been directly and continuously in the direction of interfering with every privilege that Labour has secured in this country. We expected this from members of the Tory party or the old Liberal party, or the National party - they have so many names that one really gets confused - but we did not expect it from  the others. They had made so many protests, and some of them had been so long in the Labour movement, that we did think that their lifelong principles, or, at any rate, the principles they had declared adherence to, would triumph over accidental circumstances. But as soon as the' present Prime Minister and his  party  gained power, they set about  destroying every principle that the trade unions of the country had asserted and acted upon, and every privilege they had secured after years of struggle, and they have never failed to grasp the opportunity to deal a blow at unionism. They have not failed to try to destroy the temple of Labour by rending it stone  from  stone, and if the temp.e hae not been laid in ashes or laid fat, it has not been their fault. And whether we may be able to submit proofs of it or not - of course we should never hope to  be able to submit proofs to the satisfaction of the Government and their supporters - the fact remains that not only in Australia, but ail over the world to-day, there is evidence that employers and supporters of the capitalistic system have decided that there -is to be a war to the death with the workers, and that, once and for all, the trade unions must be grappled with and strangled. In the Mother Country most profuse promises were made that if the workers would volunteer and go to the war, and not only that, but also surrender their trade union privileges for the time being in the munition factories, every privilege they had gained would be restored after the war, and a new heaven  and earth would be built up. They were told that thing? would never be the same in England after the war as they had been before. But what is the position to-day? The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> has told us that there are more men proportionately in England to-day than before the war in destitution, without employment, lying about idling and unable to be placed in positions. Press reports indicate that Great Britain's conditions to-day give the lie to the promises <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George gave to the workers when he as'-'ed them  to surrender their privileges. </para>
                    <para>It has been said even to-night- one would have thought that the time had gone past for such statements as the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming)</inline> made - that the supporters of the Labour party have not loyally stood by their country. Every statement, official or otherwise, and all the figures that have been submitted, go to prove that it is the workers not only of Australia, but of every country engaged in the war, who have had to bear  the burden of the war and do the fighting. Whether there were conscript countries or whether it was Australia, the only country which sent a volunteer army to the war, the workers have been the backbone of the forces »»iq:aged in fighting, and if it had not been for their loyal, steadfast adherence to the things for which they believed our Empire stood during the war, armies would never have been raised in the British Empire or in any other country. Yet while these men have been away fighting, their wives and children at home have been robbed, the trade unions have been attacked, bureaux have been opened to enroll "scabs" to take their places, profiteers have been at large, and landlords have attacked their wives and children and ejected them; and those who have been spared to come back have returned to find their wives and children much worse off than they were before, and that there is no hope of redress for them. The Government say that the- administration of the country has been carried on in an admirable manner, and we are told in this precious statement that the work of repatriation has proceeded swiftly and satisfactorily. No branch of any Returned Soldiers' League will subscribe to that assertion. I challenge the Government to ask the Returned Soldiers'. League to indorse' it. One has only to look at the Repatriation Offices or hear the tales of returned soldiers to ascertain the truth. There is not an honorable member who has not amongst his correspondence a very large proportion of letters dealing with the claims, difficulties, and troubles of returned soldiers, also with the claims of the widows, wives, and mothers. A never-ending series of appeals is addressed to honorable members on behalf of returned soldiers. Yet' the Acting Prime. Minister says that the Opposition are wasting time in calling attention to these matters, and the Government party say that the administration is being carried on in an admirable manner. </para>
                    <para>This precious statement says that owing to the price-fixing policy of the Government, the people of this country have been saved  millions  of pounds sterling. Yet the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming)</inline> has just told us that this same policy has increased the cost of living. The honorable member attacked the Government severely to-night on the wheat question, the wool question, and the cost of living, yet he supported the resolution which expressed approval of the " admirable manner " in which the government of the country had been carried on. Following on the statement of the Acting Prime Minister that price-fixing had been successful, we have in the Ministerial statement the announcement that the Government have decided to surrender their price-fixing methods. The thing which is good, according to the Government's own statement, is so good that they propose to give it up. Immediately the Government withdrew the embargo on the exportation of hides, the price of leather advanced, and the price of boots and shoes advanced. They were not affected by the removal of the embargo to the extent of a single fraction, yet all the stocks held were immediately advanced in price, and the workers had to pay more. The Government are so enamoured of the scheme of price-fixing, and so proud of their method, which saved the country millions of pounds, that they immediately proposed to abandon it. In whose interests? Not in the interests of the people; not in the interests of the consumers; it can only be in the interests of the profiteers and manufacturers. One could only expect it from this Government, because they have to sing the song of the people who sent them here. They know quite well that once they oppose the profiteers and the commercial robbers of this country, their days as a Government will be very short. However, there is a greater power in any community than commercial magnates, financial kings, wool barons, or meat lords, and one of these days, not only in other countries, but also here in Australia, there will be a rising of the Democracy that will sweep the present system out of existence. </para>

                            <para>- They have not. The capitalistic system has outlived its time. Intelligent men who are opposed to the Labour party admit that some new system must be brought into existence. They say that the workers have not had a fair share, and that the affairs of the world are not being conducted on proper lines. How is all this to be changed? We have the choice of two methods - bloody revolution, such as has had, unfortunately, to be adopted in Russia, or a constitutional revolution. Apparently, the Government party are against both methods. They have expressed themselves, as I express myself, against anything in the nature of a revolution by force, but they have also taken the first step to prevent the people of Australia from exercising their rights freely at the ballot-box. Right through the war they have interfered with the electoral laws of the Commonwealth. They have a new proposal in the shape of preferential voting. </para>

                    <para>The economic position in this country is easily the most important question we ought to be considering, and the necessity for discussing if disproves entirely the suggestion of the Acting Prime Minister that we are wasting time. The only proposal put forward by the Government in connexion with the existing industrial trouble is to do nothing. The Ministerial Statement says that there is elaborate legislative machinery to settle industrial disputes; it refers to the fact that the seamen have struck work and thrown idle the whole of the Commonwealth shipping, and that the strike is causing great unemployment; and then it says, " The Government can offer no concession." Is that a fair position for any Government to take up in the face of such a crisis as that which we are now facing? I may be overstating the gravity of the case, I may be exaggerating the seriousness of the position, but when we read even what the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> will print as to the scenes at the Trades Hall, the destitution, starvation, privation, want, and' misery displayed when relief is being distributed at places where food and blankets are given out, it appears to me that all our talk here about a lot of useless and comparatively trivial matters is a waste of time while this festering, running sore is allowed to continue. "What are the Government going to do? They will offer no concessions. They will do nothing. The seamen and their wives and children can starve, the whole of the industries of this country can be thrown out of gear, everything can be closed up, the lights can be put out, the fires go down, and the homes be broken, but the Government will offer no concession. The Acting Prime Minister says that the Ministerial party not only express their hearty approval of the " admirable manner " in which the administration has been carried on, but also express their approval of this policy - a policy of no concession, a policy of stand and deliver. </para>

I never yet knew a trade union which, in the eyes of an anti-Labour Government, was in the right. I have never known a strike yet that was justified from their point of view. Never once have such a Government admitted that the union was right. The union, in their view, is always wrong, no matter whether it is right or wrong. </para>

                        <para>At present the approach to this Court is through a veritable Serbonian bog of technicalities, and the bog is extending. After full consideration T must state it as my opinion that these decisions as to the limits of the Court's power will make it impracticable to frame awards that will work - will entail, indeed, a gradual paralysis of the functions of the Court. Yet this Court, if it be trusted, and unless it can be trusted it ought not to exist, shows magnificent promise of usefulness to the public. It is in a position to solve problems which cannot be solved, to settle disputes which cannot be settled by any tribunal except one that has authority in all parts of Australia. In this very case I showed that in industries where there is Inter-State, competition, the State Wages Boards confessedly cannot do justice. </para>

He had not been able to take any evidence as to the merits of the claim, but had had to confine his attention to certain legal conundrums. The three weeks had been mainly taken up with- matters all devoid of private benefit or public use. except as bearing on the barren issue. But as had been shown in other cases, as well as the present, the cost and delay of arbitration proceedings before the Court were chiefly due, not to the inquiry as to the merits of the dispute, but to the efforts of some respondents to prevent any arbitration at all. He said this, not as assuming any right to blame them, for they were entitled to avail themselves of the provisions of the law as it stood, but because he conceived it to be his duty to inform the public as to the working of the Act, an Act which touched the public more widely and more intimately than perhaps any other Act, an Act which was meant for practical purposes of the public peace, and not for a game of ingenious wordsplitting. </para>

When a dispute could be twisted into a plaint extending over more than one State the manufacturers app'eared before the august presence at a tribunal whose  president  had such an opinion of manufacturers and employers as to dub them " highwaymen who had their pistols at the heads of the unfortunate wayfarer, the working man." (Laughter.) In pronouncing judgment he quoted poetry, thus discovering new and undiscovered laws to political economy. The Judge affirmed that his supreme care was to avoid friction - to achieve which more than justice was done to one side. (Applause.)  His  recent judgment in the waterside workers' dispute would probably start a succession of impossible claims threatening the very existence of many industries If manufacturers were asked whether they would welcome the reappointment of this poet-political  President  of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Courts they would cry almost with one voice, " Send us the earthquake instead." That at least would' bring them to the ground 'at once; the other process was slow torture. </para>

                        <para>Notwithstanding its ' drawbacks, we look upon arbitration as a civilized system of obtaining justice between all citizens with the minimum disturbance of industrial relationship and the minimum of distress. The present position is intolerable, approaching robbery of hard-earned money. Our aim is industrial peace. But to delay justice is to deny it. Uncertain law is no law. The present Serbonian bog of legal technicalities ruins the unions and is a mockery of justice. To rob the workers of their strenuous earnings in order that they may win through the artificial technicalities of the Courts defeats the very purpose and object of the law. If parties to a dispute cannot get grievances redressed by the Court they will readily resort to the only courses open to thom - strikes and lock-outs. We desire, therefore, the widest possible opportunity to be afforded to all workers and employers to approach the Arbitration Court, and this policy we shall give effect to if returned. </para>

                            <para>- I am not suggesting what the concessions ought to be. I gladly admit that after the Ministerial statement, made last Wednesday, when the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> said, " We will offer no concession," and that the matter so far as the Government were concerned was closed ; a change has1 come over the scene. To-day the Acting Prime Minister has. stated that the Government are again opening the way towards a settlement of the dispute. </para>

                    <para>May I put before the House the position of the seamen ? Many supporters of the Government are simply content to accept the one-sided party view given by the press. They do not think it possible for the seamen in this instance to have a legitimate grievance. I have pointed out how not only the  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, but the employers right through have shown the failure and the certainty of trouble arising from the operations of the .Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins should have been protected long ago from the attacks that have been made upon him. I believe that the employees, when the Conciliation and Arbitration Court was established, made honest efforts to use it to improve their conditions. But the workers have lost faith in that Court. The  President  of the Court himself said some time ago that the operations of the Court would be paralyzed. What <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins told us in 1910 has come true in 1919. </para>

                            <para>- I shall tell the House what he says, and also what the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> has said. I remind honorable members that the - seamen have tried the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and that it is not their fault that it is not being used now as a means of settling the present dispute. Because of the peculiar operation of the Act, it has been practically impossible for the seamen .to get near that Court with any degree of satisfaction. There is not only the delay and cost, but also, the obstructive tactics of the shipping people, and, later still, the peculiar attitude of the Shipping Comptroller, acting under the direct instructions of the Government. The seamen are fighting, .not an industrial matter, but a political battle. They could have settled this dispute long ago had they been left free to deal either with the shipping companies or with the Shipping Comptroller. But the Government have taken the control of shipping out of the hands of the shipping companies, and have placed it under the Comptroller of Shipping. They have given such instructions to the Comptroller of Shipping that the trouble has degenerated into, not an industrial, but a political question. </para>

                        <para>As recently as December last year the seamen came away from the Arbitration Court with an award which we considered unjust and unfair. At that time we asked for a 50 per cent, increase on our then rate of wages, and the Court granted us what was an equivalent to only a 11 per cent, increase. Immediately the decision of the Court became known to the members of the Union, disappointment found expression amongst the members throughout the Commonwealth, and resolutions were adopted by a number of branches disagreeing to the award, and, in one instance, repudiating it. The men determined, further,- that arbitration as in operation throughout the Arbitration Court as a method of redress left so little for the seamen to hope for that they resolved to appeal to it no more. </para>

Negotiations were opened up with the Shipping Comptroller (Admiral Clarkson), early in February. Those negotiations had the effect of inducing Admiral Clarkson to grant a conference with the representatives of the seamen on 4th March, but, unfortunately, the Shipping Comptroller contracted influenza, and the conference had to be postponed. An interview was, however, at Admiral Clarkson's request, held at his residence, and the situation generally was reviewed. _ A promise was given to us that all the conditions of the seamen's life would be made the subject of a conference which he, Admiral Clarkson, would convene at an early date.

The Acting Prime Minister said the other day, in regard to the Court, that in the Federal Convention the " big men " fought for and obtained the establishment of the principle of the settlement of industrial disputes by law, and yet there had been 647 strikes during 1914-5.-6-7. </para>

                            <para>- I am very proud to belong to a mob that repudiates the suggestion that the Government of the country, with its long catalogue of deportations, imprisonments, and fines, is being carried on in an " admirable manner." The seamen are said to be adopting unconstitutional means. If so, from whom did they learn them ? Who are responsible for the adoption of unconstitutional methods? The Government, during the war, adopted, and propose to continue the adoption, of methods of dealing with the affairs of the country that are in violation of every principle of our Constitution. I do not refer to what the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> has said about the violation of British justice, or the violation of that democratic idea that is supposed to be embodied in British communities. We have heard a lot about that matter - more, perhaps, than honorable members opposite care to hear ; though they have not heard the last of it yet. From whom do the unions learn the value of ultra-constitutional methods? Who has violated consistently the Constitution of this country during the war? The Government; and I shall give one illustration. Section 41 of the Constitution provides - </para>

I admit that it is a most unfortunate and regrettable position to arrive at when the Arbitration Court is turned down by the workers. </para>

                            <para>- The High Court is not trusted by the workers, and they do not believe that they will get justice in either Court. The fact is there, and the question is, how is it ? And not only how is it that we have arrived at that position, but how can we improve matters. The Government have thrown down the challenge to the trade unions, and the trade unions will not hesitate to take it up. If the Government are going to fight the trade unions, very well, let it be war, and we shall see who wins. If the workers of the country are forced into direct action, the' Government will have to take the consequences of direct action. </para>

' All along the attitude of the Government, up to the submission of a policy speech, has been one of challenge to the unions. The position of the Government is "We will offer no concessions. </para>

There has' been the opening of loyalist bureaux ; the protection of loyalist workers and promises to them, and the Government have even gone to the length, as I said before, of supplying from the Repatriation Department men to take the place of others on strike. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable gentleman has not, perhaps to my disadvantage, heard the argument I put up that the employers have all along obstructed the Court in its operations. The  President  of the Court pointed out, in 1910 and 1911, that the functions of the Court were being paralyzed by legal technicalities. Honorable members well remember that when the Labour party proposed to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine said that it needed amending, because the Court argued as to the meaning of the word conciliation and the meaning of the word arbitration, and as to what was meant by " preventing" a dispute or " settling " a dispute. He said that the Court would argue for days as to whether there was a dispute or not, and that employers and employees had become so disgusted with the delays and expenses of the Arbitration Court that it was a discredited institution. The seamen decided, after their experience of the Court last December, that it was of no use to them as a. means of obtaining redress. It is a most unfortunate circumstance, but it is only unfortunate because this Parliament and the country have refused to recognise the danger of allowing arbitration to be a discredited policy, and of allowing the Arbitration Court to become a discredited institution, and because we are not taking steps to make the industrial laws of this country effective for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes. </para>

                            <para>- Of course it does, and it is a peculiar circumstance that in regard to the Arbitration Court both employers and employees are agreed that its functions are neither useful nor effective. When an award is made, the workers complain that the employers try to get behind it, and the employers complain that the employees are trying to get behind it; the agreement is not binding on one side or the other. We have degenerated into a most unfortunate position in regard to arbitration. </para>

                            <para>- There is not an honorable member of this House who does not believe in the principle of arbitration, not only in the matter of industrial disputes, but also in the matter of international disputes; but one has to deal, not with theories, but with facts; and the facts lead us to realize that on both sides the Arbitration Court is declared a failure, and that our arbitration laws are declared useless. Are we to allow such a condition of affairs to continue? If the Arbitration Act amendment outlined in the policy speech is to follow suggestions which have been made to open wide the doors of the Arbitration Court to all sorts and kinds of unions, there will only be more trouble, disaster, sorrow, and misery. It is because I wish to avoid this that I make my speech tonight. I have confined myself to this subject because I believe that it is easily the most pressing and urgent reform required in Australia to-day. </para>

                    <para>We have a load of debt, and we can only carry it as we so arrange the industrial operations of this country to produce the maximum it is possible for Australia to produce. We must so organize our industrial affairs as to create and make <inline font-style="italic">money</inline> in this country. Otherwise we shall be in a fearful financial mess. I have no fear as to the courage of the Australian people in these matters, but I do fear very much that, unless a better feeling is instilled into the community, we are going to reach disaster instead of harmony. Unless some satisfaction is given to the workers of the country, unless they know they are going to get a better deal than before, there is going to be trouble. Unless a better method of settling industrial disputes is devised than that of the present Arbitration Court, the workers will feel that there is only one thing for them to do - what the seamen have done. It is most regrettable, but there is no other course open to men who are dissatisfied with the Arbitration Court. In any case they are only adopting the methods of the profiteers and manufacturers, the men who support Ministerialists and keep them in office, those who adopt direct action in regard to the cost of living and the price of goods and of every article that the people of the country have to use. It is because I do not believe in direct action that I want the Government to consider how they can amend the arbitration laws in order to make the Arbitration Court useful. Honorable members opposite may laugh, but it is no laughing matter to us. </para>

                            <para>- Let the honorable member make no mistake about it. Today in Australia, as in every other country, the cry is " Bread or Bolshevism." That was the cry in Germany the other day. It is useless attempting to throw dust in each other's eyes. We are up against it. What is it to be ? Peace or war? Are the capitalists of this country or other countries to surrender part of their robberies and give the workers a fair deal, or are they going to fight them ? The war is on, and I hope that in Australia we shall settle it on civilized Christian lines, and not on the lines adopted in some other countries. We can do it. If the Government are willing, we can settle these things on constitutional lines, but Ministers are making it mighty hard for us. </para>

                            <para>- We cannot go on the platforms of the country and say' that we approve of the " admirable manner " in which the affairs of the country are being administered. How can we justify the deportations that are taking place or the internment of Australian citizens ? How can we tell the people that it is not true when it is only Labour supporters or opponents of the Government who are being seized and ill-treated and when we know that the Government are exercising an evident discretion in favour of their own supporters, the profiteers, by removing the price-fixing regulations and giving a free field and every favour to those who all through the war, and even more so to-day, have shown their readiness to rob the widows and children of the country in the matter of the price of goods and the cost of things generally ? We are asked to approve of this. We cannot do so. That is why we have launched this amendment. It may seem a waste of time to Ministerialists, but these matters are near to us, and touch us very keenly. It hurts us to see men on strike going about the streets with nothing to do, because idle men and hungry men are dangerous. </para>

                            <para>- There is no lack of them. Any branch of the Returned Soldiers League will deny that the Repatriation Department is working swiftly or smoothly, or that returned soldiers are not being allowed to go about destitute. Honorable members are inundated with appeals for the consideration of such cases. A man with a wife and children is asked to live on something like £2 per week. </para>

                    <para>We want to transfer the aptitude, resourcefulness, and courage to which I have referred to civil affairs. We want our soldiers to bring into civil life those virtues and those heroic qualities which have made their name so famous, and which will stand to them right through history. Yet the attitude of the Government is such as to destroy in them the best which they have developed in the war, and to encourage in them only the worst. I believe there is a bright future for Australia if the forces of the community are united, if bitterness is cut out, and if there is a cessation of insults. To-night, the very first remark of the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming)</inline> was an insult to every honorable member on this side. Are we going to stand it? I do not propose to do so. While the war was on I put up with a good deal, but now that the war is over there is not a man in this House who is going to insult me. I shall fight honorable members opposite at every opportunity so long as they continue to do these things. No man on that side will be allowed to hurl at me any charge of disloyalty without challenge. What my comrades do is their own business but so far as I am concerned there will be a row in this House every time the party opposite carry on that kind of fighting. If you, sir, so desire, I am prepared to be sent outside, but I am determined that neither the honorable member for Robertson nor any other honorable member on that side shall continue to hurl these abominable insults across the chamber, either at me or my colleagues, without protest. Are honorable members opposite going to give up that kind of thing so that we may unite for the good government of this country] </para>

                    <para>July 1st. My telegrams June 18th, June 28th. Peace celebrations.  Following  proclamation has been issued  today: </para>
                    <para>By the King, a Proclamation, George R.I. Whereas it has pleased Almighty God to bring to a close the late widespread and sanguinary war, in which we were engaged against Germany and her Allies, we therefore, adoring the Divine goodness and duly considering that the great and general blessings of peace do call for public and solemn acknowledgment, have thought fit, by and with the advice of our Privy Council, to issue this our Royal Proclamation hereby appointing and commanding that a general thanksgiving to Almighty God for these His manifold and great mercies be observed throughout our Dominions on Sunday, the sixth day of July; and for the better and more devout solemnization of the same we have given directions to the most reverend the archbishops and the right reverend the bishops of England to compose a form of prayer suitable to this occasion to be used in all churches and chapels, and to take care for the timely dispersing of the same throughout their respective dioceses : and to the same end we do further advertise and exhort the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and all spiritual authorities and ministers of religion in their respective churches and other places of public worship throughout our United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and in all quarters of our Dominions beyond the seas to take part, as it may properly behove them to do, in this great and common act of worship, and we do strictly charge and command that the said public day of thanksgiving be religiously observed by all as they tender the favour of Almighty God; and have the sense of His benefits. </para>
                    <para>Given at our Court at Buckingham Palace this first day of July, in the year of our Lord One thousand nine hundred and nineteen, and in the tenth year of our reign. </para>
                    <para class="block">God save the King ! </para>
                    <para>Please arrange for publication at once. It is wish of His Majesty that all parts of the Empire should, as far as possible, unite in observing July 6th as day of thanksgiving. Reason for alteration of date from that previously proposed is to approximate day of general thanksgiving as nearly as possible to date of signatures of peace with Germany. Further telegram will be sent as to Peace celebrations generally. </para>
                    <para class="block">The further telegram referred to is as follows :  - 1st July. - With reference to my telegram 1st July, Proclamation general thanksgiving. As date of religious ceremony put forward, thought desirable fix earlier date Peace celebrations generally, and accordingly decided, with  His  Majesty's sanction, hold celebrations United Kingdom, Saturday, 19th July, and to have all celebrations on one day. Hope that all parts of the Empire will join, as far as possible, in celebrating Peace on that day; but it is realized, of course, that this may not be possible in all cases for various local reasons. Much regret that it has been impossible to communicate to you alteration in plans sooner, but decision of  His  Majesty's Government only reached to-day. General opinion here strongly in favour of earlier date. </para>
                    <para class="block">Beyond expressing briefly, but earnestly, the appreciation  I  think of every member of the House of the termination of this great war by the final signature of the Peace Treaty and the proclamation of peace; in which  I  believe the whole nation will spontaneously join,  I  have to add that it is the desire of the Government to fulfil, as far as possible the wish of  His  Majesty and his Ministers.
