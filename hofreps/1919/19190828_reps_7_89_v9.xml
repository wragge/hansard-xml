The statistics show that the average export of hides during the last three months has not been anything like the pre-war average, and that the leather exports during the same period were somewhere about the pre-war level. </para>

The honorable gentleman was not able then to state whether it was intended to bring the local price up to the standard of the London parity. I ask now whether a decision has been arrived at? </para>

                        <para>- As I desire to make a full statement of the position, I ask the leave of the House to do so - <inline font-style="italic">(Leave granted).</inline> On the 26th June last I made a statement regarding the embargo that had been placed on the importation of sheep dip. In the course of that statement I said that " for some time the Australasian general manager of Messrs. Cooper and Nephews was in communication with Messrs. A. Victor Leggo and Company," with a view to the latter firm manufacturing dip in Australia under Cooper's' label." I understand that Messrs. Cooper and Nephews have in a circular letter repeated some statements they made to me in a letter which they addressed to me on the 15th July last. In that letter they quoted the statement which I have just read, and then went on to say - </para>

                        <para>I would respectfully inform you that Messrs. A. Victor Leggo and Company were never approached by me, or any representative of my firm, to manufacture sheep dip under Cooper's label. </para>
                        <para>In June, 1918, I interviewed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Leggo</inline> with quite a different object, and as at that time neither I nor any member of the Cooper organization had ever seen a packet of the sheep dip produced by Messrs. Leggo and Company, nor had we ever heard of a single instance of it being used, we were not in a position to form any opinion of the merits of that article or the qualifications of Messrs. Leggo and Company as dip manufacturers. </para>

                        <para>We beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, addressed to our manager at Sydney, and to say that the evidence in our possession, put on record at the time, and our full knowledge of all that passed, distinctly confirmed the correctness of the statements contained in his letter to you of the 15th July. In answer to the last paragraph in your letter, the subject discussed upon the occasion in question was the possibility of obtaining supplies of arsenic for the manufacturing by us of dip in Australia. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>Messrs. A.

Leggo that they should supply arsenic to other dip manufacturers at a reasonable price. </para>
                    <para>The idea of any other than ourselves " manufacturing dip in Australia under Cooper's label " has never been in our minds, and we assert most emphatically that it has never been at any time anywhere spoken of or discussed, either amongst ourselves, or by us, or by any one on our behalf, with Messrs. Leggo and Company, or with any one else. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is a pretty emphatic statement from Messrs. Cooper and Nephews. I propose now to give to the House the grounds upon which I made that statement. These are contained in the papers which have already been tabled, and which, consequently, were open to every honorable member of the House and to the press. 1 am going to read from the record which was kept by A. Victor Leggo and Company of the whole of these negotiations, copies of which I have on the departmental file. I will support those records with the original documents, which are in the possession of Messrs. A. Victor Leggo and Company. The first record to which I want to draw the attention of the House is contained in the file, and is the account of an interview between Messrs. A. Victor Leggo and Company and Messrs. Cooper and Nephews, on the 28th May. I will not read the whole of it, because it is lengthy, but it is a brief account of that interview, occupying several hours, in which the whole of this matter was discussed between those two gentlemen. I desire to draw the attention of honorable members to one paragraph in it only. </para>

William Cooper and Nephews and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Victor</inline> Leggo. It is dated 5th June, and reads: - </para>

                            called, and said he had been giving a lot of thought to this matter and he could sec no reason why they should not come to terms on a partnership basis. A. Victor Leggo and Company could do all the manufacturing for the partnership in Australia, and after allowing for its costs on a fair basis, the profits could be equally divided between the two firms. This would suit A. Victor Leggo and Company very well, as they would have the benefit of the Cooper name and selling organization, whilst it would suit Cooper's, who would have an immediate and plentiful supply of dip, and would avoid the expense of having to erect a factory here. Harrowell's opinion is that the partnership would easily command SO per cent, or more of' the Australian trade, and by working together the costs of distributing, selling, advertising, &amp;c, would be much cut down, and the whole arrangements would be more satisfactory to both firms than fighting each other on a cutting competition.

                    <quote>
                        <para>On discussing what name we should call the dip, Harrowell suggested that we could not do better than stick to the- name, " Coopers," as it had been established now over seventy years, and was recognised world-over as the leading dip; in fact, the use of their name would bc one of the chief advantages of the partnership. I pointed out that we had now already put it out as " Vallo," and made broadcast announcements that we were putting our dip out in that name, and I thought it would perhaps bc well if we called it "  Cooper-vallo  " dip, and announced quite frankly that the two firms had joined forces in the Australian trade. He said he did not think this need stand in the way, but he thought his people would want to stick to their own name for it. </para>

                    <para>These are all the cables which it is necessary for me to read. They show very clearly that Messrs. Leggo and Company's statement that they were in active negotiations with the general manager of Messrs. Cooper and Nephews in Australia is absolutely correct. They prove that Messrs. Cooper and Nephews did enter into negotiations with a view to using Messrs. Leggo and Company's organization and plant, and that the latter firm was to manufacture Cooper's dip in Australia. </para>
                    <para>There is only one other matter to which I desire to refer, because, to my mind, it absolutely clinches the statement which I made, and the accuracy of which Messrs.

                            <para>- During the war arrangements were made, which we thought sufficiently drastic, to prevent shipping space from Great Britain being taken up with sheep dip. At that time priority was given to certain cargo, and we advised the British Ministry from time to time as to the goods which were to take priority of despatch to Australia. I am not personally acquainted with the actual details of the matter, but I understand that, notwithstanding the urgent request of the Commonwealth Government that other commodities should take priority over sheep dip, once we had established the local manufacture of it, sheep dip continued to come to Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Some months ago I introduced to the Minister for Trade and Customs a deputation of residents of North Sydney with reference to the removal of the present quarantine station at North Sydney, and the Minister's reply was that the Department was obtaining a report as to the suitability of Port Stephens as a site for a quarantine station. Can the Minister say whether that report has been received ? </para>

The portion which can be made available to the public will be considered immediately the Prime Minister . <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> return. As a matter of fact, it did not come into my hands until last week, and as there are four volumes of it, covering a great many activities in connexion with land preparations for naval defence, it will necessarily require a great deal of consideration on the part of the Government before they can come to a decision as to what action they will take. </para>

But the prices of the majority of the properties that come before the Department are much in excess of the real values, and for that reason the houses are rejected. In such cases we make provision for either the purchase of another house or for the construction of a new one. </para>

                    <para>. - I have already stated clearly my attitude towards that part of the clause which provides for the exclusion of Germans and certain other people from Australia for a period of five years. I do not think that any good purpose will be served by it. Great Britain and the United States of America to-day are trading with Germany, and through such channels much of our produce is finding its way into that country. It is because of this trade that the prices of many of our commodities have been seriously increased. It would seem that, while the Government is going to trade with Germany, it will not allow Germans to come into this country. I do not suppose that any honorable member is as free from German influence as I am. I cannot say that I know of any Germans or descendants of Germans in my electorate. </para>

                        <para>- When the Commerce Bill was before this House, in 1907-8, I endeavoured to secure the insertion of a clause providing that the country of origin should be stamped on all goods and packages in letters of the same size as those used for other markings. A number of warehousemen then urged that it would be absurd to insist upon that requirement, and pointed out that we were doing a very large trade with Germany. I have always opposed the importation of German goods to Australia; hut it would seem that some honorable members opposite, while quite prepared to allow goods of German origin to enter this country, are ready to vote against people of German origin coming in. Under this Bill the Minister will still have power to allow German agents and tourists to come in, and no doubt they will come here and do business. </para>

                        <para>-I admit that it is practically impossible. Now that Great Britain and the United States of America, which offer the largest markets for our products, have agreed to trade with Germany, there is nothing to prevent Australian goods reaching that country. The statistics show that during the war large quantities of Australian productions, including metals, leather, and  hides, were shipped to countries near Germany. I am confident that a lot of them found their way into Germany, and that some of our Australian leather and hides were used for the manufacture of goods for German soldiers. I said last night that this was a piece of political hypocrisy - that, so far as this measure was concerned, the Government were political hypocrites. </para>

                        <para>- But it is admitted that we cannot prevent this trade going on, and I regard the proposal to exclude Germans as a piece of political camouflage. The Government are proposing to do something which they know they cannot do. I am as much opposed to these people as is any one; but, seeing that we are practically shaking hands with them, so far as trade relations are concerned, I do not think that any good object would be served by legislating to exclude them. We are practically saying to Germany, " We will not allow your people to enter our country to compete with our workmen, but you will still be at liberty to send into Australia the products of German factories to compete with those manufactured by our own people." </para>

                        <para>- Then will the shipping companies be compelled to give a free passage to any person who has. arrived in Australia within the last three years, and whom it is desired to deport? I object to retrospective legislation. A shipping company may have brought a man here <inline font-style="italic">bonâ fide</inline> and in the ordinary way, without there being any law in this country to prevent him from landing. If we pass a law now which would have applied to that man if it had been in force when he arrived, can this clause be used to compel the shipping company to take him away again ? I do not think that would be fair, although I hold no brief for the shipping companies. If the law is to be made retrospective for three years, some other Government may make it retrospective for twenty years. </para>

                    <para>.- The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> is really asking me to give a legal opinion. As a matter of administration, we must regard this provision as taking effect from the time it is assented to. The power of exemption is sometimes applied to cases of persons who were wrongly brought in, but whom it would be undesirable to send away at that particular time. What is done is that a bond is taken from the ship-owners or from the person they have left here, to secure them against any possible obligation to take him away.  As  a matter of fact, after the exemption is issued, there  is  no obligation, under the Act as it stands, on the owners of the vessel to take away the person at their expense. The clause applies to men who ought not to have been brought in, because they would be prohibited immigrants. </para>

This provision creates an obligation, and, therefore, it must be regarded as a future one. I believe that is the proper interpretation of the clause. In any case, that will be the line of administration, so that no injury can possibly result. </para>

                <para>The honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fen ton)</inline> asked a question about international relations. We cannot compel a nation of which a man was a citizen to take him in, but nations are bound by international comity, if not by treaties, to accept him. Some treaties exist under which deported persons must be taken by particular countries. Fugitive offenders are dealt with under the specific terms of a treaty. If the treaty is not fulfilled there is a breach of international obligations, which can be enforced only by morality, or, unfortunately, as in the past, by the sword. In future these obligations will be incident to the League of Nations to a great extent. Every civilized nation regards itself as under an obligation to take back deported persons of its nationality or its citizens. Difficulties may arise sometimes as to whether we can deport to a particular place or not. There have been difficulties even with the United States of Amercia, and this measure  has  been to some extent affected by the fact. </para>

                        <para>- That case may have raised a difficulty also, but as a Minister, it being a Defence matter, I do not know much about it. Cases have come under my knowledge of men who are about to be, or have been, deported from another country, and the question arises whether they can remain here or not. I have to decide those cases on grounds of nationality and citizenship - that is, whether this is the country from which they really went, and to which they should be permitted, or not permitted, to return. The only obligation is one dependent on the ordinary rules that apply between nations. </para>

                        <para>- We have an absolute right of refusal, except against persons whose domicile is here. The question arises whether the person deported is really a citizen of this country. If he were sent away three or four months ago from Australia, and then deported from America, the question would arise whether we should allow him back or not. Every one of these cases must be decided on its merits, but the general principle applying between nations is that where a nation deports its own citizens to another country, and that country at once objects, it has a right to object. That, however; is not a legal right, but a right depending upon the practice of international relationship. </para>

People have telephoned me asking for permission for a certain person to land, as he was very ill, and I have granted the permission, and then found that the persons concerned did not always keep their obligations. The limit of three years fixed in this Bill will not be too long, but, in most cases, it will not be anything like three years for which the exemption will be granted. </para>

As the clause stands, any convicted criminal, even though he may have been convicted of a shameful offence, will be absolutely immune from deportation if he succeeds in evading the operation of the law for three years. Thus a person who has been three years and one month in the country, even . though he is a convicted criminal of the worst type, will escape deportation. </para>

                        <para>- If a person of the type indicated in this clause has been resident in Australia for many years, and has shown no sign of mending his ways, it is highly desirable that we should have the power to deport him. It is absurd that we should limit the term within which he may he punished for his evil doings to three years. If the Bill is intended to rid the country of undesirables, we have no right to limit its operation in that way. I trust that the Government will accept my amendment as one which is necessary to the proposals embodied in the measure. </para>

Under the amendment of the honorable member for Perth, if the Minister were satisfied that a person not born in Australia had been convicted of a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment for one year or longer, he could order his deportation. The Minister alone has to determine the matter- </para>

                <para>Mr.CONSIDINE.- Then the honorable member will have an opportunity of correcting me. If the amendment he carried, and the Minister is satisfied that a' person not born in Australia has been guilty of certain offences, he may summon him to appear before a Board to show cause why he should not be deported. Thus a man may have been resident in Australia - as I have been - for thirty years and then suffer deportation. Suppose that I were the organizer of a union whose members were out on strike, and that, by reason of that strike, foodstuffs were destroyed. Under this clause I could be called upon to assign reasons why I should not be deported. Need I remind honorable members of the experience of Paul Freeman, whose whereabouts, by the way, are just now wrapped in mystery. We do not know whether he has been deported or not. But many other men have been kept in gaol without any opportunity being afforded them to obtain justice, and they have afterwards been deported. The Bill proposes to perpetuate that system. The Government propose to limit the operation of this clause to a period of three  years, but the honorable member for Perth desires to still further extend its provisions. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly. The honorable member for Perth has cited this particular illustration to enable the other portions of the clause to be carried through Committee. Upon the motion for the second reading of the Bill he was agitated by very grave doubts whether the Government were not taking to themselves too much power, and he instanced the cases of certain individuals who might be subjected to injustice under its provisions. Yet he now desires to give Ministers even wider powers. </para>

The distorted views that are characteristic of that particular class of individuals who advocate deportation are remarkable. Take, for instance, an article in this, morning's <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> criticising the United States of America in connexion with a proposal of the American Government to " go dry." This is what the organ which defends the action of our Government, and loudly applauds such measures as this, has to say concerning Americans:- </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The literary apologist-in-chief for the Government indorses the action of Ministers in deporting all who can by any means be got at, who are opposed to them, or opposed to " disordered government," that is to say, the chaotic state of affairs which is ruling this and every other country in the world to-day. Honorable members opposite can see all sorts of things wrong with people on the other side of the world ; and the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> says, sarcastically, of Course, that we ought to deport this and that person, because American people have run to extremes; but it does not see that here, also, people run to extremes. Honorable members opposite in their anxiety to protect propertied interests in Australia, the profiteers, and vested interests generally; honorable members like the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)-</inline></para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler)</inline> has moved to amend the clause by striking out the time limit of three years within which the power to deport may be exercised. Under the existing Act there is power, without regard to time, to deport in the case of an absolute evasion "of the Act. Section-  7  provides that every prohibited immigrant. entering or found within the Commonwealth in contravention or evasion of the Act shall be liable, on conviction, to be sentenced to six months' imprisonment, and to be deported, but that power of deportation is conditioned by the Department's ability to prove that the person was a prohibited immigrant when he arrived in Australia or had become one under the Act. A time limit of five years is prescribed by the American Act of  1917,  but it is subject to a condition similar to that in section  7  of the Commonwealth Act, namely, that the Department can prove that at the time a person entered the United States of America he evaded, or was in the country in contravention of, the Act, so that our existing Act actually gives wider scope for deportation in the case of a person who has evaded the Act. As a matter of fact, the American .Act deals only with the deportation of aliens. Our Act gives power to deport persons who came from the United Kingdom, but the American Act refers to aliens, because all persons born outside the United States are regarded as aliens, that country having no Dominions such as those of the British Empire. The American provisions, therefore, though they allow a period of five years, apply in circumstances different from those in this country, and our Act ' gives a wider power to deal with persons who have evaded the Act, and who are prohibited immigrants within the meaning of the Act. The clause means that, without necessarily proving that a person was an anarchist when he entered, he can be deported if he is found within three years of his arrival to be acting in contravention of. the law. The reason why the limit of three years is provided is that there must be some reasonable period within which we. assume that a man has developed within Australia into a person prohibited by our Immigration Act. If it can be proved that at the time of entering he did evade the Act, and was, in fact, a prohibited immigrant, he can be arrested and deported at any time; but if that cannot be proved, but proof is available that within three years of his arrival . he became one of the persons specified by clause  7,  he may he deported. I ask the honorable member for Perth not to press his amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- I cannot . understand what the honorable member for 'Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler)</inline> desires to achieve by the amendment. If the limitation of three years is struck out, the clause will then read that at any time, regardless of how many years a person may have been resident in the country, he will be liable to deportation if he does anything in contravention of the immigration law. The whole clause is repugnant to me, because I see no necessity for it. One of the best arguments in. support of its elimination is the statement by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> that the existing Act gives power to deport . persons who are convicted of certain offences. Having that power to punish persons for these offences, why should ' we now make an additional law to provide for their deportation ? Any man who offends against the Immigration Act must pay the penalty prescribed. I do not know what is meant by paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c,</inline> which refers to a person .who, within three years after his arrival in Australia, "has become an inmate of an insane asylum or public charitable institution." If that paragraph is "agreed to any person who was not in Australia at the time this law was passed, but who within three years of his arrival becomes an inmate of an insane asylum or public charitable institution, may be deported if the Board so directs. It is a bad enough misfortune  for a man to become insane, but to make him liable, in addition, to be deported and separated from his friends, seems to me to be most unreasonable. </para>

                        <para>-But, if this amendment were agreed to, action could be taken against such a person at any time. After living here for ten or twenty years, a man might lose his reason, or, owing to a series of misfortunes, might become an inmate of a charitable institution. Under this amendment, such a person could be deported on the recommendation of the Board, although probably he had relatives and family ties here. </para>

                <para>I said last night that in proposing legislation of this kind we seemed to be suffering from shell-shock. This is certainly panic legislation, and quite unreasonable. Under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of this proposed new section, any person who has been convicted in Australia of a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment for one year or longer may be called upon to show cause why he should not be deported. We can all carry back our minds to industrial troubles in connexion with which much feeling has been aroused, and which have led to men making statements in the heat of the moment which have resulted in their imprisonment for twelve months or more. I can recollect cases in my own district where, because of much public excitement caused by certain troubles, the military were sent to the mines. Their appearance in the district served only to intensify the feeling, and led to certain men making statements which brought them under the law of conspiracy. Ordinarily, they were excellent citizens, but in a moment of excitement they made statements which led to their prosecution and to their imprisonment to a year or more. Such men, if this amendment were agreed to, might at any time be called upon to appear before this Board to show cause why they should not be deported. Imagine the Board solemnly recommending the deportation of such men after they had been living in the Commonwealth for ten or twenty years. They are good citizens - hardworking men - but, because of a dispute with their employers leading to much feeling, they might, in the circumstances I have named, he recommended for deportation. Are we going to place people in that position? </para>

                <para>This is panic legislation for which there is no cause, and in the near future it may have a boomerang effect. It goes beyond the bounds of reason. Surely in these enlightened days it is unnecessary to pass legislation the only effect of which will be to create dissension. A measure of this kind will produce not harmony, but turmoil, in the community. If, as the result of industrial trouble, men, because of statements made in a moment of excitement are sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment, and are then recommended for deportation, we shall have the country up in arms. In moments of agitation, common sense often flies to the wind. This is an abnormal production. It is because of the happenings of the last two years, which have affected our mental calibre, that it is brought forward. </para>

                        <para>- There is no wiser nation to-day than Australia. Why did our boys make such a fine stand at the Front? Was it not because of the freedom and liberty they enjoyed here? Was it not because of their life-long environment? Was, it not because of their trade unions? All these things contributed to make the Australian soldier stand out as one of the superior men of the world. Are we to follow in the foot- steps of nations that in this respect cannot compare with us ? My advice is that we should give our people as much freedom as possible. Let us pass wise laws, and punish those who violate them; but, in the name of all that is good, do not let us pass coercive legislation, which, if put into operation, will lead to much hardship. Under this amendment, married men who have lived here for years might be deported and separated from their wives and children unless they chose to accompany them. While in one respect I think the Bill is desirable, I yet believe that, on the whole, it is right up against Democracy and the best interests of Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - I appeal to the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler)</inline> to withdraw his amendment, for a reason other than that stated by the honorable member who has just resumed his seat. I am in favour of the Bill, and believe that the clause as it stands will prove exceedingly useful. The honorable member's amendment, while possibly sound from many standpoints, has to be considered, also, from the point of view of its validity. We have but a limited jurisdiction. Under the Constitution, the Parliament has power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealthwith respect, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> to immigration and emigration. We also have power to make laws with respect to all matters incidental to the execution of any power vested by the Constitution in the Parliament or in the Government of the Commonwealth, or in any Department or officer of the Commonwealth. Anything, therefore, which is incidental to immigration comes within our jurisdiction. The Commonwealth has power to regulate and control the class of persons who shall be allowed to come into Australia, and if Parliament, in its wisdom, determines that, in order effectively to carry out its policy with regard to immigration, the class of persons dealt with in this proposed new section shall be deemed undesirable immigrants, then we have power to say that such persons, within a certain period from the date of their arrival here, shall be liable to deportation. But if, on the other hand, there is no limitation to this provision ; if, as the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> has said, a man is permitted to remain here for ten or twenty years before any at tempt is made to deport him, then, in such circumstances, he would have identified himself with theState in which he lived. He would have been absorbed in, and become an inhabitant of that State, and be subject to its jurisdiction. If the limitation which the proposed new section imposes were removed, we should be going outside the jurisdiction granted to this Parliament in respect of immigration. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>It might be suggested, in reply to that argument, that sections 7 and 8 of the principal Act may be subject to a similar challenge as regards jurisdiction. Section 7, however, refers to a contravention or evasion of the Immigration Act. In the case of a man who has, by fraud or by a process , of evasion, managed to enter the Commonwealth, we should only be exercising a power incidental to our powers in respect to immigration and emigration if we provided for the deportation of such a man. Section 7, therefore, is, in my opinion, valid. I am not prepared to say definitely that section 8 is valid ; but if we have gone as far as we can under that section it would be a great mistake to remove, as the honorable member proposes, the limitation provided for in this provision. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. The Commonwealth permits certain individuals to enter. It discovers within three years that they have developed certain disqualifications for Australian citizenship. Therefore, the Commonwealth says they are not desirable immigrants, and exercises its power to deport them. There is a considerable majority in favour of the clause, and I would suggest to the honorable member for Perth the undesirableness of doing anything which will weaken it or cause its validity to be challenged. While  ill many circumstances I might be disposed to sympathize with his amendment, I see the legal objections that may be taken, and the challenge which may be hereafter issued. It is objected that a distinction is made between the man who comes here and the man who is born here. Undoubtedly there is such a distinction. In the one case the man is a foreigner; he belongs to some other country. </para>

But if the man is Australian-born, this is his country, and we have to put up with him. He is our trouble, and we must deal with him according to our own criminal law. The objection, therefore, as to the discriminating character of the Bill is not sound. The clause should be accepted as printed. </para>

                <para class="block">Then it says " or," and describes quite another kind of person. It would, therefore, really appear, on a strict reading of the clause as it stands, that the Minister may only bring the matter before a Board when a person occupies the threefold character of having been convicted, and living on prostitution, and becoming an inmate of an insane asylum or charitable institution. This is, perhaps, a somewhat far-fetched reading, but it is clearly the literal meaning of the language used. The alternative conjunction " or " should follow each sub-clause. </para>
                <para>When I heard the honorable member for Perth speaking on the second reading, I hoped that he would bring to the consideration of the Bill in Committee a greater measure of Christian charity than he has shown in his amendment. The position he now takes up is this : If a man born in the British Isles comes here, and has the misfortune to be convicted for an offence for which the law provides a penalty of imprisonment for one year or longer, though the actual penalty imposed on him may be much less, then, not within three years as the clause states, but even if he lives here for thirty, forty, or fifty years he becomes liable to be summoned before a Board to show' cause why he should not be deported from the Commonwealth . That is monstrously unjust. It is so absurdly unjust that one can hardly think the honorable member seriously desires to bring about such a state of affairs. Even the three years' limit imposes a hardship which is far too great. The penalty actually imposed may be slight, and the man be in other respects a very desirable citizen. Good men fall into minor criminal offences, and afterwards live good lives here. They completely expiate their offence, and become good citizens, and probably were good citizens before they gave way to one bad impulse. </para>

At all events, we make them liable for deportation. Even if the person brought before the Board is excused, he has to run 'the risk of being deported, and must undergo the humiliation, expense, and sorrow of that second trial before the Board, and perhaps of a third trial before the Minister, before he can be assured that he is safe here. For that reason, I could not think of supporting the clause, even in its present form. </para>

A good man, one of our  kinsmen from across the sea, may come here. He may have relatives here, and a great number of legitimate associations in this country. Surely we are not so churlish or niggardly in. the distribution of the good things that this country has to give as to tell a man who longs to remain in our sunny land that he cannot remain here because his health has broken down, and poverty has driven him into a charitable institution. The proposal is not only not humanitarian, but almost inhuman. A man comes here, and within three years falls on hard times. Who knows what cause may have driven him into a charitable institution, or other asylum ? It may be a cause that does not reflect at all on his moral character; but he too is to be liable to the humiliation, pain, and loss of being summoned before a Board to show why. he should not be thrust forcibly out of the country in which he has endeavoured to make his home. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> who is by no means wholeheartedly with me in all the views that I have uttered on this Bill, puts the matter regarding paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> in a way that the Minister should hesitate to resist. I cannot understand men who have been long associated with the Labour movement penalizing a man on account of his poverty. Certain members opposite should, therefore, use all the influence they have with the Government to get them to drop that part of the clause. I know what the Minister has in mind. It is the undoubted fact that in some cases men are sent out here to build up their broken constitutions, and that that practice is undesirable. We know, also, that men of degenerate type may be sent out here to be got rid of. These cases would be rare. It is incredible that they should be so frequent, having regard to the difficulty and expense of sending such people here, as to justify this proposed departure from elementary justice. </para>

In regard to the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler),</inline> I would make it apply permanently to anarchists or to persons who advocate the forcible overthrow of the established government of this or any other civilized country. I am quite unable to understand the reasoning of my honorable friends opposite. To-day we have upon our statute-book the Contract Immigrants Act. Under the provisions of that measure, hard-working, honest men from the Old Country who followed the occupation of hatters and were of unblemished character, were prevented from entering the Commonwealth merely because they had made a contract with their employers here. Honorable members opposite would debar those operatives from coming to Australia, but would welcome anarchists with open arms. The members of both political parties in this Chamber did their utmost to secure the establishment of Arbitration Courts in this country for the settlement of industrial disputes. Yet we now find honorable members opposite supporting direct actionists, who are opposed to the very basic principle of arbitration. </para>

Tom Mann, when he was expelled from Great Britain, went to South Africa. After doing all the mischief that he could there, he directed his steps to Australia, where he succeeded in turning the country upside down. We have a lot of decent, honest, working men in this country,' who are quite capable -of managing their own affairs without interference by outsiders. I commend the Government for having introduced this Bill, and I intend. to give it all the support that I can.   ' </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pigott)</inline> has indicated that he would exclude from the Commonwealth men who, according to my reading of this clause, cannot be excluded. Tom Mann, for example, has never been accused of being an anarchist. I oppose the legislation proposed in this Bill because I fear that men like the honorable member may get into the Government of this country, and administer its provisions in the way that he himself has outlined. The terms of the measure remind me very forcibly of the panic legis- lation which was enacted in Victoria, at the instance of the Irvine Government, in 1902 and 1903. That legislation was directed against the public servants of this State. 'The Irvine Government brought forward what was known as a Coercion Act, which ran the gauntlet of both branches of the Legislature; but which was, afterwards unanimously repealed 'by them. I am confident that honorable members who support the proposed legislation which is now before us will be utterly ashamed of their action before they are many years older. I am surprised that the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.. Fowler)</inline> should have gone as far as he has, and I trust that he will withdraw his amendment. Should it he carried, we shall certainly be in a position to clear out many of our benevolent asylums, a large proportion of whose inmates are not native-born Australians. </para>

                <para>I need hardly remind honorable members that if a person enters a shipping office in London, and books his passage to Australia, .he is not required to undergo any medical examination whatever. But if he is unfortunate enough to be poor, and is desirous of making a fresh start in this country, he has to submit to a medical examination. I know that many persons afflicted with tubercular complaints have been sent to Australia by their friends overseas, doubtless in the hope that in our more sunny clime they would be restored to health. So long as they pay their passages, they are not required to undergo medical inspection. Of the evils of this system I can speak personally, because when I was about to visit England in 1S99 a man who was a sufferer from tuberculosis in an advanced stage was returning to' his friends by the same vessel. It was pitiable' to see him, and he died before the voyage was completed. </para>
                <para>We have no right to indulge in panic legislation, which is hound to react on Australia. The honorable member for Calare. <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pigott)</inline> spoke of the six hatters, who, he said, had been prevented from entering the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, they were not excluded from this country. Neither of the two groups of six hatters were kept out of the Commonwealth, and some pf them are as good Australians to-day as can 'be found in this country. But I particularly object to the composition o'f the proposed Board under this clause. . . We are told that the  chairman  shall be -a person who holds, or has held, the office of Judge, or police, stipendiary, or special magistrate. But we do not know who the other members of the Board will be. I 'presume that the decision of this body will be a majority one. I suppose that two- persons could be selected for appointment to it who "would vote to send every man upon .this side of the chamber out of A.iis-  tralia; and I dare say that two others could be selected by our side who would vote to deport every man on the other side of the chamber. </para>

At .present Parliament cannot think as clearly as it can in normal times, to which I hope we shall soon get back. I have made my attitude .clear.  This legislation is quite unnecessary. But certain people are panicky, and, believing that something has to be done, they come forward with a sledge-hammer proposal. No one who knows anything about the work of Tom Mann .could accuse, him of being an anarchist. Yet the honorable member for Calare says that this class of legislation is required in order to keep out men like Tom Mann. In England I have heard Tom Mann' urging workmen to get on local governing bodies. </para>

Otherwise the Board might, without rhyme or reason, vote for the deportation of any individual. For instance, the honorable member for Calare has made up his" mind about Tom Mann, who is a very estimable citizen of the Empire. He has done this without knowing him. He is simply speaking from something that the newspapers have said. If honorable members are to make up their minds on what the newspapers say about certain persons they will be following a danger  ous  course. I trust that the amendment will not be agreed to, and that the Minister will consent to some modification of the clause. </para>

                    <para>.. - The honorable member for Batman (Mr.' Brennan) fears that in some cases the application of paragraph c, " has become an inmate of an insane asylum or public charitable institution," will confer hardship. There has been good reason for inserting this paragraph in the Bill. Persons very badly affected with disease have come into the Commonwealth in violation of the Act, but their diseases were not discoverable at the time. The paragraph is intended to apply to those cases. At present the Minister has power to deport such persons if he can prove that they entered the Commonwealth with ' these diseases,, but with the assistance 'of the power taken in this Bill it will net be necessary to furnish this proof. However, provision is made in the Bill to permit the person affected' to go before a Board. It is a punishable offence under the Act for a person who is badly affected by a disease to enter the Commonwealth, but the Bill is to some extent a qualification of the Act, and enables us to deport the person without absolute proof that he was affected at the time of entry. In some cases the disease from which a person is suffering is not discoverable until many months after his arrival. Other countries have legislation in the same direction with much wider powers. In the United States of America, in the cases of these diseases, there is power to deport without trial or without reference to a board of inquiry. As a matter of fact, the Secretary of Labour is intrusted with the responsibility and can deport persons who are affected. </para>

                        <para>- No. A person who is in one of the classes excluded by the United States' law may be deported at the instance of the Secretary of Labour at any time within five years after his entry. Here we say that if we can prove that the person was at the time of entry a prohibited immigrant the period for deportation is indefinite. I quite agree that  if a disease develops within the Commonwealth it would he grossly unfair to take any person affected out of an institution and deport him. -I can say at once, speaking from an administrative point of view, that such a case would not occur; but there are circumstances in which one is practically aware that the disease must have existed at the time of the person's entry, though that could not be proved. The clause in the Bill will meet such a case. </para>

                    <para>.- Notwithstanding the clear and courteous explanation furnished by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn),</inline> I think the clause contains too many drastic' provisions, even without the extreme suggestion of the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler),</inline> whose amendment I could not in any circumstances support. I am quite aware that owing to the convulsions of nations and the disruption that has taken place everywhere there may, perhaps, ^ be a tendency among the worst element of various countries to seek "fresh fields and pastures new," and possibly it is very essential for all countries, especially young countries encouraging immigration, to be more careful than in normal times in regard to who shall be permitted to enter them. However, I think that due care can be taken without the drastic provisions in the clause. If we have methods of carefully examining the qualifications of people who seek to come to Australia under assisted immigration laws, it seems absolutely wrong to have legislation by which people who, through sickness or accident or from any other cause, may be cast into a charitable institution, shall be subject to an inquiry by a Board which may decide whether they are to be " shunted " out of the country or not. A pernicious principle such as that ought not to find expression in the laws of a free country, where we depend for justice on the administration of our Statutes and on the discretion of those who administer them, rather than on the actual working of the laws themselves. I appeal to the Minister to eliminate, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c.</inline> I cannot support it, .because it is inimical to the spirit of freedom .which should actuate the people of Australia. We are anxious to keep our country free and a home to all law-abiding people. We seek by every means in our power to raise the standard of living and make Australia an example to the less-favoured countries, but that ideal cannot he approached if we subscribe to principles which are, no doubt, due in some measure to the extraordinary conditions that have developed all over the world, or the panic stricken fear that we may perhaps suffer to a greater extent than have other less favoured countries. </para>

                    <para>.- If during an industrial dispute certain strikers happen to get at cross-purposes with the law - for instance, through committing a breach of the Arbitration Act - and they are sentenced to three months' imprisonment for the offence, though they may be liable to a sentence of twelve months' imprisonment or more, it would appear thai they could very easily be deported under this clause. Surely the Committee will not countenance a provision which may have such an effect? I do not like to see strikes, but no means can be . devised ' of avoiding them.

                        <para>- I am thankful for small mercies. The Minister would do well to eliminate paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c,</inline> which makes liable to deportation inmates of lunatic asylums and public charitable institutions. The country will not benefit by such a provision. I know of a man who went to England as a munition worker and was injured there. As a result he is unable now to follow his occupation. Because his accident occurred outside the Commonwealth he is ineligible for an invalid pension, and the State Government can do nothing for him because he is lying in his own home. That man would be liable to deportation under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c.</inline></para>

                    <para>.- The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> stated that those who vote for this Bill will subsequently be ashamed of their action. I rise to support the Bill, not because I think I can influence any other honorable member, but because I believe I can justify my vote. It is unworthy of the Leader of the Opposition to say that honorable members on this side, although they disbelieve in the Bill, have not the courage of their convictions, and will vote for the measure simply because it is introduced by the Government of whom they are supporters. I cannot understand the heat and bitterness that have been introduced into the discussion of this measure. This is not panic legislation. The Bill has evidently been designed for the simple purpose of protecting Australia by prohibiting undesirable immigrants. </para>

Every honorable member will agree that the persons aimed at in clause 7, namely, criminals, those who live by the prostitution of others, inmates of lunatic asylums and public charitable institutions, and. anarchists, and persons of that kind, are undesirable residents in any community, and if we are wise, in building up our civilization we shall protect ourselves, as far as possible, from the introduction of those elements. </para>

                <para>The amendment proposed by the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler)</inline> is too wide, and would prove altogether unworkable. The meaning of clause 7 is that we desire immigrants to show within the first three years of their residence that they are persons who are desirable as permanent residents of Australia; but if, within that period, they show any symptoms of undesirableness, they must leave the country. The interests of those various classes of persons have been adequately safeguarded by the procedure  which must be followed by the Minister before they can be deported. First of all, the attention of the Minister is called to an individual case. The clause does not provide that he must take action upon that information; he simply may take action. </para>

If they do warrant action, he summons the person complained of before a Board, the  chairman  of which, I am glad to see, must be a person who holds, or has held, the office of Judge, or police, stipendiary, or special magistrate. Generally speaking, the occupants of such positions are men of trained minds and broad outlook. </para>

The stipulation that the  chairman  shall be a man with a trained mind is a wise one. Even after the Board has considered a case, its decision must be referred back to. the Minister. No Minister of the Crown would dare to take the drastic step of deporting a resident of Australia unless there was good solid reason for doing so. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members will be in their places to challenge any case of deportation, and the Minister will have to justify his action in Parliament. I quite agree with the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> that it would be possible so to administer this measure as to work injustice. That remark, however, applies to practically every Act of Parliament. In passing a Bill we must assume that it will be justly administered. Generally speak ing, all our laws are. We must have regard, not to an individual case of injustice occurring here and there, but to our general experience. I have had some experience of the administration of Acts of Parliament, particularly in Courts of justice, and do not hesitate to say that they are administered in a common-sense way, and with a due sense of justice and responsibility. </para>

                <para>As to the provision under which it will be possible to deport men who are sentenced to imprisonment for twelve months or longer for an offence committed within three years of their arrival in the Commonwealth, I think that the policy of the Government is to protect Australia against an influx of criminals. When a man comes here the Government know nothing about him. They have had nothing to do with his upbringing, and they say, in effect, under this clause, that we will give such a man three years in which to declare himself. If he should prove to be a criminal and displays criminal instincts within this reasonable period, is there any hardship in declaring that such a man, on being convicted of a. crime for which he is liable to a term of twelve months' imprisonment or more, shall be sent back to the country from which he came ? It is only just that the Government should have such a power. Every case will be considered on its merits. I cannot conceive it to be possible, as the honorable member for Batman suggests, that a man who, after leading an upright and honorable life, suddenly yields to momentary temptation, and commits a crime for which he is liable to imprisonment for twelve months or longer, would be summoned before this Board, and that on such facts he would be recommended for deportation. I do not think that such a recommendation would be made, or if it were, that it would be acted upon by a responsible Minister. Such cases are quite safeguarded by this Bill. It is only the class of men to whom I have previously referred, men who come here with criminal instincts and within three years show that they are criminals, that any Minister would think of deporting. </para>
                <para>I come now to the paragraph in the proposed new section providing for the deportation of those who within a certain period of their arrival here are found to be living on the prostitution of others. </para>
                <para class="block">I have not heard a word from either side in defence of those who come within that category, or urging that they should become permanent residents of" Australia. No mart ; who entered upon hie of that kind would deserve any consideration, and no protest would be raised h: support of a claim made by him to remain here. </para>

It would be only where the Minister had reason to believe on the evidence before  him  that the person concerned was suffering .from incipient insanity when he came here that he would take steps to deport him. If, for instance, . the Minister found that as the result of an accident, as has just been suggested, a man had become insane within the period named, I  do not think he would ever dream, of deporting 'him. If he made such a proposal no one would indorse it. The object is to "keep out undesirable' people, who had shown some evidence of insanity before coining here. </para>

Such men- have no right to come here. If, on the other hand, a man was able  to  maintain himself 'when he landed in Australia, 'but owing to misfortune became an inmate of a charitable institution, on- such facts no Minister would dare to suggest his deportation.

If I thought that in years to come I would be ashamed of having voted for such a measure, I certainly should not do so.

                    <para>. - I avail myself of this opportunity to declare my entire opposition to the Bill, and to deplore the lack of wisdom shown by the Government in introducing it. Measures of this kind are usually the result of public agitation, but I have not heard any demand outside for the introduction of this Bill. I do not think that the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> is- as familiar with the ramifications of ordinary life in Australia "as the Opposition are. The clause under discussion deals with all classes and conditions of people. It is certainly not calculated to remove the discontent  that exists in the community, to which the honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riley)</inline> has referred. No steps have been taken to remove the cause of that discontent. The Government view the situation as a nurse might gaze upon a party of children ' playing in a nursery. There is no attempt on their part to come to the help of the people. The State Governments also seem to be inclined to let things go as they please, and to be waiting, like Micawber, for " something to turn up."

They have lectured men for not being able to keep a family of three or four children on £3 a week. If I had been concerned, and been spoken to in that way for applying for an increase of 6s. per week, and I had met the man who delivered me that lecture outside, I am - afraid it would have been a case of seeing who was the better man. Some of Judge Heydon's deliverances from the Bench of the New South Wales Arbitration Court might have been excused if delivered to sheep, goats, or dogs, but not to human beings. I do not know how the men have stood what has been said to them. I have no confidence that legal gentlemen are everything that is good. </para>
                <para>This Bill will very often be applied in times of excitement. Take the case of the members of the Industrial Workers of the World, who were sentenced in Sydney. I believe you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> have been in the company of' some of those men, as I have been. No one could have thought, from what we knew of them, that they would do anything worthy of the- punishment they received. When I was a lad, I took part in. a rio.t. In 1866 I helped to pull down the railings of Hyde Park, "and I am proud of what I did. I was taken charge of by the police, who asked me my name. I gave them some other name, and heard no more about it. Under a Bill of this kind, I would be subject to deportation. :Sir Henry Parkes was a Chartist. My father and grandfather were Chartists, and my grandfather spoke at a great Chartist meeting in the Old Country. Under this Bill, he would be liable to be deported from Australia. It looks as if the measure was brought in to satisfy a set of old ladies who have no idea, of the struggles of real ' life, but set themselves up into a union or organization, and talk through their necks. The Minister would be wise to modify the Bill before it passes another place. ' It is evident from his attitude that we shall not be able to modify it in this Chamber. Certainly the provision regarding inmates of insane asylums or public charitable institutions requires careful consideration.' In my own trade  of plumbing, men run great risk of accidents. I know a man who was not here for more than two years before he met with an accident, and became an inmate of an institution. He is a cripple for life, and now the Government want  power to send him to London. Fancy landing that man in London Docks a cripple ! It would be an inhuman act, . but it could be committed under the authority of this Bill. </para>

I would prevent the landing of an immigrant who was suffering from venereal disease, or who was not mentally 60und; but I understand that the present law gives the Government that power in the case of all undesirable immigrants. We are asked to give the Government power to exclude any anarchist or other person who advocates  the overthrow of established government. Presumably, any one who wanted to overthrow the present Government would come within the category. This would include almost every  speaker  in the Sydney Domain of a Sunday. It would also include the Opposition in this Parliament, because we are here to overthrow the Government. The phrase about teaching any doctrine is also very wide. We have had an experience in the War Precautions Act of the way powers of this kind can be abused. I was in the House when that Act was passed, and helped to pass it. We did so because we were assured by the Government that it would be used only for certain purposes: <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> member thought it would be stretched in the way it has been. There is no necessity to give the Government these wide and indiscriminate powers. The Bill would convey to any one the idea that we have in this community a lot of people who ought to be not only deported, but exterminated. One would think, from reading .it, that this was the worst community in the world. I do not hold that opinion, because I know that some of the men who speak in the Sydney Domain or on the Yarra Bank are at heart really good men, and think they are doing some, thing for the benefit of suffering humanity. In their hearts they believe that their proposals, if put into practice, would prove a panacea for all evils, ,and on the spur of the moment they sometimes make statements' which are scarcely warranted by' facts ; but they are not alone in that respect. I remember making a certain statement in the Sydney Domain some years ago, and the next day a policeman told me that he had instructions from the Government to shadow me. When the matter was investigated, my statement was found to be an accurate one, and accordingly the instructions which had previously been issued were withdrawn. The statement which I made on that occasion had reference to a man who holds one of the highest positions in Australia to-day. Under this Bill, perhaps the authorities will again be chasing me. I quite recognise that every honorable  member who attempts to secure amendments in the measure will be misrepresented on the hustings at the next general election. He will be charged with desiring to encourage the retention in Australia of all sorts of undesirables; but despite that circumstance, I maintain that there is no necessity for the Bill. I have not seen a column in the daily press of Australia commending the Government for their action in introducing it. </para>

                    <para>.- I have listened very carefully to what the legal members of the House have said in regard to my amendment, but I am obliged to confess that I am still of the same mind as when I moved it. I have in view the illogical position by which an alien who has been resident in Australia for thirty-five months, and has been convicted of some offence, perhaps a very objectionable one, can be sent out of the country, while another who has committed a similar offence, but has been thirty-seven months in Australia, can escape deportation. I believe that a person guilty of an offence, sufficient to justify his deportation, should be equally liable to deportation if the offence is committed either within three years following his arrival in the country, or within some reasonable time after that period. I do not suggest that a person who has come here and resided for the better part of his life in Australia should be deported unless the circumstances of his offence are of a particularly objectionable character, but I look to those who are administering a measure of this kind to exercise the Ordinary commonsense and discretion we usually regard as belonging to those who are intrusted with all matters of administration. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I confess that I am quite at a loss to follow honorable members opposite in their flights of imagination, and in the pictures they have painted in regard to the possibilities of my proposal; but I recognise that they are looking at certain offences, while I am thinking more particularly of the offences indicated in paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">b.</inline> I have listened to all that has been put forward by way of objection to my amendment, but I still think that there ought to he no limitation whatever upon the power of the Government to get rid of persons who are convicted of such undesirable offences as are indicated in those two paragraphs. I am also at a loss to understand the attitude of many honorable members on the Ministerial side who regard my amendment as objectionable, and consider the Bill entirely satisfactory, with its limitation of the operation of deportation to three years. I am convinced that I have no chance of carrying my amendment, and am, therefore, obliged to ask leave to withdraw it. However, having heard the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> ventureon a prophecy in regard to the operation of the Bill, I shall also venture to prophesy: I believe that before many years have passed, we shall find that if a person is deported for any objectionable offence within a period of three years after his arrival in the country, and it happens that another individual of the same class has committed the same offence more than three years after his arrival, there will be an outcry on the part of the general public against the inconsistency of the law when it is. found that the second man cannot be deported. </para>
                <para>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. </para>
                <para>Mr.FINLAYSON (Brisbane) [7.51] . - I intended to support the amendment put forward by the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler),</inline> because if the proposal is at all right its limitation to three years is obviously inconsistent. Its ridiculous to limit things which ought to be done to a specific time, -and render them nugatory at any other time. It is perfectly obvious that the temper of the Committee shows that we are not in a proper position to view this very important proposal in its true perspective. This measure follows the procedure of the Commercial Activities Bill, which continues the operation by statutory authority of certain regulations under the War Precautions Act, and is another endeavour, on the part of the Government, to continue by statutory authority certain powers they exercised under those regulations. Evidently Ministers are so satisfied with their efforts to maintain the purity of Australia during the war by the use of the drastic War Precautions regulations that they propose to continue them. Rudyard Kipling must have had them in mind when he spoke of men who were drunk with the sense of power." The Government find that they have such a substantial authority to carry any proposal they put forward that they have entered on a career of legislation which, conceived in a hostile spirit, is evidently aimed at securing purposes that serve their particular ends.. That is not a basis upon which they should approach legislation meant to be of a permanent character. </para>
                <para>We are told that this measure will he administered ina reasonable spirit, and that no sane Minister of the Crown would dare do certain things under it. When the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> was Attorney-General of the Labour Government, he and the then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fisher)</inline> gave exactly the same assurance in regard to the War Precautions Act - namely, that it would be administered with prudence and discretion - as the Minister now at the table <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> gives in connexion with this Bill. Their assurance was given in the same tone, and on exactly the same basis as that on which the Minister to-day guarantees the administration of this Bill. </para>
                <para>Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> provides that a person who has been convicted in Australia of a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment for one year or longer may be deported after certain inquiries have been made. It would be all right if the provision applied in one direction only, but it is meant to apply all round, and, therefore, it should be a general rule. If for instance, a man is declared to be a confirmed criminal, he should be deported, hut we must wait to see whether he develops into a confirmed criminal. If he exhibits criminal tendencies within Australia inside three years or beyond that period, I consider that he is a type of man who, without much hesitation or inquiry, should be deported. We do not want men with criminal tendencies in Australia. But the application of the provision is that a man who in a season of national excitement, or under great provocation, or at a time when the moral elements in his constitution are at the lowest ebb, may commit an offence punishable by twelve . months' imprisonment shall be deported, although he may be sentenced to one month's imprisonment only. </para>

The men responsible for that revolt against established government, which the Bill professes to provide for, were at that time considered to be the enemies of society, but to-day they are regarded as heroes. One of their leaders afterwards became Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, and a monument has been erected to his memory in Ballarat. History goes to prove that men who are convicted of offences against established government at one period are the heroes of the country and its law givers at later periods. Yet this Bill says they are unfit to become citizens of Australia. </para>

                <para>The honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell),</inline> whose opinion is always listened to with respect, said that this Bill would apply only to persons entering Australia, and that it was our bounden duty to prevent the influx of undesirable persons. To that extent I am entirely in sympathy with his attitude. But the honorable member seemed to have overlooked the fact that the Bill is applicable also to people who are already in Australia. It will be retrospective in its operations, and after it is placed on the statute-book no man will be safe who holds an opinion of a violent character in opposition to the Government of the day. When we are asked to accept the assurance that this Bill will be administered with prudence and reasonableness, we are asked to forget a lot of things that took place during the war. We are. asked to forget the deportations that have already taken place, and the circumstances surrounding them. The Government are calling on the people to forget too much, for it is because of their own actions that the Government do not possess the confidence of the people. </para>

Because of their experiences during the last twenty years, the people of Australia have arrived at a stage when they believe that we should have a new Constitution in order to conserve the interests of this country. Whether we favour a small modification or a wholesale alteration of the Constitution makes very little difference. There is no member of the House who believes that the Constitution is all that is necessary, and that . it requires no alteration. </para>

                        <para>- No. We have already threshed out in this House the serious limitations that have been placed on the discussion of public questions during the last four years. Every honorable member must be aware that the only hope of progress, and the only means of discovering truth, is by investigation and discussion. Truth ripens in the open air of discussion, and when the Government limit the right of discussion they place a period to the progress of the community. There is no country in the world - least of all the British countries scattered throughout the world, which enjoy the best system of government in existence - that has arrived at its present position without open, full, and unlimited expression of public opinion. That is the guarantee of constitutional government and the hope of Democracy in every country, and if we give the Government power to deport any person who ventures to advocate that there shall be a change in the established order, we shall be sitting down on the safety valve of public opinion; we shall put such a restriction on the most vital element in a democratic community as will accentuate the very dangers which we are seeking to avoid. </para>

                        <para>- I have no objection to a very severe tightening of the immigration laws in order to insure that criminals, those who live on the prostitution of others, diseased and insane persons, and persons who are likely to become a charge on public charity shall not be allowed to enter Australia. We cannot be too careful about keeping the race pure. </para>

                <para>We have established a reputation throughout the world because of the White Australia policy, which is only a declaration of our desire to keep the Australian race as clean and high as possible. To that extent every strengthening of the immigration law must secure unlimited support. But the Bill proposes to go very much further, and if it were not for the fact that we are still suffering from war nervousness, and are still under the shadow of the War Precautions Act, this measure would not have been brought forward. This is not the time when we can honestly and wisely consider such a proposal. The more I look at the. measure, the more I am satisfied that the Government, knowing the power they exercised under the War Precautions Act will necessarily slip from their hands within a few months, are determined by this means to retain some of that power. I know that the arguments from this side of the House fall upon deaf ears; our opinions pass unnoticed. I think that during this Parliament only one amendment has been accepted from the Opposition. </para>

                        <para>- It was only accepted after three weeks of fighting. The Bill will be carried, but I have reasonable grounds for believing that the time will soon come when we shall be able to wipe this stain off the statute-book. I hope to support before very long a Government who will remove the very undesirable advertisement that will be given to Australia by this Bill. Australia, least of any country in the world, can afford to do this sort of thing; our dangers are too great. I had hoped that after the war this Parliament would have sought out means whereby all the causes of internal dissension and all the incitements to national animosities would be removed. But, although the war is over the Government seem determined to carry hostilities into intra-national and economic affairs. This Bill is nothing more or less than a declaration of war against any person in the community who ventures to hold a political opinion different from that of the Ministry of the day. I am prepared to go upon the public platform and declare that this Bill is conceived in a war spirit, that it is meant as a challenge to the Democracy of this country </para>

I am opposed to the Bill, as well as to another of the same kind now before another, place. ' They axe conceived in a wrong spirit, and can have only disastrous results.

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson),</inline> to whom I have- listened patiently, takes a' very extreme view of this proposed new section. The class of persons against whom it is aimed is obvious, and if the honorable member . supports those to whom it refers, I am sorry to hear it. He has urged that we as Australians should take quite the opposite view, and not object to such people entering the Commonwealth. On the other hand, I hold that as Australians we should have initiated legislation of this kind years ago. Had we done so, possibly we would not have had the serious industrial unrest that has been experienced here. </para>

I am entirely at one with the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> as to the wisdom of passing, a provision of this kind. ' If there were any possibility of the administration of the Bill being attended by any of the serious injustices so graphically described by the honorable member, as well as bv the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West),</inline> I should oppose it. A little while ago the honorable member for East Sydney brought forward the case of a man who, after residing in the Commonwealth for a year or two, became, as the result of an accident, a hopeless cripple. No Minister would think of ordering the deportation of a man in such circumstances. If that were possible, I should certainly urge that the Bill should be so amended as to provide against such a contingency. I cannot conceive, however, that a Minister charged with the administration of this measure would" fail to .give full consideration to such a case. ° </para>

                <para>I wish to refer, very briefly, to the attitude taken up by honorable members of the Opposition with regard to the question of deportation. When speaking on the motion for the second reading of the Bill, the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> made a reference to Longfellow's <inline font-style="italic">Evangeline,</inline> which describes how certain people of Quebec were deported by the British Government.I quoted that poem in this House sixteen years ago, but in wholly different circumstances. I was then a member of the Labour party, and it was an honour to belong to the Labour party of those days. Of those who were then members of this House,there are now only three present. The Labour party was at that time supporting a Liberal Administration in return for concessions received from it. That was openly admitted by one of our leaders in another place.  His  statement was never contradicted. We were supporting the Government of the day in return for concessions, not of a private or individual character, but believed by us to be in the best interests of Australia. One of the concessions for which every member of the Labour party at that time fought very strongly was the passing of a Bill providing for the deportation of between 3,000 and 4,000 people, not one of whom was a criminal. Taken by and large, they were the most harmless lot of people that ever came into this country. We objected to their presence, however, because their labour was cheap, and competed with that of white men. I refer to the kanakas. </para>

                        <para>- Many of them had been brought here against their will, but members of the Labour party, who are now strongly declaiming against the proposal to deport anarchists land others, insisted upon the deportation of those kanakas, who were not criminals and had done no injury to the country. The deportations for which this Bill provides are far more necessary than were those. </para>

                        <para>- I regret to see such a display of inconsistency on the part of honorable members opposite. I rose chiefly to draw attention to a phase of our legislation which, although a thing of the past, is not entirely forgotten. I am reminding the Committee that honorable members opposite who supported the deportation of the kanakas are opposed to the deportation of a class of men dealt with in this Bill who  ought  never to have  been allowed  to come in here. </para>

                <para>Power is taken under paragraph 6 of the proposed new sub-section to deport persons found to be living on the prostitution of others within three years of their arrival in the Commonwealth. I wish to draw attention to the position of persons who are living, not upon the earnings of others, but who are earning money by prostitution. In my electorate, principally at Thursday Island, and also at Cairns, there are quite a number of such persons - coloured people, to whose residence here we should object under the Immigration Restriction Act. I ask the Minister to insert in this Bill a clause providing for the deportation of such people, who inflict considerable injury upon the male population and upon the country as a whole. </para>

                    <para>. -  In common with all other residents of Australia, I am desirous of keeping our race pure. I suppose even the savage wants to do that. One could agree with most of this clause but for our past experience of theWar Precautions Act. I fought strenuously in this House against the introduction of that measure, and when behindthethenGovernment I was the immediate means of causing a delay of  nearly a  fortnight in the passing of the amending War Precautions Act. I was eventually appeased with some alterations, and with an assurance from the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> who was then Attorney-General, and in charge of the Bill, that it would be administered in a way that would not cause dissension in the community, and only for the protection of the community. It was suggested at the time that it could  be  used for political purposes, but the Prime Minister said, " Far from  it ; it  will be used only  in  defence  of  the Commonwealth  or of  the Empire." We know now that  it  was used for political purposes. No one opposite can deny that during the past four years  there  have been prosecutions under that Act for political purposes. </para>

                <para>Mr.MATHEWS.- Yes. It was to prevent me from scattering "pearls of wisdom" before the electors of Grampians. My truthful statement caused a flutter in the dovecots of that electorate. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> did not like it, and tried to gaol me, purely for political and personal vengeance. With that experience, I am afraid to allow this Government to administer a measure such as the one before us. </para>

                <para>If I were sure that the Government would administer this measure in the way they say they will, and in the best interests of Australia, I would be willing to let it go, but there are members of the present Ministry, and others among their supporters, who will use it for political purposes and in a vengeful spirit. The War Precautions Act would not have passed this House if the Prime Minister had not given us the three assurances he did in 1915. The House rose in rebellion against giving to any set of individuals the powers embraced in that Act, but we were told that it would not be allowed to be administered by the military, that British subjects would not he treated in certain ways, and that the Government themselves would see that it was administered in the way originally intended. I am candidly afraid to trust the Government with powers of this character. The only thing I can trust them to do is to look after the well-being of the plutocrats of this country. They have done that ably and well. They have looked after the interests of the friends who placed them there, and of the misguided individuals who assisted their friends to place them there. I would not trust them to administer any measure. Honorable members opposite are like a crowd that I once saw listening to a  speaker  in the Sydney Domain. He had a most idealistic idea of what civilization should be, but, because in the course of his lecture he touched the religious feelings of certain of his hearers, they rose in their might and pulled him from his platform. He was trying to show that under a proper system of anarchy the Church would not have the power that it wields to-day by instilling into the people the fear of hell. There were men and women among his hearers who would have deported him; but surely they had no right to inflict punishment upon him because they happened to differ from him. </para>
                <para>The war, is over, but it has left shell-shock or nerve effects, not only among our returning soldiers, but in the community generally. "We may be suffering from nerves, but we have in our midst calculating individuals who can see in this measure a means of perpetrating injustices similar to those perpetrated under the War Precautions Act. I suppose both sides desire to see the. population of this country increased, so that this great tract of country may be more densely peopled. One means of doing that Ls to bring to our shores desirable individuals who are mentally and physically capable. But this measure can be used, and the Prime Minister will undoubtedly  use  it if he wants- to, to keep out' individuals politically opposed to' him. I would not trust the Prime Minister and some other Ministers not ' to use it for that purpose. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence would use any means within their power to beat those with whom they have fallen out politically. </para>

                        <para>- I was nervous, not because I was afraid of uttering the truth, but because I knew that if I did. so, these gentlemen would at once go to the Prime Minister with my statements, and a' prosecution would follow. The honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bamford)</inline> would kick over the traces very quickly if he were persecuted for advocating matters in regard to which he has very strong feelings, and he certainly re'sents the treatment which some persons have attempted to mete out to him ; yet I ask him would he deport them? If he would do so, he would know that they in their turn, if they became strong enough, would deport him. I do not say that the honorable member would do anything to justify his deportation, yet that is quite possible. ' It is said that we must get people to come here from other countries, to take up our land and increase and multiply, and make our race great. But is it proposed to import people of one political colour only ? Is it proposed to submit to any person arriving in Australia a list of questions to ascertain his or her political views in order to maintain the Government's majority? Are people to be declared insane because they disagree politically with the Government? </para>

                    <para>. - I thank the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> for his very clear definition of the purposes of this Bill; and I hope every person outside the chamber, who is interested in the measure, will read carefully the honorable gentleman's remarks.  His  enunciation of the principles contained in the Bill must appeal to every right-thinking person, because we are desirous only, of keeping out of Australia those people who would be a menace to the country. I have observed the effect of unrestricted immigration into Great Britain, and I have found that the influx of aliens is welcomed by the employers of labour, but is a menace to the workers. When I was in England I spent a considerable time in studying the condition of affairs in the East End of London, where I found that, the greatest menace to the British workers were people of the very class whom honorable -members opposite say should be welcomed to this country. They are desirous that such persons should be allowed to immigrate, no matter whence they came or what their character. Men said to me in the East End of London, " Our work has been taken from us by Russians, who came here without a shilling in the world. ' They are remaining only until they can earn £5, so that they may pass on to Canada." The earning of that £5 meant that the Britishers we're thrown out of work, and compelled to' starve, while the cheaply-paid Russians, filled their _ positions. Their admission, into England was possible only because there was not in existence a law such as that we are considering to-night. The honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson)</inline> cannot have given full consideration to this Bill. The honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> has been in the East End of London, and must be aware of the condition of affairs that exists owing to the unrestricted admission of aliens. </para>

                <para>I advise honorable members to study the literature of the Intelligence Department of, Great Britain, in order to understand what the presence of the foreigners in England has meant to the Empire during the struggle through which we have just passed. Our enemies were continually advised of what was taking place in Great Britain, and amongst the guilty persons were aliens who had resided in that country for twenty years. One man, a baker in the East End of London, who had been looked upon as a good citizen, was shot as a spy in the Tower of London. </para>

                        <para>- Of course. I was first impelled to take an interest in this great question by meeting, twenty-five years ago, in New South Wales a sea captain, who said to me, " Australia is allowing all the criminals of the United States of America to enter without question. Some day she will pay the penalty for that policy." Little did I anticipate then the trouble we experienced with aliens during the war period. If honorable members were aware of the information that the Intelligence Staff gained for the Defence Department during the last four or five years, they would adopt an attitude different from that they have taken up to-night. Honorable members of the Opposition have protested against the deportation of certain men, and have spoken a great deal about the freedom of entry which they would allow to immigrants from other countries. Those honorable members are the very persons who deported out of the Labour movement men such as Willis, Garden, ex-Senator Rae, Rosa, and dozens of others. The honorable gentlemen opposite, who have such a kindly sympathy for strangers coming to our shores, have cast their former colleagues into the world, and if they had power, would deprive them of a vote. Why is ex-Senator Rae excluded from the Labour movement? </para>

                <para>It is men of that type whom honorable members opposite would welcome to Australia. They are the men who, members of the" Opposition say, we need to help in building up Australia, and making it what they desire it to be. What do they desire it to be? They desire that somebody shall be blowing up Parliament House or forcibly seizing the property of some other person. It is persons of that type whom they would welcome as future citizens of the Commonwealth. I was once in a place where two gang-men were expressing opinions in opposition to those of some men of the tyne whom honorable members opposite think we have no right. to condemn. Whilst the conversation of these two men wis proceeding inside a hall, the friends of honorable members opposite filled the car with human excrement. They ruined a first-class motor car, and compelled one man to walk a distance of 12 miles. A friend who knew him said, " I would not advise you to walk along that dark road to-night, because these fellows would shoot you if they got the chance." He said, "Let them come along; I have a six-shooter." Not one of the cowards attempted to molest him. Subsequently they found out that a 50-ton stack of 'hay belonging to one of these two men was not insured, and they fired it. It is men of that type who are being defended by members of the Opposition. These are the men whom honorable members opposite think should not be prohibited from entering  this country. Yet they declare that citizens like Arthur Rae, Willis, Rosa, and others shall not remain in the political, Labour movement. I quite expected the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> to propose an amendment to provide for the deportation of those men. </para>

He would not be excluded from Australia; he would be allowed to speak from, every platform in the Commonwealth.

                    <para>- There may be, but the chance is not worth the risk. We welcome to this country, the freest in the world, where a man may speak and argue according to his conscience, all white people who are in good ' health  and not in favour of the overthrow, by force or violence, of established forms of government. In this country, a man is largely a law unto himself, as was 'shown during' the conscription campaign. In these circumstances, why should the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson)</inline> say that  if ever he gets into power he will endeavour to remove from the statute-book the stain of this Bill ? I am inclined to think that he and his party will be glad to continue its operation. The Labour party are just as anxious as we are to get some men out of the country. They would give worlds, so to speak, to get rid of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arthur</inline> Rae and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Willis. Mr.</inline> Brookfield,  the representative of Broken Hill in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, is reported to have said that he was asked to subscribe money to secure men to pack the Labour Leagues in order to rid them of such persons. </para>

                <para>Our honorable friends opposite display a great" solicitude for the welfare of those who are aliens throughout the world. No one has a greater sympathy than we have for such persons. But what is the position? Many of us know that a certain medical practitioner wrote . to the Old Country, stating that, having seen our sunny shores, he was of opinion that many consumptives might be cured by taking up their residence here. This suggestion was largely acted upon, and the result to-day is that one city of which I know has a consumptive sanatorium out of all proportion to its population. It is being crowded, not by these born in Australia, but by people from abroad. The Opposition would have such people coming, here in droves. I speak feelingly on this, particular subject, because I have suffered very severely from the coming of such people into our midst. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for Brisbane was honest when he said, " We will fight this Bill." He said, in effect, " We will allow consumptives to come in here. We will allow those who live on the prostitution of others to enter, as well as anarchists and others, because we want to use this Bill on the public platform for politicalpurposes." Is that the type of politics that we want in this country? </para>

                        <para>- I am going to vote for the whole clause. The honorable member knows as well as I do that every civilized country refuses to admit any person likely to become a burden to the community. In his large heartedness, however, he would welcome even such persons into Australia. I would not. I would welcome robust, healthy, white people, and if any of them, as a result of an accident after their arrival here, had to become an inmate of a charitable institution, I would treat them well. I am glad to know that we do treat such people well. We treat our invalid and aged poor better than such persons are treated in any other part of the world. That being so, I can safely vote for this clause.  The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> has said that we will live to regret the giving of such a vote. I will not. I shall read from every platform in the electorate of Denison on which I stand, this proposed new section, and tell the electors that the Labour party objected to it. I shall tell them that the Labour party welcome the anarchist, and the several classes of people covered by paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a, b,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">c,</inline> and, in support of my statement, I shall quote the division list, showing how they voted. Happily, Australians are a thinking people. They think for themselves. </para>

                        <para>- They are trying, as it is, to secure a wider field of selection. The workers will think for themselves. Imagine the Labour party favouring the introduction of droves of Russians to compete in our labour market. Honorable members opposite are so overcome by the political atmosphere that they fail to appreciate the danger of welcoming to our shores the people who would be shut out under this provision, and many of whom would compete with the workers in divisions such as those represented by the honorable member for Batman. I have heard it said to-night, for the first time, by a body of Labour men, "Let all white , people come in here without restriction. Let us crowd the labour market with people of these classes. The country is wealthy enough to provide for them all." Will these aliens he prepared to enter our unions? I think not. We did not find them entering the unions in Great Britain. As a matter of fact, they were union breakers. </para>

                <para>The Opposition would not keep out of Australia men of the class covered by paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d,</inline> who did not try to reform their own country, but who have taken certain action here. According to a report made by a gentleman who was at one time a member of this House, about fifty such men came here in 1914, and started upon propaganda work in favour of "direct action," and the Industrial Workers of the World organization. One honorable member opposite has had the courage to say, " We would welcome the Soviet form of Government, and we welcome the Industrial Workers of the </para>
                <para class="block">World." Today he was suspended from the service of the House for a month. These Industrial Workers of the World men, from other countries, are not satisfied with the system of government operating in Australia, although it is the freest in the world. They came here at a time when the Government was in the hands of a party working according to a fixed platform. They disapproved of it, however, and said that they would break it down. It was not long before they got into the Labour movement and succeeded in breaking it down. Honorable members opposite, however, according to statements they have made during this discussion, would allow such people to come in without restriction. I am prepared to welcome to this country every white man, no matter how poor or humble he may be, provided that he is healthy and strong, and will abide by constitutional forms of government. But I am opposed to the introduction of anarchists and other persons covered by this provision, who, to my mind, would be a menace to the country. </para>

                        <para>-  Well, I will say that it is not correct. It is in contradiction of the facts, and I am surprised that a man with whom I was previously associated in parliamentary work should so far have lost control of himself as to state any such thing. I do not believe that any honorable member would make such a suggestion, and the last thing in my mind was to suggest anything of the kind. No member on either side of the House believes that I would do so. I hope the honorable member will try to regain some of the control that he used to exercise over his words and conduct. </para>

                    <para>.- Thehonorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith)</inline> , about whom I hesitate to make any comment, for fear that I should draw down upon myself a tornado similar to that which he has just poured out upon an unoffending Committee, filled me with reminiscent feelings as to what his speech would have been, if he were still a member of the Labour party, with this Bill be- fore the House for consideration. The very basis of his eloquence was that he had had the advantage of hearing the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell).</inline> He seemed delighted almost to ecstasy that the honorable member for Fawkner had completely convinced him of the justice of this clause. The honorable member for Denison has not heard the honorable member for Fawkner as often as I have endeavouring to satisfy a jury that an anarchist was a most amiable person, who ought immediately to be discharged from the custody of the Court, or that a person against whom there was considerable strength of evidence that he was in favour of doing certain things by force of arms and other kinds of violence was nevertheless a most law-abiding and  harmless individual, so that the jury has been wont to return a docile, and, let Us hope, just verdict of not guilty in the face of much evidence-. -As the honorable member for Denison has not heard these performances on the. part of the honorable member for Fawkner, I can quite understand his frame of mind.  Evidently,  up' to the time, that he heard the honorable member for Fawkner, be had considerable doubt as to how he should vote on the clause. Having heard the honorable member, he rose in a quite unexampled paroxysm of conviction that he should vote as the  honorable  member directed him to do. ' </para>

                    <para>. - I have no desire to go into specifications such as the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> has just dealt with. All sorts of opinions have been expressed about the Bolsheviks. We can read differing views on them in the <inline font-style="italic">New Europe,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Nation,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Athenaeum,. and</inline> other papers-, but this clause does not deal with any particular names. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> does not deal with men who violate a particular Act of Parliament, or who come here and may be mixed up in strikes. It deals with men who are against: all forms of government.' That is practically what the clause is directed against. It has been suggested' that under this- measure men who advocate- certain political views may be kept, out. by a Minister by an abuse of administration. I remind, honorable members that except in two or three very special cases, the dictation test, has never been used to my knowledge for any other purpose- than to keep out coloured immigrants-. The instructions given to the officers time after time call their attention to that. Instruction 56 says - "It is intended that the dictation test, which is to meet the case "of coloured persons desiring to enter the Commonwealth, shall be an absolute bar to admission." If it was used for any other purpose, it would not be necessary to specify the other classes that are mentioned in section 3 of the Act. In it a number of classes are specifically re f erred to, and are, as such, prohibited immigrants. They could have been kept out by the dictation test, but it is not used for that purpose, so that no one can possibly assume that any Minister, without a breach of the spirit of this Act and of the administration up to the present, could use the dictation test to keep out people who are not of the class against whom it was originally designed. </para>

                <para>Reference has been made to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c,</inline> which mentions inmates of insane asylums and public charitable institutions. Under sub-section 5 of section 5 of the existing law persons of that class, if found in the Commonwealth, within three years of the date on which they came in, suffering from disease or disability, may be regarded as prohibited immigrants, unless they convince the Minister that they were free from the disease or disability at the time they entered. The temper of that section really runs through the Act at present. The Minister may assume that a man who is suffering from a disease mentioned in the Act or prescribed by the regulations was suffering from it when he 'entered the Commonwealth, if he' is suffering from it within three years of the time of his immigration. Under the administration, if the Minister is satisfied that n person who has become an inmate of an insane asylum or of a public charitable institution is suffering from any of those disabilities . within three years of his entry, the Minister can regard him as a prohibited immigrant. That means those particular persons only. Under the Act as it stands at' present, persons suffering from such disabilities may be declared by the. Minister to be prohibited immigrants, unless they show cause to the contrary, and are then liable to prosecution under section 7, and can on summary conviction be deported by the Minister. You can scarcely charge an inmate of an insane asylum or charitable institution in a Court of summary jurisdiction with an offence, but that charge and hearing is a condition for deportation under the Act as it stands. We are now putting that class of person under clause 7 of the Bill, so that they will not be prosecuted for an offence. Their cases will be inquired into by a Board to be appointed by the Minister. If anything may be regarded as a mitigation of the Act in relation to that particular class, this provision may be. </para>

                    when he pointed to us and said, These men who vote to allow persons who live on prostitution to come into Australia." Honorable members of the Opposition are as honorable and clean living as any honorable member on the Ministerial side, and it is .a disgrace to this Parliament that an honorable member should take advantage of his position to slander a body of men with whom he lias been closely allied. I did not think any honorable member would have such a filthy mind as to suggest what the honorable member has suggested. The honorable member for Denison also said that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Willis, Mr. Rae,,</inline>
                    and other men had been, expelled from the Labour party. That is true. They have not been deprived of their votes, but they have been expelled from the party, just as the honorable member himself was expelled by the very men to whom he now refers. In fact, they are merely getting back a little of their own medicine. The pity of it is that they were not expelled earlier.

                    <para>- Had the honorable member been tried for conspiracy and convicted, and sentenced to imprisonment, he could have been deported if he had been a new-comer to Australia. I do not believe that any Minister worthy of his salt would use the powers given under this Bill to deport people wholesale; but, as there are some people who would do so, we. are not justified in giving them the opportunity. We never anticipated that the War Precautions Act would be extended and used for the purposes to which it was put. In the ' same way, we are taking great risks in giving Ministers the power contained in this Bill. The honorable member for Denison claims that if we vote against this clause we advocate the admission of the classes of individuals referred to in the various paragraphs; but Australia has been governed under the Federal Constitution for the last eighteen years without any of these powers, and has not " gone to the dogs." Why, therefore, should we be stricken with the desire to place panic legislation on the statute-book?  I  am prepared- to take the responsibility of voting against the Bill, because I consider it is not necessary to pass this kind of legislation, and because I know that there is already in the Act sufficient power to deal with all the classes of individuals referred to in this Bill. </para>

                            <para>- Of course not. But I am glad to say that the newspapers which have been working against us have been wrong in their anticipations. In my own electorate the Labour party has retained every municipal seat it previously held, and has gained others. Honorable members on the Ministerial side, particularly those who left the Labour party, say that we on this side are altogether wrong in our attitude. They will ascribe to us all sorts of motives. One honorable member threatened us that on the public platform he would let the people know how the members of this Opposition were anxious to let aliens enter this country. Honorable members may do that, and I, in return, shall tell the people how the Government are allowing German goods into the country, and how exports from this country are being sent <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> England and America to the very people who are supposed to be our lifelong enemies. Honorable members opposite said they would never trade with Germany. What an absurdity! What political hypocrisy! By this Bill they declare they will not admit persons of enemy race into Australia, and yet they will trade with Germans, Austrians, Bulgarians, and Turks, so long as' they can make dollars out of them. Money is the god of Ministerialists and their supporters. . The people of other lands may be compelled to continue to work under degrading conditions; but they shall not be allowed to enter Australia. One honorable member said that he would expose our attitude on every political platform. Of course, he will. This Bill is a political placard; it is camouflage, or, to use an old-fashioned word, deception, of the people. </para>

                        <para>.- I propose to strike a note different from that struck by any other honorable member during the consideration of this Bill. Whilst I agree with certain portions of the measure, I regret that the Government, when framing the Bill, did not take into consideration, the fact that section 3 of the Act has caused more hatred and dislike of Australia than any other law passed by the British or Commonwealth . Parliaments. The dictation test has caused enmity and ill-feeling on the part of more than one-third of the human race. In other words, 400,000,000 people in China, 350,000,000 in India, and 70,000,000 people in Japan, resent that provision. The intelligent minds of those countries have not been deceived as to the purpose of the dictation test. I have heard a Minister declare in this chamber that by means of that test any person could be kept out of Australia. If an immigrant or traveller does not understand a passage dictated to him from a European language, he may be forbidden . to enter the Commonwealth. If he does Understand that passage, tests in other languages can be applied until he fails. One of those -nations was' an ally of the Commonwealth in the war; it helped to defend us, and its warships have protected our cities, because the good ship <inline font-style="italic">Augtralia,</inline> great as it may be, could- not possibly defend our huge coast line. </para>

                            <para>- When the honorable member for Hume has been longer in the House he will understand how to rise to a point of order. The good ship <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> alone could not defend the cities distributed along the huge coast line of Australia, and the warships of Japan came to our assistance. Therefore, I make a protest against the needless insult of a nation that has been our ally. The insults to that nation have been not only by word of lip, but also by newspaper caricatures. ' Whilst I believe in the policy of a White Australia, and would gladly give my life to preserve it, I will not be a party to insulting an ally. Japan paid the greatest compliment ever paid to our race and language when she asked one of our most eminent philosophers to advise her how to escape entangling alliances and quarrels with other nations. In reply, Herbert Spencer penned what, in the opinion of some of the greatest critics of literature, is, perhaps, the most important letter ever written by human hands. We ought to approach that nation, not with insults, but with the sacred word " reciprocity," which is a word to conjure with throughout the Orient. The letter written by Herbert Spencer was so important that I shall confine my remarks to the reading of it, so that honorable members may see it in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and realize how great a man he was, how much he was misunderstood, and why, in the pathos of that knowledge he asked, the great nation of Japan not to publish his letter until he had passed into the shadows. I quote from page 321 of the <inline font-style="italic">Life and Letters of Herbert Spen-</inline> 26th August, 1892. </para>

                    <para class="block">To Ken taro Kaneko. </para>
                    <para>Your proposal to send translations of my two letters to Count Ito, the newly-appointed Prime Minister, is quite satisfactory. I very willingly give my assent. </para>
                    <para>Respecting the further questions you ask, let me, in the first place, answer generally that the Japanese policy should, I think, be that of keeping Americans and Europeans as much as possible at arm's length. In presence of the more powerful races your position is one of chronic danger, and you should take every precaution to give as little foothold as possible to foreigners. </para>
                    <para>It seems to me that the only forms of inter- course which you may with advantage permit are those which are indispensable for the ex-' change of commodities and exchange of ideas - importation and exportation of physical and mental products. No further privileges should be allowed to people of other races, and especially to people of the more powerful races, than is absolutely needful for the achievement of these ends. Apparently you are proposing, by revision of the treaty powers with Europe and America, " to open the whole Empire to foreigners and foreign capital." I regard this as a fatal policy. If you wish to see what is likely to happen, study the history of India. Once let one of the more powerful races gain a. <inline font-style="italic">point d'appui</inline> and there will inevitably, in course of time, grow up an aggressive policy, which will lead to collisions with the Japanese; these collisions will be represented as attacks by the Japanese which must be avenged; forces will be sent from America or Europe, as the case may be; a portion of territory will be seized and required to be made over as a foreign settlement; and from this there will grow eventually subjugation of the entire Japanese Empire. ' I believe that you will have great difficulty in avoiding this fate in any case, but you will make the process easy if you allow any privileges to foreigners beyond those which I have indicated. </para>
                    <para>In pursuance of the advice thus generally indicated, I should say, in answer to your first question, that there should be, not only a pro- » hibition to foreign persons to hold property in land, but also a refusal to give them leases, and the permission only to reside as annual tenants. </para>
                    <para>To the second question, I should say, decidedly, prohibit to foreigners the working of the mines owned or worked by Government. Here there would be obviously liable to arrive grounds of difference between the Europeans or Americans who worked them and the Government, and these grounds of difference would immediately become grounds of quarrel, and -would be followed by invocations to' the English or American Governments, or other powers, to send forces to insist on whatever i the European workers claimed; for always the habit here and elsewhere among the civilized peoples is to believe what their agents or settlers abroad represent to them. </para>
                    <para>In the third place, in pursuance of the policy I have indicated, you ought also to keep the coasting trade in your own 'hands, and forbid foreigners to engage in it. This coasting trade is clearly not included in the requirement I have indicated as the sole one to be recognised - a requirement to facilitate exportation and importation of commodities. The distribution of commodities brought to Japan from other places may be properly left to the Japanese themselves, and should be denied to foreigners, for the reason that, again, the various transactions involved would become so many doors open to quarrels, and result in aggressions. </para>
                    <para>To your remaining question respecting the inter-marriage of foreigners and Japanese, which you say is " now very much agitated among our scholars and politicians," and which you say is "one of the most difficult problems," ray reply is that, as rationally answered, there is no difficulty at all. It should be positively forbidden. It is not at root a question of social philosophy. It is at root a question of biology. There is abundant proof,  alike furnished by the inter-marriages of human races and by the inter-breeding  of  animals, that, when the varieties mingled diverge beyond a certain slight degree, the result is invariably a bad  one  in the  long  run. I have myself . been in the habit of looking at the evidence bearing on  this  matter for many years past, and my conviction is based upon numerous facts derived from numerous sources. This conviction I have, within the last  half-hour,  verified, for I happen to be staying in the country with a gentleman who is well known as an authority on horses, cattle, and sheep, and knows much respecting their inter-breeding, and he has just, on inquiry, fully confirmed my belief that when, say, of different varieties of sheep, there is an inter-breeding of those which are widely unlike, the result, especially in the second generation, is a bad one - there arises an incalculable mixture  of  traits, and what may be called a chaotic constitution. And the same thing happens amongst human beings - the Eurasians in India and the half-breeds in America  show  this. The physiological basis of this experience appears to be that any one variety of creature in course of many generations acquires a certain constitutional adaptation to its particular form of life, and every other variety similarly acquires its own special adaptation. ' The consequence is that, if you mix the constitutions of two widely divergent varieties which have severally become adapted to widely divergent modes of life, you get a constitution which is adapted to. the mode of life of neither - a constitution which will not work properly, because it is not fitted  for  any  Bet  of conditions whatever; by all means, therefore, peremptorily interdict marriages of Japanese with foreigners. </para>
                    <para>I have, for the reasons indicated, entirely approved of the regulations which have been established in America for restraining the Chinese immigration, and, had I the power, would restrict them to the smallest possible amount, my reasons for this decision being, that one of two things must happen. If the Chinese are allowed to settle extensively in America, they . must either, if they remain unmixed, form a subject race, in the position, if not  of  slaves, yet of a class approaching to slaves; or, if they mix, they must form a bad hybrid. In either case, supposing the immigration to be large, immense social mischief must arise, and eventually social disorganization. The same thing will happen if there should be any considerable mixture of the European or American races with the Japanese. </para>
                    <para>You see, therefore, that my advice is strongly conservative in all directions, and I end by saying as I began - keep other races at arm's length  as  much as possible. </para>
                    <para>I give this advice in confidence. I wish that it should not transpire publicly, at any rate during my life, for I  do  not desire to rouse the animosity of my fellow countrymen. </para>
                    <para>P.S.  -  Of course, when I say I wish this advice to he in. confidence, I do not interdict the -communication of it to Count Ito, but rather wish that he should have the opportunity of taking it. into consideration. </para>

                        <para>- I have been endeavouring to show that it would have been better for the Government to endeavour to amend the principal Act by removing from it a provision which gives great offence to one of our Allies. To sum up my argument, I am trying to show that it is not yet too late for the Government to make such an amendment of the Bill when it is before another place, and thus to extend a courtesy to an Allied nation, instead of insulting it. We believe in the policy of a White Australia, and we should tell Japan that we are seeking to follow the very example which Japan set us when she sought the advice of Herbert Spencer. In such circumstances Japan could not take offence at our action, since " imitation is the sincerest flattery." If we were to tell Japan that we are seeking to hold Australia just as the Japanese seek to hold their country, they would Dot regard our legislation in respect of immigration as an insult' to them. We could also assure them, with no lack of firmness, that, just as they would be prepared to defend their country, so we are prepared to defend our policy of a White Australia. </para>

                        <para>. - I recently brought, under the notice of the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Wise) the lack of accommodation for invalid soldiers at. the Randwick Military. Hospital. Several out-door, patients have informed me that there are about 1,500. men attending the hospital in that capacity. There  is  no room- for them in, the hospital itself, and; many- of them were asked to go to their homes in order that accommodation might be found' for the more serious cases. This request was complied with by these men, who have not been discharged, but are receiving only their military pay of 5s. per day. While they were actually, in the military hospital, they were, in addition, receiving rations; and the provision of food for them . in their- own homes imposes an additional strain on their resources. These men are now feeling the pinch owing to the high cost of living, I asked the Assistant Minister; for Defence to arrange to give them a- ration allowance representing the cost ' which would have been incurred in supplying them with food in the hospital. The Minister to-day, however, came along with an answer to my question, prepared, evidently by an official; and' merely setting out that there is plenty of accommodation in the hospital for such men; This hospital is in my electorate, and I know that it is crowded. I ask the Minister, if. possible, to try to arrange' that: these men shall receive a ration allowance equivalent to the cost of that which the Department would have had' to provide for them had they remained in the hospital. They- have- not been discharged. If they had been, the position would' be different. They would like,. if well,, to be discharged, so . as. to be able- to be. employed', but they are still on military pay.
