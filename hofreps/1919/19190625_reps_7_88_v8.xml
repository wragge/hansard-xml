                        <para>Some months ago, having ascertained that the coal industry was in an unsettled and critical condition, and that the stocks of coal in many parts of the Commonwealth were dangerously low, the Government called the employers and employees together in conference. After full consideration, it was decided, in order to prevent a serious dislocation of industry, to authorize an increase of wages as agreed upon by the employers and employees, and a corresponding increase in the selling price of coal and coke. </para>

                        <para>- Is the Acting Prime Minister aware of the very serious position of North Queensland? North of Rockhampton there is no communication other than by sea, and, as a consequence of the seamen's strike, the people in that portion of Queensland are very short of provisions and also medical necessities very urgently required because of the prevalence of influenza. I have here a telegram from Bowen which tells me that, owing to the shortage of flour, starvation is imminent. In view of this, I ask the Acting Prime Minister if any Commonwealth overseas ships cannot be diverted in order to take provisions to Northern Queensland? I may be permitted to say that, although I have received a number of telegrams in reference to the seriousness of the position, in not one is it suggested that there should be any yielding on the part of the Government. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member has on very many occasions pointed out to the Government, and chiefly to myself, the unfortunate position of many of the communities in Northern Queensland. Yesterday, particularly, he stressed the view that a special attempt should be made, apart 'altogether from the strike, <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> put a vessel in communication with places in Northern Queensland which are beyond the  Teach  of railways. I got into communication with the Shipping Controller, to see how far : this suggestion is capable of operation; and he advises  me  that he is already endeavouring to arrange for one vessel to load cargo for Northern Queensland ports. He points out that it is very difficult to induce the oversea ships to accept cargo for Northern Queensland ports on account of the uncertainty of arranging foT the discharge of the cargo. In some cases ships have been hung up because of the refusal of the unions to handle cargo in Northern Queensland ports. The Shipping Controller further says that if definite assurance could be given that there would be no delay in the discharge of cargo, it would be possible to arrange for oversea ships to accept cargo. </para>

                            <para>- Very many workers in the community, probably 90 per cent, of them, if compelled to take a Monday holiday, will lose pay for that day. Will the Government endeavour to make such arrangement, at any rate as employers, as will insure that the men who are compelled to take a holiday receive payment for that day ? </para>

                                <para>- I have not yet. considered whether an employer should be compelled to pay wages for a compulsory holiday, but I shall do so. It seems to me that if the peace is real, and the terms are as satisfactory as we all hope they will be, the people of this country, whatever their station in life, will  not boggle over the minor questions that usually concern them. It may be, however, that owing to the present industrial disturbance, and widespread unemployment, the loss of a day's pay is more than usually serious. </para>

When the Government first considered, some months ago, the question of the celebration of Peace, if and when it should come, we requested a then member of the Ministry, the honorable member for Nepean <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Orchard)</inline> to take charge of the matter. Within the financial limits imposed by the Government, the honorable member was allowed a free hand to make arrangements with the State Governments and the municipal authorities, and his last report to me was that the amount which the Government thought they could afford to spend in celebrating Peace would not be more than half spent. </para>

                        <para>- I appreciate the honorable member's unfailing courtesy, but there is a sting in the tail of his question. The Government are not unmindful of their responsibility in matters of this kind. The first thing I saw in reference to this communication was the report in the press to which, undoubtedly, the honorable member refers. Doubtless this is one of the many communications which reach the Prime Minister's office, and, not being treated as a personal matter, are sent on to the Departments concerned. The honorable member no doubt knows the procedure in such cases. I may take the opportunity of saying that there is growing up in Australia a grave system of official discourtesy. Governments all over Australia, and various other public bodies, announce in the press that they have sent communications to the Acting Prime Minister, who, however, seldom, if ever, sees them. The proper way to conduct official correspondence is to send it  through the post or by telegraph, and give the information to the press after it has been received. </para>

                        <para>- An application was made by the Government of Tasmania, when the intimation appeared in the press that the Commonwealth had sent experts to Blythe River, that certain other deposits should be examined. I do not know whether the particular deposit mentioned by the honorable member was on the list, but it was explained in our communications, as I remember them, to the Government of Tasmania, that we could not search for iron and find experts for the State Government to identify or describe iron ore in the many deposits in Tasmania. We are inspecting and having this place reported upon, because we have an option over it for Commonwealth purposes; but the States must do their own geological and mineralogical work. </para>

                        <para>- I have been inquiring into that matter to-day.. It was submitted to me for consideration by some other good folk. I have just received a reply from the Defence Department which indicates, at first blush, that the difficulties with regard to Egypt have been special. The date of enlistment meant priority of return in the Old Country, where there were vast numbers of men; but that system could not be operated in quite the same way for the Egyptian or Mesopotamian troops. It appears that the Department therefore adopted, on the advice of the highest organizing authority, the unit embarkation theory, which, I think, will keep some of the troops in Egypt away a little longer than some of the troops in England. I understand that there are about 9,000 men, all told, in Egypt at the present time. </para>

The " agitation," which has been properly named by him, has been brought under the notice of the Government, and, with respect to myself, has caused a very deep and lasting feeling of depression. As to whether the Government intend to observe the constitutional requirement, I can only say that they would be recreant to their duty if they did not see that the Constitution and laws of this country, which they are sworn to administer, were given effect. </para>

The Government take full responsibility for the Prime Minister's utterances in London in respect of all matters. We could not, even if we desired to do so, dissociate ourselves from our share of that responsibility. As to how far the cabled reports of the right honorable gentleman's utterances are correct, I have no means of judging. The policy of the Government on Tariff matters will be considered in full consultation with all the members of the Cabinet. </para>

                        <para>- The Government propose to take steps that will lead to the £100,000, made out of the wheat sacks, being refunded to the Wheat Pool. The circumstances under which the rabbit business was transacted make it practically impossible to do what the honorable member suggests. It is not practicable to trace to the men who actually caught the rabbits the various transactions in regard to the skins, and that is the only means by which we could make a refund to the trappers. Had it been possible no doubt the Government would have been very glad to do what the honorable member suggests. </para>

                        <para>It was officially stated to-day . that Java sugar was £30 a ton, and it cost £2 a ton to carry it to Australia. Sugar in the United Kingdom was quoted at about £57 a ton, and in America at £46 a ton. Therefore, it was stated, if the prices were repealed there would be every incentive to export sugar from Australia, leaving us with insufficient, sugar supplies, and thus sending up prices like a rocket. Is there any truth in the statement that the Minister is endeavouring to give further opportunities to the enemies of Australia to raise the price of sugar? </para>

                        <para>- It is a little difficult to follow the honorable member, but I may say that there is in force, as between the Commonwealth and the Queensland Governments, an agreement under which we are obliged to purchase the whole of the sugar produced in Queensland for the next twelve months. I regret very much to say that the crop this year, as well as last year's crop, fell very much below anticipations, and that the probabilities are that there will be in Australia a serious shortage of sugar, the extent of which at present can only be guessed. Anticipating, however, from all the information we could obtain, that this shortage would occur, we entered into contracts, some considerable time ago, for the purchase of a very large quantity of sugar. That was before the market price had risen to anything like the figure at which it stands to-day. Whilst I am unable to promise that there will be no rise in the price of sugar during the next twelve months, by averaging the Australian sugar with the imported sugar which we are buying, I think I can definitely say that the increase in price will not be great. The control will be maintained as long as it is necessary, and there is no possibility of anything of the nature suggested by the honorable member happening, so as to result in the exploitation of the Australian consumer, through any oversea agency. </para>

If the Minister is  agreeable,  the -motion, being unopposed, is taken as formal, and moved without debate, and the papers are then tabled accordingly. It would be better to adhere to the old practice which prevailed before the war. </para>

                <para>In asking for temporary Supply, it is proper that I should give the Committee a brief indication of the general financial position of the Commonwealth. I shall deal first with War Loan Finance. </para>
                <para>The seven war loans raised by the Commonwealth within Australia brought in a total of £188,432,040. To this must be added receipts from the sale of War Savings Certificates, £5,140,513. The total amount, therefore, raised in Australia was £193,572,553. We borrowed direct from the British Government £47,500,000. The British Government further paid for the maintenance of Australian troops overseas, and for their munitions £70,645,000, but of this last amount Australia has repaid £26,000,000, leaving the amount due to Great Britain for the payments at £44,645,000. </para>
                <para>The amount borrowed altogether consequently totals £285,717,553. The Treasurer had on hand on the 31st May unexpended war loan moneys amounting to £24,176,449. Deducting this from the total borrowed, it will be seen that the war loan expenditure to the 31st May last has been, approximately, £261,541,104. </para>
                <para>Although the Armistice was signed seven months ago, there has not been any diminution of the expenditure directly borne by the Commonwealth, out of loans. Disbursements on munitions have certainly disappeared, but as the cost was being met temporarily by the British Government, the Commonwealth Treasury has not yet felt relief. On the contrary, large payments for transports and deferred pay have increased the drain from the Treasury. Demobilization is expected soon to be complete, and then the war payments in respect to soldiers still in khaki will be reduced to comparatively small proportions. Some hospital expenditure, however, will be required for a considerable time. </para>
                <para>Although the payments referred to may be expected to rapidly diminish in the near future, the repatriation effort will necessitate the raising of further loans. At the Premiers' Conference of January last, the Commonwealth agreed to lend to the States sums of money aggregating over £30,000,000 to enable them to carry out a programme of settling 20,000 returned soldiers on the land. The payments under the War Service Homes Act are likely also to reach a large figure, but the amount cannot at present be indicated even roughly. Sustenance payments will also require considerable funds. With the heavy expenditure in prospect, it will be necessary before long to raise another war loan. </para>
                <para>Interest on the war debt now amounts to £13,170,000 per annum. Of that amount, there is payable to Australian lenders £8,560,000, and to the British Government £4,610,000. Difficulties of exchange, with which the financial and commercial community are well acquainted, have prevented payments which otherwise would have been made to the British Government in reduction of Australian indebtedness. We are not able at the present moment, and have not been able for some time, to transfer to London the interest which is due to Great Britain, and it has, consequently, been decided to establish a trust account in the Treasury to which will be credited about £2,000,000. This will enable the interest to be charged to the present year's accounts that should properly carry it, and to be held in the Treasury until exchange becomes available. This difficulty is receiving attention in the Treasury, and I hope will soon be removed. </para>
                <para>The total annual recurring charge at present upon the Consolidated  Revenue  in respect of the war may be set down as follows : - </para>

                <para>The total expenditure of the Commonwealth out of revenue in the financial year before the war was £23,160,000, including payments to the States. The war burden has. thus almost doubled the payments out of revenue. The indemnity imposed by the Allies upon Germany may somewhat lighten this load, but, judging by present indications, any such payment to Australia will probably be spread over a long period of years, and will represent a comparatively small portion of our total cost of war. The Australian taxpayer must, according to my information and judgment, make up his mind to carry and liquidate the great bulk of Australia's war debt. </para>

                        <para>- It is due to the fact that the Budget was produced in a period of war, and to the House having to provide for the conception of the war lasting till the end of the financial year. Direct taxation is also likely to be in excess of estimates. The Department is still issuing income and land tax assessment, and all the money will not be received before 30th June. When the accounts have been closed I expect that the expenditure will be below the estimates. On the whole, a satisfactory surplus may <inline font-style="italic">bt</inline> expected for the year which is now closing, though it is quite impossible at this stage to hazard a guess as to its size. As early as practicable in August the Budget statement for the new year will be presented to the House. Complete information as to the finances will then be available. During the first week of July, however, I hope to be able to lay on the table a statement giving the approximate receipts and payments of the Commonwealth in 1918-19 under the main heads. This will show as nearly as one can what the surplus is likely to be. This Supply Bill, though nominally for two months, really is for about  a fifth of the year, because a pay-day for the Public Service occurs on 5th September, and it is necessary to provide funds for other services for a little longer than that. The total amount of the Supply asked is £4,337,335. Included in this, as will be seen from the Bill circulated last night, is £700,000 for Treasurer's Advance, which is required for the continuation of public works in progress and for unforeseen items generally. </para>

                <para>In the first Supply Bill for the current year an amount of £1,000,000 was included under the head of Treasurer's Advance, but the officers of the Treasury advise me that £700.000 is likely to suffice for the present. To get a fair comparison with the total amount of the expenditure approved by the Parliament for the'year 1918-19 it is necessary to deduct the £700,000 for Treasurer's Advance, £80,000 for refunds of revenue, and £1,452,000 for war expenditure payable out of revenue. After abstracting these sums, the amount in the Supply Bid is £2,105,335, which is rather less than one-fifth of the £11,207,860 granted by the Parliament for the comparable services in the year just ended. The £1,452,000 set down for war services is composed of the following items: - War pensions, £1,040,000; repatriation of Australian soldiers, £356,000; and other war services, £56,000. The Bill includes no new items. It is for ordinary services only, and the total is less than that which was provided for a similar period of the previous year. </para>

                        <para>- The press has been refusing to do a lot of things lately, and the Government have had to take their own course with the press. The honorable member is not more in love with the press than I am myself ; and recently I felt it my duty to shut the press out of the public Departments for a considerable time. This was not with the object of getting the press to criticise the Government less, but in order to insure that official statements of facts or policy were published as they were uttered, and not manipulated to suit some organs. As I have said, there is nothing extraordinary or new in the expenditure under this Bill, and I think I have given honorable members enough material to enable them to compare the items for the corresponding period of this year and the coming year for which we are providing Supply. Having given the assurances I have, I think. I am justified in asking that this Supply be granted by the Committee. I  have only to add that the Government have no desire to rush this Bill through either House. We realize quite clearly that the Committee of Supply in either House is entitled to reasonable time for discussion after so long a recess. The only reservation I make is that we desire to be able to pay war pensions constantly falling due ana wages commitments, the first of which the Treasury officers tell me will fall due on Wednesday, the 2nd July. Within that limitation I ask honorable members to discuss this Bill as freely as they desire, and any information which the Treasury or the Departments can afford will be freely given. </para>

I went further, in replying to the same toast, and pointed out that, on the last day on which Parliament sat last year, there was a meeting of the Government party upstairs, and the party agreed that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> should go to London. The responsibility, therefore, was upon the whole party for the visit of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> his wife, and family to Great Britain to do certain work. </para>

The honorable member for Robertson knows a little of the work of the Defence Department over there, and of demobilization proceedings, and I should like to hear him say whether demobilization is not proceeding more harmoniously now, and whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has impeded the work over there. </para>

                <para>Many matters should be referred to in discussing this Bill. One is the tremendous increase in the cost of living. ITo matter what Government is in power, it will have to deal with that question. Recently the Government lifted the embargo on the export of hides. The people who were holding hides in Australia would not sell them. Before the war the very best hides that Australia could  turn  out, which are some of the best in the world, were less than ls. per lb. The, price was then fixed at ls. l£d., but directly the embargo was lifted it jumped up to ls. 8d. The farmer has obtained no advantage from th,alt. because the hides were in store here; and it was estimated that over 1,000,000 hides were held by the speculators and the big killing companies of Australia. They are the people who made the profit on those hides, but the people of Australia have to pay. We are anxious .that the very test should be done for Australian industries. We have here the material to turn those hides into leather. We have the bark and the grease. We have the hides and the labour, and every one will admit that Australian leather made a name for itself during the recent war; but, instead of the work being done here, .we are going to send away the hides and the tanning materials, and deprive our own people of the work. To take the embargo off the export of hides was not a statesmanlike action. It would have been far better to keep them in Australia to create labour for our people. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> can give us information on that point. If they were not exported, it means that their price was artificially inflated. We are told that, instead of the prices of commodities going down, they are likely to increase. This means, then, that the value of land is to increase, the value of cattle will increase, the values of commodities will increase, but the value of human life will be less. I shall never subscribe to a policy which means that the life of any individual in this community is to be counted second to the life of a beast, or to the value of a piece of land. The lives of human beings should be valued higher than commodities or land or beasts. </para>

                <para>Let me give one illustration on the question of the cost of living. Bread to-day is dearer in Australia than it has been probably for forty years. Forty years ago you could get a 4-lb. loaf for what a 2-lb. loaf costs to-day. The wages of the people who are producing the article have not made all that difference. During the past three or four weeks bread has gone up in Melbourne by &amp;&amp;. per 2-lb. loaf, and this increase is attributed to the increase of the wages of the bread carters. </para>

                        <para>- Not that I know of. A recent law case showed that it was impossible for a customer to transfer his patronage from one master baker to another. The proprietor of a cafe in Melbourne had left baker " A " and gone to baker " B." The case was taken to the committee of the master bakers organization, and the customer -was compelled to go back to baker "A." Baker " A " can supply any sort of bread that he likes, and his customers are not allowed to leave him. That is one of the results of that employers' union, the Master Bakers Association. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and a lady who was a member of the association, in Parkville, was fined £50 because she broke its rules. In my own district the Civil Service Co-operative Bakery - the largest in Victoria, and one of the largest in Australia/ - was refused flour by the millers. The case was taken to Court under the War Precautions Act, and the millers, who defended the case, were fined £50. They were a firm that admitted a few years ago that they had lost £6,000 worth of flour sacks, and did not know that they had lost them, so they must have been making enormous profits. Although the defendants gave notice of appeal, "they did not appeal, because they did not want these things shown up to the public. These are the things that are increasing the cost of living. In the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of the 14th inst. a paragraph was published stating that the new determination of the Bread Carters Wages Board, which was to come into operation on the 21st inst., had been discussed at a meeting of bread carters. A resolution expressing dissatisfaction with the determination was passed, and it was decided to refer the matter to a conference of the bread carters and bakers' societies, then in session at the Trades Hall. It was said that while the master bakers had raised the price of bread by Jd. all round, and were reaping a considerable profit on the transaction, only twelve firms were paying the increased wages. A letter appeared about a week before stating that the price of bread was increased from 7d. to 7£d. per 4-lb. loaf on the 30th of the previous month, the reason given being the increase of wages. The wages increase was not to take effect until the 21st inst., but the price of bread was increased three weeks before that. This is the sort of thing that is giving rise to the continual industrial unrest. I told a gathering of the Chamber of Manufactures that I was not surprised at the existence of industrial unrest, and that the only thing that surprised me was that there was not more of it. How some of the women manage to maintain their families on the weekly wages coming into their homes, I am at a loss to know. When the price of bread was increased from 7d. to 7$d. per loaf on the 30th ultimo, the reason -given was that the wages of the operative bakers had recently been increased, and that on 21st inst. further increases of wages would have to be paid to the bread-carters. The combined increases to bakers and carters range from 14s,. to l'7s. per week; but on the average load of 140 loaves the increase in the price of bread would amount to 5s. lOd. per cart per day, or 40s. lOd. per cart per week. This., it is pointed out, is a very impressive illustration of the ratio in which the public are made to pay for increased costs in the baking trade. </para>

                        <para>- Power should be given to one Parliament in Australia to deal with the whole question of the illegality of combines. We know that when combinations were practically made illegal in the United States of America, the various trusts took steps to secure their incorporation in the State of New Jersey, where they could practically flout the Federal law. If we have to wait until action is taken by the slowest State in Australia to deal with these matters, then Australians will be waiting a long time for the redress of their grievances. </para>

It was alleged that the returned soldier was swindled by those from whom he made his purchase, and that the furniture obtained by him was of Chinese manufacture. Is it not absurd to teach some of our returned soldiers how to make furniture when we allow others to purchase Chinese furniture out of advances made by the Department? It should be laid down by the Repatriation Department that as long as returned soldiers  are making furniture no part of any advance made to a returned soldier shall be used for the purchase of furniture of Chinese manufacture. Our own men are making furniture superior to anything turned out by the Chinese of Melbourne or elsewhere. This is not a party question, and I hope it will receive the attention of the Repatriation Department. </para>

Superimposed upon the Ministerial statement we have had from the Treasurer in connexion with this measure a semi-Budget statement, and we are asked to deal with it without being afforded an opportunity to assimilate the figures. We are asked to pass in two and a half days a Bill providing for an expenditure of some £4,300,000. Within these two and a half days we are to deal, not only with this proposed expenditure, but with the various problems that have arisen during the six months that we have been in re cess. That is the only time allowed us by the Government to deal with such questions as the industrial unrest which now prevails, profiteering, and the steps which should be taken to put it down, as well as other important subjects which we must have an opportunity to consider. </para>

                    <para>.- The procedure adopted by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> is unusual. The honorable gentleman should have consented to an adjournment of the debate in order to give honorable members an opportunity to examine the Supply Bill, and to consider the financial statement made by him, more especially as we have nothing before us to enable us to thoroughly grasp its purport. It is difficult at any time to follow the honorable gentleman when he is dealing with an array of figures covering our receipts and expenditure, and it is to be regretted that on this occasion he has not circulated a financial statement which we might compare with the last Budget statement made by him. </para>

                <para>We have every reason to complain of the brutal tactics of the Ministerialists, who have a majority of two to one in this Chamber, and who refused to permit us any time to discuss the Estimates other than the few hours between 11.20 a.m. on one day and 4.30 p.m. on the following day. That was the attitude they adopted towards us, notwithstanding that the Estimates covered an expenditure of some £120,000,000. The Estimates relating to some of the Departments, indeed, were not allowed to be discussed. I do not think it is too late even now to refer to the way in which the Treasurer brought in his Estimates. The method adopted was entirely new, since the Estimates as submitted, instead of giving us the actual expenditure of the previous year, simply compared the Estimates for the current financial year with the Estimates of the previous year. Formerly we had had the actual expenditure for the previous year side by side with the Estimates for the period under review. Such a method in my opinion, tends only to confuse the House. I should have preferred to see the Treasurer bring forward his Estimates of revenue in this way, although with greater detail: - </para>

                <para>Deduct estimated receipts, £39,634,270, from estimated expenditure, £44,544,595, and we get a deficiency of £4,910,325, after allowing for the £5,356,000 which the Treasurer ' expects to obtain by new taxation. </para>
                <para>The Treasurer partly made up that deficiency by taking the money set aside for Invalid and Old-age Pensions, £3,995,091, and balances brought from London, £800,000, making a total of £4,705,091. But he will not be able to draw on such reserves during the financial year 1919-20. In order to arrive at the total estimated expenditure for the year ending 30th June, 1919, we must add to the estimated expenditure of £44,544,595 the amount of £78,914,809 paid out of loan for war services. This gives a total of £123,459,404. If we deduct from that the estimated receipts, £39,634,270, we have a probable deficit on the year's transactions of £83,825,134. Add that to the public debt of the Commonwealth, viz., £272,022,072, and we get a total public debt of £355,847,206. I believe those figures are approximately correct, but they cannot be absolutely accurate, because the cessation of hostilities has already taken 150,000 soldiers off the pay sheets. But they show that there has been a very great increase in. our public debt, and the Treasurer will have to meet an interest bill of not less than £16,000,000 for the year ending 30th June, 1920, apart altogether from any sinking fund to repay the loans. </para>
                <para>I do not agree with the proposal of the Treasurer to rob the States of their <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> allowance of 25s., which we agreed to pay as compensation for the Federal authority taking all Customs and Excise revenue. The Treasurer proposes to reduce that payment by 2s. 6d. per head of population in each year, commencing in 1920-21, until the payment reaches 10s. in 1925-26. That <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment of 10s. is to continue for the succeeding five years, when it will be again reviewed by the Federal Parliament. It was in 1910 that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> the then Treasurer, introduced a Bill to provide that the States should receive a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment of 25s. for a period of ten yeaTs, and at that time the States were in great fear that the Commonwealth would rob them of a considerable amount of revenue. It is very easy for the Treasurer to propose to make good the deficiency which will arise through the war debt by reducing the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> allowance to the States. But we must remember that the States have a great deal to do with their revenue. Many of the activities of the State authorities enter into the very heart of the social and domestic life of the community. There are many domestic Departments to be maintained, which were not included in the Commonwealth's thirty-nine articles. There are State Departments of Mines, of Agriculture, of Education, and of Charity. In Queensland the Charities Department is very comprehensive. Any unfortunate wife whose husband has deserted her is given by the Department assistance for the maintenance of herself and her children. That is an allowance which ought to have been granted long ago by all the States. </para>
                <para>Mr.West. - The maintenance of the children is provided for in New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- There, waa a time in Queensland when a widowed mother who could not maintain her children was compelled to board them out. Now she can claim from the Charity Department an allowance for their maintenance. Similarly a deserted wife can obtain assistance for herself and her children, and there is a further provision for granting aid to the wife and children of a man who is ill and unable to earn a living. The Charities Departments of the States must be continued. If the Commonwealth could prove to the general public that it is expending money more economically than the States are doing, we might have some claim to reduce the payments to the States. But where can we point to any wise system of economy in our Federal expenditure? </para>

                        <para>- The procedure has been most irregular, and indicates the extravagant way in which the Government deal with questions of this nature. The Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Webster)</inline> will recollect that when he was a Minister in a Labour Government and appointments were brought before Cabinet the salaries were always mentioned. Why are the Government sending <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> abroad? Is the trip a solatium for his deprivation of the position in the Northern Territory, or do the Government think that they have so much money to dispose of that they may expend it in this extravagant fashion? We could easily refer to a score of other such items. Before the Government deprived the States of 2s. 6d. per head per annum, commencing in 1920-21, they ought to show that they are prepared to exercise a wise economy. I do not say that they should start in wholesale fashion to throw large numbers of men out of employment. </para>

                        <para>- That policy would be a mistake. But there are ways in which the Government could save hundreds of thousands of pounds. They certainly' could economize to a considerable extent in the proposed expenditure upon the Naval Bases. If the Allies' victory in the late war is to bring into being a new world, and we are to have the protection of a League of Nations - as I believe we shall have - what will be the use of expending hundreds of thousands of pounds on the creation of Naval Bases ? </para>

                <para>On the figures with which the Treasurer has supplied the Committee, I estimate that the Budget speech will show that we shall require nearly £16,000,000 to meet our interest bill, and that we shall be obliged to raise about £10,000,000 of new revenue in order to pay our way. Where is that money to be obtained ? Are we to receive an indemnity of £120,000,000 from the Germans ? I have heard rumours that the Acting Prime Minister is in possession of certain information; indeed, he almost admitted as much in the first part of his statement: - </para>

                    <para>Until the protracted deliberations of the Peace Conference were approaching finality, it was considered inadvisable to summon the Houses for the discussion of public business. Even now the information at the disposal of the Government as to the terms of peace is not sufficient to warrant the submission of the matter to Parliament, and it appears probable that it will have to await the return of the Australian representatives. </para>

                        <para>- He will need to do so in order to justify the motion of confidence in him passed by the National party at its Caucus meeting yesterday. If the terms of peace include the payment of reparation by the Germans to an amount which will cover war pensions it will account for £6,000,000, so that we shall only require to find about £4,000,000 of fresh money per annum in -order to pay our way. If, however, there is no payment of that kind, the Government will need to get £10,000,000 or £11,000,000 from some source or other. Where do they propose to get it? For one thing, they propose to rob the States in order to get some of it. Are they going to increase the rates of the income tax, the probate duties, and the land tax?. Or are they to, have a " khaki " election, so that they may come back with a mandate giving them a free hand to do as they like - to tax the general public by way of certain duties on tea, kerosene, and so forth? There is a very strong impression abroad that there will be a general election as soon as the Prime Minister returns. The electoral officers have been instructed to speed up and get all the rolls ready, so that when he returns the Government can rush to the country. There is a general impression that they will even go to the country without dealing with the Tariff. </para>

A person is supposed to write his name and address on the back of the form, but if he does so, he destroys the writing on the front. Consequently, the form has to be torn up, and a fresh one has to be filled in. On my travels, I have heard that the Postmaster-General has actually deprived the travelling post-office employees of their uniforms. These men have a difficult job to perform travelling during the night, and sorting letters, yet men who have been twenty years and thirty years in the service have been deprived of the privilege of having their old uniforms. The Postmaster-General has now issued to them the same uniform that telegraph messengers who have just entered the service are asked to wear. </para>

                        <para>- I can assure the Postmaster-General I .am not joking about the matter. I met a man in Queensland who was very distressed over it. I sympathized with him. He said, " I have been thirty years in the service, and have been deprived of the uniform I used to wear. I think I am entitled to that privilege." It is poor economy that the Postmaster-General is practising. A great deal of time is lost in saving pieces of string, and in writing on the backs of used envelopes, and a great deal more money is wasted in that way than if fresh string and fresh envelopes were used. I did not criticise the Minister during the war because I thought that he was trying to do his best in the way of exercising economy; but now that the war is over, and paper is cheaper, I think it would be wiser <inline font-style="italic">to consider tha comfort</inline> of the people who make use of the Post-office, and the personal pride of the departmental employees in the matter of uniforms. </para>

                        <para>- It is interesting to honorable members to know that out of 416,000 soldiers who enlisted it is expected that only about 20,000 will take up land - a very small percentage. In the old days we used to think there would be many thousands desirous of settling on the land. We in Queensland have reason to feel that the Commonwealth Government have not met us as it might have done in this matter. In addition to the schedule of 699,000 acres, the Queensland Government set apart in </para>

                        <para>- It is not the hinterland of Maryborough. One of the great defects in Australia is that the people in certain centres want to monopolize all the trade and commerce; and Australia will never progress until we aim at decentralization, and settle people where they ought to be settled. I am surprised that an otherwise broad-minded man should throw such obstacles in the way of the construction of this railway; his is a parochial view unworthy of a statesman. Once this money is expended it will bring settlement so much nearer to one of the best ports in Queensland, namely, the port of Gladstone. I approached the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> in this matter, and he referred meto <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who wrote a letter in the following terms :  - </para>

                    <para>With reference to your letter of the 15th instant, asking my views on a letter received from the  Hon.  W. G. Higgs on the subject of advancing a loan of £1,420,000 to the State of Queensland for the purpose of building certain railways, I have to advise that the arrangement made at the Premiers' Conference was that the Commonwealth should provide funds to the extent necessary for each State to make available its estimated quota of holdings for the soldier land settlement scheme, and this, 1 consider, fully meets the present requirements. </para>
                    <para>The Queensland proposals to the extent of their quota have already been approved, and the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs</inline> for consideration of a loan of £1,420,000 is in addition to the provision required for the Queensland quota. </para>
                    <para>This request really amounts to a proposal that the Commonwealth should finance Queensland for its ordinary public works policy, and, if such a request were agreed to, other States would naturally expect similar assistance; and I strongly urge, therefore, that the proposal be not entertained. </para>

This 2,000,000 acres of land is mostly Crown land, and can be got for the purposes of settlement for practically nothing; whereas we know that the Government of Victoria are paying £20 an acre in order to settle returned soldiers. Maryborough need not complain, seeing that it would get its share of the advantages of the line from Mundubbera . to Monto.

                </continue><para>During the last elections the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> sent a personal letter to the mother of every soldier, and audaciously addressed each one of them, although he could not know hundreds of thousands of them, as "My dear." The Government have now to make good the promises made in that letter. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> promised that his Government would not desert the mothers, or their sons at the Front, either during the war or after the war; and at the same time he said there was another party, meaning the party on this side of the House, who were pro- Germans, Sinn Feiners, and disloyalists, who would desert them. I suppose that at the next khaki election, when we get this indemnity of £120,000,000 from the Germans, we of the Labour party will be described as Bolsheviks. The general impression is that Bolsheviks are people who kill off the rich and steal their property, and as such we shall be described. </para><para>What were the Government doing with regard to demobilization <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> We saw that Keith Murdoch, the - shall I say? - brilliant correspondent of certain newspapers, complained that the Government had deliberately ordered the demobilization to cover a period of two years - deliberately sent orders abroad not to bring our soldiers back. Then the plot was exposed. I suppose that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> desired the soldiers over there for his own purposes. Honorable members may be interested to know that I met a defeated candidate not long ago who explained to me that his defeat was due to the fact that " Billy did not stand to me with the soldiers' votes." I wonder whether it is desired that the soldiers shall remain abroad over the next election. Of course, we know that soldiers are coming back now, owing to the proposal of the Government having been disclosed by Keith Murdoch. </para><para>In a recent issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> there is a report of a welcome given to Bishop Long, at the Trinity Grammar School, Kew. This gentleman, on that occasion, complained of the manner in which he and others had been treated by this Government in reference to the education of our soldiers. Bishop Long, who has the military rank of Brigadier-General, in the course of his remarks, said - that he had gone to Prance expecting to do the work of a padre, but on arrival General Birdwood asked him to undertake work which practically ended his career in this capacity. The new work was that of organizing the education service for the soldiers. General Birdwood had cabled to Australia, with the usual result -no reply. He (Bishop Long) learned in the months that were to follow what it was to wait for a reply from the people who were supposed to answer cable messages. Early efforts had to be made against officialdom. Books were smuggled up, no matter how the transport officer cut down allowances, and mathematical and other classes were held at night. This showed the men's great desire for education. He became Director of Education. He bad to think of 200,000 men from every part of Australia, the great majority of whom would depend for their living on their hands, and if left alone would gradually come to depend upon work as casual labourers - the first to surfer in hard times. "The feeling over there," said Bishop Long carnestly, " was - Australia's dead. They will not think about demobilization, about the end of the war, or about repatriation . . . . " </para><para>While the Australian Government was always talking about how much it was going to cost, and side-stepping, he and his helpers borrowed things, and big English engineering firms lent them things. </para><para class="block">This is the Government, the Prime Minister of which wrote to all the mothers of soldiers in Australia, promising to look after them and their sons after the war. </para><interjection>

                    <para>. - It is rather surprising, seeing that we have just come through such a lengthy recess, that some members on the Ministerial side- have not some complaints to make. There have been grumblings innumerable spoken in our ears, and we have heard complaints by way of interjection across the chamber, while during the recess we have often heard from members on the Ministerial side that when the House met, and they had an opportunity of exercising their lungs and attacking the Government, they would be heard from. I do not know whether the Acting Prime Minister (Mt. Watt) or other Ministers have had. a hypnotic influence, but yesterday's Caucus of the National 'party seems to have disarmed all criticism from their own side. The. first opportunity in six months is now given to Ministerialists to voice their complaints about maladministration, repatriation,, soldiers' pensions, and the treatment of returned soldiers generally, yet they have said absolutely nothing. For my part I do not intend to be silent. </para>

                <para class="block">During the 'all-night sitting that took place just prior to Christmas the matter of assistance t6 the manufacturers of Australian sheep dip was discussed. The Prime- Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> had previously promised to assist the local manufacturers of this article against the importers.. 'The recess was more than half way through before the Acting Prime Minister, in carrying out his multifarious duties, happened to light upon the promise made by the Prime Minister before he left for Great Britain. This promise, given to the manufacturers of Australian sheep dip&gt; was. that if they could satisfy the Wool Committee and the experts that they could turn out as good a dip in Australia as was produced by Cooper or Quibell, they should have an embargo placed upon importations while shipping space was so short, and an opportunity to give employment to a large number of people-, and distribute to the sheep-owners of Australia an article which is not only equal, but in some cases superior, to any imported . dip. I am not here to distribute compliments to the Ministerial party, but I will say this of the Acting Prime Minister: that, as soon as he discovered - although it was a belated discovery - that the Wool Committee, with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir john</inline> Higgins at their head, had practically said that, the local dip was as good as any imported, and that the Prime Minister had made the promise I have referred to, 'he honoured that promise. Since then some wealthy Australian firms, who are agents for imported sheep dips, have been trying, to influence municipal councils and members of Parliament; by circular. Two firms that stand out prominently in this agitation against the locally made dip are Dalgetys, who are 'agents for one imported dip, and the New Zealand Loan Company, who are agents for another. They have- circularized nearly every municipality  throughout Australia, , and nearly every member of Parliament, both State and Federal, in the endeavour to throw the local manufacturers out of the business, and, consequently, to throw out of employment a large number of Australians. I believe the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> will agree with me that the local dip is equal, if not superior, to the imported. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. If we are here to make Australia a self-contained country as far as practicable, as it should be, surely we will put up a big fight in this House for an industry of this kind, established under the conditions under which it has been established. I am sounding this warning note, because I am afraid that some, municipalities have been led into a sort of trap by this appeal to them to place an embargo not on the imported dip. but on the- locally-made article. I know something about this, because some country or semi-country municipalities are in my electorate. Let this House fight those squatters.' who will have the imported article. I hope when the Tariff proposals are tabled, we shall have such a duty on this and other items that we can set at nought opposition from any other quarter. I am glad to have backing in this matter from the Ministerial side. I hope we shall continue to give our ardent support to this Australian industry. I complained just prior to the Christmas adjournment that the promise given by the Prime Minister in that matter had not been kept, but I pointed out that the Prime Minister had taken upon himself a big load of duties that he was not able to discharge unaided. I said that if the work was better distributed amongst the members of the Ministry, some matters that had been hung up for months would be more expeditiously attended to. No one man, no matter what his brain power is, can, especially in war-time, carry the load the Prime Minister attempted to carry, and which the Acting Prime Minister has, unfortunately,  been attempting to carry, since the departure of that honorable gentleman. But we know that shipping space was very scarce during the war, and that the British Government requested that as far as practicable Australia should do for herself all that she could, so that ships might not have to carry any more than the utmost necessities by way of cargo to Australia - indeed, that Australians, so far as possible, should supply their own requirements. In the face of that special request, so negligent were the Government that, by some means or other, the firms interested in the imported dip were able to obtain shipping space. </para>

                        <para>- No. If the Prime Minister had acted up to his promises, no imported dip would have been brought out to Australia, and Australian manufacturers of that commodity would have been saved from having to practically close down, thus throwing out of work a very large number of men. In several of the States manufacturers of Australian sheep dip have satisfied the most able and candid critics as to the quality of their product. </para>

                            Higgins showed me a pile of correspondence to similar effect; and he remarked - and I am sure that I am not uttering a breach of confidence in stating this - " These manufacturers of sheep dip have been treated in a scandalous fashion." The Australian manufacturers had been working three shifts continuously in order to keep their promise that they would supply Australian sheep-owners with full quantities. Yet, by what means I am unable to state, certain wealthy firms interested were enabled to secure shipping space with the result that hundreds of Australian working men were thrown out of employment. I am surprised that the farmers, through their Farmers' Union, should permit themselves to listen to the claims of agents for the imported commodity - staunch and stalwart Protectionists as the farmers ought always to be in their own interests. Why is it that today the farmers of this community, through the Farmers' Union, are being hoodwinked by wealthy importers who are endeavouring to force upon the man on the land the squelching of a local industry? If the farmers allow themselves to be deceived in this case, it will serve them right if their own pockets are squeezed by those same wealthy importing firms by rises in the price of the overseas article. I hope Parliament will stand by the local manufacturers, and not only by regulation place an embargo on the imported dips, but in the Tariff itself make it absolutely impossible for any sheep dip to come into Australia. There are undoubtedly sinister influences at work. When. I see what is happening, I want to know whether, into our municipal councils and the ranks of the very farmers themselves, ' there are not certain persons interesting themselves in order to farm the farmers. If the local sheep dip were being charged for, say, at double the price of the imported dip, or even at 10s. a case over and above the other article, I could understand some amount of opposition. But when we know that a better and cheaper article is being offered by Australian manufacturers to the Australian farmer and sheep-owner, I am puzzled at the attitude adopted by the latter.

                        <para>- There has been circulated amongst honorable members a pamphlet in which it is made to appear that unless an embargo be placed on the locally-made sheep dip the Australian wool industry will suffer. The tests passed by the locally manufactured sheep dip go to show, however, that it is equally as effective as is the imported article in dealing, not only with blowfly, but all other pests. It remains for this Parliament to stand up against the trickery on which so much money has been spent, and to stand by the local industry. </para>

With so much to do and so little done, there should be no talk of unemployment insurance in Australia. Here every man and. woman should be profitably employed. Our policy in respect of the Tariff and other matters is very much awry if we are not providing for every Australian artisan. We have in Australia men who are employed in making table sets for the "CB." or common battery system, in connexion with the telephone service. Those sets are made of Australian woods by Australian workmen; but I am informed that the men engaged in this industry are now practically to be deprived of their employment, since orders have been sent out of the country for the supply of at least 2,000 sets, to be made, I presume, of foreign material by people who contribute nothing to the upkeep of the Commonwealth. A Government that is prepared to countenance this sort of thing is not acting consistently with the policy of developing this country. This matter may not have come under the direct attention of the Postmaster-General, but I ask him to inquire into it and to see that these orders are carried out by our own people in our own country. </para>

                <para>In submitting his preliminary financial statement to the Committee this afternoon, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> so far as I am aware, did not indicate that the amount which he gave us in respect of our loan indebtedness included other than war loans. A financial statement which deals only with war loans and interest thereon is by no means complete. We have borrowed money in respect of many of our undertakings,; we are paying interest on a great deal -of money borrowed in connexion with the Northern Territory and the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. With these, and other loans, I do not think the Treasurer dealt this afternoon; but I hope that before the Bill is passed we shall have full information in regard to them. We have to pay over £80,000 a year by way of interest on the Northern Territory loans., and we are also paying interest on over £6,000,000 borrowed for the construction of the East-West railway. All these represent burdens upon the people, and should be included in any financial statement made by the Treasurer. I shall question the honorable gentleman later on as to whether they were included in the total indebtedness of £261,000,000 of which he spoke. I understood him to say. that that amount represented merely the money borrowed locally and abroad to carry on the war. In addition to the other items enumerated by me, the Government have borrowed money from the Australian Notes Trust Fund and other Trust Funds, and also, I believe, from the Commonwealth Bank. In respect of all these borrowings, interest has to be paid. Australia to-day is paying, by way of interest alone, an amount considerably in excess of what was the revenue of the Commonwealth in normal times. Our interest bill in respect of State and Federal, borrowings is something like £30,000,000 per annum, and is increasing. We are told that a further loan will be necessary  before we can clear the decks in respect of the interest bill relating to the war a ad repatriation. The financial situation of the Commonwealth is serious. </para>
                <para>It is incumbent upon honorable members, not only to safeguard the existing industries of Australia, but to encourage the establishment of new ones, since in that way alone can we hope to keep our people well employed, and to induce others to come here- We need a scientific Protective Tariff, and we should do everything possible by means of the Tariff and other schemes to make Australia as far as possible self-contained. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not intend to delay the Committee very long in dealing with the Supply measure, but I think it well to direct the attention of Ministers to some anomalies that exist. Provision should be made during this session to render assistance to old-age pensioners. Some fourteen- or fifteen cases have been brought under my notice in which the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act appears to have been administered iri a very harsh way, though we know that sympathetic administration of such- an Act is necessary. Honor - able members will agree that 12s. 6d. per week is not sufficient to enable an old-age pensioner to procure even the necessaries of life in these days when the cost of living is so high. I know of one case in which an old-age pensioner was earning a few shillings by doing a little work which brought her weekly income up to 22s. The Pensions Office got to hear of this, and they have since been deducting 5s. per week to cover arrears, leaving the pensioner with only 7s. 6d. per week. The Government should instruct their departmental officers that such cases should be overlooked, especially at this time, and that no action should be' taken whatever to the injury of the pensioner. ' It is up to the Government to increase the amount of the old-age pension. Now that the cost of living has been increased by from 75 to 100 per cent., the pension should be 25s. or 30s. per week instead of 12s. 6d. .per week. I have another case to which special attention should be directed., and it is one which affects a seaman. We are having trouble with seamen just now, and this is a case which will show the general public, how seamen are treated. This man has been a seaman on&gt; the Australian coast for sixteen years. Whilst on a trip to the Fiji Islands, he met with an. accident in Fiji, from- which he became totally incapacitated. He is a Swede, who has been naturalized in Australia for the past fourteen years, and is domiciled in Sydney. He applied for .an invalid pension, but his application was rejected on the' ground that' the incapacity occurred outside of Australia. The pensions officer informs me that the application was refused om the authority of the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor. He writes to say that the evidence showed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hansen's</inline> incapacity occurred during his absence from Australia, and in view of the provisions of the Act, he had- to take the course of refusing the application following an expression of opinion by the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor that a claimant for an invalid pension becoming permanently incapacitated whilst employed on an Australian vessel outside of Australia could not be regarded as coming within the provisions, of the Act.

                        <para>- No. He received the amount of compensation to which he was entitled under that Act, and has been living on that for the last three years. Now he has nothing, and that is why he applied for the invalid pension'. I say that his application was rejected on the ground that his incapacity occurred outside of Australia. It should be remembered that we have 7,000 seamen on the Australian coast, and many of these men are trading to the South Sea Islands and to New, Zealand, while they are domiciled in Australia. Their families are here, and they are paying rates and taxes in Australia. It is strange that they cannot be brought within the provisions of an Act of the Parliament of this country. </para>

They can turn out an overcoat for 27s. 6d., and yet if you come up to the city you will find that an overcoat of inferior material, and not nearly as good workmanship, sells for £5 or £6. I want to know where the difference in cost is going. </para>

                        <para>- In the limited time at my disposal I cannot go through the whole of this report on clothing, but I recommend honorable members to study it. Speaking of the woollen mills, the Commissioners state that in 1914 they had a net capital of £1,144,385, and made a profit of 13.444 per cent. In 1917, their capital was £1,459,040, and they had a net profit of 25.978 per cent. In 1916, their net profit was 39.452 per cent., which represents an increase of 300 per cent, on the profits made in 1914. </para>

I find that in 1914 those warehousemen had a capital of £3,553,535, and their net profit on the capital was 8.33 per cent. In 1917 they had a capital of £3,646,492, and their net profit was 15.21 per cent., an increase of 7 per cent, in the profit as against an increase in capital of about only £100,000. The Commission's report is too bulky to be placed in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in its entirety, but I again advise honorable members to read it carefully in anticipation of a request by some of these firms for increased protection.

                        <para>- I am sure that if this Parliament desires power to control the profiteers the people will be prepared to give it. It must be apparent to them and to honorable members that it is useless to have five different authorities attempting to control commodities and fix prices. Under, that system Queensland will have one set of conditions, New South Wales another, South Australia still another, and so on. We require one central authority to exercise power throughout the Commonwealth, and the. proper authority is the Federal Parliament. We have learnt something from the lessons taught by the war. We have organized most of the industries; we have these reports by the Inter-State Commission, and there should be no difficulty in either taking steps to reduce prices to normal, or to raise wages in proportion to the abnormal prices. Honorable members talk of industrial unrest. But what else can they expect? During. the five years of war the minds of the people have been disturbed. For patriotic and other reasons many men have borne the burden of increased cost of living and other irksome conditions without complaint. Now the Avar is over, yet they see the cost of living still increasing. Notwithstanding the statement of the Commonwealth Statistician that the cost of living has increased only 41 per cent, since 1913, £3 per week to-day will not purchase as much as 25s.. would have purchased five years ago. </para>

                        <para>- Has it ever occurred to the honorable member that if the Government started co-operative concerns they would assist- to control prices? If the honorable member had studied the cooperative system as much as I have done he would know that it is a fallacy to suppose that they can entirely solve this question. Whilst I admit they do a lot of  good  in their immediate spheres, yet there is a large class of people in big industrial centres who, because of their nomadic habits, irregularity of  employment and uncertainty of domicile, cannot get any advantage from membership in a cooperative concern unless there is a complete reciprocity between all the co-operative concerns throughout the country. I am interested in a co-operative concern at Lidcombe, and I admit that we started it with 150 subscribers of £1 each, and to-day it is flourishing. But I will give .an illustration of the difficulties with which it has to contend. A few months ago, when horse feed was dear, I' bought, from a farmer, two trucks of chaff. We sold that chaff at a satisfactory price, but when I asked him for a further supply he refused, because the Sussex-street merchants had heard of the sale to me and had warned him that if he sold more chaff to me they would refuse to handle his produce. The store at Lidcombe cannot get supplies of Champion's vinegar, because the manufacturers have been warned that if they supply the co-operative store, the local storekeepers will not stock the article. </para>

                <para>I contend that it is the responsibility of the Government, and not of a few individuals, to undertake co-operative effort. We have read of what local councils do in that direction in different parts of Europe. It is possible for local councils in Australia to establish co-operative stores and eliminate the middleman. Instead of voting £500 or £600 to each local council for the purpose of providing pick and shovel work for returned soldiers, the Government would be better advised to vote a few thousand pounds to municipalities, so that' they may open stores and check the profiteer. </para>

                    <para>. - A less inquisitive individual than myself might be pardoned for asking what arrangements the Government have arrived at with a view to pacifying their malcontents. Surely during the past seven months the actions of the Government have been such as to justify criticism on the part of some honorable member upon the other side of the chamber. If we were discussing a no-confidence motion, I could readily understand the delicacy of the situation; but seeing that we are merely debating the question of Supply, I am indeed surprised to find many of the stormy petrels amongst the Ministerial following either conspicuous by their absence or absolutely dumb. However, we shall doubtless learn the reason for this silence within the course of a few days, and we shall then know precisely where we stand. Of course, I can quite imagine the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Webster)</inline> saying to Ministerial supporters, " Now, don't you talk too much; you throw the blame on the Opposition if the old-age pensions are not paid by the 2nd of next month " ; or the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> exclaiming, ' ' You make the Labour party keep back the pay of the civil servants, and then they will get hell for. having done it." That is the sort of conversation which must have gone on. I can assign no other reason for the attitude of my honorable friends opposite. </para>

                <para>I listened with pleasure to the speech of the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wallace),</inline> and I confess that all he said was correct. During the war period, the manufacturers of Australia have remorselessly robbed the people of this country of millions of pounds; and yet I will pile higher duties on imports if I can. The fact that our manufacturers have deliberately robbed the consumers is the people's own fault. They refused to give the Commonwealth Parliament the power to prevent this exploitation; but while I frankly admit that during the war the manufacturers have robbed the people of Australia of millions of pounds, I say, without any hesitation, that the importers have robbed them of ten times as much. I do not forget that they are all patriots. I have no doubt that in the future when the importer is asked by his children, " Father, what did you do in the great war?" his reply will be, "I sold soldiers' comforts while mother waved the flag." All these people - manufacturers and importers alike - are great patriots. They never grow tired of waving the Union Jack. But God help a man if he attempts to wave the red flag. Personally, I have no great opinion of the individual who always wants to wave the red flag; but I have a less opinion of the man who always wishes to wave the Union Jack because under the shelter of that flag he has been robbing the consumers throughout the war. Only the other day we had that old imbecile, the Lord Mayor of Melbourne, Alderman Cabena, compelling the Labour movement to carry the Union Jack at the head of its procession on Eight Hours Day. </para>

It was not because it was thought that respect for the Union Jack would be thus increased, but because it was anticipated there would be a refusal on the part of the eight hours movement to obey the order, that a riot would ensue, and that the Bolsheviks could then be shot down. That was the reason underlying the issue of the edict for the carrying of the Union Jack. The order, however, served only to bring the Union Jack into contempt.

                        <para>- He is a true sample of his class. I suppose that some of his barrackers instilled into his feeble mind the idea that something might be gained by the issue of that order. Had the leaders of the Eight Hours movement said, "We will walk in procession, and we will not carry the Union Jack," what would have taken place? The instruction, I repeat, was not issued with a view to commanding respect for the Union Jack, but rather with a view to belittling the Eight Hours movement. In Victoria that movement is annually celebrated by the workers, who have succeeded in reducing their daily hours of labour from sixteen to eight, and who will doubtless still further reduce them in the near future. I cannot forget that in days gone by they had to wrest their improved industrial conditions from the flag-waggers of the Union Jack. I am surprised that any honorable member opposite should not recognise how futile it was to endeavour to instil into the minds of the people who walked in the Eight Hours procession respect for the Union Jack by compelling them to carry it. I am one of those who do not think i that it is essential that an organization should have either an emblem or a flag. But the fact remains that there has grown up in the human mind a desire foT something of that sort. A flag or an emblem of some description constitutes a rallying point just as do the colours of a military regiment. With all our civilization, we are to-day very fond of ritual. </para>

The very religion of the Christian people became dominant in spite of persecution. Indeed, I believe that persecution helped it to become dominant. </para>

But we had no desire to prevent them carrying the red flag if they wished to do so. </para>

                <para>Mr.MATHEWS. - The honorable member might as well ask me why they have bare backs. I do not know. There is not an honorable member opposite who has been in Parliament for an appreciable time, and who believes for a moment that the prohibition imposed by the Government on the carrying of the red flag by any set of people possesses any real value. But things have now gone so far that at race meetings, instead of running up the red flag when the winning jockey has weighed in all right - as was the custom previously - the officials now run up a blue-and-white flag. I understand, too, that the red flag is to be taken away from the railway men and a green one substituted as an emblem of peace. The war is over now, but during its continuance there has been a constant suppression of free speech and a censorship of literature. We were told that these things were necessary in the interests of good government and because freedom of speech and the publication of uncensored literature might give offence to some of our Allies. That objection has now disappeared. Weare, I hope, entering upon a new era. Yet we have not heard one word from the Government to-day about the restoration of liberty of speech or of the right of people to fly the red flag if they so desire: I have never yet heard any valid argument why, in time of peace, restrictions should be imposed upon any section of the community who desire to follow their own particular course of action. It stands to the credit of the Government that they have released the women who were incarcerated for having flown the red flag, but there is a man named Long in gaol, and I ask whether anything can be gained by keeping him there any longer, now that the war is over and peace is about to be signed. He says that the red flag is the emblem of the brotherhood of man. I have no belief in the brotherhood of man - I know human nature too well; but I would not prevent any other man from holding that belief. Some people consider that by organization and example they will very soon bring about the brotherhood of man. Why should they be prevented from endeavouring to bring it about by the production of literature and the flying of a flag?

                        <para>- Quite possibly they are right. That may be the reason why they are being suppressed. But if it amuses them, why stop them ? It reminds me of a big blacksmith I knew, whose wife used to hit him with a poker. A friend said, " I would very soon stop her from doing that." But the big "blacksmith merely replied, " It does not hurt me, and it amuses her. Why should I stop her ? " If these people choose to carry a red flag and publish newspapers with what they consider high ideals, and go 'On the Yarra bank, or to any street corner where they are not impeding traffic, to hold forth on a special form of religion, or political ideals, what right has any one to try to prevent them? We have heard a good deal of talk about engendering in the community hostility to our present form of civilization and so forth. Well, all I have to say is that there is a good deal wrong with our civilization, and if these people can conceive methods of improving it, no one has the right to stop them so long as they do not inflict bodily harm on others. If by their advocacy they can bring about social reform in a constitutional way, no one has the right to prevent them by physical force. The time has passed for indulging in that sort of thing. Last October I warned honorable members that these people would be driven to the breaking point. If there are honorable members opposite who seek an opportunity to shoot down the populace let them say 80 but if they desire to have peace in our midst let them see that those people who are being persecuted to-day are permitted to ventilate their opinions so long- as they do it in a constitutional way; but honorable members opposite are not entitled to lay down what is a constitutional manner. I have no quarrel with honorable members opposite, or with those who have sent them here, as to their opinions. They think they are right; I think I am right. But they have no right to suppress me, and prevent me from giving expression to my views so long as I do not advocate methods which, in a civilized community, I should not advocate. How can an article published in a newspaper which people are not compelled to read, but which circulates among a section of the community who have a desire to read it, do any harm? If these people wish to give vent to speech on ordinary lilies, why should they be prevented from doing so? I do not know whether I can draw from the Government any promise,, or get from those associated with them any expression of opinion as to this matter, but I do think the Acting Prime Minister, now peace has been declared,, has an opportunity of telling the people of Australia that there will be a cessation of what has taken place in the community for some time past, that people who have been gaoled will be released, and that those who have been prosecuted and. persecuted for holding particular ideas will no longer be imprisoned. What possible gain can there be from the continuance of this practice? If political gain could be achieved I could understand it; if the community could be helped in any way by suppressing these things I could understand it; but no honorable member opposite has yet advanced one reason why the desires of people who differ from them should be suppressed, and the Government are very remiss in not taking some step in* the direction I am urging. </para>

                <para>During the recess, when honorable members did nob have the opportunity of ventilating them, crimes that I am surprised that Ministers are not ashamed of were committed. I do not propose to go into the Freeman case, which has- already been dealt with, and which will need to be dealt with again; but men have been -deported for no reason whatever. Sailors, not enemy aliens, but citizens of allied countries, have deserted their ships, and the whole of the machinery of the Australian Government has been used to deport them. We were not always so considerate of the nations we have been associated with during the war as to go to the length of chasing deserting sailors from one end of Australia to the other, and deporting them. But during the past few years, because it was thought necessary to do so, and because it was thought that we were doing something our Allies desired, men in Melbourne and Sydney have been kept in detention for deportation, not. because they were considered to be undesirable citizens, but simply because they were sailors who had deserted from their vessels. I do not know what can be gained by resorting to such extreme methods in -such trivial cases. Australia is supposed to be a free country, yet because a man comes here in a foreign vessel and is dissatisfied with the treatment he has received - under no flag does a sailor receive more than a human being should receive, and in the mercantile marine of some nations the conditions under which sailors live are still more undesirable than they are on Australian or British ships - if a sailor deserts, as right down through the centuries, sailors have always . deserted, the whole of the machinery of the Defence Department is set to work to institute a search and capture him, if if should so happen that the shipmaster cannot get hold of him while he is in port, or the owners- cannot get hold of him,. and bring him up before a magistrate. Surely it is time we heard from the Government that this practice will cease. There must be a stage at which sanity will return to the Government and to their supporters. </para>
                <para>As to the treatment of the unfortunates who happen to be of German origin or birth, a case which' I '-recently brought .under the notice of the Defence authorities and the Prime Minister's Department, and which was also brought under the attention of the Postmaster-General, who is now dealing with it, is one that I would like to mention to honorable members, asking whether any reason can exist for resorting to such methods as have been employed in regard to it. It is the case of a young fellow named Paul Herman, whose father came to Australia some thirty-two years ago. He was a Pomeranian by birth, and had run away from Germany because of his detestation of the compulsory military -service of that country. After being in London for a little time, he came to Australia, and he subsequently brought out his wife and child, Paul, who was then two years of age. I worked with the father in Sydney twenty-three years ago. Paul had one brother who enlisted, and was rejected on account of physical defect, and another who enlisted and went to the Front. The latter returned to Sydney five weeks ago to find that Paul was in gaol because he had been born in Germany. He had a tailor's shop in Sydney, and has documents to prove that he offered to manufacture clothing for the Defence Department at the military price ; but after the armistice was signed - not before - he was seized and placed for a time in Darlinghurst gaol, .and afterwards removed to the Holdsworthy Concentration Camp, where he- is now  confined.  I have endeavoured to ascertain why he was interned. I have asked men closely associated with him if they knew why this step was taken, but the only reason they can advance is that at a meeting of the Young Australia League, he made use of the remark that he believed the money which was being spent on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes'</inline> trip to Great Britain, and expenditure of a similar character, could be better devoted to the advancement of the production of Australian goods. As a young Australian, he believes that Australia ought to produce largely, and that the Commonwealth ought to be independent in these matters. That is the only reason his friends can advance for his internment. There can be no possible reason for a sane Government perpetrating crimes of this character.. Are they doing this sort of thing for fun ? Do they enjoy inflicting punishment on people just to see them squirm and suffer ? What reason can there be for keeping Paul Herman in gaol ? There are dozens of similar cases. At Canberra, Australian women married to German husbands, and children reared in Australia - true Australians - have been placed in an internment camp for what reason they do not know. During the war it might have been felt there was some need for all this sort of thing, but when the armistice was signed every one knew that the Germans could not possibly renew the' attack on the Allies, that it would be futile to attempt to do so. Yet there are thousands of people still interned in Aus=tralia. I am quite ready to admit that remarks made by some of those who were interned were objectionable, and that there is a desire not to keep these people in Australia; but I cannot understand why others who have expressed no enmity to the British Empire are still kept in internment, and I do not believe there are two honorable members opposite who would still keep them in confinement. I am not one of those who attack a Government merely for party purposes, and my remarks upon this subject are not made from a party stand-point at all. I would rather be a Britisher than the native of any other country in the world ; but while that is so, I am willing to allow everybody else to have the same opinion about his 'own native land. I cannot see what we have to gain from legislation or regulations framed for the purpose of incarcerating men for no reason whatever, now that the war is over and peace about to be declared. </para>

                    <para>.- I am somewhat surprised that members supporting the Government have not availed themselves of the opportunity to say a few words on behalf of the returned soldiers and their treatment since they have come back to Australia. I heard the Acting Prime Minister's statement, in which there is the boast that the cases of only about 4 per cent, of the returned soldiers have not been finalized. If the Acting Prime Minister had been in my position, and had met as many of these returned soldiers as I have, he would realize that the statement is absolutely untrue. A far greater percentage than that have not been finalized. The promises made to the men prior to their enlistment and on trie battlefields are not being fulfilled. Before the election of 1917, the United Kingdom and Prance were flooded with newspaper reports about tens of millions to be spent on the returned soldiers, without any stipulation or regulation then as to who was to participate. Every soldier had a promise that he would be looked after on his return to Australia. That, I think, was one reason why the soldiers' vote went so largely in favour of the Win-the-war party at that election. The soldiers believed those promises. But they are coming back now, and they are finding that there was little in them. If any young man comes back Class A medically fit, and if he does' not want to go upon the land - and not too many of them want, or are fitted,- to go on the land - his position is a difficult one. "Back again to mining" is the best that this Government can say to a man who prior to the war may have been a miner in Broken Hill. Some men medically unfit, and whose discharge is not due to any misconduct, get no pension, and they are not entitled to claim vocational training. Men who were miners prior to the outbreak, of  war have to go back to mining. That is the best that this grateful country can do for them. I say that if the Government want to precipitate trouble they are going the right way about it. These men have been in Flanders fighting for four or five years, during which they have been taught to respect neither life nor property, and they are coming back with some of those feelings still in them. When they realize that nothing is to be done for them, that they are to receive nothing but a paltry month or two of sustenance, there will be trouble. I am bringing these cases continually under the notice of the Victorian  Deputy  Controller of Repatriation, but T do not get much satisfaction from that quarter. The trouble is that there is too much of the military spirit in the administration. Every man who has a job in that Department must be a major or a. colonel. You never heard of any mere private getting any job worth having in the administrative functions of this country. </para>

                        <para>- One would have thought that, after four or five years of war, some big scheme would have been devised for the proper treatment of our returned soldiers. I have had men on the sustenance list in Ballarat for six months waiting for vocational training. "We are doing our very best by these dilatory methods to prevent these boys from becoming good citizens. Our scheme of vocational training is only a baby affair. It is not half big enough. Provision has only been made for a few cases. </para>

We are not going to turn out fitters and turners or motor mechanics in six months, with all the limitations and restrictions upon the scheme. It is not too much to say that: every lad who has been abroad should, upon his return, have an opportunity to undergo some course of training to make him a carpenter, blacksmith, motor mechanic, electric wirer, turner, or fitter, or to qualify him for whatever calling he may have a liking for. These opportunities should not be confined to the medically unfit. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. He means all those who ought never to have gone to the war; the lads who enlisted before they reached the age of twenty-one years. It is true they can get vocational training whether they are in Class A or not; but I am speaking of the great bulk of the men who enlisted over the age of twenty-one years, and I say that a man who, prior to enlistment, was a miner, and returns " Class A," gets no vocational training from the Department, no matter how good his credentials may be. In the office of the Repatriation Department to-day there is nothing but muddle leading to delay, and the men are getting absolutely sick. I know of a returned soldier who brought his girl from London. He applied for £35 worth of furniture, but his application has been hung up for weeks because of the system of centralization. I contend that the local committee ought to have had power to give that returned soldier the £35 worth of furniture two days after he applied for it. But it appears that everything must be sent on to Melbourne, where it is handled by the military authorities in the usual military manner. </para>

                <para>Then we boast about giving men sustenance while on the land. But if land is not productive for a few months after allotment, the miserable £1 per week offered to the soldier settlers cannot be called sustenance. It is impossible for such men to keep on the land. I read in to-day's paper that the Government of Western Australia are paying 9s. per day sustenance to men who take up land in that State. We ought to see that they are not paid less by the Repatriation Department. I know of a young man who gets a pension of 17s. 6d. per week. He is a man with a record for one of the most brilliant deeds on the battlefields of Flanders, for which he was awarded the Military Cross. He was a school teacher. but his health having been broken, he was not able to stand the strain of teaching children. He was lucky enough to get a block of land at Sutton Park., and now he is getting a pension of 17s. 6d. per week, upon which sum he is supposed to be able to work the farm, and make it profitable. I say we are going the right way to make failure a certainty for such men. It is an impossibility for them to be successful in such circumstances. </para>

And so it is with every phase of the repatriation scheme - all muddle and delay and centralization in Melbourne. The pensions system must be revised, for we may take it for granted that the return ing soldiers are not going to accept the conditions " lying down." They do not wish to threaten the community. Their association is a non-party one; but we must make no mistake, for it is going to be a political association. The pension of 30s. was fixed at a time when the cost of living had not increased, and the promises made to the men ought to be fulfilled in the spirit. </para>

So far as I am concerned, this session will not proceed very far before there is some alteration made regarding the treatment of our men. I want a pronouncement from the Government that every soldier who desires shall receive vocational training; and in this regard there ought to be no exceptions made, provided the men are healthy and fit. There are, of course, some in such a state of health that it would be foolish to send them to learn any trade, and such men ought to be in receipt of a full pension without working. </para>

                <para>There is another matter that requires urgent attention. I received a letter today from a young boy who enlisted at the age of seventeen, and after four years' service in Gallipoli and in France he was absent without leave for a short time. For this offence he was sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment in the military compound in France, and in a letter to his mother he says - </para>

                    <para>You know that I got twelve months' hard labour last Christmas. Well, I was sent away to do it in a military prison. After I hail been there about six weeks, there was a strike for better food. The stuff that we were getting would just keep one alive. There were 400 odd in the prison, and we were all together until the governor of the prison read the Riot Act out to us, and all but ninety-seven of us gave in to them; so we were court martialled and I got ten years out of it, others got thirteen years, and so on. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That was the treatment meted out to a bit of a boy who enlisted at the age of seventeen. The letter, I may say, is dated from the Park House prison, in the Isle of Wight. Our returned men will not be worthy of the name of Australian soldiers if they rest until every one of these boys is released and sent to his loved ones in Australia. During last session, I kept very quiet on the question of their treatment. When I returned, the position was critical, Germany being likely to capture Paris, and I did not utter one word to discourage any one from enlisting. To-night, however, I am free to speak the truth; and I know what these compounds are, and for what trivial offences the boys are thrown into them. When the British "Tommy" gets one or two stripes on his arm, and has Australian boys under him, they are treated with very little consideration. The life these men have to lead in the compound is beyond description, and I can well understand their revolting. 1 have known some of these prisoners, in the middle of winter, to have only a sack as their clothing, and they have been made to sleep without blankets, and awakened in the morning with a bucket of cold water thrown over them. The very characteristics that made this boy of whom I am speaking absent himself without leave, are those born of a love of freedom - of the spirit that made him the gallant soldier he was. These men see that the officers get about ten times as much leave as they do,. ' and this causes them to break out sometimes; and the case of this boy is typical of many who are doing eight, ten, and thirteen years in gaol. There should not be the slightest delay on the part of the Government bringing these boys back to Australia, and, if they are offenders, having them tried by the civil power in this country. The honorable member for Adelaide (ex-Gunner Yates) was tried by court martial here. Had he been tried by the French military authorities he would have had some semblance of fair treatment. In a similar trial in France one of the members of the Court would be a man of his own rank; but that was not so when he was tried in Australia. The Navy affords an illustration of how our men are treated. I have received a letter from the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney,</inline> at Portsmouth, regarding the conditions on that vessel; and my correspondent tells me that this is not really an Australian Navy, because 80 per cent, of those on board are what he describes as " Pommies."

                <para class="block">The time has arrived when we should have an Australian Navy officered by Australians. For a long time in the Australian Imperial Force every good position was given to somebody from abroad, who knew nothing more than did our own. officers about the war. This war was waged under conditions different from those of any other war, and our men and? officers were there just as long, and knew just as much, as did the officers and men of any other army. In the Navy there is a similar state of affairs. We are everlastingly bringing officers from the Old Country as experts and instructors, <inline font-style="italic">although</inline> we have as good men here as in any other part of the world. We shall? have a satisfied Navy when we have officers in charge who understand Australians and how to treat them. Only the other day some boys on a war vessel in Australia were given most ferocious sentences. Did we not enter the war to fight for freedom ? Has this war, after all, been just a gigantic fraud? We set officers to try these offenders, although officers are the last people in the world who should be trusted with such a duty. All offenders of the kind ought to be tried by the civil Courts, and there is a big difference between a trial by court martial and one in an ordinary Court. </para>

No one knows who' made the charges against Freeman, or what the charges were, and it was only by adopting . the extreme course of refusing to take food that he compelled the Government to consent to his being placed in one of the gaols. Such occurrences as these ought not to be tolerated, and if we on this side, though small in numbers, do our duty, there will be mightly  little business done in this House until there has been inquiry made into all these cases, and the -boys brought back to Australia. </para>

                <para class="block">People talk about " patriotism," but I am beginning to almost hate the word. There was a case in which land was  offered  to the Closer Settlement Board by a lady at £8 an acre, but that land she sold to a private person at £6 10s. 'When the Board stepped in and told the pur- . chaser that the land was under option to the Board for a month he said that he did not know a soldier desired to have it. The owner gave another option to the Board, but not at £6 10s. ; her price was £8, and the Board offered £7, and the land was subsequently sold to this "patriot" for £6 10s. There is no doubt that the word " patriotism " is being very much abused to-day. I leave all these questions in the hands of the Government, and I believe that, not only on this side, but opposite, there are honorable members who will not be satisfied with an explanation, but will insist on a thorough revision of the methods of the Government and the treatment given to returned soldiers. </para>

                    <para>.- It is awful to think that so little interest is taken by this National Parliament in questions of public finance, although the finances are the most important topic with which we are called upon to deal. The Government have brought down PrO.posals for Supply, and yet they leave the House absolutely in the dark as to the possibility of raising the necessary revenue. Australia at the present time is accumulating debts, and those at the head of affairs are simply raking in whatever they, can get hold of, while making no provision to meet their responsibilities. If a private firm carried on its business in this way it would be liable to a criminal prosecution- and, indeed, I think the Government are deserving of a prosecution of the kind for their gross disregard of their financial responsibilities. When the Commonwealth Parliament was established one result expected was the consolidation of ' the debts of Australia. Yet for nearly seven months this Parliament has not been in session, although there were most urgent measures awaiting to be dealt with. We on this side were thirsting to serve our country, but honorable members opposite seem to have only one ambition - to become members of Parliament, draw their salaries, and let the country go to the devil. I have tried to find out what they are sent here for, but I cannot find a member on the Government side who is prepared to offer any proposals that will help to get us out of the present difficulty. </para>

                <para>When Federation was brought about it was believed that one of the most important things with which the National Parliament would deal was the consolidation of the State debts, but nothing has been done; and a few months ago, when loans were falling due in New South Wales and other States, no attempt was made to meet the liabilities. Of course, the party in power in most of the State Parliaments is in sympathy with the party now in power in the Australian </para>
                <para class="block">Parliament, but that will be altered at the next election, and a good many of these anomalies, I hope, will be removed. Some of the States are actually paying per cent, for the renewal loans floated last year or this, because the interest is 5^ per cent, and they were floated at 98, and some at less than that. However, no honorable member opposite seems to' be at all concerned. Our children will curse the men in Parliament in these times who neglected to make provision to meet these responsibilities. </para>
                <para>The Government have proposed a graduated scale to reduce the proportion of the Customs and Excise duties now paid to the States. At the time of the expiry of the Braddon section of the Constitution, the Labour party took the view that the 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> should be paid to the States for ten years only as a sort of compromise. The then Opposition, thu party which is now in power in this Parliament, wanted the payment of the 253. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> to be made perpetual, but the country returned our party with a triumphant majority, and the intention then was that at the end of the ten-year period the whole of the Customs and Excise duties should go to the Commonwealth. That is the authority which should have it. It is sound financing, because the Commonwealth Parliament imposes the duties, either to raise revenue or to encourage local industries, and Should be free to frame its balance-sheet to meet its own requirements. Under the present system the States have to receive a share of this revenue, and s.me of them have even put on super-taxes, while still expecting the Commonwealth Government to allow them to receive a share of the Customs and Excise revenue. When Federation was brought about, the State Governments should have begun to set their houses in order instead of keeping up their enormous expenditures. We are the laughing-stock of the outside world, with our fourteen Houses of Parliament, seven Governments, and seven Agents-General, with all their trimmings and paraphernalia. We have one Parliament to pass a law, and a second Parliament to tell the other fellow that he shall not have it, and some of the Houses are not even elected by the people. I sometimes wonder what Australians are made of, and whether they understand what Democracy really means. They put me in mind of the Canadian boxer Burns, who met the coloured fighter Johnson in a contest in Australia. Burns' only qualification was that he was a little fellow and could stand a lot of hammering. The people of Australia can stand a big lot of hammering without any feeling of resentment. The various State Governments are making a clamour because the Commonwealth Government proposes to take away from them part of the Customs and Excise duties. The people always expected that they would be taken away. I took as active a part as anybody in the advocacy of Federation, and all those working with me shared my opinion that duties of Customs and Excise should go to the Commonwealth Government, because the Government that raises the revenue should have the responsibility of spending it. </para>
                <para>This Government cannot last much longer, thank God; but I do hope that even in their dying hours they will make some attempt to deal with the question of the consolidation of our debts. They do hot seem to take any interest in the matter of arranging loans when they fall due. Whatever the State Governments do in raising loans must affect the financial position of the whole of Australia,  and any wrong action on their part must prejudice the credit of Australia. It has been difficult to find money, except at extraordinary interest, for some of the State loans floated recently. Honorable members should remember that for all loans raised outside of Australia the interest has to come from the wealth of Australia. It is sent abroad, and we get nothing for it. That means impoverishing the country, whereas when loans are raised within Australia, the interest is received by the people of Australia. The' money simply goes out of the Treasury into the pockets of the people for them to spend next day. If a consolidation proposal were put forward, much of the money required could be found in Australia. The Government discovered during the war that enormous sums could be raised locally. If we  must ' have  taxeaters,  at least they should be in Australia, and not abroad. This question ought to exercise the mind of every honorable member, but no interest appears to be taken in it. Some members are snoozing on the Ministerial benches, and others are outside the Chamber. </para>
                <para>I have received a booklet which bears the Government imprint, and deals with the appointment of a Commission to manage the debts of the Empire. It puts me in mind of an agreement which I was once asked to sign by a  main,  for whom I undertook a contract. A friend of mine warned me that it was too long.  He advised me never to sign a long agreement, because it was always contradictory. He said that if I signed it, I would find myself under the thumb of "the other man. This proposal absolutely takes away from Parliament the control of its debts. It has not yet been ex-' plained by anybody on the other side, and at present appears to me a very dangerous document. The Japanese Government have certainly shown a point to our Government, if they are prepared to agree to a document of this sort, because there is nothing to prevent the Government of Japan from taking up a . few million pounds worth of Australian stock, and drawing the interest in Japan. Members opposite evidently do not know that, and probably have not read the proposal. There is nothing in it to prevent our stock being carted all over the world. I am sure that no Australian wants that to happen. I do not believe in consolidating the debts of the whole Empire. "We ought to manage our own debts, and reduce our indebtedness, while the interest on all our loans, or on as many of  them  as possible, should be paid to the Australian people. The Government should wake up and realize the serious financial situation. We are expecting this year an enormously heavy revenue. We have a revenue of about £39,000,000; but if we examine all our responsibilities we shall find that we are about £11,000,000 short. We should begin to set our house in order. Two years ago I pointed out that one of the responsibilities of the Government must' be to prepare for peace.' I told them that the problems which peace would " bring would be as great and difficult as those arising from the war; yet nothing has been done. How oan we wonder, then, at the general discontent? Who is breeding this discontent? Not the people outside, who are rightly complaining, but those in political office who should have made ready adequate relief against the time when the problem was bound to arise, namely, at the end of the war. There must be some causes leading to all this dissatisfaction. A community is not discontented merely because it loves .the country in which it lives, but because of some fear of a calamity such as starvation. When feelings like those are aroused, they animate attempts to bring under notice the urgent necessity for Government action; but day after day nothing is done. Members of Parliament find themselves at the four corners of the Commonwealth instead of being called together to assist in carrying relief measures, and in facing the pressing problems of the day. It is only playing with the whole subject to take one man away from .a job and put a returned soldier in his place. What are the Government doing towards making Australia self-contained? The whole country seems to be going " on the drunk," and honorable members opposite seem to be assisting towards that end instead of trying to secure some amelioration. The national drift is very serious. There must be a limitation to the raising of loans. It appears to me, indeed, that certain parties in the. community who have put so much money into recent loans can only have been in a position to do so by fleecing the people. In Great Britain the people can never get anything done without a rio't or a bloody revolution, then, when it reaches that stage, Parliament begins to " get a move on." This Parliament requires a revolution to awaken it ' to its sense of responsibility. The Government and their supporters are aware of seething discontent from one end of Australia to the other. What do  they  do? They call .people all manner of names, from " Grasshoppers * to Bolsheviks. What is the good of hurling names? Supporters of the Government have been away from this building foi six or seven months, and they come back like a lot of dumb dogs, with muzzles over their mouths. The only hope I «an see of reviving interest among them in public affairs would be to fling a book at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> or to wake up this' House in some similar way. I am here to represent the industrial masses of Australia, and I have to try to look after those who need help. Honorable members like the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. .Jowett)</inline> can look after themselves. He has been able to do so all his life, and, very likely, at the expense of somebody else; because one cannot create wealth save at the expense of others. I shall endeavour at every opportunity to instil into the supposed representatives of the people on the Government benches their heavy responsibilities in connexion with the financial position of Australia.- </para>
                <para>I desire how to refer briefly to one phase of -the influenza epidemic in Sydney. There have been certain working men who, in following their "occupation as Government employees, have had to go on board mail steamers and transports aud men-of-war in Sydney Harbor. They have done so under official instruction, with the .result that numbers of them have been stricken with the "flu," and have died. In most of these cases domestic relief has been urgently necessary. It was in the public interest that those men boarded the infected ships. The Government would be well advised, therefore, to grant pensions to the widows and children of those unfortunates who have lost their lives. There would be no precedent created if' the Government were to take such action', remembering, as one does, the pension granted by Act of Parliament last year to the Federal Chief Justice. </para>

                        <para>- I doubt if .that will support very many men. The war having terminated sooner than we had anticipated, the Government found themselves at the end of last year in possession of large sums of money which had been raised for war purposes. The Treasurer told us this afternoon that as the men came back they were paid off, so that our outgoings in that direction also are not what they used to be. . I contend that all the .unexpended moneys raised for war purposes should now be devoted to the work of repatriation. The finding of work for the men who come back should be regarded as part and parcel of our war expenditure, and these unexpended war balances should be used in providing employment for our men by the establishment of new industries. In the Ministerial statement as submitted to us this afternoon, however, there is not one solitary proposal in the direction of a vigorous industrial policy. </para>

The Government should have come forward with ' a strong, vigorous policy to provide employment for our men on reproductive works.

This will be glorious news for the 12,000 persons who are dependent upon the operations of the mine for a livelihood. I feel that the' directors have met <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> and myself in a very fair spirit, and that we have reason to be grateful to the officers of the Trades Hall Council and the Seamen's Union for having brought about such a happy settlement. </para>

It provides that a person to whom a pension is granted shall be a resident of Australia; not that he shall be resident here when he suffers the injury in, respect of which the claim is made. At all events, I ask the Government to place the opinion of the Crown Law Officer in the possession of the House. </para>

The Government are now deliberating on measures that may induce similar action in some other important copper-raising centres. Although the circumstances of the different mines vary, and the resources of the mining companies are not in any way equal to those of the Mount Morgan Company, we are hopeful that the stoppage of production will be prevented in the near future. </para>
