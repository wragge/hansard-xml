                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">(By leave.)</inline> - I notice that during my recent absence in Sydney the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> made some very grave reflections on Captain Glossop, and to be charitable the only conclusion I can come to is that he was speaking without full knowledge of the facts. The honorable member criticised adversely Captain Glossop's handling of H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline> in the duel with the German light cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Emden.</inline> In the first place, I would point out that the loss of life on the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline> was small. Out of a complement of 400, three men were killed and fifteen wounded. The best Naval opinion is that the action against the <inline font-style="italic">Emden</inline> was ably and skilfully fought. The officer most exposed to the enemy's fire was Captain Glossop himself, as shown by the fact that the first casualty occurred beside him on the bridge. The Admiralty's ' appreciation of his work was shown by the conferring on him, of the Most Honorable Order of the Companion of the Bath. I trust that no more of these unwarranted attacks will be made upon a distinguished officer, who by his prompt and efficient action made the name of Australia ring throughout the civilized world by ridding the Empire of a raider which had done millions of pounds worth of damage. </para>

He appeared to me to be endeavouring to show that the Government had promoted Captain Glossop to a higher position, and that his treatment was different from that extended to men in the ranks. I am very glad to learn that Captain Glossop was not disrated. </para>

The Acting Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> has not explained the actual situation. On the occasion to which he has referred, I was trying to distinguish between the punishment meted out to the lower-paid men of the Australian Navy, and the treatment of those of the highly-paid ranks. The authorities which the Minister has quoted are not the only ones that might be cited with regard to Captain Glossop's handling of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline> in the encounter in question. It is well known that the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney,</inline> with its guns of longer range and greater calibre than those of the <inline font-style="italic">Emden,</inline> should have been able to engage her without coming within her range of fire- </para>

                            <para>- When the Celebrations Committee was appointed under the presidency of the honorable member for Nepean <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Orchard),</inline> and the medal question was considered, the Government expressed its desire that every child in Australia should receive a medal on- the proclamation of peace. I realize that there are many difficulties in the matter of distribution to children of tender age, but I suggested to the honorable member for Nepean, and J. think he has already dealt with the matter, that, on the application of parents, medals be provided for children in arms, so that it may be said that every child alive, within the Commonwealth, when peace was declared, received a token commemorating the event. </para>

I have communicated with the Ministers in charge of those Departments. I have received some replies, but I have not yet had time to deal with them.

                <para>Mr.FINLAYSON. - I will withdraw the word "untrue," <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and substitute " annoying " for it. The remarks made by the honorable member for Hindmarsh induced me yesterday to use language which was quite unparliamentary, and, at your request, I withdrew it. The honorable member yesterday, referring to my political life, said that I had never voted Labour until I had voted for myself. The statement, in a somewhat similar form, was made previously by the Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom),</inline> and by the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser),</inline> but I took little notice of it because it came from my political opponents, and manifestly it was made for political purposes. I do object, however, when an honorable member who deserted his own party in its time of trouble and trial accuses me of being false politically; and I think I have a right to inform the House and my constituents, who obviously were meant to be impressed by the statement, of the facts concerning my political career. I entered this House in 1910 at the very urgent request of two particularly honoured Labour representatives, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hinchcliffe,</inline> M.L.C., of Queensland, and David Bowman, ex-Leader of the Labour party in that State. I have often told them since that the only grudge I have against them was that they induced me to leave a comfortable position in private life for the political arena. </para>

                <para>Mr.FINLAYSON. - Prior to that time, and particularly during the 1906 Federal election, I took a very active part in support of the Labour candidate, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Culpin,</inline> and at about the same time I was urgently requested to submit myself as a Labour candidate for Warwick in the State Parliament; but I declined the invitation. Prior to that, and during the 1904 Federal election, I actively supported the candidature of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Culpin</inline> against the two opposing Liberal candidates. Prior to that again, and while in Maryborough, as the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> is well aware, I identified myself with the Labour candidate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Norman,</inline> and the Independent candidate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stafford,</inline> in opposition to the Liberal candidates, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Annear</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bartholomew.</inline> From the time of my arrival in Australia in 1887, I have always taken an active part in temperance work, and whilst occupying an official position in that movement, I kept myself free from membership in any political party, because I believe that the temperance question should not be the plaything of party politics. I believe that the temperance movement is in a faulty position to-day, because its leaders have not followed a wise policy in this regard. </para>

                            <para>Federal Taxation Department eastern States sending over returned soldiers who have qualified in eastern States to take place of temporary clerks returned soldiers employed here. We object to introduction of men from east for these positions, contending it is a case of repatriating eastern returned soldiers at' the expense of local returned soldiers. There are only a limited number of positions to fill in Western Australia, and by introducing men from other States there will be no positions for those men who are returning and who will desire to qualify for positions in the Service. Please note that the salary paid to these men coming over is approximately11s. 3d. per day. Minimum rate in this State for temporary officers 12s. 6d. </para>

                        <para class="block">During the last two years there has been a decided drift of men from the eastern States to Western Australia to occupy the better-paid positions in the Service there. That has been especially noticeable in the Defence Department. In the present instance the complaint is against the Taxation Department. We do not enjoy a reciprocal transfer of men from Western Australia to the eastern States, and I think the position of returned soldiers in the West, who desire to qualify for the Service, is being unjustly prejudiced by the sending over of men from  the eastern States. I ask for some definite pronouncement on this matter from the Acting Prime Minister, because, when in the past, we have protested against Defence Department appointments of this kind, we have been informed that for the purposes of the Public Service the Government regard the Commonwealth as a whole, and take no notice of State boundaries. However, this practice operates unjustly against the returned soldiers in a State which did its part in the war extremely well. We, in this House, should now do our part in seeing that the positions in Western Australia are kept for the men from that State who did the job at the Front. </para>

                            <para>. -  The honorable member for Swan was courteous enough to show me the telegram when I entered the Chamber this morning, but I have not been able to get from the Department the papers relating to the case. I do not know whether or not the allegations made in the telegram are substantially correct, or whether, if they are, the practice referred to is followed at the instance of the Commissioner of Taxation, or is inter-departmental. All I can say at this stage is that the Government has laid down no policy of the kind indicated. The sending of officers to Western Australia appears to be an automatic operation of the Commonwealth Public Service machine. But if I were a resident of the West, and saw a drift of officers from the eastern States to the disadvantage of Western men, whether returned soldiers or not, I should be inclined to voice the indignation of the Western State. Of course, the theory is generally held that the Commonwealth Service is one body throughout Australia, and many transfers to Defence Department positions and others have teen made that are of a thoroughly reciprocal nature. That is the only way in which promotion can be gained in certain branches of the Service. However, if the honorable member for Swan will be content with this answer for to-day, I shall inquire into the matter and furnish him, as early as possible next week, with a more definite reply. If he is not then satisfied, he will be able to take further action. </para>

                            <para>- On 26th September, 1918, representatives of the Central Wool Committee of the Colonial Combing, Spinning and Weaving Company Limited met me at my office, with the view of arranging the terms of a new agreement to be entered into between the Committee and the company. The heads for such new agreement were drawn up by me; and, on 27th September, were signed by the respective parties. A draft agreement designed to embody the heads for agreement in formal shape was then settled by counsel on behalf of the Central Wool Committee, and submitted to the company for its approval; but the parties have so far not been able to. agree as to vital clauses. As the "heads for agreement," <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> are included in the subject-matter of the litigation, and the ease is <inline font-style="italic">subjudice,</inline> no further explanation can be given. </para>

                        <para>- The answer to the honorable member's questions is : -  1 and 2. It has been the practice in the past or men returning to Australia to be required to furnish a certificate that they would return the Military greatcoat on issue to them immediately after discharge, unless they joined the Army Reserve, in which case the retention of  the greatcoat was permitted. Failing fulfilment of this undertaking men were charged with the value of the overcoat. The return of the greatcoat was considered necessary in order to maintain adequate supplies for A.I.F. requirements, including re-issues to troops overseas. The cessation of hostilities, and the rapidity with which our troops are returning has, however, enabled a stock to be accumulated in Australia, and it is no longer necessary to insist on the return of the articles in question; consequently, instructions have been given that all returning members of the A.I.F. may retain, without payment, the greatcoats on issue to them. It is the intention that men already demobilized shall be re-issued with greatcoats in cases in which coats have been withdrawn on discharge. Action in this direction will be taken as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made to deal with applications. </para>

                        <para>- To supply this information would involve the examination, for this purpose, of the individual account of every soldier who has served in the Australian Imperial Force - a huge and costly task. A consecutive account of fines to show the total fines for the Australian Imperial Force has not been kept, as the information was not required for departmental purposes, and would have involved considerable cost. </para>

                        <para>- The answer to the honorable member's questions is as follows : - 1 and 2. It was approved by the Cabinet that the pay of the Royal Australian Garrison Artillery be equalized to that of mobilized Australian Garrison Artillery (Militia) rates by the payment of a war allowance for the period of the war, to date from 1st July, 1917. This concession was also extended to certain other units of the Permanent Forces. As the highest rank below " Commissioned " officer in the A.G.A. (Militia) is Company Sergeant-Major - pay,11s. per diem - no provision was made for the payment of war allowance to ranks of Permanent Forces in receipt of pay higher than that of C.S.M. Warrant Officers and Noncommissioned Officers of the Instructional Staff, who were practically employed seven days per week in Australian Imperial Force Camps and Schools of Instruction, were paid extra duty pay, at the rate of1s. 6d. per diem, whilst so employed. This payment was reviewed in 1917; and, in view of the fact that the work had somewhat eased down, the payment of extra duty pay was superseded by the granting of a daily allowance of 9d. to all Warrant and Noncommissioned Officers of the Instructional Staff, and was likewise extended to members of the Survey Corps and Provost Staff. It was never intended that any member of the Permanent Forces should be adversely affected, but that they should be placed on at least an equal footing to mobilized members of the A.G.A. At the same time, it was not intended that any member of the Permanent Forces already in receipt of pay and allowances greater in total than was payable to members of the A.G.A., of corresponding rank, should receive any additional payment. </para>

The reasons for cancellation and payments were that the Government considered it sound policy, after the conclusion of the war, not to complete the contracts for wooden ships; and the payments made included progress payments and covered contractors' liabilities, as well as some measure of compensation. Advice has been received from the Commissioner for Australia in the United States, indicating that contracts for building 385 wooden vessels were cancelled by the American' Government, at an average cost of £13 5s. 4d. per ton, or a total cost of £14,942,877 ; and that they further cancelled the building of fifty-two ships, at a cost rather more than that involved in the cancellation of the 385 ships. This included 342 vessels, the construction of which had not commenced, and 94 vessels in various stages of construction - mostly under 50 per cent. completed. </para>

                                -Returned soldiers are exempt from taxation in respect of all personal exertion income derived by them from sources within Australia from the date of their enlistment for service abroad until the date of their discharge from the Forces, or the termination of appointment in the case of officers. From the latter date they become liable to taxation from personal exertion income like ordinary citizens. Soldiers' on active service have always been liable! to pay tax on any income from property derived from sources within Australia provided it amounted to £100 in the case of a single person without dependants, or to more than £156 in the case of persons with dependants. Munition workers have never been exempt from taxation on any part of their Australian income, because they were not on active service outside Australia with the Naval or Military Forces of the Commonwealth, or any part of the King's Dominions, or of an Ally of Great Britain, as provided by section 13 of the Act.

                                - Returned soldiers who own businesses, or are partners in a firm, or shareholders in a company consisting of not more than twenty shareholders, are exempt from this tax if they were in the danger zone while the assessable profits were being earned or when the tax thereon was assessed. Munition workers are liable as ordinary citizens of Australia who are temporarily absent from Australia for any reason.

If honorable members will study the schedules they will perceive that opposite to each particular amendment of the original regulation there appears the date of that amendment. The whole item appears in the form of a consolidated group. Take, for example, the subject of dairy produce. I call attention to Part2,dealing with that activity. The principle involved asa declaration that the dairy produce regulations are to continue in force until a prescribed date. The date is fixed upon the basis that the Commonwealth has  entered into a contract with the Imperial authorities, which contract expires on the date prescribed. </para>

                            <para>- I have fully set out the whole circumstances, but can sum them up by saying that considerable encouragement has been afforded, and that there has been noteworthy advance in the industry. After the winding up of the Flax Committee's activities there is no reason why the Commonwealth should not take additional steps to further develop that industry in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- This Bill covers certain specified activities, and constitutes the fulfilment of a promise to the House. The Government undertook that if it were deemed necessary to extend any of the War Precautions Regulations beyond the specified period of three months after the expiration of the war, they would ask for specific authority. Two other activities, to which I have not to-day referred, are sugar and wheat. That part of the Bill dealing with sugar is simply a reproduction of existing regulations. In regard to wheat, we ask for authority to ratify the existing agreement, and to enter into a further agreement. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. In dealing with large concerns it is absolutely essential to be able, to make contracts for definite periods. That has been a great security to Australia to have these contracts made for definite periods. It has led to a feeling of confidence in the community. This Bill covers only the periods of those contracts, and enables these activities to be carried on in order that the contracts may be fulfilled. </para>

The Government Whip last night informed me that it was intended to go on with the consideration of the Bill to-day, and the Minister supplied me with a copy of his speech on the introduction of the measure. We had the power conferred by this Bill before, or we do not possess it now. That is certain. We had the power to deal with these matters under the Constitution, war or no war, or we had not. The gentlemen who certify to the competence of this Parliament to pass this Bill do not refer to the war in any shape or form. The Minister told us that the expert Committee to whom the Bill was referred consisted of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Mitchell, K.C., M.A., LL.B. ; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Adrian</inline> Knox, K.C., C.M.G. ; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> E.

Every one knows quite well that the High Court would take no notice whatever of the certificate which these gentlemen have given. The Court would consider only the Bill itself, if a case were brought before it under the measure. It would not consider what might have been said in Parliament. ' The Court would consider merely whether, in its opinion, the law was valid or not. My hope is that we have this power to fix prices which these gentlemen say that we have. If we have the power to fix the price of sugar until the 30th September, 1920, we have the power to fix the price of any and every commodity which any person consumes in this country. </para>

                            <para>- If we have the power to fix the price up to 1920, then I agree with the honorable member that we have the power to fix it up to 1990. My mind goes back to the first case taken under the  price-fixing regulations, that of <inline font-style="italic">Burvett</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Farey.</inline> Burvett was the detective employed by the Department, and Farey was a baker in Kew or Hawthorn. I was a member of the Government at the time that case came before the High Court, and was very much interested to know whether we had the power to deal with price-fixing. The Crown Law Department had up to that date contended that we had no such power. Early in June, 1916, two or three months before I left the Government, a decision on the question was given in the High Court. Chief Justice Griffith said that the case of <inline font-style="italic">Burvett</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Farey</inline> raised a Defence matter, and that the action of the defendant affected recruiting in the Commonwealth. The question whether the money allotted by a soldier to his dependants was sufficient to buy bread and other commodities depended on their price, and he held that the fixing of the price of bread was within the Defence powers of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>If  honorable members  will look  at the regulations dealing with dairy produce  set out  in the schedule they  will  find that  they  cover six or seven pages  of  the measure, though there is only  one  line dealing with the subject in the  Bill  itself.  There  are some amendments that  I  desire to move in the Dairy Produce Regulations when we reach  the  Committee stage.  In  reference to. the Dairy Produce Control Committee, the Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom),</inline> when introducing the  Bill,  said - </para>
                    <para>It was decided, therefore, to form a Pool to provide against this expected shortage. Committees chosen by the dairying and commercial interests concerned were set up in the various States, with a central committee, of which the Chief Prices Commissioner in Melbourne was the  chairman.  A conference was held in Melbourne, and another, later on, in Sydney, at which certain recommendations were made and approved by the Government. </para>
                    <para>The  honorable gentleman  then referred to the  amount  of  butter dealt  with, and  went on to say - </para>
                    <para>The Committee consisted of the Minister - who is chairman - a deputy chairman appointed by the Minister, three nominees of the Commonwealth Government, the Commonwealth Dairy Expert, two representatives for each of the States of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland in respect of the butter factories in those States, one representative for each of the States of South Australia and Tasmania in respect of the butter factories in those States, and one representative for each of the States of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland in respect of the cheese factories, in those States. The representatives of the producers in the various States were elected' by ballot held on 14th October, 1918. Immediately upon the ballot being taken the Committee formerly in existence voluntarily retired and handed over to the newly-elected body...... </para>
                    <para class="block">It will be observed that the Commonwealth Dairy Expert is. to have no vote ; that is, the only employee of the Commonwealth Government who is on the Committee is not allowed to vote, although the employees of the State Governments are. As I pointed out the other evening, there are fifteen persons on this Committee, and, although the producers, the manufacturers' agents, and others are represented, there is no representative of the consumers. If I, when Minister of Customs, had appointed a committee consisting of fifteen consumers only, without any representation for producers or agents, what would have been said? I trust that, in Committee, honorable members will see the advisability of providing for at least some representation of the consumers, who are certainly as important and as much entitled to it as. are producers and agents. The Acting Attorney- General will, I hope, agree that on all committees of the kind, not only employers, buyers and sellers - the latter of whom produce nothing, being merely agents or brokers - but also consumers, shall be represented. Speaking of brokers, I remember ex-Senator Trenwith, at the time of the Kyabram movement, some years ago, saying that it was worked by " sharebrokers, pawnbrokers, and stony-brokers ' ' ; and I certainly think the consumers will be the " stony- brokers ' ' if they are not allowed to have some say in the fixing of prices. </para>
                    <para>We require information in regard to some of the regulations, which are certainly the most important part of the Bill - indeed, one regulation is more important than the whole of the fourteen clauses. No. 5 of the Dairy Produce Regulations is as follows: - </para>
                    <para>Members of the Committee, other than the Minister,  may  be paid, from moneys held  by  the Committee, such sums as remuneration  or  expenses  as  the Minister may from time  to  time authorize; </para>
                    <para class="block">The Government, of course, are all. powerful, and may appoint whom they like, and pay the members of the Committee as they choose; and it is in regard to this that information is necessary.

                            <para>- Of course; members of the Pool have been entitled to pay all along, and some have received it for out-of-pocket expenses, and, no doubt for services rendered. I remember that when the Labour party were in office, some of the gentlemen now on the Government benches were very persistent with questions as to what this or . that member of any committee received for his services; and it is only fair that information of that kind should be given now. </para>

Possibly the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> thinks that only one' section of the community is entitled to representation. When I was Minister for Trade and Customs - a position which my generous friends on the press said I occupied by pure accident - I was accused of concerning myself with one interest only. </para>

What would have been their answer had they been asked whether Parliament bad power to fix the price of every commodity without any limitation as to time? The honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)</inline> looks as if he is about to make an interjection. I think I can anticipate him by saying that if we have power to fix the price of two articles, we have power to fix the price of a hundred and two articles. If we have power to determine the prices of two commodities until September,  1920,  we have power to determine those prices until September,  1990: </para>

                            <para>- In all probability it is a very good opinion. Some time ago I was speaking to one of our Judges upon the work of the Arbitration Court. I was told that the High Court had been worrying for weeks to discover what constituted an industrial dispute. This Judge told me that he had had a witness before him to whom he put the question, What is an industrial dispute?" The witness immediately replied,. "When I ask the boss for a rise, and be says that he will not give it to me, then you have an industrial dispute." </para>

                            <para>- Most people would say that there is an industrial dispute in our midst. The Government propose in this Bill to deal with only four or five commodities. They have already fixed the price of sugar. Under this measure they desire to fix the price of every commodity exported overseas. But, while we send only about one-fifth of our butter production (overseas, it must be remembered that the whole of the sugar manufactured in Australia is consumed locally, and that we are obliged to import more. It is now proposed to fix the price of this article, not only at the mill, but also the price at which it shall be retailed. Consequently the Legal Committee, by their opinion, affirmed that this Parliament possesses the power to fix the wholesale and retail price of sugar until September,1920. While the present juncture practically marks the termination of  the War Precautions Act and of the regulations framed under it, it is significant that the 'Government are anxious to abandon -their power ito. control prices. They have accordingly (banded this power over to the States, saying, " We must nc longer deal  with  this matter." Yet, according to the opinion which I have quoted, they 'possess the power to deal with it. eternally, so long as we pass the Bill before the " exchange of ratifications."  </para>

                    <para>It is interesting to look back upon the history  of  this sugar business. Within four or five weeks of the outbreak of war, the party which I have the honour to lead was returned 'by the electors of this country with a majority. Within a period of twenty-four hours after the Labour Ministry was sworn in, it prohibited the export of sugar, which had reached a very high price overseas. Wo thus saved the local consumer many thousands of pounds. If we possess the power to fix the price of sugar until the 30th 'September, 1920, I unhesitatingly say that we possess -the power to fix the price of any other commodity. To-day we are not sending a pound of sugar outside of Australia. The -position which it occupies is quite! different from -that of wool or butter, which :we are exporting. But why does not the Bill extend to shipping? When the War Precautions Act was before this Parliament, and many of us protested against its extension, we were assured that if shipping were re0leased the ship-owners would immediately increase freights and fares. The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> stated that if shipping were released, and if we did not allow the ship-owners to increase freights and fares, they would withdraw their vessels from Australian waters. But I contend that if the Government can' control sugar they can also control shipping. Wo were told not long ago that ship-owners would be able to sell their  ships for double the price at which they stood in their books -at that time. During the first twelve months of the war \ustrailiion  ship-owners  were 'anxious to sell their vessels outside of the Commonwealth. The honorable' member for </para>
                    <para class="block">Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)</inline> knows that perfectly well. A number of those ships were somewhat out of date, but nobody then imagined that the war would be such a protracted one. The ship-owners at that time were under the impression that -they would- 'be able to replace their vessels with new and up-to-date ships at a less price than they  would get for their own out-of-date vessels. In all probability, had they been as wise then as they are to-day, they would not have been anxious to dispose of them. We know that shipping is essential to Australia,  since it is impossible to reach some parts of the Commonwealth except by steam. At an early hour this morning the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McWilliams)</inline> called attention to the isolation of Tasmania, and I certainly think that if the Government have power to deal with sugar in this way they have power to deal with shipping. Since the Legal Committee, to whom this measure was referred, say that it is within the competence of the Parliament to pass it, it must be admitted that the Government have just as much power to deal with the shipping industry as they have to control sugar. With the exception of the sugar industry, none of the interests covered by this Bill will be likely to contest it, inasmuch as they will be better off under it than they would be without it. </para>

                    <para>I do not know what will be the position of the meat industry under this measure. In the early days of the war the Queensland Parliament passed a Sugar Acquisition Bill, under which the State Government  have  since dealt with many other commodities. Indeed, it may be said that the whole of the commercial activities of the Queensland State Government have been carried out under it. Meat was acquired under it to enable the contract which the Denham Government entered into with the Imperial authorities to be carried out. Beef and mutton, under that contract, were to be supplied at fixed prices, which have been varied from time to time, and in all probability, notwithstanding that the war is over, that contract will continue to operate. The position is, therefore, that beef and mutton will continue to be controlled under the Queensland State legislation, and wool will be controlled under this Bill, whereas hides will not be dealt with. </para>

                        <para>Adelaide. - The Prices Commission sat on Thursday, when the leather industry was under consideration. J. M. Reid,' tanner, stated that under normal conditions Australian tanners readily obtained all the hides they required, and turned out a big quantity of leather, which gave an exportable surplus of 25 per cent. On the declaration of war, the Australian hide and leather markets were greatly upset, and hides fell considerably in value, as there was no opportunity to export. Subsequently, British tanners wanted Australian hides, and opportunities were afforded for shipments to Great Britain. The prices of hides then gradually rose, until, early in February last, light hides were up 60 per cent., medium hides from 43 per cent., and heavy hides from 54 per cent. Leather values advanced in a relative ratio. </para>

According to some figures that I obtained from Mr.Knibbs, the price of heavy hides before the imposition of the embargo was less than ls. per lb., whereas to-day it is over ls. Sd. per lb. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. That embargo was imposed while I held office as Minister for Trade and Customs. A point that needs to be emphasized is that the advantage of this great increase in the price of hides has not been reaped by the producer. I make bold to say that hundreds of thousands of hides were held by the big meat companies. They purchased their beef on the hoof at from 40s. to" 60a. per cwt., and would estimate to receive about 55s. for a heavy hide, or, at 13d. per lb., about 60s. ' Since then, as I have said,, the price of hides has gone up to ls. 8d. per lb., so that the meat companies are reaping the advantage of the enormous increase. Those who have leather stocks are also reaping the advantage of the increase in leather values. The Government, however, say that they will leave the State Governments to deal with the price of meat, that they themselves will control the wool, but that the hides and pelts shall be free from governmental control. Every person in the community is being called upon to pay higher prices for his boots because of the failure of the Government to control the hides. The Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> should tell us at once whether the Government have power to deal with hides and pelts. According to' a report of the InterState Commission, if a man goes to a timber merchant for building material he is told that he -must buy from that firm everything he wants for his building, otherwise he will not be supplied. The Government, in the same way, should say in respect of all these matters, " All or none." </para>

                            <para>- Before lunch I said that it was the duty of every Minister to get the best opinion available, so that he might avoid making mistakes. On the question of the examination of the lighthouses of Australia, upon which the Commonwealth proposed to spend a considerable sum of money in order to bring them up to date, I called into consultation in my office the  chairman  of the Steam-ship Owners Federation and the secretary of the Merchant Service Guild, although they were having a controversy in the newspapers at the time, and, apparently, were not friendly. I asked for their assistance in making a choice from among the persons who had tendered their services to do the work. Both gentlemen readily acceded to my request. I hold that if a Minister will not seek assistance he is not worthy of holding office. A man makes a big mistake who sets himself up to be an expert in everything. In fact, the person who knows all about everything is generally a " mug." "When the . Fisher Government were in office a Bill was brought forward in which it was proposed to ask the High Court to give a decision as to the constitutionality of any measure. It was an unusual procedure, aud I do not know that the' Court was ever asked to give such a decision ; but it is not a bad idea for Parliament to ask the Court whether it has the constitutional power to legislate in any particular direction. </para>

In addition to- the declared profits, direct savings to the extent of £68,470 18s. 2d., on account of Government services, must be taken into consideration. These savings were effected by Government services, but also the general public participated in these reduced prices, though necessarily such estimates are not included. It will thus be seen that the profits were £23,622 8s. 9d., plus the savings of £68,470 188. 2d., or, in all, £92,093 6s. lid., a sum in excess of the capital employed, viz., £87,669, bv which amount the State has benefited." </para><interjection>

                            <para>- The report states that various trade associations or combinations are dealing with building material, and exercising a rigid control in fixing prices as well as in regulating distribution. If the Government do not fix prices, outside organizations of employers will do so. It is better for the Government to take this course. The Bill, in my judgment, does not go far enough with regard to them. Instead of asking the Legal Committee whether the Government ha? power to deal with these particular items, they should have asked whether power was not vested in the Government to deal with every item in regard to price-fixing. I believe we have the power, and now that the war is over any failure on the part of the Government to control these matters cannot be excused because we are in a state of war, as was urged in the <inline font-style="italic">Burvett</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Farey</inline> case, which came before Chief Justice Griffith. The Acting Attorney-General has stated that we have power to deal with the matters referred to in the Bill, but I think we have a great deal more power under the Constitution than many of us have been led to believe. </para>

                        <para>. - I intend to speak for only a few minutes on one or two salient features of this Bill. I should like to compliment the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> upon his marvellous industry. He must have spent many hours going into all the details of this measure, but, notwithstanding his industry, his speech will land him nowhere. He reminds me very much of an occasion when he introduced a Bill on the subject of navigation in this House. He sat at the table with nobody behind him, as all the members of his party were upstairs. They had gone through the Bill and left it to the Minister. He sat at the table while I made a speech from the opposite side of the House, occupying about an hour and a half, in which I brought to bear all the knowledge I possessed, covering many years of experience of shipping and the law, and simply nodded his head at me very much like a Chinese toy. In the end he did not make one single amendment. I am afraid he has been beating the wind this afternoon, and that the Minister will probably not make one alteration in the Bill as the result of the many suggestions he has made. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I take an interest in this measure, because I think I was the leading spirit in opposing an indiscriminate extension for six months of the War Precautions Act last session. It was proposed then to extend the Act with regard to all the activities at that time controlled by the Government. I pointed out that as the war was practically over, we ought, as soon as possible, to return to government by Parliament. I consider that during the last three or four years I have been paid £600 a year for doing nothing because the whole power of Parliament has been vested in heads of Departments. We have been governed by heads of Departments. None of us have had the advantage of knowing what the Ministerial intentions were, as they will be in future explained in Bills to be placed before us for consideration and criticisms. When . the Minister brought forward the Bill for the indiscriminate extension of the </para>
                    <para class="block">War Precautions Act for six months, I contended that it was altogether too general; that, as the Avar was over, he might pay us the compliment of allowing us to return to parliamentary practice, and have some opportunity of criticising Government activities. With five or six other honorable members I voted against the Bill, and as a consequence of a reduction in the Government majority the Ministry thought it wise to extend the powers for three months only instead of enacting an indiscriminate extension of war powers . for six months. I want to see a' return to parliamentary government to-day. We are a democratic community, and whether we believe that the man in the street knows as much as we do about politics, we are quite satisfied to regard this House as representing the country and to criticise measures on their merits. I urged at that time that, because of the  termina-tion  of the war, there was an obligation on the Government to demonstrate the necessity for an extension of any War Precautions Act powers, and that they ought to bring down a Bill at the end of three months indicating what activities it might be thought advisable to still further control. The Government have done that, and I am perfectly satisfied to leave the matter in their hands. </para>
                    <para>In this measure the Government have enumerated daily produce, wool, sugar, flax, and wheat, which it is desirable further to control. Shipping is not mentioned, and in connexion with that matter I remind the Leader of the Opposition that when he is talking about shipping he always appears to be talking at me, and points his finger at me. One would think, from his general attitude, that I was fortunate enough to possess all the shipping of Australia. Perhaps he would be very much surprised to know that, although I had the honour to manage a very big company for three years, as a ship owner I now take no more interest in shipping except so far as it affects the dividends I receive. I know nothing of the details of purchase, freights, or arrangements, and therefore I would have the honorable member to- understand that, he should shake his finger at some other member, remembering that I know no more about the subject than he 'does. Asa professional man, I have learned not to use my head for nothing, unless it be foi my own edification and amusement, and ] can assure him that I am just as innocent of all these wicked practices of the snipping rings as he is. I suppose I  know  about as much of the shipping rings as he does of the rings in the Trades Halls of this country. </para>
                    <para>The Government have done as I suggested, though I do not say it is in consequence of my observations. They have taken upon themselves the responsibility of stating in . regard to what particular subjects they desire an extension of powers, and, as the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, they have obtained the best legal talent to advise them as to the effect of existing law and laws which they propose for the future. I am perfectly satisfied, as <inline font-style="italic">i.</inline> private member, while we are living under the War Precautions Act, to accept the suggestion of the Government as to the necessity for extending the law in regard to those particular activities. 3 understood the Minister to say that if, as time goes on, 'they find it necessary to extend powers affecting 'other activities, they will bring down Bills and consult. Parliament. That being the case, I think the Leader of the Opposition is only beating the wind, and that when the  Bill  comes out of Committee he will find it has been but little altered in consequence oi' his observations this afternoon. </para>

                            <para>- I, too, think that Mr. CHARLTON . - I am surprised that the honorable gentleman, who possesses legal knowledge, did not attempt to offer an opinion as to the validity o; the Bill, in view of the fact that the wai has terminated,' and that the War' Precautions Act was passed for the purpose of enabling the Federal authority te operate certain powers during the currency of the war and for six month; thereafter. The honorable gentleman i; quite prepared to accept the decision oi the legal authorities consulted by the Government. ' I .do not question that decision, but it appears to me, as a layman, that there is need for some further explanation of the legal decision, because, if, as the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> stated, the Government must have power under the Constitution to extend the control of some commodities till 1920, and others to an earlier date, there is no reason why. the control should not be extended in regard to all commodities. If that is so, why do the Government tell us that, peace having been restored, certain commodities, the price of which was formerly controlled by the Commonwealth, must now, in accord"ance with the powers of the Constitution' revert to the control of the States? There must be something wrong in that con7tradictory statement. . If the Government can continue to regulate the prices of sugar, butter, cheese, wheat, and other commodities, surely they can do the same in regard to every commodity; no line of demarcation can be drawn between one set of articles and another. What is legal in respect of one commodity must be legal in respect of others. I find the Minister's statement a little perplexing. Frequently  legislation which has passed this Parliament has been found, when tested in the Courts, to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> ind we ought, therefore, to be very careful not to pass legislation that is possibly beyond the province of the Commonwealth. I am not convinced by the legal decision which the Acting Attorney-General has quoted. ' The honorable gentleman did not offer his own individual opinion.. </para>

                            <para>- I accept the honorable member as an authority on that question. There is considerable- danger in this Bill. If the contention of the Minister is correct, what are we to say t"o. the people when it appears that we have extended the control of certain commodities under this measure, whilst we have permitted to continue unchecked the profiteering in other commodities? We must be logical. Either we can control all commodities, or we can control none. The honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce Smith)</inline> said that the Minister will have power to add from time to time to the commodities 'mentioned in the Bill. If that is so, the Parliament must have power to bring within the scope of the measure all the necessaries of life', and there can be no justification for permitting profiteering to continue one minute longer. How can we shelter ourselves behind the people by saying that before we can act we must have an amendment of the Constitution? If the opinion upon which the Minister is acting be sound, no amendment of the Constitution is necessary,. I admit that when the Fisher Government were in power we were advised that an amendment of the Constitution was necessary before the Federal  Parliament could legally deal with trade and commerce and monopolies. We appealed to the people, and they rejected our proposal. But in the light of the latest legal opinion, it appears as if there is no longer any necessity to take a referendum of the electors; we have the constitutional power to deal with trade if we only care to exercise it. If it be true that we can legally do the things which this Bill seeks to do, I shall not go before the people and shelter myself and Parliament behind the plea that we have no constitutional power. That is a position which the Government will be obliged to face, During the recent debate, whenever any one on this side mentioned the cost of living and pointed out the necessity of this Parliament doing something to regulate it, there was a chorus from the other side to this effect : " Oh, we cannot do anything; we have not the power. The war is over; it is now a matter for the States." Even the Minister now sitting at the table said it was. Now we find it is a matter not for the States, but for this Parliament. Why, then, are we shirking our responsibilities? There seems to be no room for argument if that legal opinion is correct. I believe it will be found that this Parliament has not the power that it should have to deal with these matters, but I am not a legal man, and my opinion does not justify the Government, who believe they have the power, in permitting certain things to go from their control, and certain individuals to charge exorbitant prices. R&amp;cently the Leader of the Opposition and myself asked what justification there was for this Parliament permitting the price of boots to rise as it is doing. It can be raised now week after week if those interested wish it. The Minister says that . the reason they allow it is that they no longer have control over them. </para>

                            <para>- So far so good; but the Government take control of the whole of the consumption of the people of Australia in regard to those very commodities, although there is no contract between the people and the Government. This measure not only covers those commodities where they are contracted for, but also where there is no contract in existence. Yet the Government intend to allow some things to go unchecked, and people handling certain lines to make additional profits, because increases" are taking place every day. Those interested are not satisfied for one week. Directly they get an increase, up goes the price again, and we are allowing this fo go on. The honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Atkinson)</inline> says the Constitution will not permit us to interfere, but the Constitution will permit the Government to regulate the price of butter, cheese, sugar, and wool to the people of Australia. If the Constitution permits the Government to do that up to the end of 1920 for certain specified articles, it will permit them to do it for everything that they care to specify in this Bill. This measure, therefore, will not give the satisfaction which the public expect. I question very much whether it will stand the test of an appeal to the High Court. The Government ought to be sure about the constitutionality of any measure that they bring forth, and get the best legal advice to guide them. We should not be doing certain things, and setting up new Departments, in the dark. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce Smith")</inline> rightly pointed out that we have been governed by Departments for a long time past. I have said the same thing myself here, and many of those Departments have not given the satisfaction that the public expected. Having established that system of government, however, we cannot abandon it all at once. It must be a matter of gradual evolution, and during that evolution the people should be protected in regard to all commodities, and not only in relation to certain specified articles. The dairy farmer has no greater sympathizer in .this House than myself. I know how he and his family have to toil. He has a perfect right to get a fair price for his commodities, and I do not think he is getting more than a fair price now. But what happens between the man that produces and the man who retails the stuff to the consumer? That is where the leakage takes place, and we are making no endeavour to control it. We are allowing those interested a free hand. If, later on, we ask the people to give us greater  powers to control these things,  Ave  shall lay ourselves open to the charge of hypocrisy, because, when we had the power, we would not attempt to exercise it. How is the public protected on the Boards enumerated in the schedules? See Who are on those Boards, and you will find that the consumers have no representatives. If we seriously intend to try to keep down the cost of living, 'and to do what is right between man and man - out guiding principle in fixing prices should be to see that the man who produces gets a fair return to enable him to keep his family in decent comfort and provide for old age, and also that the consumer gets a fair deal - we should give both sides representation on these controlling Boards. Whoever represents the general public on the Boards will be able, to put the point of view of the consumer. Surely he will carry some weight, and he may be able to prevent exorbitant charges being made to the people of Australia. </para>
                    <para>The Minister says we have contracts for certain things entered into by these Boards. The Boards seem always to take the ruling price abroad as the guiding principle, and then expect the people here, in a country which produces in abundance, to pay exactly the same as they would have to pay in other parts of the world which depend on us for supplies; although so many miles of sea roll between us and them that the cost in freight alone to carry our commodities to them represents a good deal of money. Even then tremendous profits are made out of our produce. The Boards persist in regarding the needs of our own people from the stand-point of the demands of the people abroad, and this is due to the fact that only one class is represented on them - that is, those directly concerned in the commodities which are dealt with. That sort of thing should not continue. Now that the Minister proposes to prolong these controls until the and of 1920, why does he not invite the House to alter the composition of the Boards? Why does he not provide for representatives of the consumers to have seats on those bodies during the remainder of the term? The honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> told us the other night that his Board did not charge the same for wool here as they exported it for. That may be so, but it does not follow that they are not charging too much to the people of Australia even then. It is quite ' possible, if there were representatives on that Board looking after the interests of the consumers, that they might find it necessary to urge that even less should be charged here for wool, in order to enable the people of Australia to get their clothing much cheaper. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so; but those who have to pay for these commodities have no voice in the matter. We regulate the price of sugar, for instance, through the Customs Department. A few months ago the honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> and myself got a surprise. The co-operative people asked us to meet them at Newcastle, and pointed out what the wholesale merchants were doing. When I speak of the wholesale merchants, I invite honorable members to look at the Inter-State Commission's report on groceries, and see who they are. They are called the Co-operative Distribution Company, and certain wholesale firms are members. They fix the prices. Manufacturers have to supply them, and they distribute to the retailers. It is claimed that they are fixing exorbitant prices. This wholesale Co-operative Distribution Company evidently had sufficient influence to deal with the Government in regard to sugar. A certain rebate was given to all who bought sugar from that source. But it is strange that the various co-operative societies, which belong to the consumers themselves, and are not capitalistic concerns, did. not secure the rebate which was allowed to other storekeepers. The co-operative societies in my district, where they are  strongly established and have their own wholesale society, could not get sugar on the same terms as other retailers, although it is a commodity which the Government are regulating. </para>

This all goes to show that the consumers ought to be represented on the Boards; that is all I urge. If there is to be an extension until the end of 1920, why is not provision made in the Bill for the representation of the consumers ? Prices have been going up, despite the control we have been exercising. There is a screw loose somewhere. We have a right to demand an explanation of the mystery. We should insist that the interests of the consumer be protected. No one is against those concerned in business securing fair returns ; but we want to prevent profiteering, which is rampant. Nothing is being done. This measure seeks to perpetuate what has been carried on for the past two or three years. I want to see the people getting a fair deal. </para>

While we have taken over their ships and are paying them rental for their vessels, they have been practically permitted to run the boats to their own satisfaction. Wherever they have been concerned in a particular commodity they have not been hindered in using their craft to carry that commodity to their own choice of markets, to the exclusion of other people. Take the carriage of coal, for instance. I cannot complain with regard to my own district, for the miners hate been kept going fairly constantly. But the honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> cannot say the same, unfortunately. The shipping managers have worked their own favoured propositions, and have carried coal in their ships quite independently of Commonwealth control; but a fair deal has not been given other districts. </para>

                            <para>- There have been empty sheds at Newcastle during the war. That fact has been brought by the Newcastle Chamber of Commerce under the notice of the Board and of the Government; and the reply has been that the wool could not be appraised at Newcastle. Evidently it was better business to drag the wool 103 miles past that port rather than pay the expense of sending an appraiser from Sydney to Newcastle, to do the work there. These things are very unsatisfactory, and should be remedied. </para>

These Boards are all right, in the opinion of those directly interested in the commodities with which they deal, but what is necessary is that they should have the confidence of the general public. </para>

                            <para>-I agree that that isa very small percentage, but that 3 per cent. of the wool clip is essential to the people in Australia. From it we manufacture our woollen goods. If we have an over-supply of wool, is it to be argued that, because we require only 3 per cent. of the clip for local consumption, we should pay for that 3 per cent. a price on a parity with the price secured for the 97per cent. which is sent abroad? </para>

                            <para>- That will do me. Is the honorable member going to contend that in Australia, where we produce all this wool, our people, who must have woollen clothing, should be charged 55 per cent. more for wool to-day than before the war, merely because our wool-growers can get that price for it in countries abroad, where they grow no wool? Such an argument would be fallacious, and, if carried out with respect to every commodity, where would the cost of living soar to? </para>

                            <para>- I should say that it plays a very large part. I have used wool as an example, and some honorable members suggest that it is a bad example ; but my argument applies to the prices of all commodities. It is not a fair thing to say that, because we can get 100 per cent. more for a certain commodity overseas, we should charge the people in Australia about the same price for it. How are our people going to live, if we do that? </para>

                            <para>- I venture to say that every honorable member opposite will support it. What does it do to destroy the Combines? So far from destroying them, it will give them another lease of life. We desire that these arrangements should come to an end within a certain time after the war; but this Bill proposes to extend them. With the experience of the operations of these Boards during the last five years, we have learned their defects. If it is necessary, because of certain contracts with people abroad, to extend the operation of these powers, what is to prevent us remedying the defects which have been discovered? This Bill regulates the prices of commodities to the people in Australia, where there are no contracts in existence at all; and it should receive the very careful examination of honorable members before it is passed. </para>

                            <para>- I have said so over and over again. It is a one-sided business to provide that only those directly concerned in a particular commodity shall be represented on the Board dealing with it. If honorable members wish to restore public confidence in these matters, they will see that the public have representation on these Boards. If we do not do so, the public will say, "Who are running these Boards that fix the prices that we have to pay for bread, sugar, butter, and other things? They are people who are directly interested in those commodities." I have said that the price of dairy products is not too high ; but the very fact that there is no representation of the public on these Boards creates suspicion in the public mind. If the public were represented, everything could be investigated, and the true position made clear. </para>

                            <para>- During the last sittings of this House I went through the list of these Boards. There is a very large number of them, and if honorable members will examine them they will find that they are all composed of interested persons. That is what the " public are crying out against. If we are going to regulate the prices of commodities, the public demand a voice in the business. It is only human nature that if men personally interested in a particular article are appointed to the Board regulating the price of that article they will get as much for it as they can. If a man is given the opportunity to exploit the public in any way, he will avail himself of it. The public should be represented on these Boards, to prevent that sort of thing. </para>

                            <para>- If a man is a member of a Board, and the majority of the members of that Board differ from Lim on a particular matter, he will, ordinarily, accept the decision of his colleagues. He may think that it is entirely wrong, but he will not come out and stand on his own and make a fuss about it.  The great majority of the persons who compose these Boards are interested in the commodities with which they deal, and they fix the prices in their own interests. I ask the Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> to say that something will be done to give the public a say in these matters, by securing their representation on these Boards. </para>

                    <para>If the Minister has the power he thinks he has, though I doubt it, there is no reason, why he should not bring other commodities under the Bill; there is no reason, for instance, why leather should not be included, and thus bring about a reduction in the price of boots, instead of the constant inflation we have experienced. This is a matter entirely in our own hands; and I ask the Minister to consider what I have said with a view of doing something which will give  a  little meed of satisfaction to .the general public. Unless something is done in  regard  to the fixing of prices in the near future, and thus some relief given in connexion with the cost of living, I see nothing but trouble ahead. People cannot be kept in submission all the time. It redounds to the credit of the people of this community .that, although they were hard pressed during the -war, .and had to go short of many things, they felt that a patriotic duty devolved on them to make sacrifices. Many, owing to their age, were not able to go to the Front, but they made what sacrifices lay within their power. Now, however, they cannot continue to make those sacrifices; their stocks of clothing have worn out, and their purchasing power is not sufficient to secure more; and they anticipate that, now Peace has been signed, some effort will be made to quickly return to normal conditions. As I say, unless some relief is afforded, I see nothing before us but chaos, leading we know not where. I am one who believes, and always have believed, that whatever we do should be done in a constitutional way, because with adult suffrage all the power is in our hands.. People are constantly being told that Parliament is what they make it, and they look to us to protect their interests, and, now that there is no necessity for further sacrifices, to (bring about a state of society in which they can live in decent comfort. </para>

                        <para>. -  I welcome this Bill, not, perhaps, for reasons advanced by some honorable, members, but for the. reason that it, at least, foreshadows the termination of Government functions under the War Precautions Act. I was one who urged as strongly as possible that, when the war ceased, the unconstitutional method of Government control under this Act should cease with it. Although we were unable when we last met, at the end of 1918, to get our own way in the matter, we got a promise from the Government that the operation of this Act would be curtailed as far as possible, and at the earliest possible moment; and this Bill, T take it, is the fulfilment of that promise. Whether it will prove of any value lies in the wom!b of the future. A certificate has been given by some very eminent legal gentlemen regarding the constitutionality of the Bill, and, naturally, a layman ought to hold his breath 'before expressing an opinion adverse to theirs. But what was submitted to those gentlemen for decision? </para>

                    <para class="block">Supreme Court is wrong, and if we  have  plenty of money we take his advice and appeal to the Full Court, which decides in our favour. Then our opponents take the case to the High Court, which reverses the judgment of the Supreme Court. Where are we then? This is no fanciful picture, for it represents a frequent experience. Such a case may be taken to the Privy Council, which reverses the decision of the Court below. In one case, a decision by a Police Magistrate was carried through the Courts right up to the Privy Council, which in the end decided that the Police Magistrate was right; so it can be seen how much reliance can be placed on the opinions of lawyers. I shall not mention names, because that might lead to the identification of the party concerned, but there was a case in which we had occasion to obtain a legal opinion on  a  certain matter. We obtained that opinion from a very prominent lawyer. Later on it was found that our opponents had secured from the same gentleman an opinion contrary to that which he had given us. When attention was drawn to this fact the solicitor withdrew the opinion which had been submitted to us in order to allow the other opinion of the barrister to stand. </para>

                        <para>We have carefully considered this Bill, and are of opinion that it is within the competence of the Commonwealth Parliament, subject, as regards Part IV. (Sugar), to the proviso that the Bill becomes law before the termination of the war. </para>

                    <para class="block">At a later stage they define " termination of the war " as the " exchange of ratifications." Does not that circumstance show that in their judgment, if we pass this Bill after the " exchange of ratifications," it will not be legal so far as sugar is concerned? I understand that the Italian and French Parliaments are the only Parliaments which are now required to ratify the Peace Treaty. If to-morrow we learned that they have already done this, clearly a doubt would exist in the minds of  Messrs.  Knox and Hemsley, two of the Sydney members of the Committee who have given their opinion on the question of the constitutionality of this Bill, so far as sugar is concerned. If the measure would not be legal in the case of sugar, how could it be legal in the case of other commodities? If we desire to get this matter in proper perspective, we must view it from the stand-point of the conditions which existed prior to the war. If we had no power to deal with these matters then, I venture to say that we shall have no power to deal with them after the war. If the validity of the Bill be contested before the Court it is quite possible that it will be held to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> of our Constitution. If that result were achieved many matters would be materially complicated. But quite apart from sugar, other commodities which the Government desire to bring within the scope of this measure would affect a number of producers, who will probably realize higher prices for their products under Government control than they could otherwise do. That being the case, it is more than unlikely that a test case would be put up. On the other hand, I am assured that the jam manufacturers of the Commonwealth intend to contest the Commonwealth power in regard to fixing the price of sugar. </para>

On board were twenty-three  eot  cases, some very bad indeed. Breakfast was served while in the stream at 7.30 a.m. Shortly after the vessel was moored, eight or ten' of the invalids were taken on deck, most of the invalids dressed in pyjamas only, yet the weather was cold, a sharp wind- blowing. Shortly after 11 a.m., cot cases were removed to the wharf, where they lay in the cold without sufficient covering. The <inline font-style="italic">Karoola</inline> then pulled out to the stream. Through an insufficiency of motor ambulances, it was 3 p.m. before the last of the invalids arrived at Randwick Hospital. The invalids had no food or refreshments of any kind from 7.30 a.m. until 3 p.m., while the exposure to cold through want of sufficient clothing resulted in some of the invalids contracting severe colds. Notwithstanding this, we read in the evening newspapers that the Governor-General met the hospital ship, addressed words of welcome to the returned men, that a plentiful supply of cars were in waiting, and that everything went without a hitch. </para>

I should like to know whether the Government intend to keep Paul Freeman in gaol? </para>

                    <para>. ---I desire to direct the attention of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> to certain phases of the administration of the entertainments tax in New South Wales. In connexion with repatriation work, and the welcoming home of our returned soldiers, we have, in many centres, associations and societies which, by means of concerts and other entertainments, raise funds to enable the returning men to be entertained. The officer administering the entertainments tax holds, that such entertainments are subject to the (tax if the expenses of conducting them amount to 50 per cent, of the gross proceeds. As the number of returning men increases, with a consequent increase in the " welcome home " functions, more and more difficulty is being experienced in securing a full attendance at these gatherings. A charge is -made for admission merely to recoup the societies the expense incurred. They very often find nowadays that, instead of having a surplus, they have a deficit, and the taxing officer thereupon demands that the tax shall be paid on admission tickets. This is a rather serious matter for the people concerned, many of whom are not in affluent circumstances, and have to provide the tax out of their own pockets. It seems to me that if the officer were to " turn a blind eye " on such cases, he would do more good to the community than he does by taking a strictly technical view of the wording of the Act. </para>

                <para>In another case, to which I shall refer in detail later on, the power of the Department has been used in a most extraordinary way because of the inexperience of the man concerned. This man, who is a miner, failed to secure the authority which he could have secured from the Department, exempting from the provisions of the Entertainments Tax Act the patriotic entertainment for which he was responsible. Notwithstanding that his mistake was due to inexperience, the Department put him to the expense of a trial, sent counsel to the town where the trial took place, and compelled him to pay the  costs of the prosecution. And all this because of his failure to pay the tax on tickets of admission to a patriotic entertainment which was conducted by him without any object of personal gain. So far as I can see, there was not the slightest justification for the action of the Department, which refuses to grant any redress. I hope the Treasurer will look into these cases, and see whether the strict letter of the law should be enforced in respect of patriotic and charitable entertainments that are not a source of profit, but, on the contrary, an actual loss to the promoters. </para>

I am not able to say whether the cases cited by the honorable member are within or outside the Act, but my own view is that the law was never intended to burden gatherings of the kind described by him. I shall take an early opportunity of ascertaining exactly the purport of the law with respect to such entertainments, and, should it be necessary, in the judgment of the Government, to amend that law, 1 shall not hesitate to ask Parliament to alter it. </para>
