            <para>.- The budget has been described by the Leader of the Opposition
               (Mr. Curtin) as a document which determines ways and
              means of war. It should also be considered by the Parliament and the country as one
              which determines ways and means of rebuilding Australia after the termination of the
              war. It is, of course, essential that all of our resources should be employed in order
              to help the attainment of the great aim of victory in this fierce struggle, but we
              should not take measures now which would prevent the adoption of a proper scheme of
              reconstruction after the Avar. </para>
          <para class="block"> The situation in which Australia, is placed to-day is sufficiently
            serious to make it necessary for us to examine the budget critically. Profiteering is
            being largely practised, and the spirit of sacrifice which animates the members of our
            fighting services has hardly touched large sections of the people. The stores of the
            cities are filled with luxury goods, whilst the position in many country towns is almost
            one of desolation, due to the depletion of their
            manhood by enlistments and the demands of munitions production. Every patriot must
            seriously consider what action should be taken in order to improve the condition of
            rural industries. The people of Australia must prepare for the sacrifices which will be
            entailed first, by the winning of final victory, and secondly, by post-war rebuilding. A
            principal feature of our economy to-day is the easy money which is characteristic of the
            cost-plus system associated with war contracts. The Prime Minister (Mr. Fadden) must admit that for many months honorable
            members of the party to which I belong have directed attention to the evils of this
            system. It was, of course, necessary to depart from usual practices in the initiation of
            many war projects; but it appears to me that the cost-plus system is becoming an
            accepted feature of the munitions effort of this country. It is a most dangerous and
            pernicious system, which docs not offer any safeguard against the extravagance, waste,
            and inefficiency that are characteristic of it. Although the Labour party believes that
            everything which is necessary must be done in order to win the war, it is the duty of
            this Parliament and of the Government to practice every reasonable economy. The Prime
            Minister can not dispute that great industrial undertakings which are engaged in
            munitions production are maneuvring and jockeying for positions which will enable them
            to be favorably placed at the termination of the war. I admit that spendid work has been
            done by some of these enterprises; but simultaneously they are endeavouring so to
            entrench themselves that they will be ready to proceed at full speed ahead in the
            direction of more and still more profits when the signal to do so is given. A duty rests
            upon this Parliament and the Government to control their operations in the interests of
            the people at large. </para>
          <para>The position of the private trading banks is only characteristic of the general
            situation. It is not my intention to attack those institutions on the ground of
            inefficiency; they are remarkably efficient, and for many years they rendered services
            to this country; but I challenge the correctness of the statement of the manager of one
            influential banking institution, which I read this morning, in which he denied that the
            banks had made excess profits out of the war. On the contrary, I agree with the
            statement which the Premier of Queensland is reported to have made yesterday, namely,
            that great as their services have been, the trading banks are utilities which are
            engaged in the creation of credit for private profit and that they must be drastically
            regulated in the public interest. What has happened in connexion with these institutions
            since the outbreak of war? According to the returns of the Commonwealth Bank, comparing
            the figures for 1939 with those of July of this year, the deposits which do not bear
            interest have increased from &#163;121,000,000 to &#163;1&#38;2,000,000. Interestbearing
            deposits have increased by only &#163;2,000,000 or &#163;3,000,000. In actual fact, the
            deposit liability has increased, from &#163;321,000,000 to &#163;355,000,000, but that
            increase is practically confined to current accounts - deposits which do not bear
            interest. On the assets side, the value of the coin and notes has increased from
            &#163;33,000,000 to &#163;35,000,000; treasury bills increased from &#163;23,000,000 to
            &#163;29,000,000; and government and municipal securities increased from
            &#163;22,100,000 to no loss than &#163;61,200,000. This illustrates the tendency of the
            private banks to swim with the tide of easy money. They joined in the race to make
            profits out, of the war. </para>
          <para>My main criticism of the budget is, I believe, the criticism of most of the people -
            that the adoption of its principles would tend to destroy all hope of building a greater
            and happier Australia. What would happen to schemes in respect of housing, rural&#39;
            development, re-establishment of primary industries, and the improvement of our general
            standards of living, the development of education, child, welfare and the like, if such
            a budget were to characterize Australian economy during the next two or three years? -A
            crushing burden of debt, which would be too great for Australia to bear, is threatened.
            &#34; Post-wax credits &#34; is a synonym for &#34; post-war debts &#34; so far as
            public finance is concerned. I congratulate the Prime Minister upon the energy and
            vigour with which he put the case for the Government; but may I ask him how he
            would propose, if he should remain Treasurer until the war was over, to repay the
            credits established during the war ? </para>

                be erected on a foundation of public debt and interest. Further loans will have to
                be raised in order to make these repayments, and those who have the &#34; credits
                &#34; will be expected to subscribe to loans ; or they will be taxed in order that
                they may have returned to them the amounts standing to their &#34;credit&#34;. I ask

          <para>The Prime Minister must admit that he has ignored the warning. What is deferred pay
            to the troops, except an obligation which will have to be discharged in the future? Such
            an obligation is, in essence, a loan. In what way will i.t be discharged in the first
            year after the termination of the war, except by borrowing more money? </para>
          <para>A mysterious feature of the budget is the arrangement between Australia and the
            United States of America under the Lease-Lend Act. It is an important arrangement,
            designed to help us during the war; but it needs to be carefully watched, because once
            again the effect will be to lay upon the shoulders of the people a burden of debt. I
            repeat, therefore, that increase of the public debt is the characteristic feature of
            this budget. </para>
          <para>No serious attempt is being made to remove the profit motive from the war effort. I
            admit that something has been done in the direction of price fixation; but it is
            altogether inadequate. Since 1920, there has been an enormous growth of monopolies and
            combines in this country. They were small and unimportant in that year, but are very
            powerful to-day. They tend to control the financial, commercial, and industrial life of
            the community. New methods must be tried. We must be just to the soldiers, to the aged
            and infirm, .and those in the lower and middle income groups. War burdens must be
            distributed fairly. In every country in the world, the war resources available have to
            be organized, irrespective of any private interests. The success of a nation in war
            appears to be directly proportionate to its organiza tion as a socialist state ; that is
            to say, ,to the organized pooling of the whole of its resources, and the sharing of loss
            and gain as one unit and one group.&#39; I cannot see any evidence of that in this
            budget; but there is much, evidence to the contrary. One theory of the Government&#39;s
            proposals is, that the war effort wild be improved, by means of a farced contribution
            from -taxpayers in the lower and middle ranges of income. That is fallacious. The
            Government has all the powers it needs in order to control raw material and labour, and
            can direct the ends to which they shall be used. The journal <inline font-style="italic"
              >Banker,</inline> a conservative publication, a few weeks ago published the following
            comment on the subject: - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It cannot .be said that the public, by failing to cut down its consumption
              expenditure sufficiently, is preventing the release of resources for the war effort.
              It is for the Government to decide what shall or shall not he produced, irrespective
              of the way the public disposes of its money. </para>
            <para class="block">The key to this problem could be discerned in the interjection by
              the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender),</inline> when the
              Leader of the Opposition was criticizing the scheme of national contributions. The
              Leader of the Opposition said that rationing should be adopted, if necessary, and the
              Minister replied, &#34; We are rationing, under this system of contributions.&#34;
              That exactly represents the argument for the budget. But it is wrong, because
              rationing, whether in a beleaguered fortress or on a. disabled ship, means pooling
              everything and dividing it equitably amongst all. That is the true principle of
              rationing, and we have applied it in connexion with petrol. The theory accepted two
              years ago was that by putting up the price of petrol the consumption of it would be
              reduced. But that process was not rationing. The wealthy were still able to buy
              petrol, and in the end the supply had to be rationed. Wc may have to adopt that
              principle to a far greater degree than has been necessary up to the present. The
              fallacy of applying to Australia the Keynes scheme of forced loans or &#34;post-war
              credits&#34; is analagous to our blunders over petrol. The position in Australia is
              different from that in Great Britain, where the value of food imports reaches the
              colossal sum of &#163;350,000,000. If, by force of law, wc impose on the lower-paid
              groups in the community an increased contribution to the national revenue they will
              have to purchase less of the commodities produced in this country, they will buy less
              butter and less fruit, and the next problem will bethat of discovering a means of
              overcoming the special difficulties caused by reduced purchases. The economists,
              professors and ex-professors advising the Govern ment have, I .think, wrongly
              concluded that the Keynes scheme is automatically applicable to Australia ; but, as I
              have already said, the situation in this country is entirely different from that in
              Great Britain. . </para>
            <para>The Opposition has been twitted by the honorable member for Deakin <inline
                font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hutchinson)</inline> and the honorable member for Parkes
                <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Charles Marr)</inline> with not having made a
              positive contribution to the debate, and with not having indicated what sources of
              revenue should be tapped. First, I quote the following passage from a &#34;work on
              Australia&#39;s war finance by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. S.</inline> J. Butlin,
              who is a reliable authority on Australian economics. The work is &#34; Australia foots
              the Bill &#34;. I read from pages 118 and 119- </para>
            <para>But, in fact, &#34;indirect&#34; taxation has placed relatively little on the cost
              of the war on the larger incomes, which also escape lightly from direct income
              taxation. This situation is only partly remedied by changes in company taxation.
              Rebates to shareholders in respect of federal company tax have been abolished; a small
              tax has been levied on undistributed profits; and there is a war-time profits tax.
              This last is in form an excess-profits tax, and its severity has been greatly
              exaggerated. The maximum rate. 00 per cent., has been widely quoted, but it is not
              generally realized that this rate applies only to that part of profits in excess of 22
              per cent. . . . </para>
            <para>Taken as a whole then, Australian war-time increases in tax have hit the middle
              incomes hardest. This is unfortunate, for, while the needs of the war effort determine
              what goods and services must be forgone, they do not dictate the way in which that
              sacrifice is to be shared. Taxation is the chief instrument at the Government&#39;s
              disposal for the allocation of the hurden between individuals and groups. It has not
              used that weapon efficient . . . </para>
            <para>Much can still be done in the taxation of profits. A really effective
              excess-profits tax remains to be attained, and might well go as, far as the British
              tax-, taking all excess profits. There are, it is true, difficulties associated with a
              rate of .100 per cent, or with any really high rate. But they are not insuperable.

              <para>- Not at all. If the Commonwealth Bank Board were independent of the private
                banks, and were acting exclusively in the national interests, the agreement entered
                into would be defensible and valuable. But is it not recognized that, since 1924,
                the Commonwealth Bank Board has not been independent of the private banks? As a
                general policy, it has always refrained from entering into competition with them.
                Therefore, one appreciates the importance of the scheme mentioned yesterday by the
                Deputy Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline>
                regarding the establishment of a mortgage branch of the Commonwealth Bank. It is
                essential that the nation&#39;s bank should perform. the national service of lending
                to the Commonwealth, and it should do it, in my opinion, without imposing the heavy
                interest burden which, up to the present, has characterized our borrowing policy.
                Something has been said about <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline>
                Davidson&#39;s statement that the private banks are not making excessive profits. It
                is well known that those who control the nation&#39;s credit are really in control
                of the nation, a-nd that the trading banks, which are profit-making ventures, are
                fighting to retain control of the nation&#39;s credit. Ten years ago very little
                attention was devoted to these topics, but it is now almost common knowledge that
                the private banks do something which almost encroaches on the prerogative of the
                Crown, that is, they do something equivalent to the coinage of money, because they
                create both credit and debit. They assume prerogatives because actual coin has
                become less important, and documentary credit transactions have increased in
                importance. Despite denials the banks have made profits out of the war and because
                of the war. We cannot give the precise figures, but we can work out approximately
                the improvement of their position by estimating the costs and earnings directly and
                ascertaining and watching the trend of the difference. By using the aggregate
                figures for deposits and advances given in the Commonwealth Bank monthly bulletin,
                and allowing reasonable deposit interest costs and conservative charges for advances
                - <inline font-style="italic">oi</inline> per cent, on ordinary advances and
                appropriate earnings on securities - the following rough results are obtained : -

            current account deposit charges and discounts and profits on sales of foreign exchange,
            taxes, reserves. &#38;c. It will be observed that from 1939 to 1941 the margin increased
            by fl.Sm., that is from &#163;ll.Sm. to &#163;13.1m. The 1941 figure is estimated on a
            June basis only and exaggerates the profits, since deposits, and therefore their costs,
            are seasonally low and advances seasonally high in this month. However, allowing for
            this, it can be said that the gross margin available for costs of management, taxes,
            including the pay-roll tax, reserves and profits, has increased by about
            &#163;.1,000,000 in the last two years. </para>
          <para>We do not know the exact profits of the banks. Who can tell from their
            balance-sheets what their profits are? A fair approximation to the truth can be obtained
            regarding the financial position of ordinary companies. The Royal Commission on Monetary
            and Banking Systems dealt with this matter and made certain recommendations, but the
            banks have not seen fit to adopt the recommendations. From the trend of their
            balance-sheets, and the expansive nature of the speeches delivered by the chairmen of
            their boards of directors at their annual meetings, it is clear that there has been a
            substantial increase of the profits of the trading banks since the outbreak of the war.
            The statement by the Leader of the Opposition as to the general position is correct. </para>

              <para>- They may not, but I am dealing with the actual position. Share values, of
                course, are some reflection of what appears in the balance-sheets and in the profit
                and loss accounts. In one sense the degree to which reserves are built up and
                valuations of properties are written down - properties which, in fact, are often
                increasing in value - is only a matter between a company and its shareholders. In
                another sense the practice of inner reserves tends to place the public in a position
                in which it cannot judge the value of the securities. Therefore the Stock Exchange
                quotations of the shares of bai.king companies is not a true indication of the
                profits which the hanks are making. &#34;The Prime Minister referred yesterday to
                the taxation system of New Zealand. I shall compare what 2few Zealand has done in
                regard to the taxation of war profits and company profits with what has been clone
                by the Commonwealth. Last year this Parliament passed the Wartime (Company) Tax Act.
                But so far from being a genuine attempt to extractsome of the war profits of the
                large companies it has turned out to be a delusion and a snare. The share capital
                and the accumulated profits of the companies are taken as the capital for the
                purposes of the act, and these include reserves from profits. The result is that
                small but efficient companies making less profit than before the war are hit the
                hardest. This act, which was passed to catch the war profiteer, has, I Min informed,
                resulted in only from 250 to 300 companies in Australia being called upon to pay the
                graduated tax. Many companies which are making increased profits because of the war
                are not touched at all by the graduated system of tax. As the honorable member for
                West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr., Beasley)</inline> well pointed out,
                capitalization has been carefully managed and organized for so many years that it is
                almost impossible for these great corporations to be found making a profit beyond 8
                per cent. To-day, companies in Australia are taxed at the rate of 3s. in the fi,
                which is the same rate as is paid by an individual taxpayer whose income from
                personal exertion is &#163;1,050 per annum. </para>

              <para>- 1 have not indulged in any misrepresentation; the Prime Minister&#39;s comment
                is unjustified. He interrupts me before I finish my statement, and now he complains
                that I indulged in misrepresentation The flat rate tax of ls. in the &#163;1 has
                produced &#163;2,600,000. The graduated system, devised ostensibly to get at Avar
                profits, has produced only &#163;1,400,000 more than the proceeds of a tax of ls. in
                the &#163;1. This amount is almost negligible. Moreover, the flat rate of ls. in the
                &#163;1 is not reached until the profits amount to 12 per cent., because ls. in the
                &#163;1 is a higher rate than the statutory rate until the profits go well past 8
                per cent, and reach 12 per cent. In Queensland, to which the Prime Minister
                referred, a distinction is drawn between financial combines and monopolies,
                including banks, and ordinary trading companies. The existing act should be
                drastically amended so as to provide a further source of revenue for the
                Commonwealth Treasury. In New Zealand there is, first, a tax of 2s. 6d. in the
                &#163;1 on companies. After that the tax is graduated so that at the low profit
                figure of &#163;7,590, the rate is 8s. 9d. in the &#163;1. </para>

                security tax of ls. in the &#163;1 on companies, and a national security tax at a
                similar rate. Finally, and overriding all other taxes, there is an excess profits
                tax of 60 per cent. The highest rate on companies in New Zealand is 12s. Id. in the
                &#163;1, plus 60 per cent, extra profits tax, and the lowest rate is 4s. 10&#163;d.
                in the &#163;1, plus that extra tax. It is true that in New Zealand there is a
                unitary system of government, but even with Commonwealth and State taxes companies
                and financial, commercial, and industrial combines in Australia have escaped lightly
                in respect of direct taxation. That is borne out by the citations which I have made
                from the work of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Butlin</inline> and his colleagues.

                his budget. He must, of necessity, have considered many alternative proposals before
                he adopted those which he has presented to the Parliament; but it is preposterous to
                ask the Opposition to table its budget proposals in the course of a short debate.

                He wants to retain all the powers of government, and to bring in his budget and then
                to say, &#34; The Opposition has criticized my budget, but it has not produced its
                own financial proposals &#34;. That is the only inference which can be drawn from
                his remarks. The attitude of the Opposition to the war was stated clearly by the
                leader of our party. I say in conclusion, that I am glad that the amendment moved by

            <para>.- The debate before the House is one in which the Opposition is seeking to throw
              out the Government, and the pretence is made that the discussion is based on the
              budget. No one with any sense listening to the various speakers on the Opposition side
              could come to any other conclusion than that this is a definite attempt, under the
              facade of a budget debate, to throw out the Government and obtain power for a party
              government controlled by the militants of New South Wales. We on this side can see
              what is designed. The honorable member for West Sydney (Mr.
                Beasley) said yesterday that he had no doubt whatever that the Government
              was controlled by influences outside the chamber. That was his view, but it is not the
              view which is held by any considerable section of the people. There can be no doubt
              whatever that the Opposition is controlled by the militant unions in this country. We
              on this side know it, and honorable members opposite know it. Only a few weeks ago
              certain unions against which the Opposition will not move promised to make a 100 per
              cent. war effort if Labour took office in the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- I know what he said, but his voice is drowned by the clamant demands of an
                extremist section of the party. Is a man&#39;s loyalty or disloyalty to be
                determined by the government which happens to occupy the treasury bench? . I say
                deliberately that there are in this country militant sections of Labour which are
                concerned chiefly with gaining power. They are not concerned with much beyond that.

              <para>- I know that my remark hurts the Opposition. It is all very well to talk about
                a maximum war effort and co-operation with the Government, but the fact is that
                there has been manoeuvring on the part of the Opposition to obtain power. Certain
                sections of the Opposition have indeed made a maximum effort, but it has been with a
                view to gaining power by discrediting the Government. The only thing that -theyhave
                done has been to discredit the cause of democracy. Talk of co-operation is only lip
                service with them; behind the scenes there has been deliberate manoeuvring in order
                to obtain power. What is the use of the Opposition saying that if it were in office
                itwould make a better war effort than the present Governmenthas done? In this most
                momentous debate nothing more than generalities has been spoken in respect of the
                budget. Therehas not been any criticism levelled against the Government&#39;s war
                effort; all that has been said by the Opposition has been said in an attempt to
                discredit the Government by means of general allegations. </para>

              <para>- The gloves are off. The honorable member for &#34;West Sydney challenged the
                Minister for Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen),</inline> and chided him
                with being a member of a minority party in the Parliament and a minority government.
                Heaven knows that the honorable member for West Sydney ought to be an expert in
                minorities! He has done a good deal of manoeuvring, and other minority parties hav,
                learned a lot from the honorable member&#39;s amazingly good efforts. We are told
                that there has been a reconciliation on the Opposition side; men who desired to be
                known as &#34;non-Communists &#34; are now associated with those from whom they
                formerly withdrew. The Opposition claims to be one happy family. How long will it
                remain so? I remember that not so long ago there were bitter recriminations between
                members of this supposedly solid Labour party. </para>

              <para>- Let us look at the facts. A sum of &#163;122,000,000 must be raised by loan
                and central bank credit. There is a budget gap of over &#163;.100,000,000 to be
                id&#39; ed. One would have thought that the Leader of the Opposition, with his
                knowledge of the facts, as he admits, would, had he had any proper sense of
                responsibility, have come to this chamber and advanced proposition against
                proposition, principle against principle, and programme against programme. There is
                no mystery about the matter. What are the sources of revenue available to the
                Government? Direct taxation, indirect taxation, voluntary loans, compulsory loans,
                and central bank credit - they are the only fire&#39; sources. One would have
                thought that the Leader of the Opposition would have said, &#34; We have considered
                this matter. We have the full facts before us, and these are the ways and means of
                obtaining this money.&#34; But he and his colleagues have not suggested any
                alternatives to the Government&#39;s proposals. The only alternative which the
                honorable member for Barton advanced was a quotation from a textbook to the effect
                thai more money could be raised in this or that way. Of course, more money can be
                raised in a variety of ways. More money can be raised by indirect taxation ; but
                this Government very correctly, and very wisely, has refrained from making any
                further imposition of that description. Let us consider direct taxation - taxation
                of individuals and companies - as a source of additional revenue, and let us examine
                some of the statements which have been made by the honorable member for Barton about
                wealthy companies. He painted a picture of what has taken place in New Zealand, yet
                he never took the trouble to examine the real situation in detail. New Zealand does
                not tax dividends in the hands of shareholders. But what is the total contribution
                made from the same funds in this country, where we do tax dividends in the hands of
                shareholders? The honorable member adopted the expedient of comparing like with
                unlike, making it appear that they are comparable. He also referred to the taxation
                of war profits in Australia. I remind honorable members that a committee of this
                Parliament was set up to go into that matter. I had something to do with the
                drafting of the original bill on the subject, and I recall that many members of the
                Opposition made representations to me not to go on with the measure. When honorable
                members opposite talk about getting this money out of big business, I cannot help
                remembering how many of their protests against that particular measure are now to be
                found on the treasury file. When that bill came before the House, we set up a
                committee representative of both sides of the chamber for the purpose of going into
                the subject of war-time profits. That com mittee recommended the very act which,
                honorable members, opposite now condemn. Their talk about what the Government can
                get from the profits of companies is so much arrant nonsense, because when they had
                an opportunity to frame a measure- according to their own ideas, they did not take
                advantage of it. Who was the chairman of that committee? He was a member of the
                Opposition. </para>

              <para>- At all events honorable members opposite had the opportunity to go into the
                whole of the details, and I assume that the then representatives of the Opposition
                did so, because the committee brought in a unanimous recommendation. What humbug it
                is, then, for honorable members opposite to say that we are not taking sufficient
                from company profits, and that there is a large reservoir upon which we can draw. We
                have too the spectacle of the Opposition seeking to make a purely political appeal
                by declaring that we must not tax those in the lower ranges of income. It is about
                time that honorable members opposite took a realistic attitude towards the war: Lt
                is useless for them to imagine that we can go through the war without making
                sacrifices, or that we can finance the war simply by taxing those in the higher
                ranges of income. I shall establish the full facts in that respect, and honorable
                members generally will then see to what degree the Opposition can be relied upon to
                govern this country. The number of incomes exceeding &#163;500 a year i3 166,000,
                and the total amount of those incomes is &#163;17S,000,000. The amount which the
                Government proposes to take by way of tax on those incomes is &#163;62,000,000,
                which means that the total net income of those 166,000 people will hp &#163;13
                6,000,000, or an average individual income of &#163;700 a year. The total amount of
                incomes of persons receiving up to &#163;500 a year is &#163;82,000,000, and the
                balance available from that source, after allowing for taxation, will be
                &#163;34,000,000. Of that amount it is estimated that &#163;16,000,000 is now being
                made available to the Government in voluntary loans, whilst other items, such as
                local rates, v. ill reduce that amount still further. If those balances were taken
                by the Government, the amount so obtained would represent only a small proportion of
                the amount we still require in order to meet the costs of the war. Where, then,
                shall we obtain the money we require? It will not come from indirect taxation - we
                are agreed upon that. It will not come from direct taxation on higher incomes,
                because, as I have shown, further imposts of that kind cannot yield more than a
                fraction of the amount required. Compulsory loans are rejected by the Opposition so
                how else can the money be obtained except by expanding the credit base? This reveals
                the shallowness of the Opposition&#39;s case, particularly when it is remembered
                that you cannot achieve anything at all by expanding credit once you have
                substantial employment; and that is the position at present in Australia. Therefore,
                the Government should be applauded for the liberality of its budget rather than
                condemned for bringing down what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr.Forde)
                termed a reactionary and deflationary budget. I listened to the speech of the
                honorable gentleman with a great deal of interest. He made a very good speech; it
                always has been a very good speech. Every time I hear him speak upon the budget he
                always says the same thing. </para>

              <para>- I imagine that one would find it very easy to make a consistent speech by
                simply repeating what one has been saying for years past. It is quite apparent to
                any one who looks at the budget dispassionately that the Opposition is not concerned
                with the terms of the budget, or whether the budget is good or bad. Honorable
                members opposite simply made up their minds to defeat the Government if they could.
                So the speech delivered by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was written before he
                read the budget; and he did not change one word of it even after the budget was
                brought down. </para>

          <para class="block">Let us examine the facts. We have an increasing national income,
            increasing employment, increasing wages, and increasing productivity. Every one of those
            signs negatives deflation. The cold fact is that a very large amount of bank credit is
            being injected into the community. That fact is clear when one compares the amount of
            &#163;122,000,000 which the Government now proposes to raise by loan and central bank
            credit with the amount we succeeded in raising by public loan last year. It is obvious
            that the Government, and particularly the Treasurer, has been liberal in the solution it
            has proposed for the budget problem. The Opposition has made no attempt to challenge the
            budget. Honorable members opposite have merely attempted under cover of an attack on the
            budget to find their way to the treasury benches. I say deliberately that if, in fact,
            they were genuine, or had any real claim to govern this country, they might have been
            expected to say, &#34; This is the budget problem. This money can be raised along the
            following general lines. This total gap of &#163;100,000,000 can be closed in such and
            such a way&#34;. Details need not have been given. But the Opposition has made no
            attempt to approach the matter in that way. Honorable members have offered no counter
            proposals that they are yet game to place before the people. The only way in which they
            seek to cover their paltry tactics is by the use of generalizations about equality of
            effort and equality of sacrifice. </para>

              <para>- The war effort of this Government has been remarkably good, and stands greatly
                to its credit. As well as our need to supply <inline font-style="italic"
                  >equipment</inline> to our troops overseas, we need men to go overseas. A
                recruiting campaign has been conducted in this country for some considerable time.
                But how many members of the Opposition have yet gone upon the recruiting platform?
                Honorable members opposite are silent. The Opposition has gone through an amazing
                metamorphosis in respect of its attitude towards the war. Itis not so long ago that
                honorable members opposite resisted the idea of sending men overseas. And it is not
                so long ago that their platform, to which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition so
                fully referred yesterday, expressed opposition to compulsory training and urged the
                removal of that provision from the statute-book. But honorable members opposite now
                say that they support compulsory training. How could it ever be said that a
                government could be formed by men whose minds have never been constant upon any
                phase of these matters? The one problem which has agitated the minds of certain
                honorable members opposite has been that of intriguing and manoeuvring to defeat the
                Government. If the Leader of the Opposition does not know who are the manoenvrers
                inside his own party we on this side do. </para>

          <para>If we view this problem as one either of finance,or resources, the Opposition&#39;s
            case is completely shallow. If we consider it as one of finance, I have emphasized what
            was already clear to every honorable member on this side, namely, that no concrete
            proposals have been advanced by the Opposition. If we consider the problem as one of
            resources, whence are the resources to come? We can divert our resources only by
            increasing production - there is still room for that, but not very much; by diverting
            expenditure from non-essential work to essential work - that has been done by the
            Capital Issues Advisory Boardand by other measures taken by the Treasury ; or by
            reducing consumption. From the last named there is no escape. How can consumption be
            reduced if the greater part of the purchasing power of the community is left completely
            untouched? Here we have the cold fact that &#163;560,000,000 of the total income of
            Australia is earned in a field which the Opposition says should not be touched at all.
            If it be a matter of finance or of resources, I say to the country that the Opposition.,
            occupying the treasury bench, would completely fail to carry out our war effort. </para>

          <para>Criticism of compulsory loans cannot hold. water. Since it has become fashionable
            for honorable members to quote economists, I shall read what Professor Ileshas written
            about war finance. This will show precisely where the Opposition is heading in its
            attack upon compulsory loans. ProfessorIles said - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It must be remembered that in Australia there are few very large incomes, and that
              the small and medium incomes greatly predominate. Although it would be impossible for
              the rich to pay for the war in the sense of bearing the whole burden of economizing in
              consumption which it involves, thereis an illusory sense in which the rich could be
              made to do all the actual paying. For it would be possible (if it were not for the
              effects on production) to finance the war in such a way that the poor would not be
              called upon to contribute, directly to the Government, anything at all in the form of
              taxes or loans - as they need not if resort were had on a large scale to bank credit.
              This would mean that the poor could escape making payments in money to the Government.
              But it would not mean that they could escape the burden. Indeed, they would bear a
              larger part of the burden under this method of finance than they would bear under the
              method of direct taxation. Inflation has the effect of skimming off part of the real
              incomes of wage and salary earners and of handing it over to the rich (the profit
              earners) so that they would in effect have the wherewithal to pay additional sums to
              the Government in taxation and voluntary loans. It is thus a simple matterto ensure
              that the rich shall have the means to &#34; pay for the war&#34;, by impoverishing the
              poor in order that they may. In advocating finance by bank credit, the Labour party
              would be well advised to take heed of this distinction between paying the money and
              bearing the burden, and in doing so to remember that inflation is incredibly efficient
              in producing inequality. </para>

          <para class="block">I quote that, not because it was written by ProfessorIles, but because
            it is sound common sense. What the Opposition is seeking to do is to enable the people
            in the lower ranges of income to escape paying in terms of money for our war effort. No
            matter what financial jiggery-pokery is indulged in by the Opposition, the burden cast
            upon the people by this war cannot be escaped. So I say to the committee that the
            Opposition has advanced no case at all, either in terms of finance or in terms of
            marshalling resources. Its attack is an utterly abortive attempt to challenge the
            principles upon which the budgetis founded. </para>

          <para>The honorable member for WestSydney said yesterday: &#34;Were I to go on the public
            platform and repeat the statements made by the Minister for the Army at the secret
            session I could make out a good case in respect of the lack of preparations in this
            country &#34;. With due regard to my friendship for the honorable gentleman, I say that
            he played a low game, because he knows that my tongue is tied and that I cannot say what
            has been said at the secret meetings of members and senators or disclose what has been
            clone to remedy the position then revealed. His tactics are just as low as mine would be
            if I were to tell the people of the country that the views held by Labour members of the
            Advisory War Council as shown in discussions by that body of this or that matter reveal
            that they are entirely incapable of government. Since the war began the defences of this
            country have been increased to an amazing degree by the Government. I am ready at any
            time to go on to the platform and defend against any one the war effort of this country. </para>
          <para>The final matter to which I intend to direct myself is that of the banks. As far as
            I can see it, the whole question is whether the Government should nationalize the banks
            or control them. The honorable member forCorio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
              Dedman)</inline> let the cat out of the bag yesterday when he said that the only thing
            to do wasto nationalize them. That, apparently, represents the views of one section of
            the Labour party, but the Leader of the Opposition was not prepared to say that that was
            his view. He said that the Government should control the private banks in order to
            prevent them from making profits out of secondary inflation.. The agreement entered into
            between the Government and the trading banks ensures the attainment of that object. </para>

                one who does not represent its particular brand of politics. This agreement requires
                the attention of the Treasurer, Treasury officials, the Commissioner of Taxation and
                the Commonwealth Bank Board. I refuse to believe that that body of men would do
                other than the fair thing by Australia. I refine to believe that the members of the
                Commonwealth Bank Board would sell themselves to the trading banks. I have had
                experience of the men in whose charge the carrying out of the agreement will be
                placed, and I know that their only concern is to see that the best is done for this

                industrial resources for war. In the view of the Opposition, they are contemptible
                traitors, who would sell their country for private profit. I deny that on their

                whom they do not agree are in the pay of moneyed interests and are taking advantage
                of this war to serve their own ends. It would be a good thing if the people of this

              will not do things which are absolutely necessary, to ensure not only the effective
              defence of Australia, but also that the living conditions of the people shall be

          <para>The Minister for Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> asked, &#34;
            What will be the thoughts of the defenders of Tobruk when they read of this attack on
            the Government?&#34;. I should imagine that the garrison would think the same about this
            attack as they thought during the last federal election. On that occasion, the majority
            of Australian soldiers abroad voted for Labour candidates, and the two members of this
            Parliament who had the honour to share the greatest number of soldiers&#39; votes are
            the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
              Holloway)</inline> and myself. In East Sydney, the Labour party secured 252 soldier
            votes, the United Australia party 48, and other candidates 97. In Indi, which is
            represented by the Minister for Air,87 votes were cast for the Labour candidate. In
            Melbourne Ports, the Labour candidate polled 252 votes compared with his opponent&#39;s
            46. </para>
          <para>In Darling Downs, which is the electorate of the Prime Minister, 56 votes were cast
            for the Labour candidate, and 74 for the honorable gentleman. Those figures indicate
            that the soldiers abroad know the members of Parliament who protect their interests. </para>
          <para>Our opponents forecast an outbreak of manoeuvring and intrigue in the ranks of the

            &#34;Wales militants would seize control, and direct its policy. Let us examine comments
            which have been made from time to time by Government supporters regarding manoeuvring
            and intrigue in their own ranks. When the honorable member for Barker <inline

            <para>Everlasting intrigue and manoeuvring for personal advantage reached its zenith in
              ruptures of the seal of cabinet secrecy, which must ultimately make any Minister&#39;s

            Independent, subsequently entered the ranks of the United Australia party, but the

            this Government, and his remarks about it have been condemnatory. Let us expose the
            opportunists who want power at any price. I well recollect that when the Prime Minister
            first sought election as the representative of Darling Downs, he was opposed by a
            candidate of the United Australia party. Let us see what the honorable gentleman said
            about his opponent in those days. Speaking on the 5th December, 1936, he declared - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The United Australia party gave its allegiance to the big financial and
              manufacturing interests of the cities, and to the middlemen and monopolists, because
              it received its support and power from those people. </para>

              subjected to repeated onslaughts, and were beaten to their knees, preference being
              extended by the United Australia parly to cheap, foreign, black-grown products, so
              that city importers - the men behind the United Australia party - should reap a
              harvest. </para>

          <para>Now, the Prime Minister has joined the bloodsuckers. So that I shall not be unfair
            to him, may I say that, in my opinion, he is fully qualified to be one of their number.
            The honorable gentleman now prophesies that dissension will rend the ranks of the Labour
            party if it takes office. My only regret is that the blow against the Government was not
            struck much earlier, because a great deal of valuable time has been lost. </para>
          <para>The Minister for the Army accused the honorable member for West Sydney <inline
              font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> of having taken an unfair advantage of him
            yesterday by making use of information disclosed at a secret sitting of Parliament and
            knowing that the Minister could not reply to him. Having been present at the secret
            meeting when the Minister made the statement, I say that Australia&#39;s defences are no
            credit to the Government or to him. That is one specific reason why I am pleased to have
            an opportunity to record a vote against the Government. Before the interests which
            Ministers represent will participate in the Avar effort, they require an assurance that
            they will be allowed to make substantial profits. They know that they have nothing to
            fear from the Government. Consequently, Australia can have a proper war effort only when
            &#34; big finance&#34; is ousted from, its position of directing the country&#39;s
            activities. I shall read a few of the comments of newspapers upon the budget. Perhaps
            the Minister will be able to reply to them. Last Saturday, the Sydney <inline
              font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> announced that the market wa3 &#34;
            unmoved by the new taxation proposals.&#34; The next day the Sydney <inline
              font-style="italic">Sunday Sun</inline> declared that investors were &#34; not
            perturbed by the budget; indeed, the week finished with a slightly improved buying, and
            inquiries for industrials.&#34; On Tuesday, the <inline font-style="italic">Daily
              Telegraph&#39;</inline> commented on &#34; the brighter tone in the share marker
            &#34;. .Does that indicate that the wealthy interests believe that the budget will
            affect them ? &#34; Big business &#34; knows full well that this is its budget, the
            outline of which was decided by the Prime Minister, the general manager of the Bank of
            New South&#39; &#34;Wales <inline font-weight="bold">(.Sir Alfred Davidson)</inline> and
            other representatives of private banks in conference. The budget will compel the poorer
            classes to make all of the sacrifices and to pay for the war. Being an accountant, the
            Prime Minister studies these matters in the cold-blooded manner that we expect from
            accountants and lawyers. &#34;When he analyses the effect of the budget upon a
            particular group of people, he does not take into consideration human values. He
            announced that his object was to &#34; bring into work the whole of the physical
            resources which are available &#34;. As the war has been in progress for two years, why
            have not the full resources of the nation already been brought into play in order to
            ensure <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> adequate defence of the country, and to
            deal with post-war problems? At the end of the last financial year, the Treasury had an
            unexpended balance of &#163;16,000,000, which, the Leader of the Opposition declared,
            could play a considerable part in improving social conditions in the Commonwealth. In my
            opinion, pensions could he increased substantially. Upon that matter, I shall elaborate
            later. </para>
          <para>Members of the Country party should not overlook the manner in which the Government,
            by recklessly using its plurality of votes, dominated&#39; the recent meeting of the
            Loan Council, to the detriment of rural interests. Despite the opposition of the
            majority of the States, it forced upon them a policy which makes it impossible for them
            to proceed with essential works. For many years, the Labour party had advocated a
            waterconservation scheme for the northwestern district of New South Wales. Because of
            the attitude of the Commonwealth in dominating the Loan Council, the Labour Government
            of New South Wales has been compelled to suspend work on the Keepit dam, which is
            urgently needed in the north-west of New South Wales. Surely, the Government does not
            contend that this and similar works are not necessary now. </para>
          <para>The Government has badly bungled its handling of compulsory military training. </para>
          <para class="block">Simply to call up thousands of young Australians and to put them into
            camp is not to ensure that adequate preparations for the defence of the country are
            being undertaken. In some instances, the trainees lacked essential equipment for
            training, and galvanized piping was erected to represent trench mortars. All that the
            Army authorities do in many cases is to march them up and down the parade ground, and
            get them into good physical condition. In order to &#34; train &#34; in this manner,
            many youths are being tom from industry, although it has been said that the war will be
            won as much in the workshop as on the battlefield. Troops, to be effective, must be
            properly equipped. The Government accepts responsibility for the campaigns in Greece and
            Crete, because it admits that it was consulted before the Australian Imperial Force was
            despatched to those theatres of war. Aus,tralians who lost their lives in Greece and
            Crete were sent to their death by the Government, because they were thrown into the
            conflict without proper equipment. The Labour party wants no repetition of that tragedy. </para>

                Minister pays to his employees on his banana-farm, industrial trouble would be
                continuous. When visiting the noi-th coast of New South Wales recently, I was
                informed that the Minister had granted to one of his employees on the banana-farm
                ten days&#39; leave at Christmas - without pay; and the honorable gentleman
                subsequently asked the employee&#39;s wife where she had spent the vacation! If the
                Minister&#39;s methods are characteristic of the Government&#39;s policy for the

              <para>- That is true. Because of the acute shipping position, we cannot dispose of our
                surplus primary products, and the Government proposes to expend &#163;500,000 upon
                the erection of additional cool stores. Pensioners have passed the stage at which
                they can participate in productive work; so what would it matter if the Government,
                instead of using money, were to issue to them each week authority to secure from
                Commonwealth stores an extra quantity of food? That policy would not affect the war
                effort. It would simply mean that, instead of keeping food locked up in cool stores,
                the Government would distribute it to people who need it. In that way, primary
                industries would receive assistance. I am of the opinion that, by this process, it.
                would be possible to increase pensions much beyond their present level without
                adversely affecting the war effort. </para>

          <para>The Opposition has been charged by government supporters with having, during the
            last election campaign, promised the soldiers Ss. a clay. For my part, I think that Ss.
            a day is too little. The Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia,
            which, honorable members will admit, has some authority to speak for the soldiers, is
            asking, not for 6s. a day, not for Ss. a clay, but for &#163;1 a day. What have
            honorable members opposite to say to that? The Government takes advantage of every
            pretext to whittle down the miserly allowance to the dependants of soldiers. Here is one
            case that comes to my mind. A young man, whose mother resides in Bathurst, enlisted
            because he had been out of work for a long time, and thought, that, by enlisting, he
            would be able to help his mother. He made an allotment of 3s. a day to his mother, and
            applied for a dependant&#39;s allowance, which was granted. The mother, thinking that
            she would like to ?five something for her son&#39;s benefit when he returned, took work
            as a cleaner in a school, and for this work received &#163;1 3s. lOd. a week. Then the
            department stepped in and said that, as she was in employment, she .was not fully
            dependent upon her son, and her allowance was reduced to 10s. 6d. a week. There have
            been hundreds of cases of that kind. In another instance, a boy had been earning only
            &#163;1 15s. a week before his enlistment. He lived with relatives, to whom he paid
            &#163;1 5s. a week board, leaving him only 10s. a week for fares, &#38;c. He had never
            been in a position to assist his mother. When he enlisted, he discovered to his
            amazement that the authorities rejected his application for a dependant&#39;s allowance
            in respect of his mother, because, they said, he had not been maintaining her before his
            enlistment. </para>
          <para>The honorable member for Parkes, speaking, long before the war at a conference of
            returned soldiers&#39; representatives, made this trenchant criticism of the attitude of
            certain interests towards the returned soldiers - </para>
          <para>Attacking private enterprise, the Minister for Hepatization, <inline
              font-weight="bold">Mr. Marr,</inline> at the official opening of the annual conference
            of the Australian Legion of Ex-service Clubs on Saturday, declared that many business
            firms which could place returned soldiers in employment were rejecting them in favour of
            younger and more energetic mcn who had not been subjected to the strains of modern
            warfare. &#34; On every side there is evidence that apparently it is easier for a nation
            to remember its dead than to care for the living, and many soldiers of to-day must be
            debating whether it was better to have served their country and died than to have served
            and lived &#34;, he added. &#34; Persons were still eager to render homage to the men
            who had died&#34;, said <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Marr.</inline> &#34; They had
            erected monuments to their memory and thronged memorial services, but what was being
            done for those who had fought and returned?&#34; he asked. &#34; The young men of the
            ages that to-day would be called to the colours must wonder if they in turn would be
            forgotten like the veterans of the war, and who can blame them for such thoughts ? &#34;
            concluded the Minister. </para>
          <para class="block">Unless a a blow be struck now to place in office a government that is

            regard to petrol rationing. If you go to any of the fashionable seaside resorts, you
            will find cars there by the hundred. Their owners are ou pleasure bent, and have used
            the cars only for their own enjoyment, whilst the local butcher and baker cannot make
            deliveries more often than twice weekly because sufficient petrol is not available. On
            any of the highways approaching Sydney one can see big limousines, chauffeur-driven,
            each carrying probably not more than one person into&#34; the city. Outside the big city
            stores cars are parked in scores, showing that it is still possible for some persons to
            obtain all the petrol they want. Some time ago, I asked questions in this House

            matter, but nothing was done. It was afraid of <inline font-style="italic">an</inline>
            inquiry, just as it is afraid of an inquiry into many things, including the distribution
            of secret funds. </para>
          <para>The honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline>
            discussed ably the subject of compulsory loans, referring to the scheme proposed by the
            Government as a copy of the Keynes plan in England. It is obvious whom that plan
            pleased, because Keynes has, since he published it, become a director of the Bank of
            England. The Treasurer told us that the money put into compulsory loans would be a
            nest-egg for citizens after the war; that it Would be of-great help to the workers and
            returned soldiers during the period of reconstruction. Those who contribute to &#34;the
            compulsory loans are to receive 2 per cent, interest on their money. Why is it that the
            interest ou compulsory loans is limited to 2 per cent., whilst that on voluntary loans
            contributed by the big financial institutions is 3&#163; per cent, and, in some
            instances, even more? In any case, who is to repay these loans when the war is over? The
            Government is only the representative of the people. If the State is in debt to
            practically every member of the community, it can repay the loans only in one way - out
            of the proceeds of taxation. This applies also in the case of the deferred pay of
            soldiers now serving abroad. In fact, the deferred pay of ls. a day might well be
            described as a compulsory loan, with the difference that the soldier will receive no
            interest on it. When the soldiers return they will be taxed, not only to pay back the
            money raised by compulsory loans from civilians, but also to find the money for their
            own deferred pay. That is a fine example of equality of sacrifice! The Treasurer and
            other Ministers have said that the people&#39;s standard of living would not be affected
            by the budget. Actually, of course, their standard of living has already been reduced by
            20 per cent, and it will be still further reduced when the effects of this budget are
            felt. Consider only one item, tea. The price of tea has increased since the outbreak of
            war by ls. Id. per lb. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> McCarthy, the Acting
            Commonwealth Prices Commissioner, has stated that all the increases of price were
            warranted, but can we accept that statement? The Robur Tea Company Limited, on the 31st
            March, 1941, declared a profit of &#163;20,000, as against one of &#163;11,000 for the
            previous year; yet the Government says that it controls profits, and is determined to
            prevent exploitation. We read advertisements on the hoardings telling us that &#34; Tea
            revives the world &#34; - at from 3s. 6d. to 5s. 6d. per lb. ! How can the pensioners
            afford to buy tea at such prices ? </para>
          <para>The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
              Paterson)</inline> cited figures regarding the total incomes of various wage groups,
            and argued that it was not unjust to ask persons on incomes of less than &#163;400 a
            year to contribute 1.9 per cent, of those incomes to the national effort, but let us see
            how it works out in specific cases. It must be remembered that the money will have to be
            paid, not over a period of twelve months, but over eight months, because, by the time
            the new scheme becomes operative, four months of the financial year will have gone. A
            girl receiving &#163;3 a week will be asked to contribute 7s. a week out of her
            earnings. If she is not living with her parents - if, for instance, her home is in the
            country and she is boarding in the city - she finds it hard enough to exist on &#163;3 a
            week under present conditions. Such, girls frequently have to share rooms in order to
            cut down expenses. Does the Government understand what the loss of 7s. a week will mean
            to that girl, or does it care? I do not think that it does. The Treasurer said that
            company taxation for the year 1940-41 returned &#163;35,000,000, and that, there was not
            much room for increasing that taxation. Therefore, presumably, all increases must be
            borne by individuals. Let us examine the financial position of some of the
            Government&#39;s friends in order to see whether it is possible to get more revenue from
            them. Take, for example, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, that huge
            monopolistic concern which draws its profit, not only from iron and steel, but also from
            goldmining and from shipping. So widespread are its activities that it is in a position
            to throttle the economic life of the community. The balance-sheet of this company for
            the financial year ended the 30th June, 1941, showed that an allowance has been made for
            depreciation alone of &#163;2,164,000, compared with &#163;1,604,000 for the previous
            year. This represents depreciation at the rate of 12&#163; per cent, of the book value
            of the company&#39;s assets, so that it could replace the whole of its plant from the
            depreciation fund in a period of eight years. The company set aside last year
            &#163;1,863,000 to meet taxation, compared with &#163;1,091.000 in the previous year,
            notwithstanding the fact that the disclosed rate of profit does not bring the company
            within the scope of the excess profits tax. If it is not making excess pro- fit, why was
            it necessary to set aside nearly &#163;900,000 more for taxation this year? In 1931 the
            Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited made a profit of &#163;83,257 ; to-day its
            profits exceed &#163;1,000,000 net. Although the Treasurer would say that the company
            has not unduly exploited the Australian public, the fact is that in addition to paying
            regularly high dividends, the company has set aside &#163;7,500,000 for depreciation
            during the last 10 years and has earned profits on an increasing scale from year to
            year. The company has been protected and permitted to do that simply because it has
            great influence with this Government. lt is not necessary to look far to see where that
            influence lies. An examination of the share list of the company would no doubt reveal
            that many members of the Government hold shares either in their own namesor in the names
            of dummies operating on their behalf. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Essington</inline>
            Lewis, who controls this huge monopolistic concern, has been appointed an adviser of the
            Government; actually, he is one of the directors of this Government. We have been told
            by the former Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> that
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Essington</inline> Lewis frequently went to him on a
            Monday morning and placed before him a &#34; small &#34; account involving the payment
            of a few millions of pounds, and that he. simply wrote in the comer of the. account the
            word &#34; Approved &#34;, without any evidence being produced to show that the
            expenditure was justified. Besides being responsible for the expenditure of government
            moneys, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Essington</inline> Lewis is also in a position to
            dictate to the Government what price is to be charged for its requirements of the
            commodities produced in his own company&#39;s workshops. When a committee was appointed
            some time ago to inquire into company taxation, the representatives of the Labour party
            on the committee made a sincere attempt to tighten up the legislation in a satisfactory
            way, but they were restricted in their endeavours by the fact that the committee did not
            continue to function. They hoped that further meetings of the committee would be held at
            which they would have an opportunity to close up some of the loopholes which were
            apparent in our taxing legislation, but the Government did not summon the committee to
            meet again. So, we find that proprietary and private companies are subjected to much
            higher taxation than are limited companies. The directors of these limited companies
            have distributed bonus shares, probably with a fore knowledge of what the Government
            intended to do, so arranging their affairs as to place their earnings outside the scope
            of Commonwealth taxation. &#34;We are told that 20 per cent, of the reserves of these
            companies is now to be placed at the disposal of the Government, because the Government
            says that during war period the expansion of various companies which are not solely
            engaged on war production must be restricted. If it be the intention of the Government
            to prevent the expansion of concerns not solely engaged in war production, no limit
            should be imposed on the appropriation of their reserves. The Government has announced
            that this policy is dictated by the need for diverting from civil production to war
            production as much labour, materials and equipment as possible. If companies producing
            goods for civil consumption are not to be allowed to expand during the war period, why
            stop at taking only 20 per cent, of their reserves; why not take the whole? Now I come
            to the iniquitous cost-plus system. Those concerns which are engaged in the production
            of war material on the cost-plus system have guaranteed to them a certain rate of profit
            not only on the cost of the articles produced but also on the amount set aside for the
            payment of taxation. The provision for the payment of taxation which appears in their
            balance-sheets is added to their costs upon which the profit margin is assessed. In
            other words, the higher the taxes imposed on some of these companies the higher the rate
            of profit they get under the cost-plus system. We all know how the cost-plus system has
            operated to the detriment of the Mother Country. The <inline font-style="italic"

          <para class="block">That indicates conclusively that many of our big industrial concerns
            are more concerned about making profits than about the defence of the Empire. We have

            the Government twelve months to make up its mind to take action against unscrupulous
            boot manufacturers who were foisting inferior footwear on the members of the fighting
            forces. When, finaly, the Government decided to take action, it so arranged matters that
            the first charge was thrown out. The indictments on the other charges were so framed
            that they were ruled to be out of order by the presiding judges and were referred back
            to the Attorney-General. Undoubtedly, the Attorney-General, as a lawyer, understands his
            work, but we are told that the indictment was so faultily worded that the court would
            not be able to proceed very far with it. The Government would have the people believe

          <para class="block">That is the opinion of a man with inside knowledge of what is
            happening in this country. This budget is deliberately designed by the Government to
            benefit the big financial monopolistic interests which control it. It is a private
            bankers&#39; budget. The Treasurer, by interjection during a speech made by an honorable
            member on this side of the chamber, accused the members of the Opposition of trusting
            nobody. The honorable gentleman said, &#34;Do honorable members opposite not trust the
            banks?&#34;; but it is evident that the Government itself is not prepared to trust them,
            otherwise it would not have demanded from them that firm undertaking referred to by the
            Treasurer. I do not know what is meant by a firm undertaking from the banks; but it is
            evident that the Government believed that some special kind of undertaking was required
            from the banks. I am of the opinion that the best plan that could be proceeded with by
            the Opposition when it becomes the Government would be to put the private banks
            completely out of operation and to allow the Commonwealth Bank - the people&#39;s bank -
            to fulfil the function for which it was originally established by a Labour government,
            namely, to provide financial accommodation not only for defence preparations but also to
            meet out postwar problems. A bait for the honorable member for Wimmera was thrown into
            the discussion by the promise of the Treasurer that the Government would introduce a
            bill to establish a mortgage bank. From time to time, when the people in the country
            districts have become restless, it has been customary for this Government to throw them
            &#163;500,000 or &#163;1,000,000 in order to keep them quiet. What our primary producers
            most urgently require is that the Commonwealth Bank shall be placed in a position to
            take over the whole of their mortgages and to give to them financial assistance at a
            nominal rate of interest. It cannot be denied that profiteering is rampant in this
            country. Under the cost-plus system thousands of men are not permitted to do their best
            for their country, and the people who are employing them are pushing up costs in all
            directions. We see inefficiency on every hand, not only in regard to the supply of war
            materials, but also in the conduct of the war and the use of our Australian troops.
            Profiteering, I repeat, is in full operation. In claiming that the <inline

            <para>.- This debate was opened by the Leader of the Opposition <inline
                font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> on a fairly high plane, and it was perhaps
              fitting that the last speaker for the Opposition was a gentleman who is accustomed to
              wielding the political muck-rake. He is never happier than when he is attributing to
              other people some of the thoughts and motives which inspire his own actions. An
              individual who sees ulterior motives in every decent and honest action taken by others
              reveals a disordered mind. I do not propose to attempt to reply to all of the abuse
              that the honorable member for East Sydney has levelled at the members of the United
              Australia party and the United Country party, and at myself personally. The real issue
              at stake in this debate is how we are getting along with our war effort, and what
              attempt we are making to put this country in such a position that, in concert with the
              other members of the British Empire, we shall ultimately bring the war to a successful
              conclusion. There has been an air of unrealism in the debate which has taken place in
              this chamber during the last few days. One would assume from the speech of the Deputy
              Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> in
              particular, and from the speeches of the honorable member for Barton <inline
                font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> and other honorable members opposite, that
              the war was already won, and all we had to do now was to set to and place in order the
              machinery of reconstruction. But the war is not yet won. It may very easily yet be
              Jost; in fact, it will be lost if our allies and the British people throughout the
              world are of the same temper as that indicated by honorable members opposite. I do not
              intend to answer in detail the various matters which have been raised during this
              debate; I propose to confine myself to one or two important statements made by
              honorable members opposite which I think should be corrected. First, the honorable
              member for Barton, referring to company taxation, said that the New Zealand Government
              is taxing companies much more severely than the Australian Government. That is not
              correct. The honorable member told only a part of the story. The maximum company tax
              in New Zealand is 12s. Id. in the &#163;1. </para>

                tax rises as high as lis. in the &#163;1, .and afterwards the dividends are further
                taxed in the hands of individuals at rates as high as Ils. in the &#163;1.
                Therefore, company taxation is far more severe in Australia than it is in New
                Zealand. The amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline
                  font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> is intended to be a motion of censure,
                and is regarded as such by the Government. In the present evenly divided state of
                this House, the attitude of the Opposition seems to be that, if it cannot hold the
                reins of Government, it will not allowany other party to do so. Despite the
                assurances of the.. Leader of the Opposition, it is obvious that the Opposition has
                refused to collaborate with the Government in directing the nation&#39;s war effort.
                The reasons stated by honorable members opposite for the submission of this motion
                of censure are too flimsy to outweigh the need for the rapid development of our war
                effort, I could have appreciated the attitude of the Opposition if the motion had
                been phrased in such a. way as to contribute to the better development of our
                defences and the more vigorous prosecution of the war effort of the Empire
                generally. The reasons stated by the Opposition for its action are that some people,
                who are already lightly taxed, ought to be taxed les*, and that others, who are
                already heavily taxed, ought to be taxed more, that the soldiers&#39; pay should be
                increased by putting ls. a day more into their pockets now instead of into their
                savings accounts, and that old-age pensions ought to be increased by a few pence
                weekly - because the difference between the rate proposed by the Opposition and what
                will automatically be paid to pensioners within a few weeks as the result of cost of
                living adjustments will be 6d. a week. For these very poor reasons the Opposition
                wants to remove a Government from office in time of war. Not one constructive
                proposal has been put forward by honorable members opposite for increasing the
                efficiency of our war effort. There has been no criticism of the adequacy of the war
                effort, or of the budget as it is framed to meet war-time conditions. Not one word
                has been said to suggest that the Government is doing too little or too much for
                defence. This important consideration has been ignored altogether. The budget is the
                most important that has ever been presented in Australia, and it represents the
                greatest national effort in this country&#39;s history. The Opposition has accepted,
                in a matter of fact fashion, all of its points except a. few which do not satisfy
                the demands of some sectional interests. This shows bow little the gravity of the
                war situation has impressed itself upon the minds of the honorable members opposite.
                The chief features of the budget are that it provides for the maintenance of 400,000
                fighting troops, for an increased munitions programme that will employ nearly
                100,000 additional persons by the end of this financial year, and for the purchase
                of the products of the labour of a further 100,000 workers employed in private
                factories and on defence works. The Opposition has not. disputed the adequacy of
                these provisions. It has either taken them&#39; for granted or overlooked them
                altogether, and it is forcing the House to a vital division over only a small
                portion of the revenue and expenditure proposals. It seems to have lost a true sense
                of perspective and to be viewing the war as though it were being fought on some
                distant planet. I hope that, while we are debating these matters here, events are
                not occurring overseas which will bring sudden and tragic &#39;disillusionment to
                the critics of the Government. We are involved in a bitter struggle for national
                survival, a struggle for our continuance as a self-governing nation where
                representatives of the people may legislate freely in an unshackled Parliament.

          <para class="block">Therefore let us look squarely at the facts. I shall state the
            proposed apportionment of taxesand compulsory loans for 1941.-42 amongst the various
            income groups. Of &#163;560,000,000 of income received by the group of people who earn
            &#163;400 a year and less, the Governmentproposes to take &#163;10,500,000, or 2 per
            cent., of which a large proportion will represent loans. Of a total of &#163;145,000,000
            of income of the group of people earning between &#163;400 and &#163;1,000 a year, the
            Government proposes to take &#163;15,000,000, or 10 per cent; and of the
            &#163;95,000,000 of income of the group of people earning over &#163;1,000 a year, it
            proposes to take &#163;38,500,000, or 40 per cent. Therefore, the proposal is to take
            out of the total national income of &#163;800,000,000, an amount of &#163;64,000,000 in
            loans and taxes, which represents8 per cent. of the pool. I could understand the Leader
            of the Opposition talking of inequality of sacrifice if the taxes were to be levied on a
            flat rate. But how, in the name of reason, can any responsible person complain of a tax
            representing less than 2 per cent. of the aggregate income of persons earning less than
            &#163;400 a. year? The rates of tax are so graduated as to exempt those persons who earn
            the lowest incomes. Contrast thiswith the proposal to take &#163;38,500,000 of the
            &#163;95,000,000 of income of persons earning &#163;1,000 a year and more. That tax
            represents an average of 8s. in the &#163;1. It, also, is graduated steeply so that the
            contributions of the highest income earners rise to18s. in the &#163;1. The Leader of
            the Opposition expects the country to believe that he was serious when he called this
            inequality of sacrifice. If it is inequality of sacrifice, it is an inequality operating
            inversely to the way which the honorable gentleman alleged. Briefly, the budget
            proposals are that the Government shall take, as a direct contribution to the war
            effort, 40 per cent. of the higher incomes, 10 per cent. of the middle incomes and only
            2 per cent. of the incomes averaging less than &#163;400 a year. A man, with a wife and
            two children, who earns &#163;250 a year, will not be required to pay anything. The
            Leader of the Opposition has said. in effect, that this tax of 2 per cent. on the lower
            incomes is too high. How muchfurther can it be reduced without making the contribution
            of that section of the community negligible? Does the honorable gentleman seriously
            contend that the 2,700,000 income earners in that section cannot afford to make a
            significant direct contribution to national security? And does he contend that the
            income earners receiving &#163;400 a year or more should bear practicallythe whole of
            the direct taxation? </para>

              <para>- He implied it. Is it thehonorable gentleman&#39;s conception of equality of
                sacrifice that 90 per cent. of Australia&#39;s breadwinners should contribute either
                nothing or practically nothing to the financing of the war effort, and that 10 per
                cent. bear practically the whole of the taxation burden. Clearly, such a proposal is
                inequitable, and, if implemented, it would not give to the Government command of the
                physical resources that must be used if Australia is to play its proper part in the
                prosecution of the war. Nobody who has closely examined the facts can believe that
                persons earning &#163;400 a year or less cannot afford to pay something directly to
                the Government for their own protection and the safeguarding of their right to earn
                incomes. If the Opposition&#39;s proposals were applied throughout the British
                Commonwealth of Nations our prospects of winning this war would vanish, and we
                should become the victims of the Nazi oppressor. The sort of argument which is now
                employed by honorable members opposite, was also used in France before theoutbreak
                of war. It was claimed that that: country could not afford to provide the money
                necessary for its adequate defence. But to-day, the people of France are paying
                tribute to their victors with everythingthat they possess, even to theirlife-blood.

              <para>- The Leader of the Opposition said, if not directly then by implication, that
                2,700,000 of the people of Australia whose incomes were less than &#163;400 a year
                could not afford, and could not be expected, to contribute towards the cost of the
                war by means of direct taxation. That meant that about 300,000 individuals in this
                country were to be expected to providethe whole of our war taxation. As 1 remarked
                before the suspension of the sitting, the people of France were led astray by
                arguments of the same character. They were told that they could not afford to pay
                for the effective defence of their country. French politicians vied with one another
                in the forceful submission of this point of view to the people of France, but to-day
                France is paying, in the blood of its men, the tears of its women, the hunger of its
                children and the sweat of its workers for supporting such a policy. </para>

                whole of the people for the political representatives of half of the community to
                advance views similar to those of the Opposition to which I am now referring. If any
                such ideas gain general currency, then God help this country. The Leader of the
                Opposition should think long and seriously before encouraging 90 per cent, of the
                income earners of this country to believe that the war can be won without them
                making any contribution towards the cost of it. I do not believe that any.
                thoughtful Australian considers that we can win the war without being hurt in the
                process. I do not believe that any honorable member opposite believes, in his heart,

            this year than, they were last year. Having this in mind, can. any honorable gentleman
            opposite still suggest that these people are not in a position to make some sacrifice to
            ensure the winning of the war? A general acceptance of that view would lead to
            thibreeding of a race of petty profiteer.- holding the idea that they can make a good
            thing out of the war and still safe from their enemies. No nation and no people can be
            safe except by tinwholehearted effort of the whole of the people. One section of the
            community cannot protect every other section. Let us speak plainly and face the facts
            squarely. Does any honorable gentleman opposite believe that people can be better off

              <para>- It was suggested by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday. The purpose of the
                amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition is, in my view, to lift part of the
                load of war from the shoulders of certain people who should carry a portion of it.
                If the Opposition really believes that 2,700,000 wage-earners in this country should
                be relieved of any responsibility to contribute towards the cost of the war the
                sooner it submits its case to the electors the better for the country. I, for one,
                would not sit on the Government benches and subscribe to a view so utterly dangerous
                to the nation. I would noi lead the people &#34; up the garden path &#39;&#39; of
                such wishful, futile, rosy, thinking. We should tell the people the facts of the
                case. Our only hope of survival is for every person in the community to make an
                equitable sacrifice. ,We do not need any assurance that the members of the
                Opposition are patriotic and loyal Australians. We know that all sections of this
                community are loyal, and, if properly led and fully informed, will do everything in.
                their power to ensure the winning of the war. But the people should not be misled
                into believing that the war can be won without the making of great sacrifices. A
                Labour Government, or any other government for that matter, would hu assuming a
                terrible responsibility if it were to -tell&#39; the people iri-&#62;the lower
                income ranges that this war can be financed, and war work performed in the necessary
                volume, without any appreciable taxing of incomes under &#163;400 a year. lt, cannot
                be done. That is not an opinion; it is a fact. During the last war, income tax was
                imposed on incomes as low as &#163;100 a year. As time goes on, we shall have to
                make more substantial contributions towards the cost of this war than we have made
                hitherto; otherwise we shall reach the point at which our war effort will lag and
                ultimately depreciate. If that were to happen there could be only one end to the
                war, and it would be our defeat. To say otherwise is undoubtedly to delude the
                people. To do otherwise than to impose taxes as, when and where necessary, in order
                to obtain command of our real resources in goods and labour for war purposes, would
                be gross betrayal of the nation. We have, so far enlisted, upwards of 300,000 men in
                our various fighting services. By making such enlistments the nation, as a whole,
                has incurred a solemn obligation to arm, equip, feed, clothe and support the men. To
                do those things effectively will require a considerable sacrifice from the remainder
                of the nation. We shall have to go without some things in order that our troops may
                have all the equipment they need to fight our enemies on equal terms. We have not
                sufficient resources to engage in a full-blooded Avar effort and support our armed
                forces in the fullest possible way and, at the same time, to permit the civil
                population to enjoy all the amenities to which they have been accustomed. </para>

              <para>- In a time of war the Government will not compete with the Opposition to see
                which party can be the better political Eather Christmas. No fair-minded man can
                think, or honestly say, that this war can be satisfactorily financed by the
                imposition of a crippling tax on 45,000 people, a moderate tax on 270,000 people,
                and little or no tax on 2,700,000 people. Our enemies are not attempting to win the
                war by such means. No other country in the British Empire is attempting to do it,
                and we should not attempt to do it. If we do we shall fail. </para>

          <para>Let us look for a moment at the basis of the case submitted by the Leader of the
            Opposition. He said rightly that to fight this war we must have men equipped with guns,
            rifles, ammunition, aeroplanes, ships, motor vehicles, tanks and a hundred and one other
            necessaries, such as clothing, hats, boots, knitted goods, tents, buildings, food and
            comforts. How are these things to be provided? They cannot be conjured from thin air by
            act of Parliament, or by some mystic financial device. They must come from the labour,
            savings and sacrifice of the people. In a. large part, the nation must do without its
            luxuries, its comforts, and even some of its necessaries in order to provide for the
            first necessity of all - survival. During the first two years of the war the number of
            people employed in Australia increased by 180,000. Most of the added employment was
            provided in the production of munitions and other necessaries of war. Un to date we have
            taken over 300,000 people out of industry and put them into the armed forces. We have
            equipped them chiefly by the labour of more people, and without the imposition of very
            great sacrifices of our comfort or of our civil necessaries. But the war has now reached
            a new phase. We have virtually exhausted our labour supply, and in &#93; 941-42 we shall
            need to recruit another 100.000 men for the armed forces and possibly another 100.000
            workers for our factories. These will all have to be withdrawn from civil industry. </para>

              <para>- Relatively few of the people now unemployed are really employable. Iri the
                circumstances which T have outlined it follows that the civil population must begin
                to go without some things that they have enjoyed in order that our troops may have
                provided for thom the things necessary to enable them to defend us effectively. Our
                plain need is the transfer of income from the buying of goods for civil consumption
                to the buying of necessaries for our defence. Instead of spending more on things we
                would lite for our sustenance, comfort and enjoyment, we must spend more on things
                we need for- our preservation and for the destruction of our enemies. We are at the
                stage where we must choose between the limiting of the consumption of comfort goods
                and necessaries for civilian use and the limiting of production for war use. There
                is no alternative choice. We have not sufficient resources to supply our full
                requirements simultaneously for both war and civil purposes, and we should therefore
                put first things first. To-day defence is the first, requirement of every man, woman
                and child in the country, anc! we should not waste our time by talking
                grandiloquently of our capacity to carry on as usual. Only a race of sluggards would
                allow things for their comfort, to compete with things required for their survival,
                and Australians are no race of sluggards. If rightly led and advised, our people are
                capable of gallant sacrifices. In fact, they will make any sacrifice that may be
                necessary in order to win the war. The responsibility for leading the people in this
                connexion should fall on the shoulders of all of the members of this Parliament and
                not on the shoulders of half of us. If the members of the Opposition would give the
                Government the co-operation and support that it is within their power to give, they
                would make it possible for every thing necessary to be done for the defeat of our
                enemies. A comparison of last year&#39;s income with that for the present year shows
                that, after paying the Commonwealth taxes proposed in this budget the total income
                of persons in the group earning &#163;400 a year or less will have increased in the
                lust twelve months by &#163;32,000,000. </para>

              <para>- They do. Honorable members opposite cannot get away from figures and facts,
                although I know that they do not like them. I ask the Opposition to note these
                figures and facts when they speak of equality of sacrifice and charge this
                Government with favouring people receiving high incomes. The income of the group of
                persons earning &#163;1,000 a year or more has, during the last seven months,
                decreased by &#163;12,000,000, or 17 per cent. That is an effective answer to the
                statement that this Government has not adequately taxed those on higher incomes. The
                important point is that, whilst there has been little increase of the residual left
                to those people on the middle incomes, and whilst those on high incomes have
                suffered a decrease of &#163;12,000,000, people in the group earning &#163;400 a
                year and under have had their total income - in other words, their purchasing power
                - increased by &#163;32,000,000 after allowing for the taxes and post-war credits
                provided for in this budget. It can be seen, therefore, that the statements made by
                the Leader of the Opposition and his followers in regard to deprivations suffered by
                people on low incomes have little substance. </para>

                he will have a different story to tell. The Government has chosen direct taxation

              <para>- The honorable member for Dalley has been holding up the war effort for the
                past two years. I shall delay it for only a few minutes longer. I believe that it
                would be fraudulent to encourage the people to believe chat persons in receipt of
                low incomes can escape all direct taxation in this war. The Government has chosen
                the straightforward method&#39;, and it will stand by its decision. The Government
                has gone a considerable way to meet the views of the Labour party in the matter of
                taxation. As I have already shown, taxation levelled on high inCOmeS has effected a
                reduction of &#163;12,000,000 a year in those incomes, whereas the spending power of
                those in receipt of low incomes has increased by &#163;32,000,000 a year. Despite
                these figures, the Opposition is still dissatisfied. This Parliament and the country
                is entitled to know exactly what the Opposition wants, and what it means. Does it
                want to use the war as an excuse for the installation of a system of complete
                socialism, levelling down all incomes by means of taxes to a limit of &#163;400 per
                annum. The Leader of the Opposition seemed to imply that, that was the intention.
                Let him make a plain statement of the position. Is that what the Opposition seeks?
                Is it intended to stage a. daggering social transformation in the midst of a war?
                What has happened to other countries which have endeavoured to bring about a social
                revolution in the midst of a war? They have merely exposed their vitals to the
                enemy, as was the case in Russia in 191.7, and subsequently in other countries. It
                is quite clear that such a policy would only mean a transition to communism. I
                realize that honorable members opposite do not like what I am saying, but I shall
                give them all they want. I repeat that it would only be a transition to communism,
                because if everybody was to be prevented from earning more than &#163;400 a year, or
                to derive any benefit from earning an income above that limit, who would exert
                himself in an endeavour to earn more than that sum? </para>

                or would it start the good old printing presses again? I am putting a straight and
                direct question to the Opposition. What would honorable members opposite use for

            <para>.- For some time I have been deeply concerned over conditions prevailing in this
              chamber, and I assume that to-day honorable members :l&#93; 8 not debating the budget,
              whatever good or bad points it may contain. We are debating a proposal which is really
              a. motion of want of confidence in the ability of the Government to carry on. I do not
              regard the amendment as a motion of censure against the personnel of the Government,
              but rather as a motion of censure against the Government for the impossible position
              in which. it .finds itself. About la month ago, the then Prime Minister <inline
                font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> came to a reasoned conclusion, and set out
              his views in a letter which he sent to the Leader of the Opposition. <inline
                font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin).</inline> In that letter he expressed the opinion
              that this branch of the legislature as at present constituted was unworkable, because
              the Government cou&#39;ld not command a majority. Since that, day, there has been no
              improvement whatever in the position. In fact it has steadily deteriorated. Any
              alteration of the personnel of the Government would not add one vote to this side of
              the chamber, and I rise to-day to say that I have now come to the conclusion reached
              by the right honorable member for Kooyong a month ago. I have decided to vote against
              the Government on the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. This country
              must have stability of government. I am not concerned with the method to be adopted in
              order to achieve that end. </para>

              <para>- It is not a matter of objecting to the budget. There are some points in it
                which I would be prepared to discuss as the various items came under review, but at
                the moment they do not matter. I regard the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition
                as a motion of want of confidence in the Government. Twelve months ago this
                Parliament was a workable institution. What has eventuated to make a. responsible
                Opposition of 36 members adopt an attitude of absolute hostility to the Government
                on points which, a year ago, it was willing to cede? Nothing more or less than a
                loss of confidence in the Government&#39;s ability to carry on, and to wage the
                maximum war effort of which this country is capable. The reason for that lack of
                confidence is, that this Government has proved that it has not the numbers necessary
                to enable it to exorcise that strength of control in respect, of the war effort
                which a. government should exercise. I have stood loyally by this Government, and I
                have not sought any preferment. </para>

                But this is a matter, not of men, but of situation. The Opposition is not alone, as
                a body, in realizing that we have reached what its Deputy Leader <inline

                &#34;. There are several options open to this Parliament. It could continue to try
                to muddle along with a minority government, with challenge and counterchallenge
                whenever it met. During the last four or five weeks the position has steadily
                declined, first in the Government parties, culminating with the resignation of the
                right honorable member for Kooyong as Prime Minister, until last week we had the
                degrading spectacle of the Government being challenged on account of its alleged
                misuse of public moneys, and this week a direct challenge to its right to continue
                to administer the affairs of this country. The people of Australia require that this
                branch of the legislature shall be cleaned up. </para>

          <para>I realize that there is nothing noble in what I am doing; but I am actuated by cold

            risk, as will many other honorable members, should there be an election. The Government
            might decide to take one of the other options open to it; that is, either go to the
            country for an election, or invite the Opposition to take office. That is a decision
            which the Governor-General must make. It might not be a bad idea to go to the country
            and allow the people of Australia to give <inline font-style="italic"
              >expression</inline> to their opinion by returning a government which would be
            workable. That would be far better than that we should continue as we are at present,
            with a Gilbertian assembly which might not be workable if we were to run into a period
            of serious national emergency. </para>

              <para>- I am not handing over to the Labour party; the people of Australia will decide
                which party is to govern. The budget is susceptible to criticism. It purports to be
                the only budget which could be brought down; but many people do not agree with that
                contention. The Prime &#39;Minister wishes it to be discussed in the light of the
                principles he has set down. These are, that the financial policy shall bring into
                work the whole of the physical resources which are available; that it will promote
                the diversion of resources from civil to war purposes; and that it will distribute
                equitably the sacrifices made necessary by this diversion. If the figures on page 15
                be analysed, it will be found that no spending money is to be taken from the
                community, compared with what they have to-day. An extra &#163;32,000,000 is to be
                taken into the Treasury, but &#163;5,000,000 of this will come out of company
                reserves, which is not spending money. If the Government intends to disburse
                &#163;13,000,000 in respect of child endowment, an extra &#163;1,500,000 on invalid
                and old-age pensions, and an additional &#163;750,000 on farmers&#39; debt relief,
                and the &#163;12,000,000 raised last year by means of war savings certificates is
                not obtained this year - that source of revenue may be dried up - there will be an
                equal balance. This budget does not disclose that it will have any effect on
                Australia&#39;s No. 1 war problem, which is the transfer of men and women from civil
                to war occupations. That is a separate and physical problem, and one of management.
                In that regard I for one think that the effort in that direction could be improved.

              <para>- On the lines of the figures disclosed in the Estimates of Receipts and
                Expenditure. Under the Department of the Army it was estimated that the expenditure
                on pay and allowances last year would be &#163;21,210,350, but the actual
                expenditure was &#163;31,776,000. The vote in 1940-41 in respect of arms, armament,
                ammunition, mechanization equipment, and reserves was &#163;63,400,660, and the
                actual expenditure amounted to only &#163;30,971,766. That discloses a position that
                cannot be described as indicating efficient management. This year the estimate for
                that division of the Department of the Army has been reduced to &#163;37,800,000. A
                similar position is seen with regard to the Department of Air. The division of
                aircraft, equipment and stores was estimated last year to require a vote of
                &#163;17,653,537, and it is estimated that the expenditure this year will amount to
                &#163;.16,780,000. The people of Australia have learnt that equipment is of first im
                portance. </para>

                regarded as in reserved occupations, but they could at least be trained. Our
                technical training scheme is so limited that it will not bring the wheels of
                production to full momentum for as long a period as is necessary. Why? Because the
                policy of the Government has been to whittle down that scheme. It was not a
                long-range policy. It could have been extended to a very marked degree. </para>

                honorable member will vote on the amendment before the committee. I am aware, of
                course, that he has been opposed to the Government in its decisions with regard to
                the wheat industry. My decision has been made in the hope that Australia may have a
                change from the present unsatisfactory position, either by an appeal to the electors
                or by the present Ministry inviting the Opposition to take over the reins of
                government. Australia requires responsible government that will result in throwing

              <para>- The Leader of the Opposition, in his challenge, referred to the Government
                policy regarding compulsory loans. I have expressed myself in favour of such loans,
                and I still support such a policy if the loans are raised on an equitable basis; but
                I do not regard the proposed basis of these loans as satisfactory, for the simple
                reason that they would operate to the advantage of the more favoured States. In
                States such as Queensland, where the people are highly taxed, the- total sum raised
                would entirely disappear. I have been notified by hundreds of people in Victoria
                that they are opposed to this scheme for compulsory loans, but that does not affect
                my attitude to the budget at all. The system of compulsory loans has been sold to us
                in Victoria as something that will give security to us in the post-war period. But,
                in the more highly taxed States, the people are offered a barren outlook. </para>

              <para>- Nothing whatever. If the war continues for a sufficiently long period,
                Victoria will be able to buy Queensland out of its loan credits, but the people of
                Queensland are to be asked to pay part of the interest upon the compulsory loans
                that the more favoured States will be piling up for the post-war period. That is a
                poor foundation for compulsory loans. The position would be much better if the
                Government would do as the Minister for Defence Coordination wanted to do last year,
                and equalize the taxation. That could be done. If the Government could equalize the
                burden of child endowment, as between taxpayers in the various States, why could it
                not equalise the contributions for social services of all descriptions ? If that
                could be done, the burden could be distributed equally throughout the States, and
                the outlook for the more highly taxed States need not be so barren as it now is. My
                attitude to the budget is dictated by a desire to preserve national stability. I
                desire to see responsible and stable government at this crucial time. </para>

            <para>. -The committee has ;just listened to what may be termed a remarkable
              announcement. While I am not accustomed, when speaking in this place, to descend to
              personalities, I think that, in view of the momentous character of .the vote which the
              honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coles)</inline> has just
              announced he intends to cast, and its effects upon a country which is in the throes of
              a life-and-death struggle, it will be of interest to review what has led up to the
              present situation. The honorable member for Henty has not been in this Parliament for
              very long. He was returned for a Victorian electorate which had for many years
              previously elected supporters of the United Australia party. He certainly was returned
              as an Independent, but it was with United Australia party co-operation, and on
              previous occasions he has indicated by his vote in this Parliament that he was a
              supporter of the Government drawn from members on this side of the House. He came here
              as a determined protagonist of a national government. He went through Victoria
              preaching the virtues, and, indeed, the necessity, in time of war of a national
              government for Australia. He entered Parliament with the laudable purpose of seeking
              the greatest measure of unity among members of all parties in support of this ideal. I
              am informed that he approached several honorable members, and invited them to
              associate themselves with him in the formation of a new party, which would either
              absorb existing parties or be sufficiently strong to impose its policy on the country.
              I do not question his motives; I am attributing the highest motives to him in what he
              did. What I do question is either his sense of responsibility or his sense of
              judgment, which has enabled him at this time to make the decision that he has just
              announced, and I say that after having listened carefully to the reasons he has given.

            departments - and he proposes to do this because the Government has no hope of assurance
            of stability. Nobody could have done more than Ministers on this side of the House to
            secure such stability. They have offered to participate in that very national government
            which the honorable member for Henty, himself, advocates. They have said to the
            Opposition that, if it is prepared to sink party interests., they will do the same, and
            serve under a leader chosen by the Opposition. That offer was made only a few weeks ago,
            and the honorable member for Henty at that time applauded it. When the offer was
            refused, we then tried to achieve the greatest measure of unity among honorable members
            on this side of the House, and a change of leadership was effected. At the meeting at

              <para>- I am aware that the conscience of the Leader of the Opposition <inline
                  font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> is tender on this point. He knows that,
                .before any dissension arose, the ex-Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
                  Menzies)</inline> offered to form a national government. That, was immediately
                after the last election, and the offer has been repeated from time to time. Although
                the honorable member for Henty entered Parliament as an Independent, he walked into
                the United Australia party room as a member, and stayed there up to a few weeks ago.
                When, after the refusal of the Opposition to enter a national government, the United
                Australia party effected a changi1 of leadership, and there was once more a prospect
                of achieving stable government. the honorable member for Henty was the first to
                challenge that stability by walking out of the party room, and indicating that a
                condition of dissension still existed. I say deliberately that if he had remained in
                the joint party room, the Government could have presented a united front to the
                country, and no one in this Parliament would have attempted to challenge the
                administration. By his action in walking out, and by the statements which he issued
                to the public immediately afterwards, he weakened the edifice which had been built
                up by so much personal sacrifice. He now claims that his purpose in voting with the
                Opposition is to secure stability of government. He admits that he is not
                challenging the principles of the budget. Indeed, he is reported as having said that
                he supports the broad principles of the budget. He has openly advocated those very
                principles in the celebrated 23 points which lie presented to the acting Prime
                Minister upon his return from abroad. Therefore, his attack is not on the budget,
                but on the alleged failure of the Government to secure stability. Against whom
                should that attack have been launched? Should it have been directed against members
                on this side of the House, who have made every effort within reason to bring about
                stability? Should it not rather have been directed against members of the
                Opposition, who have not been prepared at any stage to sink their personal political
                interests for the welfare of Australia ? </para>

          <para>However, I do not propose to press that point any further. Neither shall I dwell
            further upon the fact that the honorable member for Henty proposes to sweep out of
            office experienced executives, and replace them by men who, in this generation, have no
            executive experience. I pass over all that, and ask only, how does he imagine that his
            action is going to promote the cause of administrative stability? The Opposition has 36
            members in this chamber, and. that number is not large enough to enable the Labour party
            to govern. Either he - and perhaps some other members from this side of the House - must
            give assurances of support to the Opposition, or there will have to be a general
            election. Let us assume for the moment that he is prepared to give assurances of support
            to Labour in the implementing of its policy. He has already announced the 23 points
            which embody his own conception of what should be a proper war effort for Australia.

          <para>After the honorable member had made <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> few
            speeches, special meetings were called at the Melbourne Trades Hall in order to

            Labour party to adopt when he puts it in office? I indicated earlier that I would not
            base my remarks on a personal attack on the honorable member. However, I question
            whether honorable members on this side of the committee have ever come in contact with a
            more unbalanced or irresponsible political mind than that of the honorable member for
            Henty. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member for Henty has unbalanced not only honorable members on
                this side, but also the country, which he has placed in a state of uncertainty and
                suspense. Is he prepared to give assurances of support to honorable members
                opposite, expecting them to put into effect the planks of the policy which he
                regards as fundamental to an optimum war effort in this country? And is the
                Opposition prepared to accept as a basis for the formation of a war-time
                administration assurances of support from an honorable member who one day is
                prepared to give his support to our party, and the next day demands to be put into
                effect a series of items of policy which are fundamentally opposed to the policy of
                honorable members opposite? Do honorable members opposite believe in the
                conscription of labour within this country, or in the conscription of men for
                military service? These are the matters upon which the honorable member for Henty
                expects them to meet him in the formation of an administration. I say this to the
                honorable member for Henty: Unless his action results in an election automatically,
                as he seems to imagine, it will leave this Parliament less stable than it has been
                up to the present. It will merely result in a number of men who have been engaged,
                from day to day, in the business of war-time administration, being replaced by other
                men who, whatever their qualifications, and even assuming them to possess equal
                capacity, will nevertheless require weeks and, perhaps, months to absorb the
                background and details of administration which are part and parcel of a
                Minister&#39;s everyday job. </para>

              <para>- Quite obviously, it would not; because, in that case, a majority, or at least
                a nucleus, of experienced Ministers would enable a national Ministry to operate far
                more easily than will be the case if a completely new administration takes up the
                threads of office and attempts to guide the destinies of the country from that
                point. I say to the country - obviously the Parliament is not prepared to examine
                the situation which has been placed before us - that nothing short of a general
                election can possibly produce a greater measure of stability in this Parliament than
                we have had up to this moment. So, we must assume that, as the result of the
                honorable member&#39;s action, the country, within twelve months of the last general
                election, must resolve another election in order to return a stable administration.
                I ask honorable members to examine the implications of that position. It will mean a
                complete hold-up, possibly for weeks, of the war-time administration of this
                country. It will mean that the country itself will be split from stem to stern by
                political controversy. If there is one thing on which opinion in this country is
                completely united it is that an election at this time and under existing conditions
                would be disastrous. The honorable gentleman has taken this course knowing that by
                his action be will put the country to the expense, and, at this time, the
                impediment, of an election. All I desire to say is that if he believes that his
                action will bring about any greater stability of administration within the present
                Parliament, he is gravely mistaken. We could have had that greater measure of
                stability had he himself been prepared to stand loyally and constantly by honorable
                members on this side of the House whom he was elected to support. The electors of
                Henty did not intend to return a candidate who would, in war-time, displace a
                governmentwhose achievements constitute the most remarkable record in the history of
                federation. Within the last two years we have seen a transformation in the
                administration of this country. This very Parliament has developed from a place in
                which we were concerned with matters of finance and defence, and general matters of
                principle, to the point where we ourselves guide, through the Executive the whole of
                the people of Australia. We have gone into the homes of the people in a way in which
                no previous federal administration has done, and the result has been an industrial,
                political and administrative miracle of achievement. It has earned the just praise
                of critics from all parts of the world. That has been done in the course of the last
                two years, by using the administration which this Parliament was able to furnish. Is
                that good work to be thrown into the discard because one man who could have provided
                a reasonable degree of stability has shown a lack of loyalty and consistency in his
                support of the Government? Look at some ofthe chance phrases he uttered in his
                speech. He said, &#34; It might not be a bad idea if we changed places for a while
                &#34;. Is that the sort of reason why the people are to be asked to change their
                war-time administration, and to throw the country into maladministration, which must
                be the inevitable result of the hiatus his action will cause? Not only the electors
                of Henty but also the people of Australia will place a far more balanced and
                sensible construction on, not only the motives of the honorable member, but also the
                results of the action to which he has committed this Parliament, and Administra-
                tion. If he expects stability of government in this Parliament without an election
                he will be sadly mistaken. On the other hand, he must accept responsibility, and
                carry that responsibility through history, for causing an election to be held at a
                critical hour in the affairs of this country. </para>

              <para>- I was about to say that one thing that I have noticed more than anything else
                during this debate is the chagrin and spleen which has been displayed by members on
                the Government side of the committee. In the popular phrase, &#34; They cannot take
                it &#34;. For instance, immediately 1 rose to speak, the Minister for Trade and
                Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> made a rude interjection.
                T shall not enter into any detailed discussion of the budget. The reasons that have
                actuated the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
                  Coles)</inline> to support the amendment are somewhat different from those which
                have actuated me in deciding to oppose the budget and to support the Leader of the
                Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin).</inline> No one can accuse me of
                being inconsistent. I have never had much enthusiasm for the policy of the
                Government. In my movements around the rural areas of this continent, I have seen
                too much of the effects of its lopsided policy, and to-day we see its fruits. The
                Government has now introduced a budget providing for the expenditure of
                &#163;219,000,000 for war purposes and other amounts which make the total
                requirements of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> about
                &#163;322,000,000. I make no complaint about that. That is the amount which the
                Treasurer says is necessary in order to carry out the plans of the Government, as
                regards both the war effort, which I regard as paramount, and our internal economy.
                The amount has to be raised. But I do- complain of the methods by which the
                Government proposes to raise it. I do not profess to be an expert in. economics, but
                I have a common-sense idea of financial questions, and I have always considered that
                the raising of money by taxation is a function of government. It is the method by
                which governments collect, shall we say, a percentage of the surplus funds of the
                people and redistribute them in accordance with its policy. That is an integral part
                of our present democratic system. Then, if the amount obtained is not sufficient for
                the Government&#39;s needs, there is another method by which money may be raised,
                and that is by borrowing the savings of the people. I have no complaint to make in
                that respect. The people in this time of stress and national emergency have come
                forward and lent their savings. But when those two sources are exhausted there is
                obviously a real shortage of money in the community, and, if additional funds are
                needed for war or for developmental purposes in peace-time, it is the duty of the
                Government to provide those funds through the Commonwealth Bank, which is the
                people&#39;s bank. That is the only institution through which money or credit should
                be issued. Everywhere in this country and in other countries there has been an
                awakening of the people, a desire for more knowledge and a realization that
                something is wrong with present financial methods. The people want to know why this
                debt structure has been built, why developmental works cannot be undertaken, why
                nothing can be done unless we borrow money or raise it in some way which makes it a
                debit on the community. In the march of progress I have looked to this Government
                for a change of policy in that respect, but there has been little movement in the
                desired direction, although the Government has admitted that money can be created.
                There has been an issue of new money. We .do not know how much. The Government says
                that it is not good for us to know. But this is a democracy, and the people have the
                right to know how much new money has been issued by the Commonwealth Bank or by the
                trading banks and what are the terms and conditions upon which it has been issued.
                We know that it is admitted that money can be issued in this way. Some years ago, as
                was well stated by the Leader of the Opposition, this was denied vehemently from
                every platform by the then Opposition, and the people were inclined to believe it.
                Now that story will not &#34;go over&#34;. The Government will be very lucky if it
                still &#34;goes over &#34;. &#34;We must protect our economic structure and Ave must
                wage this war with all of the material resources at our disposal. We must back our
                men with the fullest equipment possible. There must be no repetition of the tragic
                events which marked the Greek and Crete campaigns. Our soldiers, and men of all
                arms, who, with their dependants, have made ali the sacrifices, should not have to
                come back and shoulder an immense burden of debt that has been artificially created.
                If that were the result, I would say that democracy was a sham. But I am optimistic
                ; I am hopeful. The people are awake. They believe that great changes are imminent
                That is why I look to the policy enunciated by the Leader of the Opposition and
                those who have led the party before him. On the theories that they have enunciated
                rests the hope, not only for the successful termination of this war, but also for
                the reconstruction to follow. There should be no more depressions in a land such as
                we have, with abundance for everybody. I was amazed when I heard the arguments
                adduced by Ministers who twitted the Leader of the Opposition about how he would
                find the extra money with which to increase the rate of invalid and old-age
                pensions, and raise the pay of soldiers immediately and not in the future when the
                payments would form some part of the debt structure. Actually, we have a
                superabundance of food and clothing. It is false economy and a false assumption to
                say that by cheese-paring and by taking money from people in the lower income groups
                we shall assist the war effort in any way. Such a policy can result only in a
                reduction of the standard of living of the people. It will not help the war effort
                one iota. </para>

            chamber on many occasions the serious difficulties of the primary producers and the
            depressed condition of country towns. We have had. very little relief. The present
            policy has been continued, although we have had many promises that there would be a
            change. The Treasurer, in his budget speech, indicated that a mortgage bank would be
            established at some time in the future. The position of the primary producers is so
            acute that they want a mortgage bank established at once. It can be provided, and the
            Deputy Leader of the Opposition stated that it will be provided if the Labour party
            attains office. That assurance is very comforting to me and to my constituents, and it
            will be good news to all those living in rural districts throughout Australia. To sum
            up, I do not like the Government&#39;s financial policy. It envisages further debt, and
            in the natural course of events when the war is concluded, a contraction of finance is
            likely to occur as on a former occasion, and misery and suffering will follow. The
            people do not want those conditions. In order to avoid them, Australia must have a
            government which will take appropriate action. For those reasons I shall support the
            amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. What the result will be, whether a
            general election will be held, or whether another government will take office without an
            appeal to the country, are matters upon which I cannot speak. The responsibility lies
            with the Governor-General. To me, it is immaterial because, in view of the issue, I
            consider that a change must be made in order to ensure stable and safe government for
            the effective prosecution of the war, the post-war reconstruction of the country and the
            repatriation of soldiers. In the circumstances, let us ask the people to decide which
            party will govern the country. I shall be satisfied with their verdict. </para>
          <para>My position in the House has been one of heavy responsibility, but that has not been
            of my seeking. It was an accident of the last general election that I should have been
            so placed as to hold the balance between the Government and Opposition parties in this
            chamber. My sympathies have always been to a considerable degree with the Labour party.
            The platform of the party to which I belong in Victoria is not far removed from many of
            the major points in the policy of the Labour party. If Labour should take office I am
            prepared to give it my fullest co-operation in order to implement the policy that its
            representatives have enunciated during this debate. </para>

            <para>.- Members of the Australian Imperial Force in beleagured Tobruk and in Egypt will
              be greatly heartened by the crocodile tears which have been shed by people who, three
              months after the declaration of war, stated that they would not despatch one man from
              Australia to fight for the Empire. Do honorable members believe that the garrison at
              Tobruk will be happy to learn that their destinies lie in the hands of those people?

              <para>- Definitely he did. The truth is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
                  Cullen</inline> was for several years elected as State president of the
                Wheat-growers and Wool-growers Association of Victoria. Leaving his own property, he
                worked for the wheatgrowers to his own financial disadvantage and achieved more for
                them than has any honorable member sitting on the opposite side of the chamber. He
                was elected as federal president, and was nominated by the Victorian Wheatgrowers
                Association, and the New South Wales Bulk Wheat Handling Association for a position
                on the Australian Wheat Board. He was selected not because he was a friend of the
                Government - as a matter of fact he attacked the Government on many occasions - but
                because the wheat-growers of Australia were anxious that he should occupy that
                position because of the good work he had done for them. The Deputy Leader of the
                Opposition should be manly enough to apologize for making such an unfair statement.

              <para>- In their solicitude for the men in the fighting forces honorable members
                opposite remind me of the iguana, commonly known as the goanna, which covers its
                prey with slime before devouring it. When Labour assumed office for a short period
                after the last war it abandoned the policy of preference to returned soldiers; but
                there was such resentment throughout the length and breadth of the country that they
                had not the courage to stand up to their action and withdrew their threat. Honorable
                members opposite are not prepared to say to-day that they favour preference to
                soldiers who return from the present war. Whatever may have been the sins of
                omission or commission of this Government, it has at least given preference to
                returned soldiers in appointments made to the Public Service. I can assure honorable
                members that our soldiers will not be delighted at the prospect of a Labour
                Government assuming office in this country. Some honorable members opposite are
                sincere in their efforts to help the members of the fighting forces, but what can be
                said of such leaders as the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold"
                  >(Mr. Rosevear),</inline> who would bring our men overseas back to Australia, or
                the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
                  Beasley)</inline> who would shift them a little nearer to Australia where the
                danger is not so acute? What must all patriotic Australians think of the Leader of
                the Opposition who proposed that no Australian soldier should be sent abroad to
                fight in defence of the Empire? The honorable member cannot deny that he made such a
                proposal because it is recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> If
                the honorable gentleman had his way he would prevent Australia from supporting the
                Mother Country which has guarded us for over 150 years. I shall not support any
                government which includes in i t*i ministry a man of that type. </para>

            <para>. - I shall not require very many minutes to say the little that I have to say in
              regard to the budget. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
                Curtin)</inline> proposed as an amendment, &#34; That the first item be reduced by
              &#163;1 &#34; so that the budget may be recast; but he gave the committee no
              indication as to the direction in which it should be recast. Many honorable members
              expressed surprise at the failure of the Leader of the Opposition to tell the
              committee what he thought should be done to a budget which he said was wrongly cast. I
              have had the experience for many years of hearing similar amendments moved by those
              opposing the Government, but in the past the mover of such a motion has always
              indicated the lines on which improvements might be effected. To-day, however, the
              Leader of the Opposition does not tell the country by what means he would raise the
              necessary revenues to replace the loss occasioned by the rejection of that part of the
              Government&#39;s financial proposals which it was claimed would impose too great a
              burden on certain sections of the community. In refraining from stating how he
              proposed to bridge the gap the honorable gentleman was exercising a wise discretion.
              Apparently, with the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
                Coles)</inline> honorable members opposite have no interest in the budget.
              Apparently the main concern of the honorable member for Henty was not whether the
              budget was wisely drafted or otherwise, but that we should have a new Government. I
              propose to make one or two brief remarks about those aspects of the budget to
              &#34;which the Leader of the Opposition took exception. In the first place he objected
              to the deferred pay of soldiers being increased by ls. a day, claiming that the active
              pay should be increased immediately. That would have a popular appeal in Sydney,
              Melbourne, and other big cities to-day, and undoubtedly it would be tremendously
              popular in Cairo and other places where our soldiers abroad are enjoying a brief
              respite from the horrors of war. Honorable members opposite want soldiers to go
              through Melbourne and Sydney when they are on leave, as we did in. great numbers
              before divisions of the Australian Imperial Force went overseas in the last waT. The
              soldiers of to-day are still doing so, though in smaller numbers. Of course, this
              would be in the interests of the picture theatres, the breweries, and the many other
              establishments which sell trinkets and rubbish to people who have lots of money to
              spend - the sort of places which advertise &#34; nothing over 2s. 6d. &#34;, and sell
              nothing worth 6d&#187; These people do not want the soldiers to obtain their money in
              the form of deferred pay. The Leader of the Opposition has objected to the budgetary
              provision for compulsory loans or &#34; postwar credits &#34;. He wants the people to
              have their money now, so that the big city interests may obtain all the profits that
              they can from the people who, in these times, spend all the money that they can get.
              Honorable gentlemen opposite, who are always talking about the evils perpetrated by
              vested interests and profiteers, are always on the side of the profiteers. That is why
              they object to deferred payments for soldiers, and compulsory loans repayable after
              the war. I say deliberately, in the interests of the soldiers, that I support the
              deferred pay proposals, and that I would not support the making of additional payments
              in any other way. Every soldier who is worth calling a soldier will support this view,
              and every person in the country will agree that it is far better to put a few pounds
              aside now than to have it taken away in direct taxes. </para>

          <para>Of course, it does not matter to me personally how the honorable member for Henty
            casts his vote. That is his business. But he must remember that, when he casts a vote to
            put the Opposition as it is to-day constituted into power, he casts a vote with people
            who he knows are anti-British in their sympathies. </para>

              <para>- If the Chair asks me to withdraw I shall, but I shall not do so merely at the
                request of the Leader of the Opposition, who apparently thinks that he must protect
                those honorable members on his own side who he knows have no sympathy with himself,
                his leadership, or his point of view. I think that I am entitled to make these few
                remarks concerning the honorable member for Henty. I should not have referred to
                this matter, had he not spoken about the change of leadership in the United
                Australia party. I consider that the Committee and the country should be informed
                that no. honorable member did as much as did the honorable member for Henty to
                belittle, undermine, and ridicule the leadership of the right honorable member for
                Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies).</inline> The honorable gentleman
                took every opportunity to say that we could never have a united war effort whilst
                the right honorable member for Kooyong remained leader of the United Australia
                party. That statement was made over and over again by the honorable member for
                Henty, right from the time of his return from his visit to England last year. In
                fact it is not too much to say that the honorable gentleman took every opportunity
                to denounce the leadership of the right honorable member for Kooyong. </para>

                I make these statements because I think that the Committee and the country should
                know the facts. What the honorable member for Henty does is, of course, his own
                affair, but I consider it quite proper to intimate that the honorable gentleman was
                responsible for this little bit of disunity. The honorable gentleman has said to-day
                that he believes that we would get a better war effort if another government assumed
                office. I can only hope that with his support we shall be able to make a more
                successful war effort. </para>

            <para>- Gymnasium equipment for physical training purposes is provided from public funds
              in accordance with a prescribed scale. That scale includes the provision of boxing
              gloves according to the establishment of personnel on the station. The cost of
              gymnasium equipment in excess of the authorized scale is financed from profits on
              canteens, cinemas and other service institutes. At AirForce stations where boxing
              competitions are organized by the recreation clubs, the hempen square and other
              accessories are usually improvised by utilizing any departmental materials that may be
              available, supplemented by purchases from the non-public funds referred to. </para>
