                    <para>. - Honorable members will have learned of the air crash in northern Queensland yesterday, which unfortunately resulted in the loss of three lives - those of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charles</inline> Hardy, a former member of the Senate, who was recently engaged on Commonwealth defence work; Lieutenant-Colonel Miller, Director of Works, Department of the Army; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cohen,</inline> the pilot, of the ill-fated aircraft. Honorable members will, I feel sure, wish me to express deep sympathy with the relatives of those who lost their lives in this tragic occurrence. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>It is appropriate that I make special reference to the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hardy,</inline> who was very well known to many members of this House. The late gentleman served as a senator from 1932 to 1938, and was Leader of the Country party in that chamber from October, 1935, to June, 1938. </para>
                <para>
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hardy</inline>
                    saw active service during the last war.  His  enlistment soon after he had reached his eighteenth year was typical of the enthusiasm that he subsequently displayed in his public life.
                </para>
                <para>It will be remembered that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hardy</inline> founded, in 1931, the Riverina . Movement, the object of which was the recognition of that area as a new State. It was at the general elections held during the latter part of that year that he was elected to the Senate. </para>
                <para>Charles Hardy was an able, energetic and patriotic man, and his death at the early age of 42 years has caused a real loss to this country. He had many friends in this Parliament, and was widely respected for his sincerity and capacity for work. He gave his services to the Commonwealth in an honorary capacity in connexion with certain important aspects of defence works, and it was while travelling in the course of those official duties that he met his death. We aregrateful to him for his valuable  public work, and for the zeal that he displayed in the service of the people of this country.  His  death is a particularly sad blow to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Hardy</inline> and her sons. 1 move - </para>
                <para>That this House expresses its deep regret at the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charles</inline> Hardy, a former member of .the Senate, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service, and tenders its heartfelt sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement. </para>

                    <para>. - I second the motion, with, I am certain that every honorable member will believe, the very deepest regret. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hardy</inline> served in this Parliament, and was a familiar figure to honorable members of this House. The remarks of the right honorable the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> concerning his patriotism are, I believe, a just appreciation of his outlook as a man. He was imbued with the desire to be of service to Australia. He interested himself in the promotion of principles which he thought, if applied, would be of value in the political structure of this country. Although he was not re-elected to the Senate at the expiration of his first term of office, he yet found at the outbreak of war that it was impossible for him, because of his nature, to proceed quietly with his own affairs; consequently, he offered his services in an honorary capacity for use by the Government wherever the employment of his talents might be of value. I know that he was engaged in very important work connected with the general plan of Australian defence. With two other members of the fighting forces of this country, he yesterday met his death. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Charles Hardy worked conscientiously for Australia, and I state' a simple truth when I say that he died in the service of Australia. That there are men of his disposition in this country makes us feel very humble, and that there are so many of them makes us also feel proud. I offer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Hardy</inline> and her sorrowing children the deepest sympathy of every member of the Opposition - a sympathy in which, I am confident, the whole of Australia shares. </para>

                    <para>- T associate the Country party with the sentiments that have been bo fervently expressed. The tragic and untimely death of ex-Senator Charles Hardy was a severe shock to me, because he and I were personal friends. Only on Wednesday of last week I had a long conversation with him prior to his departure for north Queensland. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The late Charles Hardy served Australia with distinction, not only in the Senate but also during the Great War of 1914-1S. As he was only 42 years of age at the time of his death, it is obvious that he was a very young man during that conflict.  His  sole desire was to serve Australia in any capacity. After his defeat for the Senate he did not dissociate himself from the Country party movement - with which he had been, identified for the previous six years - but kept in touch with its policy and its views, and gave very valuable cooperation in respect of the rural problems of Australia.  His  loss is a serious one in the critical times through which we are passing. I join in conveying sympathy to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Hardy</inline> and to the two beautiful boys who have been left to mourn the loss of a fond father. He set for them an example which will sustain and guide them throughout their lives. </para>

The report did, however, contain some adverse comments on the evidence which <inline font-weight="bold">Major Rigney</inline> had given before the commission; it stated that he had given unsatisfactory evidence in an endeavour to protect his subordinates. Caustic comment was made on some portions of the evidence, and the commissioner stated that he was not wholly convinced that the state of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Rigney's</inline> health, which was admittedly bad at the time, could be. regarded as entirely responsible. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but stated that he was not motivated by personal considerations, but by a desire to get the best deal for the Army. The utmost that can bc said against him is that his earlier evidence was unsatisfactory; upon the circumstances of his bankruptcy the commissioner made little comment. The position of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Rigney</inline> is different from that of the other men involved. I have given direction that they should be dealt with immediately, but I am informed that they are entitled to be tried by court-martial. My own view is that they should be dealt with without delay, and I am having further inquiries made into the position. </para>

                        <para>- Has the Cabinet given consideration to the acute shortage of tobacco which, in the opinion of many people, is growing more serious? Is the Government aware that several tobacconists in Sydney and Melbourne claim that they will be compelled to cease trading in cigars, cigarettes, tobacco and papers for making cigarettes if supplies are not made available very soon? Is the Government also aware that inquiries reveal that tins of cigarettes are practically unobtainable in those cities? </para>

                            <para>- As long ago as 1911, seepages of oil were discovered in New Guinea, and in 1918 the Federal Government expended in the territory approximately £400,000 in a quest for oil. Extensive boring operations are now being undertaken. Recently I visited a district where a bore had been sunk to a depth of 3,500 feet, progress being at the rate of approximately 70 feet a day. Although many people appear to think that the Government has taken no steps to search for oil, such a view is unfounded, because considerable sums have been expended in this direction. Replying recently to a question similar to that asked by the honorable member for East Sydney, I mentioned that a certain company is seeking permission to explore the uncontrolled area. We have a special obligation to the nativesin the territory, and until the region is brought under control by the administration, white men will not be allowed to enter it. I see no reason to alter that rule. </para>

                            <para>- Did the Minister for External Territories see any evidence of feeling between the white residents of New Guinea and the natives while he was on his recent visit to the Territory? I understand that after the murder of a white woman by a native there has been a strong reaction against the natives. </para>

                            <para>- I ask the Minister for Social Services whether it is a fact that allotments made to relatives of members of the Australian Imperial Force are not taken into account by the Pensions Department when considering applications for invalid or old-age pensions, whereas payments made on behalf of members of the Militia Forces, or other home-service units, are treated as income. If this be so, is the honorable gentleman prepared to place the relatives of members of all forces on the same basis ? </para>

The chairmen of the committees were communicated with. The  chairman  of the Profits Committee, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer,</inline> has advised that a copy of the transcript is in the hands of the secretary of the committee and that that copy may be inspected by any honorable member upon application to the secretary. The evidence given before the Man-power and Resources Survey Committee was given <inline font-style="italic">in camera</inline> and, therefore, cannot be available for inspection. The  chairman  of the Social Security Committee, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Perkins,</inline> states that, if it be considered desirable, a proof copy of the evidence can be laid on the table of the Library.

The question dealt with an instruction issued by the Treasury to the Postmaster-General's Department to ignore the concessional allowance for all except the first child under the age of sixteen years in any family when deducting taxation instalments from the salaries of the department's employees. The answer stated that no such Treasury instructions had been issued. I am now in possession of Treasury Circular No. 9, which states distinctly that the course which I have mentioned shall be taken by the department. A Treasury circular has also been issued to the  Clerk  of the House of Representatives instructing him to take similar action against honorable  members of this House. </para>

                        <para>- The committee's recommendations with regard to technical training do not come within the province of my department ; they relate to the work of the Department of Labour and National Service. However, I am already giving some attention to the proposals for the use of small factories for munitions production, and I propose to give the subject a great deal more attention in the future. They come primarily under the charge of the Minister for Munitions, through the Area Boards of Management in the different States, but, as they must be related to the war organization of industry, I am conferring with the Minister for Munitions with a view to securing his collaboration in the consideration of the problem. Many other subjects have been mentioned in the two early reports of the Man-power and Resources Survey Committee, and I intend to give attention in the near future to such of them, as relate to the work of my department. </para>

                    <para>.- I compliment the members of the Government parties upon their devotion to duty, as is evidenced, by the large attendance in the chamber to ensure the passing of this motion. I do not know whether the Opposition refused to grant pairs, but presumably supporters of the Government are anxious to hasten into recess at the earliest possible moment so that to-morrow they may attend to other matters of minor importance outside the chamber. Nobody else will be permitted to attend, and speculation is rife as to what will happen. At any rate, I shall be a disinterested onlooker in the National Capital until the fates have decided what is in store for those who are Ministers, those who hoped to be Ministers but were not so fortunate, and those who still have hopes of achieving Cabinet rank. All that reposes in the lap of the gods. </para>

                <para>Turning now to more important matters than the prospects of individual members of Parliament for ministerial appointment, I desire  to  refer  to  several subjects that are causing great concern  to  some  of  my constituents and  to  the community generally. Earlier to-day, I asked the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> why certain producers were not given representation upon the Dairy Produce Control Committee and the Priority Dairy Products Committee. The  Minister  replied that the members  of  those bodies were representative  of  the producers. For the information of  the  right honorable gentleman I  shall read a portion of a letter that I have received from the secretary of the Victorian Dairymen's Association. He wrote to me because the head-quarters of the organization is situated in my electorate. The letter reads - </para>

                    <para>My association, representative of the dairy farmer producers of Victoria and the Primary Producers' Union of New South Wales, two organizations with a farmer membership of 27,000 have made repeated representations to the Minister for Commerce, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Earle</inline> Page, for producer representation upon the control committee and all other committees set up to control the dairying industry, and so far we have not succeeded. </para>

I wish that he would extricate himself occasionally, because he is usually most attentive to my requests. I have complained to him about the action of the Assistant Director of Medical Services in Victoria in calling up for compulsory military service certain doctors in the age groups. One of them, who is a highly qualified practitioner, has a large industrial practice, is an honorary surgeon at a leading Melbourne hospital, is a lecturer in one of the colleges, and is very well regarded in the profession. 1 have suggested that, because of his engagements, and because he is a gynaecologist and an obstetrician, he should be exempt from military service. </para>

                        <para>- Definitely, he has no partner.  His  part-time assistant qualified as a doctor at the last supplementary examinations, and, as a result, failed to obtain appointment as a resident at one of the leading hospitals. The doctor employs him as a clinical clerk. The doctor does not permit him, on account of his inexperience, to attend surgical cases or confinements. My suggestion is that medical officers should be divided into " reserved " and " non-reserved " classes. Every specialist should not be required to enter camp simply because he belongs to a certain age group.  His  value to the community should be weighed before he is called up for military service. Many young doctors, who are doubtless good general practitioners, could be obtained for the Army, but highly-qualified men, some of whom studied in London, or pursued higher studies in Melbourne and other Australian universities, can render better service to the community by remaining in civil practice. In. the early months of the war many more doctors were in camp than were required. After the sick parade each morning they had nothing to do for nearly 24 hours. There is a serious shortage of medical men, and I am not prepared to take the word of some of the older doctors as to who should go to camp and who should stay in their practices. Many of them have been out of practice for years, and ought not to be in military positions to-day. I hope that, during the brief period for which he will be permitted to remain in office, the Minister for the Army will carry out something in the nature of a purge on the medical side of the military establishment. I am not at all impressed by the fact that a letter has been sent by the secretary of the British Medical Association in Victoria to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alan</inline> Newton, a leading Melbourne surgeon, who gives a judgment against my doctor constituent, because the decision is based on wrong premises. If the Minister will reconsider the application for exemption and act fairly and courageously, as he generally does with regard to matters brought to his notice, I think that he will grant the desired exemption. </para>

                <para>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Development to take action against the Liquid Fuel Control Board in Victoria on a matter concerning its general administration. I am not referring to the allotment of petrol ration tickets or to related matters, but to the control of the staff which is employed by it and to the board's attitude to the organization which desires to make representations to it on behalf of the staff. I have a copy of a letter which the secretary of the Victorian Public Service Association, of which I was one time  president,  has forwarded to the Minister for Supply and Development <inline font-weight="bold">("Senator McBride)</inline> in which the charge i.= made that the board has refused to receive representations by this organization regarding the salaries and conditions of employment of the staff. In refusing to recognize the association as competent to speak on behalf of the employees, the board is claiming a right which is denied to employers of labour generally. Such bodies as this association have every right to organize employees, for, by that means, industrial peace is maintained. The board has no reason for refusing to permit the association either to organize or make representations on behalf of its staff. A unique situation is brought about by the fact that the salaries, sick leave and recreation leave of many members of the staff are entirely unsatisfactory, and the association claims that the staff should be treated in these matters in the same manner as officers who are at present permanently employed under the Commonwealth Public Servce  Act. That is quite a reasonable claim, but the board desires to be a law unto itself. Like a great many more of the boards with which we are plagued, this board could well be abolished, but while it administers some law or regulation, the Minister in charge of it should see that the Victorian Public Service Association is allowed to make representations to it, that it receives those representations, and that it grants conditions of employment equal to those of other Commonwealth employees. I have been asked to see that steps are taken  immedately  to bring the salaries and conditions of the employees into line with those of other Commonwealth administrations. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time granted.]</inline></para>

                    <para>We are still in camp. Am having my teeth attended to, lost bottom set when ship -went down. Still short of clothes and until I get some I cannot go on leave. Some of the lads went on leave without permission and the Colonel has handed them all 28 days. I might mention that as well as 28 days in clink, you lose 28 days' pay. I thought he was a bit tough, seeing the lads had no leave for six months and had been through three campaigns. Troops are only getting one or two days' leave and very little of it. Of course the officers, including the Colonel, have seven days. In fact it was the day after he arrived back from his seven days that he handed out the 28 days. Still things may even up some day. I might mention my pal " Slim " took three days and he fronts to-morrow. It's guineas to gooseberries on 28. </para>
                    <para>A lot of funny things happen in these wars that I don't agree with. Without mentioning anything of a military nature, it is with regard to losses in Greece. I lost everything, from a gold watch (a present) and blade razor, clothes - right down to my false teeth. I get nothing. Officers who only lost the same as the troops, with perhaps the exception of their valise that they sleep in, received £27 to replace their lost property. I am still practically naked. Officers left their trunks and cases in Alexandria before they left for Greece. They arrived the next day and they are O.K. The lads left their sea kit bags there, with some gear in them. They have not arrived and nobody seems to give a hang when they do. </para>

                <para class="block">I ask , the Minister for the Army to take notice of that letter. It is unfair discrimination if officers receive an allowance with which to replace losses, and privates nothing. It is also unfair that men after three campaigns are confined to barracks for 28 days and lose pay for that period, because, having had no leave for six months, they take leave. I hope that the fines will be remitted and that something will be done to ensure that men shall be given reasonable leave. I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the statements in that letter, but I know the writer, and he is a man who tells the truth. I hope that when we meet again, there will be no further cause for complaints such as I have made to-day. </para>

                    <para>. - I bring to the notice of the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> a dispute in the textile industry which threatens to develop into a major stoppage of work, with serious effects on production of articles required in the prosecution of the war. I have nothing to say about the merits or demerits of the dispute. My reason for rising is to solicit the aid of the Minister in inducing the employers to accede to the request of the employees for a round-table conference. When I was handling industrial matters with the Chamber of Manufactures, SirRobert Gibson and I never refused each other a conference, and we used to do everything possible, not only to settle disputes amicably, but also to avert them. The Chamber of Manufactures seems to have forgotten that conciliation is a part of its constitution, because it has refused to meet the representatives of the employees at a conference. I now suggest to the Minister that he agree to meet me and two or three representatives of the employees in Melbourne with a view to his assisting them in their desire for a round-table conference with the employers in order that conciliation may replace direct action. </para>

                <para>On the 22nd August the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell),</inline> raised the question of the bona fides of Vestey's Limited, in handling the eggdrying process for the Commonwealth Government on behalf of the producers of eggs in this country. He implied that there was something sinister about the whole undertaking. Far from that being so, the Commonwealth Government, and every producer of eggs in Australia, is indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bowater,</inline> the general manager in Australia of the company, and to the company itself, for making available to the Commonwealth at shortnotice egg-drying plants which were about to be erected in China. Before the war, Australia exported about 12,000 tons of refrigerated eggs each year, but as the result of shipping restrictions the British Government, intimated that space could not be found for eggs in refri gerated form on ships trading with England, and that the only way in which eggs could be shipped was in dried form as ordinary cargo. The Commonwealth Government was also told that the maximum space which could be allotted to eggs was about 1,000 tons. The Government immediately endeavoured to arrange for the drying of eggs in Australia this year. At first it seemed to be impossible to get the plants ready in time, owing to the enormous demands of the Department of Supply in respect of munitions. It was thought that we should be fortunate if we could establish in Australia one plant to handle one-tenth or one-twelfth of the supply of eggs. Fortunately, the Government was able to arrange for Vestey's Limited to transfer to Australia, plants intended for use in China; it .also arranged for shipping space to enable the plants to be brought here. We had to get the plants as quickly as possible and also specialists with experience of the egg-drying  process. The result is that we have been able to establish six of these plants in Sydney, and four in Melbourne. In addition, we have persuaded the British Government to provide  sufficient  refrigerated space to enable the eggs produced in South Australia and Western Australia -to be exported. It was not found practicable to erect egg-drying plants in those States. In the light of these facts, the statements which have been made regarding Vestey's Limited are to be deprecated. I assure the honorable member for Melbourne that his charges are without foundation. Had it not been for the timely assistance of Vestey's Limited we could not have shipped eggs to Britain. I point out, further, that Vestey's Limited merely process the eggs; at all times the legal possession of the eggs remains with the Commonwealth Government. The assistance afforded by this company has been of inestimable value to the poultry farmers of Australia, whose industry has been saved from destruction. </para>

The Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Foll)</inline> states that he has no record of the wasteful use of cars by Ministers. Cars have been made available to Ministers to enable them to carry out their ministerial duties and responsibilities. It will be appreciated that Ministers, by virtue of the offices they hold, are called upon to carry out many important functions in connexion with which the use of cars is essential. Moreover, the high pressure at which Ministers must work, particularly in view of the present international position, renders it necessary that cars be used. </para>

                <para>The use of cars is not confined to Commonwealth Ministers. Ministers of State governments also are compelled to use oars to enable them satisfactorily to carry out their duties; in some cases cars and chauffeurs are specially allotted to individual State Ministers. The Commonwealth chauffeurs work under a roster system, which provides that each driver will have an opportunity to earn any overtime that may be necessary in driving ministerial cars. All costs in connexion with the use of ministerial cars are debited to one vote in the Department of the Interior. Recently the honorable member stated that a minister sent a car from Melbourne to Brisbane in order to bring his wife back to Canberra. No record can be found in the Department of the Interior of any such trip. </para>

                    <para>. - In a recent speech allegations concerning conditions at the Richmond Aerodrome were made. I take this opportunity to reply to those allegations which an investigation has shown to be substantially without foundation. The official report furnished to me indicates that the statements made by the honorable gentleman were due to some misunderstanding of the position actually obtaining at Richmond station. At no time did a "sit-down" strike occur at Richmond. The commanding officer, upon receiving information that certain men who were dissatisfied with the hours of work, were attempting to induce the men of No. 2 Aircraft Depot to hold a "sitdown" strike, promptly called a conference of all unit commanders. In order to maintain the maximum output from No. 2 Aircraft Depot, which is a vital link in the maintenance of flying at flying training schools, the men had been granted two days' leave a fortnight. After full consideration, the commanding officer decided to alter the hours of work in order to enable the men to have three days' leave a fortnight. This, of course, was distinct from, and in addition to the normal four days' quarterly recreation leave granted to all non-flying members of the service. The commanding officer did, in fact, address the men on parade, and stressed the necessity for each one to do his utmost in the present struggle. He informed them, as he had done on other occasions, of the correct manner of bringing any complaints to official notice, and assured them that complaints so made would receive prompt and full investigation and that remedial action would be taken, if justified. With regard to the reference to periods of leave, no Air Board instruction was addressed specifically to Richmond that the men were to have four days' leave, later increasing the period to five days. The general policy, as laid down by the Air Board, is that nonflying personnel shall be granted four days' quarterly leave if the exigencies of the Service permit. It is thought that the reference must have been to this policy, and not to any specific instruction issued to Richmond. As I have already stated, no such instruction was issued, and the week-end leave which was referred to is distinct and additional to normal quarterly recreational leave. The decision to grant three days' week-end leave a fortnight has been adhered to, and I am advised that the whole of the men's leave was not cancelled as alleged, either because some of the men desired to catch a particular train or for any other reason. The honorable gentleman's statement that men were marched backwards and forwards three or four times in the rain, owing to their having hurried to avoid the rain, is also without foundation, according to the investigations that have been made. Furthermore, the report shows that at no time did the commanding officer have occasion to march the men, although he was at times present at parades when the men were marched by their unit commanders. The honorable gentleman also referred to the entraining of personnel at Clarendon station. The official report in this connexion confirms that no order was issued that airmen were not to walk upon the platform at Clarendon railway station until the officers had entered the railway carriages. Owing to the fact that one man had been injured, and another had fallen between a moving train and the platform, due to the men rushing to board the train, the commanding officer issued an order that personnel were to parade on .the platform, and not move to the carriages until trains had stopped. This order proved to be ineffective, as it was found that, notwithstanding the order, men still endeavoured to board the trains before they had stopped. For their own protection, the commanding officer then ordered that the men were to " fall in " off the station platform and wait under the control of noncommissioned officers until the train had stopped, when they would be allowed to board the train. Before that order was issued, a request was received from the stationmaster at Windsor that action be taken to stop the men from boarding moving trains. There is a militia camp in the vicinity of the Clarendon station, and the militia authorities have been requested to co-operate with the Air Force when large batches of men are about to board trains. Those authorities have given an assurance that they will adhere to a practice similar to that of the Air Force. This procedure would not, however, apply when only small batches of men were to entrain. The suggestions that the commanding officer had ordered men not to board trains until officers had done so is not confirmed by fact. It is regretted that the honorable gentleman made certain disparaging statements concerning the commanding officer. I have no hesitation in assuring honorable members that that officer, Group Captain Wilson, enjoys the full confidence of the Air Board. That is evidenced by his recent transfer to a higher command with increased responsibilities. While he was at Richmond, he took a keen interest in promoting and fostering the welfare of the personnel serving at that station. </para>

                    <para>The answer given to the honorable member's questions last Friday contained no misstatement, and does not call for any action. The honorable member is obviously confusing the matter of the collection of income tax by instalments with the matter of the liability for payment of tax when the latter is definitely established by the issue of an assessment notice. The reply made in the House last Friday definitely admitted there was a Treasury instruction issued relating to the collection of the tax by instalments, but no Treasury instruction issued regarding the assessment or computation of the tax which would in due course be notified strictly in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>I also take this opportunity to reply to points raised by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley),</inline> and the honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> regarding the deduction of tax instalments from Public Service salaries. They challenged the right of the Minister, in the issue of a Treasury instruction, to take into account the proposed decrease of concessional deductions under the Income Tax Assessment Act for the purpose of income taxation for 1941-42. The basic consideration in connexion with this matter relates to the arrangements, which were discussed in this House, for financing the Commonwealth child endowment scheme. Honorable members will recall that the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt),</inline> when introducing the child endowment legislation in this House, set out very clearly that finance was to be provided by means of a <inline font-style="italic">2£</inline> per cent, pay-roll tax, from which a return of £9,000,000 was anticipated, and that more than £2,000,000 would be derived from the abolition of the income tax deductions for each child under sixteen years of age, after the first, in each family. The balance of the £13,000,000 involved in the scheme was to come from general revenue. There was never any doubt in my mind, nor, I suggest, in the minds of honorable members and the general body of taxpayers, that the abolition of the exemption provided in the Taxation Act for dependent children in  excess of one was being more than offset - except in the higher ranges of income - by the amount of £13 per annum that was to be paid as endowment in respect of such children. Referring now to the Treasury instruction to Commonwealth paying officers to take this proposed reduction for children into account in arranging the tax instalment deductions for public servants, I point out that, whereas, for the majority of salary and wage-earners, the act and regulations provide for a certain deduction to be made on the basis of the gross salary or wages - to meet which employers purchase tax stamps and hand them to their employees - there is a provision in section 221k of the Income Tax Assessment Act for group schemes to be arranged with the Commissioner of Taxation for cash deductions to be made in lieu of the utilization of stamps. These group schemes for tax deductions generally facilitate the work of the paying officer in large industries and government departments, and have been introduced mainly for the purpose of making it easier for the taxpayer to meet his taxation obligations. There is no doubt in my mind that the group schemes effectively contribute to that result. They also tend to bring about economies in the pay sections of the various departments. There is a further power in section 221d of the Income Tax Assessment Act to vary the amounts of the instalments in order to facilitate the payment of taxes, and it is under this power that the Treasury officials have sought the Commissioner's consent to vary the basis of deductions for the group scheme as far  as  Commonwealth public servants are concerned. I stress that the arrangement to which exception is being taken relates only to Commonwealth public servants, and that, in making it, the sole desire of the Treasury officials was to assist public servants to meet their taxation obligations. The various Commonwealth departments have certain information regarding concessional deductions allowable to employees which ordinary businesses have not. In order to make the fortnightly instalment deductions approximate as closely as possible to the actual assessment of tax to be met towards the close of the financial year, the Treasury offi- cials arranged, in connexion with the 1940-41 instalment group scheme, to take these known concessional deductions into account. The deductions cover the allowances for children, superannuation payments, and life assurance. By making these deductions and calculating the instalment by reference to the net income instead of the gross income, the amount deducted from the salaries of public servants is very considerably less than that which could be deducted under the regulation. The same provisions were taken into account by the Treasury officials in working out a group scheme of instalment deductions for 1941-42; but in making the deduction for children, the Treasury officials, after having obtained my approval, limited such deductions to the first dependent child only. The consequence is that, though the instalment deduction thus calculated is slightly higher in respect of a Commonwealth public servant with more than one child, it is still a lesser amount than that which would be payable on the gross income as provided for by the regulation. </para>
                <para>Notwithstanding what has been said in this House by the honorable member for West Sydney, I have no doubt that the general body of the Commonwealth public servants are really appreciative of the Treasury officials' endeavours to ascertain as closely as possible the appropriate tax instalment deduction. In those instances where the number of children is such that, under the present law, no tax at all is payable, it is quite a simple procedure for the officer to apply to the  Deputy  Commissioner for a certificate of exemption. Such certificates would not be refused. As a matter of fact, thousands of exemption certificates have already been issued to Commonwealth public servants. I suggest that the particular aspect honorable members need to keep in mind in this connexion is the fact that the instalment deductions are distinct from the tax assessable. Later in the financial year an assessment will be made in accordance with the law as declared by this Parliament. The instalment deductions will then be applied in meeting the actual tax assessed. Whether an additional amount will then have to be paid to meet the tax assessed, or whether a small refund will be due to the taxpayer, will depend entirely upon  the approximation to the tax that has been reached in fixing the instalments. The remarks of the honorable member for West Sydney with regard to the Government robbing taxpayers of their concessional rights and of " rigging " the endowment scheme are unworthy of reply. I give a deliberate denial to the statement of the honorable member that the  Deputy  Commissioners in the various States have been given an instruction that, in making assessments of returns furnished for 1940-41, the concessional deduction for children should apply to one child only. </para>

                        <para>- It is understood that the following amounts of compensation have been paid by the owners of the lost ship to the widows of mariners who lost their lives: - Under award - To wife of master, £1,720 10s. 6d.; and to wife of mate, £1,153 10s. 6d. Under Workers Compensation Act - To wife of engineer, £800; to wife of able-bodied seaman, £800 ; and to wife of greaser, £875. The Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act was intended to provide for war accidents and losses not otherwise covered. It was not intended to provide for double compensation. The whole subject is still under consideration at present with a view to an appropriate adjustment of the matter. </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para>I desire to inform the honorable member that when the Department of Munitions was established last year it faced an enormous task of procuring large quantities of complicated items of munitions and military stores, the manufacture of which had never been attempted in Australia, and, consequently, there was no commercial counterpart to guide either the manufacturers or the department on the price aspect. In many cases, improvisation was necessary owing to the absence of the correct raw materials or components. Moreover, factories and workshops which were not set up for the production of munitions had to be reorganized on an efficient basis to enable manufacture to be undertaken. The whole of the circumstances were such that the adoption of fixed prices was quite impracticable, and would have been unfair from the contractors' point of view and also from the Commonwealth's point of view. The only manner in which a manufacturer could have covered himself against possible loss arising out of the newness of the work and the unforeseen difficulties relating to both labour and material would have been to quote a fantastic price, which would have been open to grave objection. In the circumstances surrounding the inauguration of the munitions programme, there was no alternative to the so-called cost-plus system, of which there are many variants and concerning which there are many checks. No doubt, it will be necessary to continue the cost-plus system in relation to certain contracts, but where an' effective alternative can be followed, this will be done. It is necessary to appreciate, however, that the various cases have to be decided on their merits, and the whole system has to be sufficiently flexible to cover such cases, and at the same time ensure that delay is avoided and maximum production obtained. This the Government- has accomplished. </para>
