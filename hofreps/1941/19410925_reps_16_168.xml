            <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> announced in the course of the statement that he made yesterday in connexion with the use of the fund established for a special  purpose  in February, 1940, that if there were any matters in respect of which there was need for fuller statement and explanation, the Government would be willing to set up a royal commission to conduct an investigation. I then said that, on the known  facts,  it was my view that a case had been made out that there had been a wrong use of this fund. It is quite conceivable, however, that the known facts do not disclose all of the facts. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway),</inline> with my authority, last night made it clear that the Labour party would welcome the appointment of a royal commission if, as was alleged - and the allegations are repeated to-day - all of the facts were not before the House. It is our view, of course, that on the admitted facts there was a case to justify the assertion that the fund had been put to  a  wrong use. The position to-day is, that the  Miners  Federation feels that the honour of a number of its officials may be involved, that their trustworthiness and integrity are suspect, and they ask - I think quite properly - that a royal commission should be set up in order that, where there is guilt, it shall be established, and where there is no guilt there shall be clear exoneration of those whose names are being bandied about. Without elaborating the  matter,  I ask the Prime Minister to set up a  royal  commission to investigate and  report  upon all of the circumstances associated with  expenditure  from the fund established for a special purpose in February, 1940. </para>

              <inline font-style="italic">- by leaveProbably</inline>every honorable member has read in the press that the miners have taken up the attitude that  if  this matter is not expeditiously dealt with they will bring about a general stoppage of work throughout Australia, because so many of their officials are at present under suspicion. That suspicion has been fastenedupon them by the references of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> to an alleged interview between him and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nelson</inline> and some mysterious and unidentified third person. When officials of the Miners Federation interviewed the Attorney-General last week on this matter the right honorable gentleman mentioned the third person by name. A. member of the deputation said to the Minister : &#34; Take a good look at me and say whether you have ever seen me before &#34; ; the Attorney-General replied, &#34; I am not sure; I am doubtful&#34;. The man then said to him, &#34;Well, I am the man whom you mentioned &#34;. I should like the Government to state, before the House adjourns this week, who is to be appointed to the royal commission, and what are to be the terms of reference. Those terms should be broad. We do not want any &#34; whi te-washing&#34; of the Government in connexion with the charges brought by honorable members on this side of the House. Last night I advocated the appointment of a royal commission,  but if the Government is going to delay the investigation, or allow it to be unduly protracted, I fear that there will be grave industrial unrest involving, not only the miners, but also members of other unions, because it is alleged that moneys were paid by the Australian Democratic Front to union officials other than those of the Miners Federation. </para>

          <para>Mr.BREEN. - Can the Minister for the Army inform the House whether the lack of recruitsfor the Australian Imperial Force in country districts is due to the greatly depleted, or completely vanished, reservoir of man-power in those areas? If this be so, will the honorable gentleman consider declaring the wheat belt of New South Wales exempt from the operation of compulsory military training until the new year; alternatively, will he consider establishing universal training camps in rural areas? </para>

That, I think, is approximately correct. The number of exemptions granted in respect of those engaged in rural industries is large. In one particular instance, of 140 men called up, over 100 were exempted because they were engaged in the dairying industry, and could make out a special case. </para>

            <para>- This matter has been brought under my notice by other honorable members, including the Acting Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott).</inline> The fines were imposed by a magistrate on persons charged with using wireless sets without holding licences. It is not the policy, neither is it the desire, of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department to intrude harshness into any of its activities, but it is the duty of the department to seek out those persons who illegally use wireless sets, and refuse to purchase licences. When people are found to be indulging in this illegal practice, the State magistrate, who hears the case, imposes a fine in accordance with what he considers to be the seriousness of the offence. People who have not purchased a listener&#39;s licence have no more right to use a wireless set than they have to travel in a train without a ticket. They are committing a breach of the law, and it is the duty of the Government to check up on them. Honorable members who receive complaints from rheir constituents about the harshness of fines imposed upon them should take the matter direct to the Commonwealth Attorney-General, who will deal with each case on its merits. </para>

        <para>With the concurrence of honorable members, I suggest that, in order to conserve stocks of paper, the report should not be printed this year as a parliamentary paper.

The latter body dealt with the export trade, and its functions have ceased since the outbreak of war </para>

Will the Minister also cause inquiries to be made as to whether the large numbers of motor vehicles to be seen at golf courses and beaches at the week-ends are not using petrol for pleasure purposes? </para>

            <para>- A scheme of the character mentioned has already been put in operation on the far south coast. Lengthy journeys by motor transport from, I think. Nowra to distant points on the south coast have been prohibited, goods for thatarea having to be sent by rail to the nearest point, which. I believe is on the Cooma line. The result of this is a very considerable saving of the use of petrol. Consideration is being given to the adoption of a similar course in other areas. </para>

            <para>- I am aware of the coal shortage in Victoria. There is also an acute shortage in South Australia. The position has not been caused by the retention of undue supplies to strengthen reserves in New South Wales for the reserves in that State are much smaller than they should be, having in mind the security of the country. The difficulties have arisen through the dislocation of the coal-mining industry and the consequent non-production of coal. That is the reason for the shortage of coal in Melbourne at present. We are hoping that the position will be rectified in consequence of the cessation of the strike in the South Maitland railway area. Unfortunately it will take some time to correct the acute shortage owing to difficulties in relation to shipping and to the handling of heavy parcels of coal on the railway system. </para>

            <para>. - It is my responsibility to present to honorable members the public accounts for the second year of the war, and to submit the Government&#39;s plans for financing an ever-expanding war effort. This year, war finance must dominate our financial policy more than ever. It is hardly necessary for me to remind honorable members that the real costs of war have to be met by the mobilization of our man-power and resources, and by the united efforts of all of us to supply our fighting forces with food, equipment, and munitions. This remains the central problem, whatever financial policy we adopt. Accordingly, the Government has framed its policy in order to expedite this mobilization of resources. The limits to our war effort are set by the supply of labour, materials and equipment at our disposal, and by our willingness to divert these resources, where required, to war needs. </para>

          <page.no>564</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>The revenue account for last year showed an exact balance, because the whole of the receipts, after meeting ordinary expenditure, were applied to war purposes. The amount so applied was &#163;65,091,000, an increase of &#163;3,106,000 over the budget estimate. This increase was due partly to revenue being greater than was expected, and partly to savings of non-war expenditure. </para>
        <para>On the revenue side, the budget proposals provided for increases of taxation, amounting to &#163;29,350.000. With these increases total revenue from taxation was estimated at &#163;124,575,000. Actual collections were &#163;125,384.000. Income tax yielded &#163;39,315,000, or &#163;1,815,000 above the estimate. Customs and excise revenue showed an increase of &#163;780,000 over the estimate. On the other hand war-time company tax and super tax yielded&#163;1,010,000 less than had been anticipated. The collections from sales tax and estate duties also fell short of the estimates. The total revenue from all sources amounted to &#163;150,482,000. </para>
        <para>On the expenditure side, the cost of non-war services amounted to &#163;85,391,000, or &#163;947,000 less than the estimate. </para>

        <para>When the budget was brought down, it was estimated that the war expenditure from all sources would reach &#163;186,000,000, viz., &#163;143,000,000 in Australia and &#163;43,000,000 overseas. The actual net expenditure proved to be &#163;170,000,000, of which &#163;127,000.000 was in Australia and &#163;43,000,000overseas. This was &#163;16,000,000 below the budget estimate. The actual gross expenditure, however, was &#163;181,000,000. the extra &#163;11,000,000 representing expenditure on work and supplies from Australia for other governments which was recovered during the year. In financing this war expenditure, we were fortunate to commence the year with a cash balance of &#163;28,000,000. Revenue provided &#163;65,000,000 andthe balance of &#163;77,000,000 came from loans raised during the course of the year; &#163;15,000,000 was borrowed from the British Government, and approximately &#163;62,000,000 came from loans raised in Australia. </para>

          <page.no>565</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>War finance has substantially affected the debt position during the last year. Two public loans were raised in Australia during the year, aggregating &#163;64,000,000. Of this sum, about &#163;48,000,000 was applied to war purposes and the balance of &#163;16,000,000 to Loan Council programmes. </para>
        <para>In order to encourage people to invest in Commonwealth loans, and to provide a means for subscription during the time when loans are not open, a system of advance subscriptions to loans was inaugurated in March, 1941. This arrangement has been very successful. </para>
        <para>The support of war savings certificates continued throughout the year, particularly from war savings groups in factories, shops and offices. Certificates to a face value of &#163;15,318,000 were taken up, bringing the total since the inception of the scheme to approximately &#163;23,000,000. Further interest-free loans and gifts were also received, bringing the totals to the end of June from these two sources to &#163;5,515,000 and &#163;997,000 respectively. </para>
        <para>Two large conversion operations were successfully carried out in London during the year. A loan of the States for &#163;13,470,000, due on the 1st October, 1941, was the subject of a short-term conversion offer at 3 per cent. About two-thirds of the loan was converted, and the balance was paid off by the sinking fund with assistance from the Commonwealth Bank. This paved the way for a larger operation to convert optional loans of &#163;30,000,000, representing debt of the Commonwealth and the States, carrying interest at 4&#190; per cent. and 5 per cent, per annum. The new securities were issued at. &#163;99, with an interest rate of 3&#189; per cent.; thus, the conversion will result in a saving of interest to the governments concerned of &#163;434,000 per annum. No new cash was accepted; and the Government is grateful for temporary assistance provided by the British Government, which enabled the Commonwealth Bank to take up &#163;6,500,000. worth of stock not converted. </para>
        <para>The statutory contributions from revenue for the redemption of debt by the Commonwealth and the States are being carried outon anincreasing scale. Last year &#163;12,898,000 was provided, and in the current year it is expected that &#163;14,000,000 will be available for these services. </para>
        <para>The aggregate debt of the Commonwealth and the States at the 30th June, 1941, reached &#163;1,426,000,000, being &#163;510,000,000 for the Commonwealth and &#163;916,000,000 for the States. The increase during the year was &#163;85,200,000, namely: Commonwealth &#163;74,900,000, and States &#163;10,300,000. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>I turn now to the estimates of revenue for 1941-42. On the basis of present rates of taxation, it is estimated that the total revenue from all sources will reach &#163;163,227,000, compared with actual revenue last year of &#163;150,482,000, an increase of almost &#163;13,000,000. A substantial part of this increase is explained by a new item, &#34; pay-roll tax &#34;, which was imposed to meet a portion of the cost of child endowment. This tax is estimated to yield &#163;8,000,000. </para>
        <para>In other items, allowance has been made for a full year&#39;s collections in respect of taxes which were introduced with the Budget last November. Income tax and war-time company tax are expected to yield &#163;49,050,000, or an increase of &#163;5,745,000. Substantial increases are also expected from excise and sales tax. On the other side of the picture, a sharp decline of &#163;9,000,000 is expected in customs revenue, due partly to restrictions we have imposed on non-essential imports and partly to difficulties of supply and shipping. </para>
        <para>Details of the estimated revenue are given in table 3. </para>

          <inline font-style="italic">Invalid and Old-age Pensions.</inline>
        </para>
        <para>Invalid and old-age pensions are expected to cost &#163;1,384,000 more in the current year than in 1940-41. The increased cost is mainly due to the liberalization of pensions announced in the last Budget, by which a general increase of 2s. per fortnight was granted in December, 1940, followed by a further increase of1s. per fortnight in April, 1941, because of an increase in the index of retail prices. </para>
        <para>The Government has now decided that in the payment of invalid pensions, &#163;2 10s. instead of &#163;1 10s. per week shall be considered adequate maintenance for each parent and adult dependant of a family of which a claimant for an invalid person is a member ; each child under sixteen years being taken as equivalent to half an adult. This accounts for an additional expenditure of &#163;50,000. </para>

        <para>Owing to shipping difficulties, the United Kingdom has been obliged to reduce substantially contracts for the purchase of Australian foodstuffs. This has created the need for drastic reorganization of many of our export industries. The commodities chiefly affected are meat, dairy produceand eggs. Details of the Government&#39;s reorganization schemes will be given to the House by my colleague, the Acting Minister for Commerce, but it is worthy of note here that the budget provides for substantial expenditure by the Government for the expansion of cold storage, for the re-equipment of factories to change over from the production of butter to that of cheese, and for the drying of eggs. These plans will involve the Government in expenditure, largely of a capital nature, exceeding &#163;500,000 in 1941-42. </para>
        <para>Provision is made also for an estimated loss of &#163;1,400,000 arising out of the apple and pear acquisition scheme. An amount of &#163;750,000 is provided for the estimated cost of a subsidy to rural producers in the form of a reduction of the price of superphosphate. </para>

          <page.no>566</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>TheRoyal Commission on Banking drew attention to a deficiency in our financial structure inthe lack of facilities for long-term borrowing. In 1938, a bill was introduced into the House to set up a Mortgage Banking Department of the Commonwealth Bank. The passage of the bill was delayed while the Government endeavoured to meet representations by certain State Government instrumentalitieswhich were themselves providing loans on mortgages. Before these negotiations were completed, the urgent and pressing problems of war administration fully occupied the Government&#39;s attention. </para>
        <para>The Government is, however, conscious that the problems created for rural producers by the war have increased the need for action to be taken to provide facilities for long-term borrowing. The Government proposes, therefore, to introduce, as soon as practicable, legislation to establish a mortgage bank. Although State instrumentalities are already operating in this field, the Government believes that the existence of supplemental and coordinating Commonwealth authority will give added strength to existing State in- stitutions. The development of the mortgage bank will be of a progressive character, and the extent of its development will depend to a considerable degree on war requirements being first satisfied. </para>
        <para>The Government believes that the mortgage bank will be a valuable addition to the finance facilities of rural industry, and that, when firmly established, it will provide adequatelong-term credit to sound borrowers at reasonable rates of interest. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>In 1941-42, the Government plans to spend from all sources &#163;24,000,000 on defence works, compared with an actual expenditure of &#163;18,100,000 in 1940-41. The Loan Council borrowing, including semi-government and local government, was reduced from &#163;24,000,000 in 1940-41 to a programme of &#163;20,000,000 for 1941-42. The carrying out of the works for both defence and civil purposes pro vided for in this programme will place a serious strain upon the resources available, which have already been depleted by enlistments and transfers to other war work. </para>
        <para>Reducing civil works expenditure is one of the easiest forms of diversion of resources to war as it makes no cut in civil consumption. Now that public works are not required to maintain employment, loan expenditure should be limited to works that are of defence value or are immediately and urgently necessary for civil purposes. The reduction that has been brought about by the Loan Council decision is a step in this direction. Special consideration was, however, given to the position of States in which war expenditure was relatively small. </para>
        <para>In spite of this reduction, total expenditure on public works will still exceed that of last year and will be considerably higher than in pre-war years. In 1941-42 the estimated expenditure onWorks, Defence and Loan Council, including semi-government and local government, is &#163;46,000,000, compared with an actual expenditure of &#163;45,000,000 in 1940-41, and of &#163;36,000,000 in the last pre-war year. </para>
        <para>Our war programme now requires both increasing resources and additional finance. In order to carry out this programme it will be necessary to keep civil works to a minimum, and this will require the full co-operation of State Governments and semi-governmental authorities. </para>

        <para>I now come to the crux of the budget our war proposals, and the manner in which they will be financed. </para>
        <para>Our war programme has so expanded that in the present year it will be almost double what it was in 1940-41. The full increase will not be reflected in the amount which we have to finance, because we expect to receive substantial assistance from the United States of America under the Lease-Lend Act in the form of essential war equipment which could not be produced in Australia or obtained elsewhere. Despite this assistance, the total cost of war expenditure to be budgeted for is estimated at &#163;217,000,000, compared with &#163;170,000,000 last year. </para>
        <para>Heavy expenditure must be incurred in the maintenance of our fighting forces both overseas and in Australia. We must equip and maintain additional forces now being raised. Munitions factories and annexes are now producing on a large scale, and a steadily rising flow of arms, ammunition, equipment and supplies is reaching all Services. In addition, extensive programmes of naval construction and aircraft production are in progress. These features illustrate the all-round expansion which has taken place in all phases of war activity. </para>
        <para>I am satisfied that&#39; the estimate of &#163;217,000,000 is conservative. The original estimates submitted by the Departments have been substantially reduced to avoid any risk of overstatement, and it may well be found necessary during the year to provide additional finance. </para>
        <para>In presenting the war estimates this year we have consolidated all defence and war votes in one group, which will be found in the ordinary estimates of expenditure, page 40. The subdivision as between revenue and loan is confined to totals only. This arrangement will present a clearer picture than last year, when the detailed votes were subdivided between ordinary and loan estimates. </para>

        <para>The effect of this decision may be illustrated in the case of the Australian Imperial Force. A member in Australia with less than six months&#39; service will receive1s. a day deferred pay; on completion of six months&#39; service in Australia, or on transfer to an operational station, a member will receive 2s. a day, and when serving overseas, 3s. a day. </para>

        <para>The estimate of &#163;160,000,000 of expenditure does not convey a full picture of the total war work to he performed in Australia.

It is anticipated that &#163;49,000,000 will be recovered during the year from the Governments concerned ; consequently no provision for this sum is necessary in the budget.

        <para>Overseas war expenditure is estimated at &#163;57,000,000, compared with &#163;43,000,000 in 1940-41. </para>
        <para>This &#163;57,000,000 of overseas expenditure requires finance, but for the most part it makes no call on Australian resources. The physical resources required are supplied by the United Kingdom. On the other hand, we are doing &#163;55,000,000 worth of work for other Governments&#39;, which does not require budget finance, but does make a call on our physical resources. The two amounts roughly balance, so that we are doing for Empire and Allied Governments about as much as the United Kingdom is doing for us. </para>
        <para>The work done for other Governments, taken by itself, has the same effect as our internal war expenditure in decreasing the amount of goods available for civil use in Australia. We cannot, grumble on that account when we know that other peoples are bearing a similar and rather greater burden on our account. This applies in particular to the United Kingdom, where the burden of war is now falling much more heavily than it will in Australia, even with the increased effort we are going to make in the year before us. </para>
        <para>Our capacity to finance our overseas war expenditure depends upon Australia possessing sufficient funds in London to provide the means of payment. Last year we were able to made a substantial contribution from Australian resources, but we still had to borrow &#163;15,000,000 from the United Kingdom Government. We have given the United Kingdom Government an undertaking to meet as much of our overseas expenditure as the level of our London funds permits. Last year even after providing &#163;28,000,000 for&#39; this purpose our London funds showed an appreciable increase.

          <page.no>570</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>The Government expects that the steady increase in the total level of economic activity will be maintained in 1941-42, and that this will be reflected in a further rise of the national income perhaps to &#163;1,000 millions, compared with &#163;925 millions in 1940-41 and &#163;794 millions in the last pre-war year. </para>
        <para>The Government recognizes that every effort should be made to mobilize all the available resources, so that this total can be pushed as high as the physical limits of our available labour, materials, and equipment permit. In the Department of Labour and National Service, and in the newly-established Department of War Organization of Industry, the Government has two departments which are actively co-operating to ensure that our resources shall be employed to the utmost. However effective their work, there is a limit to the total production which can be achieved, and the Government believes that our capacity will be strained to achieve the output required. </para>
        <para>National income on the one side measures the total value of the production of goods and services in the country, including Government services and the services of the fighting forces valued at cost. On the other side, with certain qualifications, it measures the amount of money available to thecommunity for spending on consumption or capital goods. The community includes, of course, all governments, institutions and companies, and the spending includes spending on war. </para>
        <para>This national income would normally have been spent by the community - by governments, companies and individuals - in satisfaction of civil needs. Last year, however, a considerable part, approximately 15 per cent., of the national production was used by the Government for war purposes. It was necessary, therefore, that the community should refrain from spending the same proportion of their total incomes so that it could be transferred to the Government. Our taxation plans provided for only a part of this transfer. The balance had to be effected by voluntary savings, namely, by the community willingly foregoing its use of resources. These savingsreachedthe Government through subscriptions to loans, war savings certificates, or indirectly through the banks. </para>
        <para>In view of the large amount of resources which had to be quickly transferred to the war effort, it was necessary for the Government to take certain steps in order to ensure that resources of a suitable nature were released from civilian employment. </para>
        <para>Public expenditure on non-war capital projects has been reduced, and, since October, 1939, private expenditure of a capital nature has been subject to direct Treasury control on the advice of the Capital Issues Board. During last year, a more stringent control has been exercised over the raising of new money for purposes not associated with the war and not urgently necessary for essential civil purposes. This control has been extended to building operations, hut all housing with the exception of purely luxury dwellings has continued to be free of restrictions. </para>
        <para>During 1940-41 restrictions on imported non-essentials have been applied to a wider range of commodities, and the use of exchange for purposes other than imports has been further limited. </para>
        <para>Because of the greatly increased savings for which these controls were partly responsible, we were able to raise from the public and the banking system without inflationary effects, loans totalling &#163;86,000,000 for war and essential civil works, including State and semigovernmental works, compared with &#163;75,000,000 in the previous year and &#163;37,000,000 in the last pre-war year. </para>
        <para>In 1941-42 the need for controls of the kinds which I have just outlined will be even greater. Of the total production represented Joy the estimate of &#163;1,000,000,000 for the national income, more than 22 per cent, will be for war purposes. Furthermore, the increase of incomes this year will be due not only to war production but also to the substantial surplus of export income over civil imports. This surplus, like the war expenditure, helps to swell incomes received  in Australia without increasing the amount of goods available for civilian spending. For both of these reasons, there will be an excess of incomes over the goods and services available for purchase by the public. </para>
        <para>This year, the excess of incomes over available goods and services is very much greater than last year, and if this is not to lead to rising prices, the public must adjust in one way or another their spending to the supply of goods available for purchase. The Government rejects the inflationary method of reducing consumption by letting prices rise faster than incomes. This means that, the Government must contemplate- (a) further increases of taxation, (b) stronger appeals for private and public economy in all expenditure not necessary for the war, and (c) stiffening and extending the controls already instituted to reduce spending. This will provide the real saving to back greatly increased government, borrowing both from the public and from the banking system. </para>

        <para>Before considering the matter of new financial measures, we should allow for what, on the basis of recent experience, might be got from the loan market. Last year, we raised a total of &#163;86,000,000, of which about &#163;60,000,000 was available for war. This total included a substantial amount from the banking system, which was justified by diversion of investments, rising total production, and increased savings. It is not necessary, at this stage, to estimate precisely what the market will yield this year, as we must return later to the problem of our borrowing. It is sufficient for the present to say that without further special measures, we should be able to borrow for war purposes not less than we did last year. This would reduce the amount, for which new financial measures must be taken, to about &#163;94,000,000. Our immediate task is to decide what proportion of this amount should be raised by taxation. </para>

          <title>Taxation</title>
          <page.no>571</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>In general, taxation is the simplest, most effective and most equitable way of both raising the necessary finance and making available the necessary resources. In the main, increased taxation leads to a reduction of private consumption -and this frees for war purposes the labour, material and equipment previously employed in the production of goods for consumption. </para>
        <para>There are, however, limits to the use of taxation: (ft) With anything like &#163;94,000,000 to find, the increase of taxation necessary to raise the whole amount, if imposed suddenly, would be very disturbing both to business and to the consumer. Even though the weight of the new taxation came in only gradually during the year, as with most income taxation, the mere imposition of it may be too severe a blow. The need to divert resources will become progressively greater during the year, and the pressure to reduce non-war spending should grow with it. <inline font-style="italic">(b)</inline> Moreover, the effect of taxation is to free resources in general. There will, however, be need for particular kinds of resources which will require diversion by special measures. A survey of our war programme and of our resources suggests that a large part of the diversion required will have to be done by special measures. </para>
        <para>In the circumstances, the common-sense policy is to obtain by taxation a substantial part of the amount required, and <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> obtain the remainder by increased loans. In other words, it will be the responsibility of the Government so to manage the economy that, with resolute co-operation by the people, savings will be increased to the required extent. </para>
        <para>The minimum amount to be raised by taxation, or by contributions having the same effect as taxation, 1 put at &#163;32,000,000, or about one-third of the amount for which finance is not in sight. I should have liked to propose a larger proportion, because taxation is, as I have paid, the simplest and most effective way and can be made the most equitable way. This, however, is the minimum which I propose for immediate adoption. Unless our supplementary measures be fully effective and savings increase to the required extent, I shall have to propose further taxation before the year is out. </para>

          <title>The Required Increase of Loans</title>
          <page.no>572</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>The total amount to be borrowed in Australia for war is therefore &#163;122,000,000, compared with about &#163;60,000,000 in 1940-41. The task of raising this sum is somewhat accentuated by the need to convert a loan of &#163;70,000,000, whichfalls due on the 15th November next. A large part of this loan is made up of small holdings. The terms of the new loan have already been announced. Every bond-holder, no matter how small his holding, who converts to the new loan will help our war finance, and the Government looks forward to a splendid response from bondholders. </para>
        <para>Turning back to the &#163;122,000,000, it is clear that the borrowing of this huge sum can be brought about only by an intensive drive for savings. An important contribution can be made without any increase of savings by diversion from private investment to public investment for war purposes. Private investment has already come under a large measure of control. Similarly, public investment for civil purposes is being curtailed. Gradually, as the need for resources for war purposes becomes more urgent, this control will be extended and intensified. The result will be that we shall not have the new capital goods which we could normally expect, for example, new factories and buildings (other than those required for war), new roads, railways and new public amenities generally. But this loss will not affect our present consumption. </para>
        <para>A further important contribution must, and I am sure will, be made by a greater determination to save. The necessities of war are day by day being more fully recognized, and it will be the task of the Government to promote this growing realization. Besides increased willingness to save, there will also be increased opportunity to save. This will come from the absence of many goods on which incomes are usually spent. The growing needs of war must reduce the supply of many civil goods. The Government has already placed restrictions upon imported non-essentials. There is little doubt that those restrictions will have to be extended, possibly into the field of home-produced goods. We must go without many comforts and conveniences, and this going without will give further opportunity for saving. The going-without is the hard thing, and that is inescapable. WhatI am asking of the people is that, when they do not spend on some classes of goods, let us say new. motor cars, they will, not use the money for additional spending on other classes of goods, but will really save it for the duration of the war. </para>
        <para>People who co-operate with the Government by increasing savings will not have reduced incomes on that account. They will be placing a part of their incomes aside for expenditure in future years. The savings will be most useful if they go directly into War Savings Certificates and public loans. Not all, however, will flow into these channels. Some will take the form of deposits with Savings Banks or increased provision for insurance. Some will be employed to reduce existing indebtedness. This will be the method of many producers who will take the present opportunity to increase their equities in their factories or farms. Some savings will merely tend to be left as idle deposits with the trading banks. All these types of savings are valuable and represent an effective contribution to the needs of war finance. </para>
        <para>When goods are short and incomes are relatively high, there will bedifficulties in controlling the prices and at the same time ensuring an equitable distribution of the goods in short supply. The Government is acutely conscious of these difficulties and for sometime has beengiving very anxious thought to the means of overcoming them. This is not the place for a discussion of these problems which are likely to confront us in the course of the coming year. I can only assure the Committee that the Government is fully alive to them and determined to overcome them. </para>
        <para>Let me summarize the financial problem. The Government will borrow &#163;122,000,000 to complete the provision for war expenditure. It will borrow this amount by public loans, by war savings certificates, and by loans from the banking system. It has a heavy responsibility to ensure that these loans shall be sufficiently balanced by real savings. A. considerable proportion of these loans must come from the banking system, because the banks will be the repositories of much of the savings that will be made, and of much of the money which can be diverted from other forms of investment. How far beyond that point we can borrow from the banks can be decided only by experience. I shall return later to the position of the trading banks in relation to the Commonwealth Bank and to the community. </para>

Our necessity may become so great that we cannot avoid them. At this stage, I believe we can. I propose then that, except for a moderate rise of postal charges, additional funds shall be raised by a direct contribution from incomes, in the form of either taxation or loan. </para>
        <para>We need to reduce private spending and our aim should be to reduce the present spending power of every income by an amount appropriate to that income, varying according to our accepted principles from a very large proportion of high incomes to nothing on very low ones. There are, however, incomesor parts of incomes which it is impracticable or unwise to tax to the full appropriate amount. In such cases, we can reduce present spending power to the appropriate level by taking the required amount in the form of loan, repayable when the exigencies of war are past.

        <para>Companies are taxed in various way&#39;s by Commonwealth and States and their dividends are taxed again in the income of shareholders. The total of all company income taxation for 1940-41 amounted to about &#163;35,000,000 quite apart from taxation of dividends in the hands of shareholders. There is not much room forincreased taxation. There is, however, a large amount each year allowed as provision for depreciation or left as undistributed profits and used for the expansion of business. In many cases, additions to depreciation funds cannot now be used fully, and expansion of business is not desirable. It is therefore proposed to take as loan 20 per cent, of the yearly accretion in these funds, and repay them after the war, when they will be required by the companies for rehabilitation and expansion. There will be some companies which will require all available funds for expansion for war purposes, and provision will be made to release their contributions to the degree necessary. Loan contributions from provision for depreciation will be made by individuals also. </para>

        <para>With &#163;32,000,000 raised in this way we shall have, as I said earlier, &#163;122,000,000 to be raised by loans in the ways I have outlined. This will require the full co-operation of the people of Australia, and to get that co-operation we m ust give them the best possible protection against profiteering. There are two additional precautions which the Government proposes to take - dealing primarily with excess profits but designed also as additional safeguards againstinflation. </para>
        <para class="italic">
          <inline font-style="italic">Control of the Private Banks.</inline>
        </para>
        <para>The banks have important functions in the community, particularly in time of war. However well they discharge their functions, there is a real danger that under certain conditions they may make excessive profits out of war finance; and that danger must be guarded against. The deposits of the trading banks have increased by &#163;40,000,000 since the outbreak of war, and I have heard it suggested that these additional funds which they have to invest are a. result of government expenditure and should be lent to the Government at nominal rates of interest. But the increase of deposits is only in line with the increase of employment and production. Bank deposits must be expected to rise with productive activity which is measured roughly by total employment. Employment in Australia has increased byabout 15 per cent, since the outbreak of war, and bank deposits have increased by 14 per cent. There is then no evidence of excess deposits. The deposits of the banks up to the present should not be treated otherwise than in rime of peace. </para>
        <para>Nevertheless there is a possible danger for the future. Our finance in the next, few months will require a good deal of temporary accommodation, and a neces sary precautionary measure will be to remove any danger of secondary expansion by the trading banks, and so guard against any excess banking profits.I have given a good deal of consideration to the question of the best method of doing so. My conclusion is that the most effective measure is to require the banks to keep in a special deposit account with the Commonwealth Bank any increase of their funds due to war finance. As a further check on the efficacy of this arrangement, the banks should furnish a certificate from the Commissioner of Taxation, who has access to all of the facts, showing the relation of their profits, before the payment of federal taxes, to their profits before the war. This methodwill in addition contribute to the stability of the financial system generally in that it, will supply a check, if such is required, to any tendency to over-trade on the part of the banks. </para>
        <para>This measure of control is a variation of the method proposed by the Banking Commission, by which the Commonwealth Bank could require the banks to keep with it deposits equal to any prescribed percentage of their liabilities to the public. I am satisfied that under war conditions the variation I propose will be practically more effective and immediate in its action than the commission&#39;s recommendation. </para>
        <para>It is, moreover, in keeping with the views expressed by the Banking Commission that it is by co-operation between the Commonwealth Bank and the trading banks that the regulation of credit will be best achieved. With that end in view I have asked for and have obtained a firm undertaking from the banks that they will accept the procedure I have outlined above and co-operate fully with the Commonwealth Bank in carrying it out. The value of co-operation in working a plan of this kind is very great, and it should be given a fair trial. I shall have all the data before me upon which to judge its effectiveness, and, should it be necessary, the Government will not hesitate to invoke the National Security Act in order to ensure the results required, namely, the prevention of secondary expansion by the trading banks, and an assurance against excessive banking profits. </para>
        <para>The terms of the undertaking referred to are as follows: - </para>

          <title>Control of Profits</title>
          <page.no>576</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>I have dealt with the profits of the banks, and I shall now go on to the possibilities of excess profits in other business. It is inflationary finance which gives the great opportunity for profiteering in war-time, and our finance&#39; has not been inflationary. Moreover, our controls have been particularly effective. </para>
        <para>There are three governmental authorities through which profits have been controlled during the war. The Commonwealth Prices Commissioner has fixed profit margins of traders and manufacturers and, in many cases, has specifically limited net profits. In some industries, however, individual firms, on account of differences in costs and efficiency, earn widely-varying profits whilst charging the same prices. </para>
        <para>The second authority controlling profits exercises its influence through the prices fixed for Government contracts. Every care has been taken to control net profits when determining the prices to be paid under Government contracts. There has been much criticism of the cost-plus system, on the ground that it places a premium on inefficiency and allows excessive profits. The Government is well aware of this danger, and the Departments of Munitions and Supply have carefully checked costs in order to prevent abuses of the system. Critics  overlook the fact  that &#34; cost-plus was designed to meet a special situation. Goods not formerly produced in Australia had to be manufactured for the first time; new plant for special war orders had to be installed ; plant and labour had to be diverted from their normal operations to war-time operations; orders had to be placed expeditiously where they could be executed. For all of these reasons there was no basis for operating on the normal tender system in the early stages of the war, but as industry gains experience of filling wartime needs it is becoming possible in a widening range of goods to revert to the fixed quotation system. </para>
        <para>Finally, there is the taxation power. Honorable members will recall that during the last budget debates the question of war-time company taxation was remitted to an all-party committee, which recommended the present war-time company tax. This tax imposes a special progressive levy on profits in excess of 8 per cent, on capital employed. It is a high profits tax rather than an excess profits tax, and I arn informed by the Commissioner of Taxation that its aggregate yield is greater than the possible yield of a tax that would take all of war-time profits in excess of a pre-war standard. </para>
        <para>Apart from the special war-time company tax; other imposts have been made on public companies. Federal taxation of companies, including private companies, yielded approximately &#163;17,000,000 for the vear 1940-4.1, compared with &#163;S,000,000 in 1939-40 and &#163;4,250,000 in the year before the war. A further increase will take place in the current year. </para>
        <para>With these controls the general level of profits in this war has not risen greatly as it did in the last war. But the rapid expansion of economic activity and the increased turn-over of most businesses have brought high earnings, and there may still be cases in which profits are in  excess of the pre-war profits even when these were not unduly low. The proposal to levy an excess profits tax based on prewar standards was rejected last year by the committee representative of all parties set up to report to the Government upon the most suitable form of taxing profits during the war. The Government accepted the recommendations of the committee. In the meantime, further experience has been gained of the measures by which the Government is controlling profits, and there is at present a parliamentary committee, representative of all parties, investigating prices and profits. This committee will review the whole problem and consider such gaps as may remain in the Governmental machinery for controlling profits. I assure honorable members that we shall not hesitate to take any further steps necessary to prevent profiteering, or to tax excess profits where they occur. The Government is asking the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Profits to expedite its report so that the position can bo reviewed, in the light of its findings. </para>

          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <page.no>578</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>It has been my task to present to the committee a budget of the unprecedented figure of &#163;322,000,000. In three years, our expenditure has more than trebled. In. contrast with a pre-war defence expenditure of &#163;14,000,000, we have to find this year the huge sura of &#163;217,000,000 for war. </para>
        <para>The financial plan which I have placed before you on behalf of the Government is simple, and it recognizes the need for a proper balance between taxation and loans. </para>
        <para>First. - Taxation in conjunction with the war-time contribution has bean increased. From these sources we shall raise &#163;170,000,000, compared with &#163;74,000,000 in the last pre-war year. </para>
        <para>Secondly. - The Government proposes to borrow &#163;122,000,000 for war purposes. This can only be achieved by every one making savings which involve some sacrifice, and contributing to our war funds in one form or another. These savings are essential if our war effort is to expand as it must. </para>
        <para>Thirdly. - The Government will carry out a progressive plan to ensure that the increasing resources required for war are obtained. It will also take resolute measures, if necessary, to prevent warprofiteering by individuals or institutions. </para>
        <para>This is Australia&#39;s third war budget and it brings us face to face with this reality : the raising, paying and equipping of our armed forces must take precedence over our spending on comforts and luxuries. </para>
        <para>The Avar has entered a new stage, and in it every true Australian will wish to do his bit, whether at home or abroad. </para>
        <para>No limit can be set to our efforts to win. We set no financial limit on the number of troops and airmen we shall raise, nor the planes, ships and equipment we shall produce. </para>
        <para>Whatever the occasion demands will be done within our physical capacity to do it. </para>
        <para>Developments in the ever-changing war situation must, dominate our financial plans. We shall have to review, and perhaps to modify, the budget in the light of developments overseas. We must pay careful attention <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the progress made in the provision of additional savings and to the blending of budget policy with economic policy in general. We may have to call for greater sacrifices as our war obligations increase. For all these reasons we cannot assume that our financial plans for the year are finally determined in the budget. The Government proposes to review the budget within the next three months, and to make provision for any additional finance that may be required. </para>
        <para>I submit this budget to the decision of Parliament with full confidence that nothing will divert us, individually or collectively, from our plain duty. We must continue to provide the sinews of war without consideration of privilege, creed or party. No more is asked than is necessary for the responsibilities we all must share. We have to meet the challenge of the most powerful and ruthless foe that has ever attempted to strike at the foundations of our national security. It is a challenge that we shall meet with fortitude and courage. Let us face our responsibilities with the same grim deter mination as is being shown by ourfighting allies, resolved to do everything in our capacity in the common cause. We can contemplate doing nothing less, if we wish to preserve our democratic institutions our way of life, and our very existence as a free country. </para>

          <para>.- I do not think that the House should adjourn without an assurance from the Government that the scope of the inquiry by the royal commission into the use of secret funds will be sufficiently wide to enable investigations to be made of allegations that certain financial proposals of the Government were communicated to persons who had no right to know of them. I have no ground for believing th at such communications were made, or were not made; but I am concerned about statements that I have heard, and reports that I have read, that improper communications took place on this subject. It hasbeen alleged that the improper dommunications were made through an intermediary to an officer of the Prime Minister&#39;s Department, who, I cannot conceive, had any right to such communications. I have been informed of the substance of certain telephone conversations. I consider that that matter should be investigated. The House is en titled, also, to an explanation why such a long time has been allowed to elapse without any attempt having been made to take proceedings against the officer who is said to have made these communications. The fact that proceedings are not being taken, and that there is no indication that any proceedings are to be taken, against this person, raises in my mind a suspicion that there are persons in the Parliament and in the Government who cannot afford to allow that person to speak freely on this subject. </para>

          <para>. - I direct the attention of the House to the serious position that has arisen through the. failure of the Loan Council to allocate to the Government of New SouthWales sufficient money to enable it to maintain its public works programme during the current financial year, and, in particular, to continue the work on the Keepit Dam, at Gunnedah. On the 18th September, I made representations to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> in relation to a telegram that I had received on this subject from the secretary of the camp committee at the Keepit, Dam, Gunnedah. In reply to those representations I received the following letter, dated the 22nd September, from the honorable gentleman: -  22 nd September, 1941. </para>

        <para>I acknowledge your representations ofthe 18th September in connexion with a telegram received by you from the secretary. Camp Committee, KeepitDam, Gunnedah, regarding re-allocation of loan money forNew South Wa les. I also have received a telegram direct from the secretary of the Camp Committee stating that the work was closing down and asking for re-allocation of loan money for New South Wales. </para>
        <para>To that telegram I. have sent the following reply :  - </para>
        <para>Your telegram seventeenthLoan Council recently approved allotment four and half million pounds for State works this year. Allocation that amount to specific works matter for State Government in consultation with Co-ordinator-General of Works. Suggest you address your representations State Government. </para>
        <para>Yours faithfully, (Sgd. ) A.  Fadden, </para>
        <para>Prime Minister and Treasurer. </para>
        <para class="block">This subject  is of  the utmost importance to the people  of  New South Wales. The plight  of  the Government  of  that State in this connexion is undoubtedly due to action taken by theCommonwealth Treasurer at theLoan Council. The Co-ordinator-General of Works, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Brown, prior to the meeting of the Loan Council, made a close investigation of the loan requirements of the various States, including New South Wales, and recommended certain allocations. The Loan Council subsequently reduced the allocation proposed for New South Wales by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Brown by &#163;2,500,000. This action was taken by reason of the fact that the Commonwealth Treasurer used his two deliberative votes, and also his easting vote as  chairman  of the council, to defeat the allocations recommended by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Brown.  His  votes were supported by the votes of the representatives of Tasmania and South. Australia. The decision of the Loan Council has prevented the Government of New South Wales from proceeding with absolutely essential works, including the important water conservation scheme for the northwest of the State, which is essential for the development of that area, and also for effective post-war reconstruction planning. Moreover, the cessation of the work on the Keepit Dam deprives between 200 and 300 married men of permanent work. That must necessarily have serious results for the wives and children of the men concerned. The need for a water-conservation scheme in the north-west of New South Wales has been accentuated by the progressive drying up of the artesian water basin in that area of the State. Unless the Keepit Dam project can be continued material damage will be inflicted on the economic structure of the whole State, and serious loss will fall upon the people. I appeal to the Treasurer to review this whole subject and to summon another meeting of the Loan Council in order that the allocations decided upon at its last meeting may be considered. It is absolutely essential that the north-west conservation scheme shall be completed, if the people are to continue to develop that country and if effective provision is to he made for post-war operations. The Premier and Treasurer of New South Wales has requested that an early meeting of the Loan Council be summoned to review this subject, and I sincerely trust thai the request will be granted. </para>

          <para>.- I desire to bring to the notice of the Government, and particularly the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender),</inline> the matter of the allocation to country and provincial newspapers of advertisements which are inserted for the purpose of notifying the liability of certain citizens to submit themselves for military training. I understand that the officers in charge of the different military districts are instructed to insert in suitable newspapers advertisements with respect to the call-up of trainees. I have ascertained that some military officers have interpreted the expression &#34; suitable &#34; to mean that they shall withhold advertisements from country newspapers which in their opinion do not cover an area containing a sufficient number of trainees to warrant advertising. This is to their credit, from the point of view of the conservation of public moneys. On the other hand, certain other military officers do not place that interpretation on the expression, with the result that newspapers in their districts receive a very substantial amount of advertising matter, irrespective of the number of trainees covered. In one military district, the country press has received advertisements practically a column in length, whereas in another military district, which is in charge of an officer who gives the restricted meaning to the word &#34; suitable &#34;, newspapers with an equal circulation do not receive any advertisements. I am not quarrelling with the exercise of care in the expenditure of public funds. I contend, however, that there should be clarification of the basis upon which the officers in the different military districts who have the allocation of these advertisements shall act. </para>

            <para>- Very badly; hence my complaint; but I am not quarrelling with the interpretation of the officer who made the allocation to that newspaper. There should not be differentiation between townships and newspapers according to the military areas in which they are situated; if a newspaper in one area is to receive a substantial revenue-producing advertisement, fair play demands that a newspaper in anotherarea which docs not cover a fewer number of trainees shall receive like treatment. That is the burden of my complaint. I request that the Government take steps to have even justice handed out to the various newspapers. It might very well consider the removal of the expression &#34; suitable &#34; from the instructions issued to military officers. An illustration of the differentiation of which I complain is provided by the <inline font-style="italic">Ballarat Courier</inline> - which apparently can secure every advertisement that is publishedand the <inline font-style="italic">Ballarat Mail,</inline> which has a lower circulation and can obtain only an occasional advertisement. It is said, of course, that the <inline font-style="italic">Ballarat Courier</inline> covers a larger number of readers; but, on the other hand, the <inline font-style="italic">Ballarat Mail.</inline> even though its circulation is lower, covers that very large section of the population which is producing the greatest number of recruits for the Australian Imperial Force and has also the greatest number of persons liable to be called up for  compulsory military training. I understand that the <inline font-style="italic">Ballarat Courier</inline> is sold at lid. a copy, whereas the <inline font-style="italic">Ballarat Mail</inline> can he purchased for 4id. a week, and, consequently, has a wider circulation among the larger families, which undoubtedly provide the biggest number of trainees. I shall not mention the names of two country newspapers which illustrate the point that I am making, because I do not want them to be deprived of the substantial amount of revenue they now obtain from the advertisements they receive. Incidentally, they are not in my electorate. My purpose is to convince the Government that all newspapers should be put on the one basis. A question in relation to the matter was asked to-day, and the reply was that the matter had received the attention of the Government, and that instructions had been given that a fair basis of apportionment should be observed. I am quite sure that when the Minister made that statement ho was unaware that, some of his officers adopt a practice different from that of other officers. </para>

Clearly, unless labour be available for harvesting operations, the harvest cannot, be garnered. The problem is a. serious one.

          <para>The form such help should take would require technical examination, and we do not consider it our province to recommend it except in general terms.

        <para class="block">I agree that we should get the best use possible out of prisoners of war, and. if their services are to be utilized, I press the claims of Tasmania for a share of the work upon which they would be engaged. For various reasons Tasmania has never received, nor can it, because of geographical considerations, receive a reasonable proportion of capital war expenditure, but if it is possible to make up to that State a part of this loss the Government should not fail to do so. Three or four days ago there appeared in the newspapers a report that orders worth &#163;8,000,000 were being given in the various States for the supply of machinery, and of this amount Tasmania was to receive only &#163;73,425, or less than 1 per cent, of the total. Tasmania has all the natural advantages for afforestation work, including a suitable climate, and its claims are worthy of consideration. The fact that it is separated from the mainland by Bass Strait should not be regarded as an obstacle. </para>

          <para>.  - I endorse the remarks of the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> regarding the distribution of government advertising in connexion with the callingup of military trainees in country areas. I, too, have received complaints from the proprietors of country newspapers. One proprietor has so far received only one advertisement, while others have received none at all. In country districts most families subscribe to a local paper and, in the interests of the public, notices regarding thecalling-up of trainees should be inserted in the local paper so that they may be seen by those concerned. About a week ago I asked a question in this House regarding the distribution of advertising as between the country press and the metropolitan dailies, and I learned that, during the period under review, &#163;33,000 had been paid for advertising to the newspapers inthe six capi- tal cities, and only &#163;2,731 to newspapers in country districts. The Government employs advertising agencies for the placing of war loan advertisements, and these agencies deduct 20 per cent, of the total amount payable to the country newspapers to which they allot the advertisements. In one instance the amount charged for such an advertisement was &#163;3 12s., representing a charge of1s. an inch, which is very reasonable.The agent deducted 15s. 7d., sending the newspaper proprietor a cheque for &#163;2 16s. 5d., which reduced the rate for the advertisement to 9d. an. inch. Surely advertisements can be placed with the various newspapers by the government departments concerned, thus doing away with the need to pay commission to advertising agents. </para>

          <para>.- This afternoon I brought under the notice of the Prime Minister (Mr.Fadden) the predicament of men employed in the Clyde engineering works at Granville who are losing their jobs because of the re-organization of the works for the purpose of executing government war orders. The right honorable gentleman said that if I put the question on the notice-paper he would consider it. However, I bring the matterup now as one of urgency because, according to my information, fifteen men were put off on the 12th September, and another fifteen are to be put off to-morrow. The Government promised that a minimum of inconvenience would be caused to the public in the working out of its war production plans. The Government is giving great assistance to the Clyde Engineering Company Limited, having entered into an extraordinary arrangement whereby an advance of &#163;150,000 by the Bank of New South Wales is guaranteed by the Commonwealth Government through the Commonwealth Bank. Now the company has closed down a part of its works which had been in operation for thirty years. Employees who were engaged in the enamel bath section cannot be absorbed in war work by the company, and they are to be displaced. Having regard to the generous assistance which the Government is giving to the company, it is only fair that something should be done for the men. Many of them are old. and trusted employees with fifteen and twenty years of service. They have families and are over military age. This is the first test of the Government&#39;s plan for the reorganization of industry, and it provides an opportunity for the Government to show what it proposes to do for men who lose their jobs because of industrial reorganization. On the 5th September I brought the matter under the notice of the Minister for War Organization of Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spooner),</inline> who gave me an attentive hearing, but apparently it does not come under his department because, on the 25th of this month, he wrote to me as follows: - </para>

        <para>Over three mouths ago, I communicated with the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> regarding the application of the Granville Municipal Council for financial assistance to construct a road, a few hundred yards long, between Parramattaroad, Granville, and Grand-avenue, in order to give access to certain large industries, most of which are engaged in the production of war materials. One of them is the Australian Aluminium Company Proprietary Limited. The cost of constructing the road, including a bridge over a creek, is &#163;12,000. At the present time, the funds of many local governing bodies are not particularly buoyant, and the Granville Council being no exception, it sought from the Commonwealth a grant of &#163;6,000 and approval to borrow the balance of the money. The proposition was most reasonable, because the road would definitely facilitate access to war industries. Three months elapsed before 1 obtained any information. At first, I received only formal acknowledgments of the receipt of my requests. Then I had an interview with the Treasurer, and wrote to him a letter marked &#34; personal &#34;. A few days ago, he notified me that the request had been declined.  His  letter stated - </para>

Unfortunately, I was absent from the chamber when he outlined the details of his proposal, but I shall be pleased to give full consideration to his suggestions. During recent weeks, the Department of the Army and the Department of Labour and National Service have been investigating the possibility of utilizing the services of prisoners of war upon the kind of project which the honorable member mentioned. But, as the House will appreciate, certain practical difficulties are associated with any such proposal. The matter of security, the provision of accommodation, and problems relating to health have to he taken into consideration before effective use can be made of the labour of war prisoners.

          <para>. -  A religious publication, <inline font-style="italic">The Signs of the Times,</inline> contains a reference to evidence which an anthropologist - a woman - gave before the Joint Committee on Social Security in Melbourne. According to this report, she declared that the missions do more harm than good to the natives. I challenge that statement. I shall not mention her name, because I attended a science congress in Canberra at which she delivered lectures, and I respect her for the voluntary work that she has performed among natives in New South Wales. Nevertheless, her evidence is a serious reflection upon the missions. All religious denominations are rendering excellent service to this forgotten race in the Northern Territory. In the Islands east of Darwin, the Methodists are carrying on the good work. Nearer Darwin, in West Arnhem Land, the Church of England is performing really magnificent service. For the natives on Melville Island, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Darwin has done a most effective job. Fortunately, food supplies there are ample. In the Alice Springs district, numbers of detribalized natives roamed the roads until a few years ago, when Father Maloney, who had a wonderful experience of life among the aboriginals on Palm Island, put the natives into huts and cared for them, and secured voluntary contributions to provide schools in which to educate those of superior intelligence. </para>

          <para>.- The policy of the Capital Issues Advisory Board is having a serious effect on an important subsidiary of the educational system of New South Wales. Numerous religious institutions cater for the secular and religious education of children belonging to their respective denominations, and in this way, greatly assist the State Department of Education. As the result of the decision of the Loan Council, the amount of money which is to be made available to each State for the purpose of expanding educational systems by erecting new buildings and engaging additional teaching staff, has been substantially curtailed in comparison with the amounts that were available a few years ago. As the Capital Issues Advisory Board has refused to permit private denominational organizations to incur expenditure for the purpose of carrying on their programmes of expansion, an additional burden is thrown upon the State Department of Education. One glaring instance of the shortcomings of this policy is the refusal of the Capital Issues Board to allow the Roman Catholic educational body in central western New South Wales  to erect an agricultural school at Forbes. It is well, in the interests of the Government&#39;s war requirements, to restrict building operations in areas where there is a shortage of builders, but not in areas, such as Forbes, where there is a surplus which, owing to reasons of domestic economy, cannot be transferred to places where a shortage exists. People with families engaged in occupations in country towns or on farms cannot be expected to uproot themselves and go to the cities in search of work. As the result of the policy of the Capital Issues Board, builders who could usefully be employed on such works as the erection of an agricultural school at Forbes are forced to remain idle. The instance I have cited could be multiplied many times. I appeal to the Government to give urgent consideration to this matter. </para>

        <para>A matter which concerns the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> is the refusal of the army authorities to give due recognition to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. V.</inline> L. Matthews, of Grenfell, the inventor of a device which has been employed by the Australian Imperial Force to stop German tanks. Apparently, some fifteen months ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Matthews</inline> made a special visit from Grenfell to Sydney to place his device before the officials at Victoria Barracks. I understand that, after having received a cool reception at Victoria Barracks, he saw the  chairman  of the Inventions Board, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Philip</inline> Goldfinch, who assured him of the worth of the device. Recently, he saw in a Sydney Sunday newspaper a picture of a group of Australian soldiers demonstrating how they had stopped the German tank advance in Crete. He at once recognized the device used as the one which he had shown to the Defence Department. At a fair amount of expense to himself <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Matthews</inline> demonstrated his device locally on his own tractor, and in doing so nearly destroyed the tractor. In spite of that he does not desire any monetary gain from his invention. He thinks, however, that since his idea was adopted by the military he is entitled to some official recognition. I hope that the Minister for the Army will see that he receives that recognition. </para>
        <para>Since the war began the population of country towns where there is no war activity has dwindled. Men have gone into the Army and others, with their families, have transferred to the cities in search of war work. Millthorpe, a town near Orange, is one town which has suffered.

The truth is that there was an error of addition in the board&#39;s own statement involving 1,414 gallons of spirit, and that the Neptune Oil Company, an offshoot of the Shell Company, which has a very poor reputation at the present time, disposed of 1,745 gallons in the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown,</inline> although he did not receive that quantity and did not pay for it. Actually, the petrol was received and paid for by the company&#39;s agent in Bendigo. The board now admits this. It now claims that there is a discrepancy of 208 gallons in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown&#39;s</inline> figures. This is accounted for by the fact that four drums of petrol were sold to a consumer and paid for in September, but were not taken from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown&#39;s</inline> premises, so that they were included by the board&#39;s inspector in the returns for October. I took this matter to the Minister for Supply and Development, who received me very courteously; my complaint does not bear in any way upon the Minister, but is directed entirely at the Liquid Fuel Control Board. Because it refused pointblank to provide <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown</inline> with a copy of the evidence on which it. found him guilty of committing an offence, he had no proper opportunity to defend himself. Even a murderer is entitled to hear the evidence on which he is convicted. A member of the board informed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown,</inline> in the presence of a witness, that the fact that he had sought political influence would have a seriously adverse effect on his case. </para>

            <para>- We should dispense with the services of that member of the board, at any rate. Owing to some oversight, the Minister for Supply and Development has no power, under the National Security Act, to reverse any decisions made by the Liquid. Fuel Control Board. This means that a civil servant, who might be interested in some transport board, might be given an opportunity to use the powers of the Liquid Fuel board on behalf of the interests of the transport board. That is a scandalous state of affairs. It is time that the Government took definite action to control the operations of the board. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown,</inline> who is a Justice of the Peace, is held in high esteem in Bendigo. He has been in business there for many years, and his word is honoured by men who have important dealings with him involving much more than was involved in his transactions with the Liquid Fuel Control Board. Nevertheless the board has withdrawn his licence to sell petrol, with the result that he is losing an income of &#163;25 a week and is forced to suffer the humiliation of being treated as a criminal. The sooner the Government places people with a sense of justice in control of the petrol-rationing scheme, the better will be its own position. </para>

          <para>This which I am about to write may appear to you to be highly irregular. I admit it is. But only after months of untiring efforts to get satisfaction through the correct channels with no avail have I decided to employ this irregular but, I hope, effective method. I am a rating serving overseas on board one of Australia&#39;s destroyers which are &#34;held together by string&#34;. That jesting remark which our Prime Minister passed on remarking on the Battle of Matapan was dramatically correct. It is a case of a true word spoken in jest. He is definitely and positively correct. For months now the men on board these ships have been trying to gain satisfaction through sendee channels to have something done, but each attempt has been squashed before it could get far enough. These ships of &#34; last war vintage &#34; on which we serve are in a shocking condition, and it is only fair that the public of Australia should know the type of things in which we daily risk our lives unduly. Each of them have broken down from anything up to 20 times in midocean, entirely at the mercy of the enemy. By sheer good luck we have never broken down during action. The living conditions are probably the most unhealthy of any ship in any navy. Mess spaces are cramped. Wash places shocking, an average of one basin to 25 men, while food storage is definitely against all rules of health. The armament of the ship is definitely inadequate for modern warfare. Anti-aircraft weapons are absolutely miles below the class of weapon which modern destroyers carry. Yet we are sent to do the same duties as they. After almost two years of this, we are now showing signs of wear, and when we apply for a spell we are refused point blank. You can understand what a strain, both mentally and physically, we have been under, having to keep pace with ships which are built twenty years after ours, and how we have had to put each individual effort to our jobs. I can truthfully say that the spirit of all has been good to date, and our jobs have been done with good heart, but in the last few months, since we have realized our Naval Board&#39;s attitude towards us, we are losing our punch. We are out of sight and, therefore, out of mind. The conditions we have been living under are starting to tell, and despite all we have done in the past which has been recognized as good work, we can get no satisfaction from our Naval Board. Through letters from home we have learned of how the people in home waters are having anything up to six weeks&#39; leave per annum. Some of us have had none for two and a half years. The people at home are able to get to their homes of a night but we can&#39;t. There is much discontent in the ships over the treatment and consideration shown to us by the Naval Board, and all we get from them is an occasional message telling us how they are pleased with our work. At one time these worthless scraps of paper would have pacified us, but now they are regarded as a means of hoodwinking us into believing we are heroes. We don&#39;t want appreciation in this form, but in the form of relief from this life, which is so unnatural, in the form of leave. We are quite willing to return and complete the job which we realize mustbe done, providing we have a spell to recuperate fromthe long time, and the gruelling months we have spent since the outbreak of war, and providing our Naval Board will put us on ships in which we can feel happily content, and which will be up to the standard which modern warfare requires. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.&#93;</inline></para>

        <para>I hope that the Minister for the Navy will take serious notice of the protest that this member of the Royal Australian Navy has made on behalf of himself and his fellow service men in a last desperate attempt to secure justice. </para>
        <para>I also direct the attention of the Minister to the manner in which the Naval Board discharges its obligations through some of its officials. A resident of my electorate lodged an application on the 14th March last for appointment to the antisubmarine branch of the Naval Forces. He passed a medical examination, and undertook a special study of spherical trigonometry, which is the basis of the science of navigation. He travelled to Sydney at his own expense on the 16th May in order to appear before the selection board and avoid the long wait until the board arrived in Melbourne on the 21st July. At that interview he was asked whether he knew anything about navigation and electricity, and replied in the negative . Most of the other questions which he was asked related to the sports in which he had engaged at school and the university, and the reason why he wanted to join the Navy. He said that he wanted to go to sea, and was seeking employment with the anti-submarine branch because it was an important unit and appealed to him as requiring trained minds rather more than most jobs in the other services. His qualifications at this stage were that he had a university degree, experience of handling people gained from active practice in the law courts, and a knowledge of spherical trigonometry. He had no knowledge of navigation or electricity, and lacked yachting experience. However, this was not very serious, because many people who know nothing about seamanship have been appointedto the anti-submarine branch of the Navy. </para>

            <para>- Aweek after this gentleman appeared before the selection board he was informed that he had not obtained sufficient marks to justify selection for the next qualifying course. During the intervening months up to the 31st July, he studied navigation and electricity, and on that day when he appeared again for selection, he had reached a standard at least equal to that of the examination held in those subjects at the anti-submarine school after completion of the qualifying course. The selection board consisted of Commander Jones, R.A.N., and Commander Newcombe, R.N. Commander Newcombe asked him a few questions on alternating currents, which he answered correctly, and then he was asked what school he had attended. I object to any person, seeking employment in any branch of the armed forces or employment with any government or even private employment, being questioned as to what school he attended. <inline font-style="italic">As</inline> a matter of fact this man had studied at local State schools, and had won a scholarship to the Melbourne High </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para class="block">School. He told Commander Newcombe that he was at the Melbourne High School. He was not asked any more questions. Commander Jones then put him through a rigorous crossexamination as to why he wanted to join the Navy, and then asked him a lot of minor details about whether the blue ensign was flown at the fore or aft of Australian warships, the name of the First Lord of the Admiralty, the name of the flagship of the light forces used as a decoy at the Battle of Cape Matapan, and the names of the officer commanding the ship, and of the officer commanding the Australian squadron. He was not able to answer all of those questions correctly, and it was obvious that Commander Jones, at least, thought that he had shown no real interest in naval affairs and was not impressed by his qualifications. No attempt was made to examine him on his knowledge of navigation, which, I now understand, is probably more advanced than the officers who qualify in the course are expected to have. Little weight seems to have been given to the fact that, in his desire to join the Navy, he had even gone to Sydney at his own expense for an interview and had done a great amount of study in an endeavour to qualify for selection. No selection was held in Melbourne from January until July of this year. How many applicants who were ultimately unsuccessful were immobilized for that period and their enlistment in the Services delayed will probably never be determined. This man saw that he was not wanted in the Navy, despite his qualifications and despite his persistence in trying to equip himself to become an acquisition to the antisubmarine corps. Eventually he enlisted as a private in the Armoured Division. It would seem, from the story I have related, that had this man attended a public school he would have had the necessary &#34; old-school-tie &#34; qualification andCommander Jones would have been more deeply impressed. I urge the Government to see that all officers who are appointed as members of selection boards for the Navy shall be members of the Australian Navy. It would be far better if Australian naval officers made the selection of personnel for our own Navy. They seem to understand the </para>
        <para class="block">Australian temperament, whereas officers of the Royal Navy are too deeply steeped in the &#34; old-school-tie &#34; tradition. This man had won his way through life and eventually, on scholarships, obtained his LL.M degree. He should not have been denied the opportunity to serve in our Navy simply because of some peculiar prejudice on the part of a member of the selection board. </para>

(b) Prom the foregoing list it will be noticed that seven are revisions of earlier conventions so that the actual number of unratified conventions is really 48. The conventions not yet ratified fall within three classes affecting:(a) Commonwealth alone; (b) Commonwealth and States; and (c) States exclu sively. Of those conventions whose subjectmatter is within the legislative competence of the Commonwealth most have been ratified. In the cases of (b) and (c) which comprise the great majority of the conventions, the Commonwealth can only recommend to the States and endeavour to obtain general agreement among the States with a view to their adoption. Most of these conventions require legislation or regulations to ensure that their provisions can be carried into effect. Thus the Commonwealth, which is responsible internationally, must, before ratification of any convention, be satisfied that the subject-matter is covered by State legislation. Although prior to the outbreak of war five States had intimated that there was no objection to ratification of a substantial number of conventions, no reply had been received from the remaining State. I desire to point out to the honorable member that of the 48 conventions which have not been adopted, ten (Nos. 24, 25, 35 to 40 inclusive, 48 and 56) deal with forms of compulsory insurance, a subject upon which Commonwealth legislation was enacted although not yet operative. Several others (e.g. 3 to 6 inclusive, 33 and 45) deal with subjects which are not applicable under Australian conditions. Five (Nos. 12, 17, 18, 19 and 55) deal with the subject of workmen&#39;s compensation, a matter upon which, as the honorable member is aware, adequate legislative provision has already been made throughout Australia. Other conventions such as No. 44 dealing with unemployment relief and Nos. 28 and 62 dealing with protection of workmen against accident, concern subjects in respect of which legislative provision is already made throughout the Commonwealth. The honorable member will appreciate that in general, industrial and social legislation in Australia is ahead of that in most countries of the world. At the same time, before ratification of a convention may take place, it is essential that the law in force shall give effect to every provision in that convention. In many cases, therefore while conditions in Australia correspond substantially with those prescribed by a number of the conventions, ratification is not possible because of some minor variation in one or more States. </para>
