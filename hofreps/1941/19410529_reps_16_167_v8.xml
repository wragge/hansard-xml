                        <para>- During the last sittings of Parliament I brought to the notice of the Minister for the Interior cases of eviction from houses in the Australian Capital Territory of the wives of certain men serving with the Australian Imperial Force overseas. The Minister promised to consider the matter, and the cases that I mentioned were satisfactorily adjusted. I received to-day from a woman  in  this Territory whose husband has performed valiantly  in  a division in Egypt, a communication stating that she has been notified that unless she pays certain arrears of rent within fourteen days she will be evicted from her home. Will the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior stay the threatened proceedings, and see that the wives of absent soldiers receive fair treatment? </para>

I am not prepared, at the moment, to commit myself in respect of the proposition that medical attention be provided in respect of all men who return from the war., whether their disability be due to war service  or  not, because such a proposition must be subject  to  some time qualification, but I am prepared to approach  it  in a very broad and sympathetic spirit. </para>

There are certain differences between the costs of land and materials in Victoria and the costs in South Australia; but the honorable gentleman, and other honorable members, may rest assured that the action which the Government is taking will result in the economical construction of homes that will prove both adequate and congenial, and the rents charged will not be at all disproportionate to those of private homes in the neighbourhood. </para>

                        <para>- I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether tobacco manufacturers are responsible for the present rationing of supplies of tobacco? In view of the statement reported to have been made by the honorable gentleman, namely, that supplies of tobacco will soon be available from Rhodesia, will he state whether there is any possibility of augmentation of supplies to the public? Will he also make a clear statement of the position in relation to rationing ? </para>

                        <para>- The rationing of manufactured tobacco is the responsibility of the manufacturers; the rationing of imports of tobacco leaf is the responsibility of the Government. The statement attributed to me that the agreement with Southern Rhodesia would result in more tobacco being made available is true to the extent that the manufacturers are prepared to purchase additional supplies of leaf in' order to supplement what is available from other sources. The matter raised in the third part of the honorable member's question will receive consideration. </para>

                        <para>-Wool for Australian manufacture is dealt with under special terms of the agreement with the British Government, which has purchased the whole of the wool clip. Wool owned by the British Government and outside of the range of those special terms is a matter for the Central Wool Committee and the British Government. The Central Wool Committee, I know from personal investigation, has been in close consultation with the British Government in order to ensure that maximum quantities of wool are available for carbonizing and wool-scouring concerns in Australia. The result has been that in many of the establishments two or three shifts are working at a greater pace than before the war. In the last few weeks, unfortunately, there has not been wool available to the same degree as formerly, with consequent unemployment. The Central Wool Committee is ascertaining to what extent extra wool can be obtained in order to alleviate the position. </para>

                        <para>- I ask the Prime Minister when the Government intends to redeem its promise that a munitions factory would be established on the coalfields, in the Hunter electorate? I ask the question for two reasons: first, because our troops overseas are short of equipment; and, secondly, because my stocks are certain to fall if the promise be not honoured. Whereas I am usually unopposed at election time I had an opponent at the last election. </para>

Last night an additional regulation was gazetted, the effect of which is that before engaging certain classes of employees an employer engaged in munitions work must register with the Department of Labour and National Service such particulars about the employee, including the name and address of his previous employer, as the Minister specifies. The appropriate labour exchange must be notified by the employer of his intention to engage specified classes of employees. In addition, all employers, whether engaged in munitions work or not, will not be allowed in future to invite applications for employment from the specified classes of employees unless they include in the invitation or advertisement a statement - </para>

                        <para>-  The provision of fuel oil supplies requires the use of tankers and overseas funds just as motor spirit does, and our present difficulties concerning fuel stocks are due to the nonavailability of tankers. Stocks of diesel oil fuel have been built up on the basis of normal uses of that fuel, and no trouble has been experienced so far in maintaining stocks for those uses. If, however, any extensive new uses were encouraged, it would have to be at the expense and to the detriment of present uses, for which no ready substitute is available, since it is not possible to increase our imports of diesel fuel. For these reasons, it would not be desirable at this stage to advocate a more extensive use of diesel oil engines, even if they could be obtained, which is doubtful. </para>
