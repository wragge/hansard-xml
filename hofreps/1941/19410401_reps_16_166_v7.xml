                        <para>- I noticed the press references to which the honorable member has referred, and have called for a report with regard to the matter. So far as I have been able to ascertain, only in exceptional cases has there been failure to notify relatives of casualties. It will be readily appreciated that in the early stages of the campaign there must be a small percentage of such cases; to date the proportion has been negligible. When the report comes to hand, I shall consider what can be done to ensure that in all cases the next of kin and relatives are informed of casualties. </para>

Whether new business will be brought forward will depend on circumstances beyond the control of the Government. Further, the Government cannot know what changes of the international situation may take place which will necessitate the taking of certain steps by this Parliament. Naturally, we want to be prepared for such an emergency. </para>

                        <para>- Last Thursday, having despaired of the Government fulfilling its promise that a secret meeting would be held, I made certain statements in this House; I now findthat almost the whole of my speech has been excised from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The House has now before it a very important piece of social legislation, namely, the Child Endowment Bill. I understand that we are to be asked to sit all night to-night in order that that measure may be readily disposed of, and that at the end of this week the Government proposes to rush into recess, probably until May or June. </para>

                        <para>- I am likely to believe anything after what has happened in this House during the last two weeks. Mem bers of the Opposition have gone out of their way to assist the Government; surely it is not too much to ask that the Government will adhere to its promise to give them an opportunity to question Ministers on the important matters which have arisen during the secret meetings. I wish to discuss the very pressing subject of the absorption of the unemployed in my electorate, but I cannot do so in open Parliament without having my speech consored because the work to which I propose to put them is in relation to the defence of Newcastle. I therefore urge the Government to lose no time in convening another secret meeting of senators and members. Why should we be asked to rush important legislation through the House at this time? It is said that we are to have a lengthy adjournment at Easter. I should, of course, like the House to be in recess during the New South Wales State election so that I might have an opportunity to ##"## clean up ##"## some of the political friends of this Government. </para>

                        <para>- Of course it is if this Parliament is going to repeat the performance of the last fortnight. I say if the present United Australia party Government in New South Walesbe thrown out of office the new Government will bring pressure to bear on the Commonwealth Government to ensure a more equitable distribution of defence expenditure in the future in order to absorb the unemployed in that State. I oppose the motion, and I appeal to the Government not to disregard the rights of honorable members to question Ministers on matters of importance arising out of the secret meetings held during the last couple of weeks. Although private members may be regarded as only the common herd, many of them are just as intelligent and efficient as Ministers. By refusing to continue the secret meetings, the Government has not played the game with honorable members. It promised to allow them to discuss matters of national importance which vitally affect the defences of the country. Now, it does not propose to honour that undertaking. </para>

                        <para>.- This bill is mainly a machinery measure setting out the general practice by which the proposed pay-roll tax is to be collected. The tax will be imposed upon employers, and is expected to yield ##£##9,000,000. That money will go into Consolidated Revenue andbe used as a part of the total annual outlay of ##£##13,000,000 required in order to make a weekly payment of5s. in respect of 1,000,000 children in the Commonwealth, under the proposed child endowment scheme. Having regard to the present circumstances, the Government has decided that the proposed payroll tax is the best way, and in fact the only way to enable the Consolidated Revenue Fund to bear the burden of that ##£##13,000,000. ##"##When introducing the measure the Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> made the Government##'##s attitude quite clear by saying that the payroll tax was ##"## the most logical and indeed the only available means of raising the necessary finance ##"##. Whatever views the Opposition may hold of the general principles of taxation, we believe that as the Government has said that this is the only way in which child allowances can be paid to mothers in Australia at the present time, we should not oppose it. It it true, of course, that there can be criticism of any proposed system of taxation. There has never been a tax imposed by this Parliament that has not been, to some degree, open to the charge of being somewhat anomalous. It is also true, I think, that there is no tax which will not bear upon every person in the community. </para>

                            <para>- No. Thisbill proposes to raise ##£##9,000,000, by means of a tax on all employers whose pay-roll exceeds ##£##20 a week or ##£##1,040 per annum. The question that arises is whether or not other means of raising this money are available to the Government. An impost of ##£##9,000,000 is very substantial, and the Opposition takes this view of the situation : The Assistant Treasurer has, in effect, intimated to Parliament, and therefore to the country, that, having obtained all available information, and the best possible advice, the Government has decided that this measure represents the only way in which the money for the child endowment scheme can be made available. The Opposition is more concerned with making payments to the mothers of Australia in respect of the 1,000,000 children who are part of the family structure, than with a dispute or discussion as to whether or not the proposed tax conforms to the principles of perfect equity. That is our position. We do not have to justify this tax. We simply take the view that as we have agreed to the establishment of a child endowment scheme, we see no reason why we, as an Opposition, should fail to support the Government##'##s methods of raising the necessary money. Our main concern is the use that is to be made of the money. </para>

                            <para>- We shall notoppose them. That is quite clear. The Assistant Treasurer##'##s statement was most decisive. He saidit is ##"## . . . the only available  means of raising the necessary finance ##"##. I take it that he used that language in the light of the existing circumstances of the country, and of all the ##'##Other obligations upon the Treasury, and after an exhaustive survey of the possibilities of raising revenue by other means. We on this side hope that we are realists; although we hold the highest ideals, we are not devoid of commonsense. The commonsense view in this situation is that if we oppose this tax there may be no child endowment scheme. We consider that in choosing between what may be the special claims .of the employers in respect of the proposed tax and the special claims of those whom this tax is intended to benefit, the more important social and national advantage lies in the direction of imposing the tax and devoting its proceeds to sustaining and improving family life in this country. On balance, therefore, our decision is to allow the tax to be imposed upon employers in the way proposed by the Government. Saving many years ago faced the question of special taxation, I agree that special taxes, by their nature, are undesirable, but I realize that it is not ##'##novel for the ##'##Commonwealth Parliament to impose special taxation. The Labour party has had to accept, for instance, a special tax imposed on the workers in order to assist the wheatgrowers of Australia to obtain a reasonable price for their product. The bill proposes the imposition of a special tax on employers so that many consumers of wheat may obtain additional means to buy the manufactured products of wheat. It is arguable from certain angles that upon industry devolves the responsibility for the welfare and subsistence of those whom industry employs, and naturally, they include the children of the workers. In 1929 <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. F.</inline> M. Muscio and I made the following statement in our minority report of the Royal Commission on Child Endowment or Family Allowances - </para>

                        <para>The right of men and women to live obviously implies much more than the mere right of their own personal subsistence. The normal life includes the reproduction of the species; it postulates the right of marriage and the coming of children. When industry is said to have an obligation to pay enough to its workers to enable them to continue working and maintain reasonable health and wellbeing, there is involved the well-being of the worker##'##s natural state which is not that of himself alone, but includes hie wife and their dependent children. Furthermore, industry has not only an obligation to pay a living wage to the worker to include the normal family conditions of the worker as being merged in his own being - it has uo other source of supply from which to draw the continuous flow of its labour agent. The provision, therefore, of children to grow up and replace the worn out units in the labour army, is an economic necessity, and should be included in full current ##"## cost of production ##"## just as surely as replacement charges for other producing agents. The worker##'##s normal life cannot be separated from the life of his wife and children. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">In other words, the maintenance of the worker##'##s wife and children is a matter with which the employer should be concerned, as such, apart altogether from the national and social aspects of this matter. The employer must employ men and women. He makes depreciation of his factory building and machinery .a charge against the running cost of his industry. To the degree to which they become worn put he sets aside so much of the realized profits of his production in order that the buildings and plant may be kept operating continuously. What of his labour force? Is there not .an obligation upon him to provide for the continuation and replacement of the human agency necessary to carry on his current enterprise. Surely worn-out men should be replaced. The replacement -of worn-out coal-miners is surely an obligation on the coal industry. All the fine points about principles of taxation that each of us may hold in the abstract are threatened when applied to reality. In the first period of the current session the Commonwealth Parliament passed the War-time (Company) Tax Bill imposing a tax on the earnings of companies, which was estimated to yield ##£##7,000,000 a year,. A professional man earning, say, ##£##50,000 a year, who is not a shareholder in a company, is not subject to the tax. Unless an income-earner is a shareholder in a company, he makes no contribution to the sum of .##£##7,000,000 which this tax is to raise each year for the purposes of the war. Many members of this Parliament, when members of a State legislature, did not hesitate to support legislation imposing special taxes on wages for the purpose of unemployment relief. Under that form of taxation,  those -working, no matter how low their wages, are taxed to provide wages for the workless. Special taxes have become, not only part of the history of Governments in Australia, but in certain circumstances they have presented themselves as the only available way in which a Treasurer in a given situation could carry through a national undertaking or give effect to a definite programme. Although the Labour party holds to the principle that taxation should be based on ability to pay, we must take into account, particularly in a period of great emergency, the question: what constitutes ability to pay? This Parliament has decided at different stages in the history of the Commonwealth that certain sections of the people or certain functions in the community are better able to make a special contribution to the Consolidated Revenue than is the nation as a whole capable of carrying a common obligation. Many years ago the Commonwealth Parliament imposed ,an entertainments tax. The public revenue was considered to be so urgently in need of replenishment that Parliament imposed the tax on all who attended places of public entertainment. Those who did not attend picture theatres, race meetings, or football matches, for example, did not pay the tax. By all of these special taxes Governments have drawn revenue from the people for important national undertakings. </para>

                            <para>- No. Does the honorable member suggest that the wage-earner getting ##£##3 or ##£##4 a week pays the financial emergency tax in ##"##Western Australia, or the unemployment relief tax in New South ##"##Wales out of his profits? Certainly not. I congratulate the Ministry on the sturdiness with which it has held social objectives up as a banner, despite the amount of hesitation, fear and even opposition which it has apparently experienced somewhere in the precincts of this chamber. What Ministers are now doing is a powerful contribution towards the capacity of the men and women of this country to bring to the great cause for which they are fighting the greatest degree of physical fitness in order that they may see it through successfully. It is far more important that the family life of this nation should be maintained at the highest point to which we can get it than it is to be finicky about the methods of taxation that the Government is using in order to give effect to its proposals. </para>

                            <para>- On the principle that no person in Australia receiving less than ##£##200 a year is in a position to contribute anything in order that the Government may carry on its every-day obligations. I stand to that. But the honorable gentleman argues that this plan cannot be given effect - that is his real state of mind - because, he says, the ##£##9,000,000 to be paid by the employers is an unjust burden. Well, if the employers of Australia cannot find ##£##9,000,000, the capacity of the employees of Australia to furnish that amount is certainly less. If, therefore, the Government excludes the employers, because of what the honorable gentleman says and then excludes the employees, because of what honorable gentlemen on this side of the chamber would say, it is good-bye to child endowment. The Opposition will not allow this opportunity that has come to Parliament to implement a plan of child endowment to have ##"## good-bye ##"## said to it in those circumstances. We shall, therefore, allow this legislation to pass. </para>

                        <para>. -  I am glad that the measure for the introduction of child endowment has, as stated by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> the endorsement of the whole of the Opposition. The plan should, therefore, receive the unanimous approval of Parliament. The only argument at this stage is, as was also stated by the Leader of the Opposition, about the means by which the money to finance child endowment will be raised. I noted with a certain amount of pleasure the  a ttack made by the Leader of the Opposition on the proposal to compel employers to pay the proposed tax, but I am surprised that the honorable gentleman endorsed the provision that the tax shall be levied on only some employers. This is a differentiating tax, because it excludes certain professional persons who do not pay wages, but who, perhaps, are in the best position to pay. </para>

                            <para>- If it is not there, the Government has the means to get it there by imposing a tax common to everybody in the country. I am not an employer of labour, and, therefore, as I shall not be compelled to pay, I am not speaking personally, but any tax for the purpose of child endowment, with which every honorable member agrees, should be a general tax. The Leader of the Opposition said that certain people paid entertainments tax. They are the people who patronize entertainments. People who do not use petrol do not pay the tax on petrol. This is the first tax ever imposed in this country that departs from the principle that those who benefit should pay. The honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell),</inline> who interjects, should give the Government credit for being the first to introduce a scheme of child endowment in Australia. He should not be annoyed because a nonLabour Government has once more taken the lead in social legislation. </para>

                            <para>- By interjection or otherwise, every honorable member present has expressed support of child endowment. The only debatable point raised by the Leader of the Opposition is as to the means of obtaining the money with which to finance the scheme. I am opposing the proposal to differentiate between classes of employers by excluding certain of them from the incidence of the tax. If this is to be a tax on employers, let every employer be taxed. If a man employs a maid, or a gardener, at his private house he should be obliged to pay tax. If there are to be benefits for employees, and if this House decides that the employing class shall contribute two-thirds of the funds for those benefits, all  employers should be made to share the burden. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member seems to think that the employers will not pass on the tax if it be imposed on a differential basis. He is wrong; of course they will pass it on. The Government should make the tax common to all employers. I would favour making this a general taxation measure, so that child endowment would be payable out of Consolidated Revenue, but I shall not insist on the point as it seems to be the wish of the House, judging by the tone of the interjections, that employers should bear the greater weight of the burden. Nevertheless, I maintain that there should be no differentiation between different classes of employers. All of them should be called upon to contribute according to the amount of wages they pay. </para>

                            <para>- That is because of the cost-plus system. Unfortunately, we are involved in a war which obliges the Government to give work to private enterprise, as well as to munition establishments, upon compulsory  term3.  I would disagree entirely with that system in peace time. Consolidated Revenue should be made to pay for the child endowment scheme so that every body would share the burden ; but, if the majority of the tax is to be made applicable to employers, then all employers should be obliged to contribute to it. </para>

                        <para>. -  I listened with great attention to the second-reading speech made by the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> and also to the remarks this afternoon of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin).</inline> I congratulate the Government on having prepared j scheme about which there is unanimity of opinion amongst honorable members. As one who has studied social problems for many years, I am a strong supporter of child endowment. I believe that it will be a good thing for the nation. But before we implement the scheme, we must consider it from all points of view. At the moment we are discussing the problem of financing it. I should have preferred to have dealt first with the scheme of child endowment itself, so that the House might have had the benefit of a general debate upon the subject. However, I am in accord with those who believe that the necessary expenditure should be made from general revenue. I am totally opposed to financing the scheme by means of a tax upon industry. In my opinion a pay-roll tax is not equitable, and therefore  I  am opposed to the principle of this bill. Parliament has passed many measures of a supposedly temporary character. The Government has told us that the bill now before the House is only an expedient intended to carry on the child endowment scheme for the time being. I do not like this line of action. From day to day regulations are issued and special returns requested, and by various means industry is being harassed. Employers are being requested to furnish so many returns that they have been obliged to engage considerably more clerical assistance than would otherwise have been necessary. This should not be so in a time of war. I could deal with many aspects of this subject, and shall probably do so at the committee stage of the bill; but for the moment I content myself by declaring my antagonism to the proposed pay-roll tax. I do not think that this method of finance should be adopted in connexion with child endowment. Some other means of raising the necessary funds could and should be found. </para>

                        <para>.- I look upon the introduction of the bill to provide for a scheme of child endowment as the beginning of one of the most notable advances in social legislation that we have had for some time, and I am proud to be associated with a government responsible for it. But whilst I regard child endowment as absolutely necessary, I must declare my opposition to such an inequitable method of financing it as the proposed pay-roll tax. Such a tax will seriously affect the section of the community which is already the hardest hit of all our people. I have in mind, of course, persons with an income ranging between ##£##400 and, say, ##£##900 a year. I suppose that the employers of labour in our provincial cities and country towns who may be said to be within this income range give employment to probably half the people earning wages in those localities. Yet they will be required to contribute, in a most disproportionate degree, to this tax. </para>

                            <para>- Even so, the situation will be unsatisfactory. Any taxation necessary for the purposes of the child endowment scheme should be spread as evenly as possible over the whole community. I strongly favour the enactment of a child endowment scheme, and I shall not vote against even the proposed payroll tax if I consider that by so doing I shall jeopardize the scheme; but I insist that the Government could have found a more satisfactory method of financing it. Any financial burden involved in the provision of a social service of such importance as child endowment should be borne equitably by all the people. </para>

                        <para>. -  I have always been strongly in favour of social services for the amelioration of the conditions of the  people, and have advo  cated child endowment not only in this Parliament and on the hustings, but also in the conventions  of  the United Australia party. I am happy, therefore, to be a supporter of the  Government  which is introducing this desirable reform. I believed##'## in, and supported, child endowment for many years prior to my election to this Parliament. Every honorable member on this side of the chamber, I am sure, is favorable to the establishment of a permanent system of child endowment for Australia. I particularly desire that the system that we may adopt shall be of such a character as to ensure its permanence as a part of the social structure of the nation. For that reason I propose to offer some suggestions for the consideration of the Government. In the first  place,  I do not think that the Government##'##s scheme is sufficiently far-reaching. I should like the Government to undertake, as a complementary measure, a scheme for the eradication of slums, and the establishment of a nationwide housing plan. </para>

                            <para>- Whilst I am in favour of widows##'## pensions, I shall offer my own suggestions. It is of paramount importance, in my opinion, that a nation-wide scheme for the eradication of slums and the provision of adequate housing shall be put into operation simultaneously with the child endowment scheme. If the nation is to obtain the maximum benefit from child endowment, it is necessary to ensure that children shall be born in decent and healthy surroundings. Slum areas are notorious for their heavy infant mortality. I strongly advocate that the Commonwealth  Government  shall follow the example of the Government of the United Kingdom, and of governments in other parts of the world, and undertake, in a comprehensive way, the eradication of slum dwellings. Everything possible should be done to provide improved health standards for the people. One of the greatest needs of the present day is a sanitary and stimulating home environment for the mass of the people. I therefore ask the Government to include in its immediate social programme, not only child endowment, but also plans for  slum eradication and adequate Lousing. We should make a nation-wide attack on slum areas. </para>

If the principal measure involved in the introduction of the Government##'##s scheme of child endowment had been submitted to the House first this afternoon, I had intended to suggest that the debate should proceed on the general issues, but as the bill before honorable members is merely the machinery measure, it does not provide the opportunity for a full discussion of the whole subject. I must, therefore, ask honorable members to confine their remarks, for the time being, to the bill before them. I can only depart from that attitude with the consent of the House. The House has, however, made it plain that it will not agree unanimously to a general discussion of child endowment, and therefore I rule that the debate must be limited to the provisions of this bill. </para>

                            <para>- I regret that the usual procedure is not being followed in this instance. I had hoped to explain why I am an enthusiastic supporter of child endowment, but because of the limitation placed upon me by your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> I must pass on to make other observations. I am strongly opposed to the Government##'##s proposals for financing this scheme. It is expected that the payment of 5s. a week in respect of every child, excluding the first, in a. family, will cost ##£##13,000,000 a year. Towards the raising of that sum a payroll tax at the rate of 2##£## per cent, on the amount in excess of ##£##20 a week is expected to produce ##£##9,000,000. The removal of the income tax deductions in respect of each child after the first will provide another ##£##2,000,000, leaving only ##£##2,000,000 to come out of general revenue. In my opinion, a pay-roll tax for this purpose is unwise, unjust and unsound. lt is unsound because the Government proposes that the tax shall be temporary. I believe that so important a social service as child endowment should not bo financed by means which are temporary; it should be placed on a permanent; financial basis. I object to the pay-roll tax for the further reason that it does not take into consideration the ability of an industry to pay it. An industry may make no profit whatever, yet it will have to pay this tax. This burden will fall heavily on new industries and those old established industries which are struggling to carry on in these difficult times. In some instances, the tax may so affect: a struggling industry as to put it out of existence, in which event there will be no pay-roll to tax, but instead, more unemployed workers in Australia. The basis of the proposed tax is unsound; a true basis would be the ability of an industry to pay it.

                            <para>- I believe that this Parliament is fast becoming a mere recording machine for the views and opinions expressed by the Leader of the Opposition at meetings of the War Advisory Council. I regret that that is so. I am amazed at the docility and complacency of honorable gentlemen opposite, who blindly follow their leader, instead of expressing their own views. I am particularly astonished that the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> should so willingly accept dictation by the Leader of the Opposition. Democracy will fail in this country unless the representatives of the people in this House have the courage to express the views that they themselves hold. I object to the pay-roll tax for the further reason that whilst many producers will be able to pass it on, others will not be able to do so, and because it will add to the cost of public utilities and commodities required by the people. There will also be duplication of the tax because manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers will each, in turn, seek to pass it on. I object to the tax because, owing to the fixation of prices  under war-time conditions and other conditions beyond the control of the primary producers, they would not be in a position to pass it on. Honorable gentlemen opposite appear to have no regard for the interests of the primary producers in this matter. Many taxpayers with large incomes, such as professional men, business executives, real estate agents and others, would escape substantial payments under the pay-roll tax, because the earning of their income does not involve the employment of much labour. </para>

                    <para>In reply to the statement that the proposed pay-roll tax is to be temporary, I remind honorable members of the eloquent speeches made in this chamber by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> when he was Treasurer in the Scullin Government. He definitely stated that the sales tax would be a temporary measure, but, under that tax, the total collections, including those for the present financial year, amount to ##£##10o,S##&gt;##S6,000. I have no doubt that the proposed pay-roll tax, although described as temporary, will prove to be as permanent as the sales tax has been. Another temporary tax was that introduced by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Gullett in the form of a special duty on motor chassis and parts, for the purpose of providing a bounty for the encouragement of the manufacture of motor car engines in Australia. Already, ##£##1,500,000 has been collected under that temporary measure. It will be admitted that, but for the licensing of imports, the amount collected would have been much greater. A third so-called temporary tax is that imposed by the governments of the States for the purpose of providing unemployment relief. That tax was imposed when the unemployment figure stood at about 30 per cent. To-day, it has fortunately fallen to about 5 per cent., yet the tax is still in operation. In some of the States the present collections under it are larger than they were when the unemployment figure was 30 per cent. </para>
                    <para>Nobody in the Commonwealth should be able to speak with greater assurance regarding the futility of a pay-roll tax than the Premier of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mair,</inline> who has had to finance child endowment in his State, the only State in the Commonwealth that has established a child endowment scheme. Here are the views of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mair</inline> - </para>
                    <para>  If a national endowment plan is to be successful, it should be a national charge, and not a levy or burden on industry and employment. The State Government can speak authoritatively on family endowment, as New South Wales is the only State that has provided this magnificent social service. Originally there was a tax, payable by employers, to sustain the funds for endowment, but this taxation proved disastrous, as it discouraged employment. Why should an employer be called upon to pay on additional charge when he gives employment, and why should an investor earning income from government securities and giving no direct employment be free of tax? The New South Wales Government had substantial reasons for removing the burden of the family endowment tax from industry. Small employers were forced into the position of running their businesses at a loss and still being called upon to pay tax because they continued to keep their employees at work. Surely such a principle is unsound and will cause dismissals from employment at a time when it is very necessary to have full employment. One of the most important objectives that we should strive for is to prevent the cost of living from increasing. If an endowment tax is levied on industry it will certainly go into business costs and will find its wayinto commodity prices, increasing them. </para>

                        <para>We are gravely perturbed that the Government apparently still contemplates financing child endowment by a pay-roll tax. Excessive State taxation has for nearly a decade scared off new capital for industrial expansion. Because of lack of available plants, Queensland could not undertake its share of war work. The new State basic wage is the highest in the Commonwealth. The expansion of industry is essential for the prosecution of the war and the post-war reconstruction. Can you help us towards spreading the cost of child endowment over the whole community? </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Reference is made in that telegram to the fact that the basic wage awarded recently by the Queensland Arbitration Court is the highest in the Commonwealth. Regarding that matter, I desire to make my position perfectly clear. I have always favoured the payment of the highest wage that industry can afford, with the sole reservation that, if the wage is to be effective, it must have general application throughout the Commonwealth. There would then be fair competition between the States, and every State would prosper. </para>
                    <para>I desire child endowment to be a permanent part of our social system, but it should be established on a sound and enduring basis. I am amazed at the docility of honorable gentlemen opposite who, because their leader is a member of the Advisory War Council, and supports the Government##'##s proposals in this matter, are dumb and unable to express their own views. They should have sufficient courage to express the views that they individually hold. Had there been a prior discussion on this matter, a payroll tax would not have been proposed as part of the method by which child endowment should be financed. We are passing through difficult times, in which new industries may fail to show a profit at the outset; therefore, this Parliament ought to face up to the realities of the situation with regard to child endowment. I strongly support the introduction of the principle, but I urge the Government to cast aside its proposal to finance the scheme partly by means of a pay roll tax. It should obtain the necessary funds from general revenue for this and all other social services. </para>

                        <para>.- There appears to be a mistaken notion in some quarters, on a quite insufficient ground, that some kind of embargo has been placed upon members of the Opposition against discussing this matter at all. Of course, I need hardly say that that is entirely wrong. It is quite open to members of this House to offer any observations they care to make on the principles of this measure. It is to be regretted that the Parliament was not first given an opportunity to express its view on the principle of child endowment. Had the principle been first submitted to us in a substantive measure, I think that the Parliament, by a large majority, would have wholeheartedly endorsed it. I think we could then have proceeded with open and analytical minds to the discussion of the methods by which the money should be raised for the purpose of giving effect to that decision. I realize, of course, that it is quite impossible to discuss any tax measure apart from the purpose for which the money is being raised, unless, of course, it is merely for general revenue. If the money is being raised for a special purpose, as in this case, it is impossible intelligently to discuss the method of raising it without reference to the purpose to which the money is to be applied. That is little more than a truism, and it serves to emphasize the regret I feel over the order in which these measures have been presented to the Parliament. However, that is not m.y responsibility; it is the responsibility of the Government. The Leader of the Opposition has correctly quoted the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony),</inline> who introduced the bill, as having said that this is the only method available to the Government for raising the necessary money. The Leader pf the Opposition does not endorse that view, but accepts it as coming from those responsible for the public finance of the country, from the representative of a Government of which he is not a member, and for whose conduct he is not responsible. He does not accept it as being, the best method, nor do I accept it as being the best or the only method. Therefore, I regret that we have not had, from the Government, a more sober and considered analysis of the question as to the most equitable and just method of raising the money needed. I think that the discussion has been inadequate, and I cannot help feeling that the Government, through its single representative who has addressed himself to the question, has not fully examined all the available avenues of finance. It might very well be said that I, as a representative of the working class in an industrial electorate, should not concern myself with the fact that it is proposed to establish this fund from moneys to be paid by industrial magnates who employ large numbers of persons, and have a large wages bill. I reject that narrow view. It is obvious that this is a sectional tax, and as such presents objectionable features to my mind. If the Government has not itself exhaustively examined the alternatives, I do not consider that that relieves me, at least, of the necessity for calling attention to the fact. I do not intend to oppose the bill mainly because, although this is to be a sectional tax, the obligation resting upon employers of wage-earners is of such a character, and the impost is so distributed between those who are employers and those who are earning large incomes, that I am prepared to waive my objection in favour of my strong desire that no serious obstacle should be placed in the way of child endowment. The tax on those who are not employers will bear a fair proportion to the benefit which those tax-payers .will receive. Certain persons, it is true, with large incomes will bear no part of this tax. They may actually benefit from it. </para>

                            <para>- That comes under the provisions of the Income Tax Act. However, under this taxation measure, there is some proportion, at least, between the tax on those who are not employers, but are earners of income, and the benefit which they will receive. I cannot ignore the fact that the rise which we expect, or did ##"## expect, in the basic wage, would probably have constituted a greater impost on industry than this measure will impose, upon any reasonable expectation of what the court would grant. Certainly, I strongly hold the view that the basic wage should, on the facts and. in equity, be substantially increased. I do not believe that the method proposed for raising the money is the best, but I accept it because, although it may be in some respects unjust, there are about it certain compensatory features. I do not accept it merely because it is an impost on a class of persons who do not, as a rule, vote for me,  and whose direct representative I cannot claim to be. I think there is a duty resting upon every individual member of this House to examine conscientiously the incidence of taxation in order to see whether it is fair, not to see whether more taxation is imposed on his political opponents than on his political friends. </para>

                    <para>Mr.SPOONER  (Robertson) ##[##5.15##]##.  -  I believe that, as the debate proceeds, the House will begin to get this tax into proper perspective. We must take our cue from the speech of the Assistant Minister who said that the pay-roll tax is the only way to finance child endowment. That is the Government##'##s responsibility. The Government inferentially goes further and says ##"##not only is the pay-roll tax the only way to finance the scheme, but also it is being introduced before the Child Endowment Rill itself to make sure that i t will be carried ##"##. At this stage, all honorable members who are supporters of the principle of child endowment have to be realists. They must accept the position that the Government in charge of the finances of the country says that there is only one way in which to finance child endowment, and if there is no pay-roll tax, then there will be no child endowment. I find myself in accord with the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin).</inline> It may be known to some honorable members that I am no supporter of the principle of a pay-roll tax, but if it is a question of deciding between the dropping of child endowment and proceeding with the pay-roll tax for the finding of nine-thirteenths of the cost of the scheme, then I do not propose to vote against the bill to introduce the tax. I propose to support, the bill, but that does not prevent me from expressing the opinion that the money might be found in a better way. I hope that I am not unfair in saying that the Leader of the Opposition, in his endorsement of the bill, did not show any glowing enthusiasm for it. The honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> went a little further. I shall go further still. I feel sure that were honorable members asked to vote on this measure quite detached from any scheme of child endowment, it would be given an entirely different reception. </para>
                    <para class="block">However, we must be realists, and face the position as we find it. Last December, in this House, I had an opportunity to support remarks made by the right honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> who. in speaking on an income taxation measure, expressed the hope that a child endowment scheme would be introduced and that it might be partly financed by the abandonment of the concessional deduction in respect of children under the age of sixteen. I supported that suggestion, because on previous occasions in public I had expressed the view that an all-Australian child endowment scheme was a very necessary social reform. I am not likely, therefore, to display antagonism towards this bill, particularly when I know that in the Government##'##s view child endowment at this juncture can be financed only in the way now proposed. However, I regret that the bill does not call for any contribution towards child endowment from many who are in receipt of high professional incomes, or from those whose incomes are derived from rents and dividends. </para>

                        <para>- Consolidated Revenue will provide two-thirteenths of the cost of the scheme. To that degree all classes of income will contribute. However, if the pay-roll tax is to provide nine-thirteenths of the cost, and if a specific charge is to be made upon those who will lose the benefit of concessional deductions for children, after the first child, up to the age of sixteen years, certain persons will be called upon to contribute twice towards the cost of child endowment. I agree with the proposal to abandon those concessional deductions. However, I have just indicated only one anomaly. Others will become apparent when this legislation is administered. For instance, unprofitable as well as profitable industries must contribute towards the cost of this scheme. Businesses which are flourishing are able to take care of themselves; but Parliament has some responsibility towards those industries which are not yet thoroughly established, or have not passed their teething period. </para>

                            <para>- I am not discussing that aspect of the matter. I am now considering whether child endowment should be financed by a pay-roll tax, or by all-round contributions to Consolidated Revenue. In the latter case, incomes of all classes would contribute towards the cost of the scheme; but businesses not yet successfully launched, or which are being run at a loss, will be obliged to pay the pay-roll tax. I am not in complete agreement with the statement of the Leader of the Opposition that a. pay-roll tax is a tax upon employers. I do not think that this states the position fully. In respect of a pay-roll tax, the obligation to pay the tax rests primarily upon the employer, but that docs not mean that the employer alone pays the tax. In. some cases he can pass it on to the consumer; in other cases he cannot do so. The primary producer, for example, is not able to pass on such a tax. Therefore, in the ultimate analysis, the pay-roll tax is a tax on some employers, and to the degree that other employers are able to pass it on, it is a tax on the consumers. </para>

                            <para>- Ido not think so. If it were possible to pass on income tax, industry would now be able to anticipate the Government##'##s additional requirements at the end of the current financial year. But income tax is an appropriation out of profit. It is not payable unless incomes or profits are earned. I do not think, for example, that the Prices Commissioner - although I am not anticipating what he might think of a pay-roll tax - would for one moment consider an application that prices should be raised to offset income tax. However, I anticipate that he might give very serious consideration to a proposal that there should be passed on in the prices of goods a. tax on wages; and this is a tax of <inline font-style="italic">21/2</inline> per cent. on wages. Such a taxbecomes an element of the cost of production. The point, I emphasize is that the incidence of a, pay-roll tax may be unfair; whilst some employers will be able to pass it on. others will not, be able to do so. In addition, it has an unhealthy effect upon some industries which, owing to their stage of development, are not able to bear it. That is all I propose to say at this juncture with regard to the payroll tax. </para>

I do not accept the proposition that this money cannot be found from Consolidated Revenue which can be supplemented from all available sources to finance the cost of child endowment. The Government, then, should consider whether it should impose a specific tax, with all its anomalies, or use the general revenue of the country to finance what is obviously a social service. Any disturbance of our finances half-way through the financial year cannot but have an unfavorable effect upon economic and business conditions generally. However, I repeat that we must be realists. I cannot recall whether the Assistant Minister said that this tax was intended to be a temporary tax. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly this measure will be passed ; I can only hope, therefore, that it will lead to a more comprehensive survey of the whole of the Government##'##s finances in order that the cost of the war and social services shall be equitably distributed over all sections of the community. I support the bill in the hope that during the current financial year, or, at least, before the next budget is introduced, a committee of this House will be appointed to devise a comprehensive plan for the equitable distribution of the cost of these services next year. </para>

                        <para>.- Originally I was hostile to the principle of the pay-roll tax, but after a careful analysis of the Government##'##s present financial position and the commitments which it must meet next year, I agree that, at this juncture, it has no alternative to the introduction of a pay-roll tax in order to finance its child endowment proposals. Honorable members generally do not appear to be aware that, in fact, industry will be called upon to pay only half of this tax. An amount of ##£##2,000,000 will be raised by the abolition of statutory exemptions in respect of children under the age of sixteen years; and an additional ##£##2,000,000 will be provided from general revenue. At the same time the State governments will be responsible for paying ##£##2,500,000 of this tax. That accounts for ##£##6,500,000 of the amount required to finance the scheme. Industry, therefore, will be directly responsible for only half of the total cost. I have made a very careful examination of the Government##'##s present financial position with a view to ascertaining whether it would not be possible to finance the scheme from Consolidated Revenue. Of the revenue estimated for the current year income tax will provide ##£##51,000,000, and indirect taxes ##£##74,000,000. From which of those sources is increased revenue obtainable? Every thoughtful pri##'##son will agree that we have little hope of increasing the present rates of customs duty. That would involve a reduction of imports. In addition, the rate of sales tax is now very high. Assuming that the Government decided to raise ##£##2,000,000. by increasing the rate of sales tax, an amount of ##£##11,000,000 would have to he raised through direct taxation. That would necessitate an increase of over 25 per cent, of the present rates of income tax. After the  Government  has raised the revenue it anticipates to secure from income tax this year, and allowance has been made for increases of present rates of income tax, because such increases will have to be made if the Government is to be enabled to meet its commitments next year,, and after allowing also for Government borrowings in Australia to the limit of the country##'##s capacity, a deficiency of many millions of pounds would still have to be made good. In the absence of a proposal such as that in the bill now before us the Government would have to finance its child endowment scheme out of thin air. That is not at all satisfactory. When we introduce a new system of social services, we should be prepared to say definitely how we intend to finance it. The Government is doing the right thing in coming before the Parliament and the people with a definite indication of how it intends to finance this child endowment scheme. It has been suggested in some quarters that we should defer the financing of this new governmental expenditure until the budget for next year is prepared. Had we done that we would have had to borrow the money or impose on the taxpayers a burden which they would not be able to bear. It has been said that many taxpayers will escape liability to contribute to the child endowment scheme. That is not so. I have already indicated that more than one-half of the funds required to finance the scheme will be provided out of income tax collected either by the Commonwealth or the States. There are one or two suggestions I should like to make in connexion with this bill. In the first place, is it proposed that this new tax shall be an allowable deduction for income tax purposes? As the tax is in the nature of a direct charge on industry and is in the same category as wages, that point is very important. If the tax be allowed as a deduction from income for taxation purposes the criticism that it would create hardship, in that those making losses will have to pay it, falls to the ground. I ask the Minister to give consideration to the position of a person who has entered into a contract unaware of the possibility of the imposition of this tax. Will he be regarded as being in the same position as another who signs a contract containing a clause by which the contract price may be varied in accordance with variations of the basie wage? This is an important point and should be carefully considered. </para>

                            <para>-  Most contracts include a provision of that kind. The honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> drew attention to the need for uniformity in our industrial and arbitration system. It is impossible under present conditions to have inserted in awards provision for men with large families. That is the main reason for the introduction of this bill. I agree that the proposed tax will entail some sacrifice on the part of persons who have to pay it; but their sacrifice will be as nothing compared to the anguish of soul of a mother with a large family and small income endeavouring to make both ends meet. For that reason I support the bill. </para>

                        <para>. -  It is a trite saying that empty vessels make the most sound. This bill should have passed its second-reading stage within ten minutes of the conclusion of the address of the Leader of the Opposition. To-day, however, the Opposition is the government of this country. The passing of this bill and its cognate measure, the Child Endowment Bill, is dependent, not only on the goodwill and co-operation of the Opposition,but also on its determination to see it through. Irrespective of what Government members may say, we do not intend to allow the Government to escape its responsibilities to those who are to benefit under the Child Endowment Bill. The Government need waste no time in debating this bill ; the Opposition wants to place it and the complementary bills on the statute-book. We do not agree that these measures constitute the best that the Government could do - there is room for much improvement in both of them - but we regard them as representing at least some contribution towards the social needs of the community. Honorable members opposite would do the Government and the people of this country a better service if they refrained from further debating the hill. </para>

He was like the father of an illegitimate child, saying to the mother, ##"##Here it is; devise ways and means of keeping it - whether by recourse to the wash-tub or worse. It is yours; look after it. I am going ##'##bush##'##, but sooner or later I shall come back and will want to know how the youngster is getting on ##"##. In this instance the Government is the mother. Honorable members on this side of the House know there is no government in this country to-day, just as we know that there is no Opposition. We know, further, that our parliamentary system of government is suffering as a result. </para>

                            <para>- Grave differences of opinion exist among honorable members regarding the financing of the proposed child endowment scheme. The debate on this bill is limited to a discussion of the method adopted by the Government to finance the scheme. The proposals of the Opposition for putting this bill into effect have seen many changes. At first it was suggested that we should pass the Child Endowment Bill and not worry about finance until next year. Having delivered themselves of that most ingenious and disarming suggestion, members of the Opposition now state that they will put the financial proposals through first, and discuss the implementation of the scheme afterwards. Without further reference to the impotence of the Government in this regard, and sincerely thanking the honorable member for Watson for saying what the country ought to know about the state of affairs in this Parliament, let us get down to the essentials of the bill. A proposal such as that now before us could never be discussed properly in watertight compartments. Government cannot be divorced from finance ; yet that is what we are trying to do to-day.Although we endeavoured to agree upon the method of  financing the child endowment scheme, not one member of the Opposition has yet said that the method proposed in this bill is the right one. It does not suit the Opposition at present to say what is right and what is wrong, because honorable members opposite are carefully preparing their##'## heads for the crown which they hope to wear about two months hence. Before we impose a tax of <inline font-style="italic">this</inline> sort, we should consider its effect upon certain branches of industry. Further, this tax is being imposed to provide child endowment which -many people in this community do not want and have never asked for. When the Government went to the country last year, the Prime Minister##'##s policy speech contained no reference to a child endowment scheme. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member knows as well as I do that all this talk about a new order is only so much t03h and nonsense. The world does not progress by leaps and bounds. The institution of reforms is a rather slow and painful process. I am suspicious of reforms which spring up overnight like mushrooms after rain. I prefer to plant acorns rather than mushrooms. When one plants mushrooms one gets a very early crop, but the crop lives for but a little while and dies. When one plants an acorn, one has to wait a long time for results, but in the long run one gets a sturdy tree that lives through the ages. It is, or, at any rate, it should be, the aim of every one to endeavour to keep down costs. How can industry keep down costs if taxes be imposed on wages in the way proposed in this bill? Two classes of people will be called upon to pay the proposed tax. .Many organizations such as co-operative agricultural companies which will be obliged to pay the tax, will not be able to pass it on, because the prices of the commodities which they handle are determined by the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner. Another big section which cannot bc overlooked, will be able to pass on the tax by increasing the prices of their goods. They will add the amount represented by the taxto the cost of conducting their establishments producing their goods or providing certain services. As the result, the general community will ultimately pay that portion of the tax. In this instance, the honorable member for Watson has told the truth. To employ <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Winston</inline> Churchill##'##s observation in reference to Yugoslavia##'##s <inline font-style="italic">volte face</inline> last week, I declare that it is time .that this Government found its soul. </para>

                        <para>.- Never in my experience as a member of the Commonwealth Parliament has any principle been endorsed with such cordiality and unanimity as has the principle of child endowment. But if honorable members were to express what is in their minds, they would declare unhesitatingly that the proposal to finance the scheme partly by means of a pay-roll tax is unjustified, because such an impost is inequitable. Every  speaker  to date has admitted that the pay-roll is not a reliable guide to an employer##'##s income or profits. In addition, those who are subject to this impost will be compelled to pay twice, because a portion of their income tax payments will be devoted to defraying the cost of child endowment. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> asserted that he accepted the proposal because the Government is responsible for financing the scheme, and some honorable members on this side of the House agreed with his statement. It is a novel contention, and is a peculiar one to emanate from the Opposition. Honorable members opposite did not adopt that attitude toward the national insurance legislation. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>This bill has placed Parliament in a mo3t extraordinary position. Though honorable members are overwhelmingly opposed to this form of financing child endowment, Parliament is prepared to accept it because the Government declared that the scheme can be financed in no other way. That means, in effect, that Parliament, which is ultimately responsible for the scheme, has no voice in its preparation and design. The method by which the Government intends to finance child endowment is the only point that can cause a division of opinion among honorable members and among the public. The people will desire to know the attitude adopted by individual members towards this legislation. Although few of  them will accept the Government##'##s statement that child endowment can be financed no other way - personally I do not - the majority are willing to support the bill because they desire the introduction of this social reform. </para>

                        <para>. - For three or four hours yesterday members of the Opposition discussed the attitude that they would adopt, as a party, towards the Government##'##s proposals to introduce the payment of child endowment, and now they are endeavouring to prevent honorable members on this side of the chamber from discussing the measure. The public and the press expect us to debate the legislation thoroughly, and if we allow it to pass without dissection, we shall be unfair to our constituents. Metaphorically speaking, the bill is a gun which the Government is aiming at us and I do not like the lock, stock or barrel. As I am a representative of a country constituency, the way of escape has been made simple for me; I can make myself popular with a large section of my constituents, since many of them who in other circumstances would pay the tax, are now exempt, but it would be cowardly of me to take the easy way. My sympathy lies as much with the employer, whose weekly payments of wages amount to ##£##21, as with the employer whose wage-sheet does not exceed ##£##19. Although I am not an employer, I contend that I should be liable to pay the tax. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Watson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falstein)</inline> is new to Parliament, and has something to learn. The Government, after giving consideration to various suggestions for raising the money required to finance child endowment, came to the conclusion that the pay-roll tax was the only possible means. The contention of the honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jolly)</inline> that there should be other means of financing the scheme represented my own views at the outset; but after an exhaustive examination of every proposal, supported by information from the Treasury and the Taxation Department, the Government reluctantly decided that there was no alternative to the adoption of the pay-roll tax. The honorable member for Lilley asked whether payments by employers toward child endowment would be allowed as deductions in the computation of their income tax. I inform the honorable member that the Government intends to allow such payments as deductions, and if the act does not make that provision at present, the introduction of suitable amending legislation will be considered. </para>

                            <para>- That is the intention of the Government. If my prophecy be not fulfilled, it will be the fault of Parliament. The honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Charles Marr)</inline> referred to the matter of exemptions. In reply, I state this simple fact, that if there were no exemptions, approximately 230,000 employers would be affected, but the exemptions reduce that number to 35,000. The cost of collecting the tax from the 200,000 employers who have been exempted would absorb an appreciable part of their contributions. That is the justification for the decision of the Government to grant those exemptions. Some honorable members contended that persons who derived their income from dividends and rents would not contribute to child endowment, but those people now pay a super tax on income derived from property, which exceeds the tax upon income from personal exertion by 25 per cent. Therefore, a differential tax is applied to that class of person. There is also a difference between a Commonwealth-wide tax, imposed on pay rolls, and a State tax, such as that which existed in New South Wales. A State tax is open to certain objections. For one thing, a manufacturer who is subject to the tax in one State has difficulty in competing with a manufacturer of similar goods in another State where the tax does not apply. </para>

It is fully realized that more money will have to be found from time to time. To the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis),</inline> who suggested that this may be a temporary measure, I say that we hope that all of our taxation will not continue at its present severe level, and that the time will come when it will be possible to lighten the load. However, I do not hold out hope to employers that this tax will be imposed for only a short time. Such a suggestion would be misleading.

                            <para>- I object to the report being adopted because of the manner in which the bill was put through the committee stage. I desired to move an amendment, but I had no opportunity to do so. The object of my amendment was to obviate the necessity for employers to make out monthly returns. That is quite unnecessary and I hope that when the bill is before the Senate, the Government will consider the wisdom of my suggestion. In some States to-day an extraordinary number of returns has to be filled in, and much additional work is entailed by stamp systems, ##&amp;##c. Money is urgently required for the expansion and development of business- </para>

                            <para>- The House is governed by the Standing Orders which can be suspended only ##'##by the House. I cannot undertake to state that a motion submitted for the suspension of standing orders would be agreed to. The proposal submitted by the honorable member for Moreton would involve delay in the consideration of the bill, which has already been reported to the House from the committee. My next point of objection is that I shall oppose the recommittal of the bill because I do not intend to support the amendment foreshadowed by the honorable member for Moreton. I arn opposed to it because I consider it essential for the effective operation of the measure that pay-roll tax returns should be made by employers within seven days after the close of each month. Otherwise a large amount of revenue would probably be lost to the Treasury. I.##'##n that event the sum which the Government estimates will be raised by the Payroll Tax Bill will not he raised and consequently the burden cast on other sources of revenue to the Treasury will be greatly .increased. If employers were permitted to furnish returns quarterly instead of monthly there would be considerable delay in the Treasury obtaining returns from employers of periodical or casual labour, of which there is a great deal in Australia. The Treasury would have to wait months to obtain returns from employers of casual la-bour and it would not be able to enforce submission of the returns quarterly. We have had experience of sub-contractors, whose number is legion in Australia, evading payment of their employees although they have received payment on their subcontracts. Great difficulty would be encountered in ensuring that the main purpose of the bill would be accomplished if there were any relaxation of the conditions which the Treasury regards as imperative in order to make certain that employers will contribute towards the fund necessary to give effect to the child endowment scheme. If employers could wait three months before making a return, the time lag between the payment of wages and the submission of the return would be dangerous. Moreover, any economy <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be gained by the employer is not worth considering. It is very seldom that more than a month elapses before wages are paid. The usual practice ia to pay wages weekly; in some cases, payment is made fortnightly, but monthly payment of wages is rare. All that the employer is required to do under the terms of the bill is to furnish a return to the Treasury each month of the amount of wages paid weekly, fortnightly or monthly. As there would be no gain to the country or to employers by making the change proposed by the honorable member for Moreton, I shall vote against the recommittal of the bill. </para>

                        <para>. - The Government is not prepared. to support a motion for the recommittal of the .bill, but it is prepared to have consideration given in the Senate to the question raised by the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis).</inline> The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> has pointed out adequately, and the taxation authorities have advised the Government, that in the event of employers being permitted to make pay-roll tax returns quarterly instead of monthly the door would be <inline font-style="italic">opened</inline> to a great amount of evasion by employers and consequent loss of revenue to the Treasury. Other returns of a similar nature are required to be made monthly, examples being those relating to the sales tax and the wages taxes. The obligation to make the pay-roll tax returns monthly will not place an unduly  heavy burden on employers. If the honorable member for More ton is concerned about the possibility of causing irritation to small employers, I would point out that clause 19 of the bill provides that the Commissioner of Taxation may exempt an employer from furnishing monthly returns if he can establish the fact that he does not pay in wages a total sum of more than ##£##1,040 in a year. There is not much prospect of the Government accepting the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Moreton even if the bill is recommitted, but I can give him an undertaking that the Government will have the subject-matter of the proposed amendment considered when the bill is in the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- It is necessary for the House to be informed of what happened in committee. It is necessary that the bill be recommitted to discuss not only a proposed amendment to clause18,but also all the other clauses. The proper procedure is for the bill to be recommitted. After the call for a division was withdrawn I tried to get across from the Opposition side to which I had gone to cast my vote, but I had insufficient time to do so. I was not able to hear what the  Chairman  of Committees said. I do not know whether he said anything. If he did he may, for all I know, not have dealt with the bill. </para>

                        <para>.- A few weeks ago the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> described as unfair the tax provided for in this bill. Instancing its unfairness, he cited a barrister, earning ##£##15,000 a year and employing little or no labour, who would be absolutely immune from the tax. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> in a leading article, gave prominence to what he then said. Yet to-day, mistakenly, I am sure, he accepted the view of the Government that this tax is the only means by which to finance child endowment. It is nice to have a docile Opposition. It is nice to have an Opposition purring contentedly like a lot of cats at everything that the Government says on finance. I was under the impression that one of the great barriers against a national government in this country was disagreement between the Government and the Opposition on financial matters, but I am now told through the Leader of the Opposition that his supporters accept blindly whatever the Government says on finance. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The only qualification offered by the Leader of the Opposition was that his party would not have to justify the tax. In other words, the honorable gentleman, like Charles James Fox, looks forward to years and  years of opposition. He says that he will not have to justify this tax. No doubt he is correct. No doubt his party will not be in power and have to decide the fate of this tax. With only that qualification the Opposition accepts the tenets of finance laid down by the Government. I hope that, when the next budget is under consideration, I shall have the privilege of reminding the Leader of the Opposition of what he has said and of hearing him say, ##"## That is correct. I accept the advice of the Government on financial matters ##"##. </para>

                    <para>The Government claims that this tax provides the only way in which to finance child endowment. I do not accept that contention. The tax is inequitable. It is unfair. It is a sectional tax. It taxes one particular section for one reason, and for only one reason, namely, because the employers are in the minority. In the opinion of the Government, to be an employer is a crime, and in mitigation of that crime the employer must subject himself to any impost to meet any expediency. The Opposition is to blame even more than the Government for this state of affairs. A pay-roll tax is to be adopted because it provides an easy way to obtain the money and because it is popular. The number of employers is limited; there is a big section of the people in the public services and in the learned professions who will not be taxed at all. There are also thousands of people in Sydney and Melbourne and in every other capital city who derive their income not by employing labour but by drawing dividends, rents and so on. The pay-roll tax is the popular way to raise this money, but it is a rotten way. It does not possess one sound principle md if this bill is all that the Government and the Opposition can do to give a guide to the people in these times, this House can no longer expect to maintain their high regard. Although the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited and certain other concerns have experienced increased prosperity as the result of the war, there are other enterprises in Australia, controlled by importers and primary producers, which have been hard hit. I know of one firm in Melbourne which made a loss last year and expects to make another loss this year. Because it was running at a loss that firm had to dispense with a large number of its employees. The effect of this tax on that firm will be an additional burden of ##£##400 or ##£##500 a. year. In such circumstances it will be forced to dispense with even more hands. This bill is tantamount to a demand that employers dispense with labour. In view of the mistakes which have been committed by the Government and the Opposition, we should not pass the third reading of this measure without discussion. </para>
                    <para>I take the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> to task on another matter. He said, ##"## Well, we have to find the ##£##13,000,000. The only way in which we can find it, or the greater portion of it, is by taxing the employer ##"##. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister said, ##"## We have to obtain ##£##13,000,000 in additional revenue, and in order to do so we must descend to taxing the employer. It does not matter whether it is for social services or for anything else that the money is required, but we must find ##£##13,000,000##"##. He stated that the Government could not find the money unless it adopted the expedient of taxing the employers. I objected and asked whether this meant that, if further money were required for war purposes, the Government would have to secure it from the employers, so that more and more taxes would be placed on that section of the community as the need for funds increased. The system is open to severe criticism. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> stated that the unemployment tax was imposed for a specific purpose. That is true. But will any honorable member say that it is still levied for a specific purpose? I do not believe so. The fact is that the unemployment tax is to-day collected for all sorts of purposes far removed from its original purpose. Is there any guarantee that this expedient - this tax that must, be imposed because there is no other way of raising ##£##13,000,000 for child endowment - will not remain in existence? I say that it will become permanent. The demand for funds for war-time necessities will continue to grow, and as it does so this  easy method of taxing a few people who cannot defend themselves politically, will continue to be employed. I hope that at this stage the bill will be given the consideration that it deserves. I am prepared to give the people a child endowment scheme based on right principles; but unfortunately neither the Government nor the Opposition will do that. </para>

                        <para>. - I have listened with a great deal of interest to the proceedings during the consideration of this measure. I was surprised that it was brought forward before the Child Endowment Bill. The procedure savours very much of putting the cart before the horse; it means that the House will first, approve a method of  obtaining   funds, and then consider what should be done with the money. That is a reversal of the ordinary procedure of this Parliament, as every honorable member must know. I have been forcibly impressed with the attitude of honorable members opposite who, whilst they have declined to make speeches on the bill, have done their level best to prevent honorable members on this side of the House from being heard. Nevertheless the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> received a very good hearing from honorable members on this side of the House, and, indeed, a very silent hearing from his colleagues opposite. When the hill reached the committee stage, apparently before some honorable members from this side of the Chamber had regained their seats, and in the midst of deafening clamour, it was asserted that the  Chairman  of Committees <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> had put the question that the bill be taken as a whole, and that the bill had passed through the committee stage. I say, as other honorable members have said, that if the  chairman  of committees did put the question, we were unaware that he did so. Not until the honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Evatt)</inline> put a direct question to the  chairman  did that honorable gentleman appear to recall that he had put the question. </para>

I wish to say, even if the noise which comes from the Opposition side of the chamber is intended to silence me, that people are looking to this Parliament from all over Australia to-day, and they will say to themselves, and rightly so, that this bill would be of considerable importance to the nation in any circumstances ; hut it is of considerably more importance now when the nation can ill-afford to spare ##£##137000,0(^0. The bill occupies 25 pages of printed matter, and it was passed, after a stifled division, through committee - if it were passed at all - and accepted then by honorable members opposite in their haste to have it agreed to without any discussion, although honorable members on this side of the House made it perfectly clear that they had something to say about its proposals. </para>

                            <para>- No one who did not actually witness the proceedings in this House this afternoon could believe that such things could happen in this National Parliament. I say this  without fear of successful contradiction. This stifling of discussion on a most importantbill will not help in any sense to win the war. Apparently the idea was that there should be a minimum of discussion so that those honorable members not in agreement with the general principles of the bill should not have a chance to oppose it. In common with a number of other honorable members, I am opposed to the idea of domination by numbers and by noise. We are sent here as representatives of a free people, and we are entitled to express our views on the bills introduced, whether we do so at the second reading, committee, or third reading stage, without being interrupted by noise from honorable members opposite, and ##"## without fear or favour ##"##. </para>

                        <para>. - I have no intention of opposing the motion for the third reading of the bill, but I desire to point out again - I had no chance to do so at the committee stage - that mistakes have been made in the drafting of this legislation. In my remarks on the motion for the second reading of the bill I said that the Government was mistaken in the methods that it proposed for raising the necessary money. I stated that the proposed tax would be a purely sectional tax, involving differentiation between various classes of industry. Since this afternoon I have investigated statistics, and have found that, of 230,000 employers in Australia, 200,000 will be exempt under the provisions of this bill. </para>

                    <para>I have no wish to repeat anything that I said at that time. I consider that the situation in which we find ourselves is most unfortunate, though I do not cast any aspersions upon, or blame, the  Chairman  of Committees <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> for what has happened. A mistake was undoubtedly made at the committee stage of the bill. When the call for the division was withdrawn, and as members were recrossing the floor to their place, I understand that the  Chairman  of Committees made the inquiry: ##"##Is it the desire of the committee that the bill be taken as a whole ? ##"## Certain honorable members of the Opposition have since told me that they heard his observation, but neither I nor a number of my colleagues on this side of the committee heard what was said. It was in these circumstances that the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> endeavoured to secure the recommittal of the bill in order that certain of its provisions might be discussed.  His  effort did not succeed. </para>
                    <para>I do not desire to stone-wall the measure. I give the Opposition credit for its keenness and enthusiasm in respect of social services and, in particular, at the moment, child endowment; but I expect similar credit to be given to honorable members on this side of the chamber. I believe that all of my colleagues are in favour of child endowment, but we are not in agreement concerning the means by which the Government proposes to raise the money necessary to meet the expenses of the scheme. This is the first occasion in my 22 years##'## experience as a member of this Parliament upon which I have known the Opposition to be practically silent on a taxing bill. One Opposition member said to me during the suspension of the sitting for dinner : ##"## If we had not wanted the bill, you would not have put that across us and so got the measure through so quickly ##"##. </para>

                            <para>- I am not disappointed, I am delighted that the parents of Australia are to receive some benefit under a measure of this description even though it may not be great. I desire that still further social services shall be provided. I regard this bill as historic - in fact, one of the most historic measures to be passed by this Parliament; but I hope that the day is not distant when we shall also pass a measure to provide pensions for widows, for such persons deserve the support of the nation. My only regret about this measure is that it was rushed through the committee so quickly that we were not given the opportunity to make it more effective. I support the motion for the third reading. </para>

                        <para>. -  I am not aware of a measure involving such important changes of the social fabric, and alterations of the financial and taxing structure of the nation ever being passed through a parliament, so quickly and with so little consideration as this measure is being passed. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> delivered a short, but impassioned, address on this bill this afternoon and then, like Pontius Pilate, he washed his hands of all responsibility. He said that the financial clauses of the bill were no concern of the Opposition.  His  attitude to-day was in striking contrast with the attitude that he adopted in respect of a certain measure last December. On that occasion, he held, as it were, a sixchambered revolver at the head of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> and said in effect : ##"## Either you do as we wish or we shall shoot every bullet##"##. In other words the honorable gentleman and his party were at that time, greatly concerned about how certain revenue was to be raised. I find it difficult to reconcile his attitude on that occasion with his statement this afternoon that the Opposition had no responsibility at all in connexion with the financial basis of the child endowment scheme. Although the Opposition comprises almost 50 per cent, of the membership of this Parliament the honorable gentleman declared that the financial policy of the Parliament in respect to child endowment was no concern of Labour. He said that it was the Government##'##s responsibility. This is in keeping with the attitude of the Opposition to the Government ever since the last election. Its members have been quite prepared to tender advice that they have not been willing to carry into effect. Such a state of affairs must bring retribution in its train in the future. </para>

                            <para>- I shall be here all right to keep my eye on honorable gentlemen opposite. This measure is an instalment of the Government##'##s child endowment scheme which reached this Parliament out of the blue. It was not asked for and was unwanted. It is quite clear from statements made by certain Ministers and honorable members in this House that little time or attention has been given to the details of the child endowment scheme, but certain important details of it will undoubtedly thrust  themselves upon the notice of the Government before the scheme has been in operation very long, perhaps even before the end of this year. We shall then witness the spectacle of Ministers requesting the Parliament to remedy the defects of the scheme. </para>

                    <para>The Opposition has suddenly evinced an overwhelming desire for silence. They wish the hill to be passed quickly. Their attitude is in marked contrast with that of the last few days. I have in mind particularly the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> at the moment. We all remember the interesting debate of a few days ago concerning negligence and fraud, and I remind the House that when the time for voting came, the honorable member for East Sydney neglected to vote. I do not think that even the Italian navy could have caught him had it been here, so great was his speed in retiring in order that he might relieve himself of the responsibility of recording his vote. </para>
                    <para>One most important point in this measure that could have been debated at the committee stage, had time been available, related to the great changes in the social structure of the nation of which this bill is the forerunner. The significance of this measure in relation to the basic wage, for example, should certainly have received some attention, and in due course it will have to be given attention. In my view the changes that will be caused in our financial structure by the passing of this bill and its complementary measures will be so great that their reverberations will touch every person who is in receipt of the basic wage. Under the provisions of this bill it is estimated by the Government that ##£##9,000,000 will be expended. I am not a betting man, and never have been, but I should like to have the benefit of the difference between the amount that will be raised under this bill and the ##£##9,000,000 which it is estimated will be raised from the pay-roll tax in the first year of the operation of the scheme. Industry is to be taxed to provide this money, but it must also be remembered that the same industry is already being taxed to provide a basic wage which is payable to single men though it is computed on the needs of a man with a wife and one child. It is well known that the basic wage is paid to many single workmen who have no dependants. The plain fact is that the Government has paid very little attention to logic in the framing of this measure and the complementary bills which we shall later have to consider. There are certain limits beyond which it is impossible to go in the taxing of industry. Certain principles may be altered easily enough, but, if they are altered, certain consequences must inevitably follow. Hitherto it has been the practice in this country for the Arbitration Court, which is an independent tribunal, to fix the amount of the basic wage. In doing so it has taken cognizance of the needs of a man who has to support a wife and one child. That system is now to be changed. The old system was based, to a large degree at any rate, on what return the worker should give for his labour, but that principle is now being altered. Hereafter, the principle will be not ##"## to each according to what he gives ##"## but ##"##to each according to what he needs##"##. My complaint, at the moment, is that honorable members generally are not giving the consideration that they should give to such a far-reaching change. This measure will be passed because the members of the Government and the Opposition are hand-in-glove, hut there arc many factors which should be taken into consideration before such a measure as this is passed. We should clearly recognize that we are embarking upon a definitely socialistic course. If the new principle to which I have referred is to be adopted the members of the Government, and also my colleagues on this side of the chamber, should realize clearly that there are limits beyond which they will not be able to go. I compliment the Opposition upon its good fortune in having on the treasury bench a government which is prepared to go thus far, but I fear that our King Canute at the table will find himself in the same position as the King Canute of long ago. He may attempt to wave back the Labour Opposition, but he will find that they will not obey him. He may find not only that his feet will get wet but that he himself will be in danger of drowning in the flood. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable gentleman said it clearly. I tried to interrupt him on several occasions to correct his figures, but <inline font-style="italic">. I</inline> merely succeeded in causing him to repeat them. The fact is that of the ##£##13,000,000 that it is estimated will bo required for the purposes of the child endowment scheme, the State governments will provide approximately ##£##2,217,000 through their pay-roll tax. Every penny of that amount will probably be raised through taxes on incomes. That is the class of tax which certain honorable gentlemen are suggesting should be applied in order to raise the whole of the money needed. The sum of ##£##2,500,000 will accrue to Commonwealth revenue by reason of the discontinuance of the exemption of ##£##50 for income tax in respect of children. This is a direct tax on the section of the community who previously had the advantage of this exemption, and it is not entirely composed of employers. Of the ##£##13,000,000 which will be required, only ##£##6,783,000, or just about one half, will be found by means of the tax on pay-rolls. It should be generally agreed that the employers, particularly large employers, are in a position to carry this additional burden, on top of a total Commonwealth wage bill of ##£##425,000,000. It would be albsurd to suggest that the extra burden would seriously disrupt industry, and have all the effects suggested by some honorable members. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Deakin made a plea on behalf of the primary industries and those other industries which could not pass on this tax. That is a very justifiable plea, and one the significance of which I, as a representative of a rural constituency, appre ciate; but the ##£##1,040 exemption leaves out probably 90 per cent. of rural employers, and many other small employers as well. Therefore, very few of those engaged in primary industries will be called upon to pay this tax, which admittedly cannot be passed on by those industries. There are definite indications that the best way by which the money required for this scheme can be raised is by means of a pay-roll tax. In reply to the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron),</inline> I point out that we are not now discussing the Child Endowment Bill, but only a taxation measure. The historical matters which the honorable member would like to discuss could be more appropriately dealt with when the Child Endowment Bill is before the House. I submit that the third reading of this bill might well be passed without further delay. </para>

                    <para>.- Clause 3 provides for the imposition of a tax at the rate of ##£##2 10s. per cent. on all wages paid or payable by any employer in respect of any period of time occurring after the 30th June, 1941. I wish to be clear that, it is unnecessary </para>

                <para>It is necessary to deal with the problem of family allowances, regardless of the wage determined by any arbitral authority. ##"##Whether the authority should fix the basic wage high or low, so long as it took into account the family which is accepted as the standard, or determined upon some special unit of its own selection, so long would it happen that families whose members were larger than the standard or the average would suffer some disadvantage in their own households. Therefore, what we are faced with is not the problem of the minimum wage, or what is the status of labour as a class, but what is the degree of disparity between the family life of this country, as we find it in many instances, and that of the standard or average family in receipt of the wage which the courts or other authorities declare to be the minimum. So there is no relevant connexion between wage-fixingas such and a system of family allowances. </para>

                <para>Mr.CURTIN.- It includes the second, third, fourth and fifth. The general theory is that the wage takes into account a family of a certain size, and a dispute has arisen about that. The view we took twelve years ago was that, disregarding all the theories advanced throughout Australia at that time, the wage was such that at the best it could be regarded as providing for a. family in which there were only two children. The theory was that the Commonwealth court had fixed a wage allowing for three children. The minority on the royal commission came to the conclusion that at that time the court acted realistically, and not upon the theory laid down many years before, and selected the statistical average number of children for the married worker, which was approximately two. An investigation conducted by the court in Western Australia resulted in the determination of two children as the average number. A similar decision was reached in <inline font-style="italic">New</inline> South Wales some time prior to that by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Heydon, but since then the Commonwealth court, and certain other instrumentalities which fix wages, have disregarded the average or standard family as the basis on which they declare to refer in this clause to exemptions. I take it that it is sufficient to deal with the exemptions in another measure. </para>

                    <para>. - I can confidently approach the discussion of this bill now that we have passed a measure providing for the financing of the obligations contemplated under it. It would have been very difficult to have ensured that the proposal set out would be operative on the 1st July next unless the House had indicated in the most conclusive way that it was prepared to take therequisite other steps to provide the money which has to be found in order that the contemplated payments may be made. I am tempted, because of my share of the investigation of this problem in Australia, to review shortly the history of child endowment, and some of the more important developments that have marked the emergence of this proposal to the present stage of a bill which the House is asked to pass; but so much has been said, and well said, by the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> in his speech on the second reading of the bill a few days ago that my remarks would be largely a repetition of his. I should like to pay a tribute to my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Muscio,</inline> who with me subscribed to the minority report; of the Royal Commission on Child Endowment which was set up in 1927 and which presented its report to the Commonwealth Government in 1929. To-day, one derives a good deal of satisfaction from the fact that, although upon that occasion I was outvoted, the supporters of the measure are to-day in the majority. the basic wage. In 1931, the Commonwealth court disregarded the needs of the family, and computed the wage upon what it declared to be the capacity of the national income. Thus there was a 10 per cent, cut in real wages, and the justification which the court set out for that decision was not that families had changed in number, but that the economic structure of the country had so affected conditions that no longer could the court fix wages on the basis of the needs of the family. It took into account the new principle of the capacity of the country. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins said that certain industries which could not pay the standard wage which he fixed as the minimum, having regard to needs, ought not to exist. He meant that they were parasitical, and were getting their life-blood out of low standards compulsorily imposed upon the workers and upon the families of workers. There has been a great deal of parasitism in the industrial development of this and every other country in the world. If to-day employers as a class are called upon to carry a special burden in support of the family life of the country, let it be well borne in mind that generation after generation of workers has made great sacrifices in order that employers may be able to carry on industry. Thus the wheel turns. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>There is no relevant relationship between the wages fixed by arbitral authorities in Australia and a system of family allowances. Judge Beeby said quite recently that the wage now operative met the requirements of a family with one child ; if there were two children there was hardship, and if there were more than two, there was actual suffering. That cannot be denied. It is clear that something must be done nationally, in order to equate the disabilities of larger families to the standard accepted conventionally, or declared juridically, as the average or standard family. It was implied by the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> that by this arrangement we are providing for children a source of income which should free the wage of having to provide for their maintenance. I refuse to accept that argument. I say that endowment is not a full provision for the maintenance of the child, and I am not silly enough to believe that the first child will receive no benefit from this plan, even though the payment begins with the second child. The money is to he expended by the mother, and, therefore, all the children will share in the improved spending capacity of the family. Thus, though we have selected the second child as a starting point, the use to which the money is put will help to raise the status of the family, as such, in Australia. Where there is but one child, no alteration will take place, but the existing standard will not be impaired. Where there is more than one child, the family will be able, as a result of this subvention to its resources, to live according to the standard fixed and accepted for a family in which there is only one child. Thus, we shall have some corrective of the glaring social anomaly of a large family experiencing privation and making sacrifices which would not have been necessary if the family were not so large. We ought not to regard it as economically inevitable that there must be hardship if there are two, three or more children in a family. It will be urged that the mothers will not spend this money wisely, and that it would be better, as is also said in the case of maternity allowances, to give the money in kind by having more dental clinics, schools of domestic economy, and schools in which to teach girls mothercraft, and the like. I submit that, while all those things are eminently desirable, they are available, to the extent that they exist, to all children. The one-child family can share those services equally with the family in which there are two, three or four children. There is no special provision in such services for the larger family as against the smaller one. Furthermore, it is generally the case that the larger family has to go without boots, and often without sufficient clothing or proper food, disabilities from which the smaller family does not suffer. As a result of that deficiency in boots aud clothing and food, there exists a greater demand for dental clinics, and there is a greater strain on hospital accommodation. On this phase of the subject <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Muscio</inline> and myself stated - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The provision of stout boots and warm clothing, for example, may reduce the need for medical attention. Ability to pay the rent for a decent house, to buy the foods needed for building up young bodies and the clothing needed to protect thom, keeps away physical ills as well as the psychological ills of undue strain and anxiety to the father and mother, which strike at the very roots o##£## family wellbeing. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">There is no device which can be regarded as an adequate substitute for actual cash in the mother##'##s hands, for she,, better than any agent of the State, is able to use what resources are available to the best advantage of the children. She knows best what food and clothing to provide for them. If she has not the money to purchase those necessaries, it is idle to place at her disposal a beautifully constructed health-centre, or to provide schools of domestic economy for the education of her girls. It is far better to give her the means to feed and clothe her children, and thus relieve her of anxiety in that direction. If she is a constant prey to anxiety, her own health will suffer, and this in turn will be reflected in the health of her children. Therefore, this scheme represents much more than a mere subvention of money, much more than the transfer of ##£##13,000,000 from the employers to the employees ; it is a scheme for putting ##£##13,000,000 to much better use than would have been possible if the money had not been so transferred. On that point, there is a great wealth of testimony. </para>
                <para>With this hill we are, for the first time in the history of this country - except for the Maternity Allowance Act - writing into the statute-book our realization of the national significance of family life. That is not a mere platitude - that means something. There never has been any doubt of the value of the services, infinite in variety and extent, which the family renders to the nation. Primarily, it is the source of national continuance; it has supplied the human material indispensible for the production of the means of subsistence ; it provides for the replacement of the old and the dead, and is the sole guarantee for the redemption, in the future, of those obligations which previous and present generations have found it desirable to incur in order to enjoy the fullest obtainable measures of security, comfort and civilization. At the present time, we find ourselves engaged in the most terrible war ever known. Vast sums are being expended in the defence of the country against external aggression. Great liabilities are being incurred, and we are passing a great proportion of those liabilities on to those who come after us. We are incurring this expense primarily to protect ourselves, but also conscientiously to hand the country on to those who come after us. Because the national burden will thus be larger than it would otherwise have been, the only guarantee for the redemption of our obligations in the future is to ensure the existence of a fit and physically virile population to sustain the burden which will be the legacy of future difficult times. Therefore, every contribution we can make to the improvement of the health and welfare of the children now growing up is a definite contribution to the stability of the national structure in the years to come. </para>
                <para>Although improvements can, no doubt, be suggested, I feel that we ought to accept this bill. I note that the Labour Advisory Council in Melbourne stated during the week-end that the scheme had imperfections, and I daresay even the Minister will admit the truth of that. For my part, I should like to see the first child in the family of a widow eligible for benefits under the scheme, but I know that it would ##'##be merely fooling with the necessities of that family to provide 5s. for a child. The primary need there would be to make an allowance to the widow in addition to an endowment for the child. I hope that some day, and as early as possible, a system of allowances to widows with dependent children will be introduced. Then, I should like the Minister to consider, at some time to come, the wisdom of fixing the rate for the fifth, sixth and seventh children at a figure higher than for the second, third and fourth. I do not want any one to assume that this Will have any effect upon the birth-rate. I do not believe that assistance of this sort to families has anything to do with the birth-rate. In my opinion the birth-rate is determined more by considerations of family habit, and general economic, social and world conditions. Nevertheless, it would be a worthwhile thing to do, having regard to the primary purpose, which is to ease the disability which must be suffered by the large family regardless of the wage standard. </para>
                <para>It is proposed in the bill to fix the age of dependency at sixteen years. That is in accordance with the recommendation made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Muscio</inline> and myself. The gravest consequences have flowed from the assumption that dependency ceased at fourteen years, which is the age for the termination of primary education. That has led too much to the throwing of boys and girls into blind alley occupations. The average age of males on marriage in Australia is 29. When the first child reaches the age of 14 years the father is about 40 or more; but when the second and third children reach the age of 14 the father is nearly 50 years of age, and, therefore, has just about passed the zenith of his capacity to work. If he be an unskilled labourer, or a semi-skilled tradesman, the uncertainty of his own employment becomes greater because of the advancing labour army behind him which is younger and fitter. And his competitive ability is then not so great as it was. lie is being outdistanced. Unless employment be abundant, as is now the case, his periods of employment become mot##'##o intermittent and, therefore, the urge to send 1,is children to work after they have reached their fourteenth year is always present. Thus,, however, brilliant a boy may be, he is unable to continue at High School, not because his talents do not warrant it, but merely because he has to be used as an auxiliary to the family income. In this way the country loses a vast fund of potential ability, and we are forced to the conclusion that a professional career, in practice, is, for the most part, open only to the children of well-to-do parents. I say that knowing quite well the number of bursaries which are now made available, and the great, number of working-class  boys and girls who have gone on to the university. Despite that fact we have, because of our inability to give this opportunity to all boys and girls from fourteen, to sixteen years of age, lost a great part of what would otherwise be a large reservoir. Consequently, the proposal to pay child endowment in respect of children up to the age of sixteen years is splendid. It represents an improvement on some of the. schemes operating in other countries. ##]## also accept with pleasure that part of the bill which contemplates that this payment shall not be used to reduce any other benefit which is now operative. It would, be wrong if some benefit now applicable to certain sections of the community were cancelled, and this benefit substituted for it. I say, particularly to the State Governments, that whatever aid they are at present giving this proposal is not to be used by them as a substitute for that aid. It is being put forward in order to improve family life and to augment the various aids which are already beinggiven to its maintenance. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; that scheme is similar to this. This proposal extends the same benefit in a greater number of ways. I also gladly applaud the principle that there shall be no means test applied in respect of this scheme. <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Muscio</inline> and I suggested in our report a limit of income. We were faced with the fact that the Commonwealth##'##s resources wen##'## said to be depleted ; we were on the verge of an economic depression. Furthermore, a great amount of evidence was produced by employers and taxpayers##'## associations in an endeavour to show that the country could not afford even a modest plan of child endowment. I have never known a. time in the history of this, or of any other country, when the issue was faced that a tax should be imposed for social purposes, or a wage should be increased, that you could not get a wealth of evidence from the employers that, if the tax were imposed or the wage increased, the whole industrial fabric would collapse. They have been extraordinarily fertile in prophesying evil as the result of any improvement of the standard of life for the masses. Consequently, they do not frighten me to-day when they say that this tax of ##£##6,000,000 on themselves will produce industrial chaos, or will be unjust or unfair. An extra ls. a day in wages, which they could, quite easily have been called upon by a decree of the Commonwealth court to pay, would have been a sectional burden in that the whole of the community would not have had to pay it. Only the employers would have had to pay it; but it would have cost them very much more than the tax of 2^ per cent, on their pay-rolls, which has just been passed by this House. So the charges made by the honorable members for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Charles Marr)</inline> and Deakin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hutchinson)</inline> as to where I stand in that respect leaves my withers entirely unwrung.  The employers can afford to pay that ##£##6,000,000, and they can afford it for no better purpose than that for which the Government intends to use it. The general principle of the bill is one which for years in Australia has had almost unanimous public support. There has been a great deal of controversy as to the way in which child, endowment should be applied, but outside the New South Wales scheme and this scheme, no specific legislative proposals as to how it should be applied have been made. This is the first proposal on a national basis to be made the subject of legislation. Tlie bill brings into its scope 1,000,000 of the 1,S00,000 children in Australia under the age of sixteen years. The 800,000 children who are excluded belong to either  one-child  families, or are the first in larger families. The bill will apply to 1,000,000 children who belong to ##"####&gt;##00,000 families in Australia. Therefore, it can be regarded as nation-wide in its scope. It provides for the family which, in present circumstances, has the hardest path to follow. It. covers, furthermore, the misfortunes of seasonal occupation and intermittent unemployment which are the regular routine conditions of labour. We have in this device, at least, the first continuous assurance of income regardless of what happens to the father. This allowance will continue whether the father suffers unemployment or not. It would be a mistake to regard this legislation as other than a subvention. It is an aid to family standards ; it is not a provision for family standards. Men will, still have to work. Upon the man who works devolves, properly, the major responsibility for the maintenance of his wife and children. This is not an easement of the primary obligation devolving upon him. Rather is it an incentive to him to do his best so that by his own exertion he can provide for them as well as he humanly can. In peace, or war, the worker is exposed to a variety of hazards which it is beyond his capacity to control, unci as the result he cannot make that provision for his family which he would otherwise make. Thus the obligation of the nation, through its legislature, to make provision for his family is an obligation which should have been met a long time ago. </para>

                <para>This is one of a series of social services which the Commonwealth Parliament must, in the years to come, regard as being more and more obligatory on the National Parliament, and less and less to be left to the States, to initiate. Every social service which a State initiates imposes a particular burden on the taxpayers of that State. It places them at a disadvantage in comparison with residents of other States in industrial development, and in competition with other States. Therefore, the only fair way to levy the taxpayers of Australia is by a Commonwealth-wide scheme, whether it be for widows##'## pensions, or family allowances. Indeed, that applies io the great mass of social services. I accept with satisfaction the principle which was stated by the Minister in his speech several days ago that the use of inoney in. social services and the promotion of human welfare is as legitimate it use of money as is its investment in land, factories or in any other material asset. This nation consists of not, only physical, but al.=o human, values. For too long wc have failed to appreciate that human values have a paramount claim upon us, and. indeed, are more important economically than material values. In any case all of us, as a nation, are now facing the##'## great; ordeal of surviving the war. We are, of necessity, brought closer together by the fact that we share the one fate; be it victory, I pray; but if it be defeat, it will none the less be the one fate for all the citizens of this country. To th##«## degree that this merging of each individual in the fate of the nation has been forced upon us by the state of the world, and to the degree that that brings n.##«## nearer to each other than has hitherto been the case, I hope that that approximation, between the Opposition and Ministers, to which the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> referred this afternoon - and it is only because, of an accidental fit of temperament that he is not one of them - shall, in this country, give to the children who are now being born, and the youth and mothers of Australia, the assurance that their needs at any rate shall be placed beyond the hazards of political controversy, and that no future Government will deal with this legislation which we are now passing except to widen and improve it. We shall not retrace this step; no economic burden which this scheme imposes shall be regarded as insuperable. If economic trouble in the immediate future, or in years to come, should involve something being dispensed with, then there are a number of other economies which this country can afford to make with greater regard for the welfare of our citizens than any economy at the expense of legislation of this kind. </para>

I am enthusiastically in favour of child endowment, but I do not want the risk of unconstitutionality to pass unnoticed. Therefore, I should like an assurancefrom the Minister that the Commonwealth has power to give effect to this measure. Speaking in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly on the New South Wales child endowment legislation and replying to a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. S.</inline> M.

                    <para class="block">I fully appreciate that, during the continuance of the war and; for twelve months thereafter, the Commonwealth has sufficient power under the National Security Act and the regulations framed under  it,  to pass legislation such as this. We should be perfectly certain, however, that the Parliament does not rely on that power alone. If there be any doubt on that point, we should immediately ask the States to pass the necessary legislation before introducing complementary legislation in this Parliament, or, alternatively ask the States to hand over to the Commonwealth full power  to  organize and control a national scheme of child endowment. I am sure that the Minister has considered the risks inherent in legislation of this kind, but I should like an assurance from him that he is satisfied beyond doubt that the Commonwealth has the necessary power to proceed with it. I have been happy to be associated with the initiation of a child endowment scheme. I should like to see associated with this proposal a national undertaking for the eradication of slums and a national health insurance scheme providing for hospital, medical and dental treatment for a man, his wife, and family. I trust that these schemes will be given a prominent place in the new order which we hope to establish and that at the appropriate time the Parliament will pass the necessary legislation to give effect to them. </para>

                    <para>. -  Many honorable members on this side of the House are just as enthusiastic about child endowment as a theory as are honorable members opposite; hut very many people in this country are not satisfied that this is a suitable time for the introduction of such a proposal. The benefits of any scheme such as this depend entirely on what may be the outcome of the war. This is not a time for advantages to be gained by, or distributed to,- sections of the community except those which, in the general interests of the Commonwealth as a whole, should be supported##'##. One of the difficulties associated with the provision of benefits of this kind is that we never seem to do things on a scale comparable with other parts of the world. I remember referring to that aspect of our problem when the National Insurance legislation was debated in the Parliament a few years ago. I then moved an amendment which sought to reduce the qualifying income from ##£##365 to ##£##315, which was approximately the figure adopted in Great Britain, plus 25 per cent, exchange. My purpose was to bring about some degree of equality with other parts of the Empire. However, my amendment was not carried and, finally, the National Insurance legislation was dropped and has remained in abeyance ever since. We are not by any means certain that that will not be the fate of the child endowment scheme. If the bill now before us be passed our war effort will not be increased one iota; on the contrary, it will bc reduced. How can we expend a large sum of money on a child endowment scheme without reducing the amount available for war purposes? I come now to the question of the propriety of the scheme; whether child endowment in itself is desirable. I do not believe that anybody in Australia would assent to the proposition that a married man with dependent children should not be paid more than a bachelor, and conversely, there are a great many people in this country who would not assent to the proposition that a bachelor##'##s standard should be on the basis of the needs of a man, his wife and either one, two or three children. Those honorable members who are so keen on this scheme have so far completely evaded that point. The honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> has dealt fairly effectively with the constitutionality of this legislation. It is possible that during the war this bill and the measure that preceded it may have constitutional backing; but it is evident from the legal opinions of the eminent lawyers mentioned by the honorable member for Moreton that in time of peace its constitutionality is, to say the least, doubtful. </para>

                <para>Apart from the passage of war legislation, has anything occurred since those opinions were stated which has radically altered the position? To assist it in its deliberations the royal commission sought the assistance of the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn),</inline> among others. I ask the honorable member frankly is he certain that this bill would be upheld if its constitutionality were challenged in the courts? </para>

                <para class="block">The majority opinion was that there was no power vested in the Commonwealth to bring in a child endowment scheme except, first, by referendum under section 128 of the Constitution - and that has not been done; secondly, by a reference by the States under paragraph xxxvii of section 51 of the Constitution - and that has not been made; or thirdly, in an indirect way by handing over the funds collected by the Commonwealth for distribution by the States, as was done under the Federal Aid Roads Act - and that is not intended. It is obvious, I think, that the man in the street will be extremely doubtful of the validity of this bill. The Maternity Allowance legislation is also of doubtful constitutionality, but. nobody has been sufficiently directly affected by it to test it in the courts. Can anybody suggest, however, that in due season nobody will he sufficiently interested to test the validity of the bill now before us? Even while I have been a member of Parliament, the legislature has passed many bills and agreed to many regulations, a large number of which were subsequently declared invalid. It would he calamitous, as the majority report says, if the High Court held this legislation to be unconstitutional. </para>

It would be easy for me to ask other honorable members why they did not foresee this war; I foresaw it; but that does not help us very much. When the Minister jumped back historically to William. Pitt, he was on sounder ground. The Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> and he both emphasized that it was desirable to increase the size of families in Australia. About this subject a good deal of misconception exists. As one form of encouragement, the Government instituted the maternity allowance, which, it might not be realized, has cost the country to date ##£##15,250,000 and at least ##£##370,000 to administer. Would any one claim that the payment of maternity allowances has resulted in the increase of the number or size of families in the Commonwealth? </para>

In my opinion, it is not likely to have such a result. In practically every European country, the decline of the birth-rate has been on a similar scale. That fact is not generally realized. </para>

                        <para>- HUGHES. - Everything is relative. It is useless to assert that we are going to pieces, if every other country is going to pieces in exactly the same way. For the benefit of honorable memberswho have not, delved into the subject, I shall cite some countries in which the birth-rate compares with our own. I obtained my information from <inline font-style="italic">Whitaker##'##^ Almanac,</inline> which is usually accurate. The statistics of birth-rate for each 1,000 of population are: Australia 17.4, New Zealand 17.3 Belgium, 15.3, Canada 20.21, Czechoslovakia 17.9, Denmark 18.0, England and Wales 15.9, Finland 18.0, France 14.7, Germany 18. S, the Netherlands 20.3, Norway 14.6, Scotland 17.6, Sweden 14.3, Switzerland 15.9 and the United States of America 17. The statistics for Germany surprised me; they are not much better than our own. From those figures it is useless to lament the falling away of the birthrate in the Commonwealth, when a similar decline is occurring in practically every European country and also in the United States of America. Countries in which the decline is less marked include Russia 44.1, Spain 26.3, Italy 22.9, Portugal 28.4, and outside Europe, Japan 31 and Egypt 42.9. The conclusion which I draw from the? information is that it is futile to declare that we must improve the birthrate in Australia because we are going backwards since the decline is proceeding relatively at the same speed as in various European country and also in the United hers examine the figures critically they will notice that the birthrate in countries with a democratic form of government tends to go down more than in countries with other forms of government. When the Minister spoke about producing new families, he forgot that migration is another method of securing population for this country. Many people, including members of the Labour party, do not desire to foster migration. </para>

                        <para>- I have not said anything of the kind. What I do say is that it would be better for every body to have three-quarters of a loaf than for some to have a whole loaf and others none at all. Another reason why I am not in favour of this hill is that it was not a plank in the election platform propounded by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Menzies),  nor, in my own inferior way, was it a part of my platform. I was asked about this matter during the election campaign, and my reply to the electors was probably similar to what I have said to-night, namely, that at present the country cannot afford these additional social services. Social services in Australia are already on a very high scale. </para>

                        <para>- In the majority report of the royal commission the total annual expenditure of the Australian community on welfare services and organized charities, ##&amp;##c., was given as ##£##27,000,000. There was a further expenditure, the report stated, of nearly ##£##10,000,000 under the heading of education, science and art. The report then gave other details of expenditure on social services, and finally, in paragraph 709, gave the total Commonwealth and State expenditure on welfare services, pensions and education as approximately ##£##37,000,000 a year. Since thenwe have added about ##£##10,000,000 a year for pensions, and (apart from the ##£##13,000,000 added by this measure) the annual total must pass the ##£##50,000,000 mark. That is getting very close to the value of the whole of our wool exports, which is our main form of new income. I do not wish to overstress the matter, but I should like to make it quite clear that our social services are already on a very high scale indeed, and it will probably be impossible for them to be maintained just as it will be impossible for the income of anybody, whether he be rich, moderately rich, or poor, to be maintained. I do not hesitate to repeat what I said throughout my election campaign.: I said that in my opinion we are in for a very bad time and that the standard of living of all ofus is bound to come down. I see no possible alternative; and therefore I do not approve of steps designed to put certain sections of the community, not necessarily in immediate need, on a preferential basis to others. I am sure that is also the view of a good many of my electors who are thoroughly in favour of making personal sacrifices. Of course it is very easy to talk of equality of sacrifice, but that was certainly the idea in the minds of electors of varying standards of means, in the State which I represent. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly, and I should not even go so far as to say that they are wrong. Such views are purely matters of opinion, and I give my opinion for what it is worth. I may be wrong and the others may be right, but I still claim the right to express my opinion which is not given hastily, but after some consideration. Speaking of election platforms, we all know of many instances in which members of parliament have promised a great deal at election time and who have failed to honour their promises, but I have heard of no instance such as this in which we are doing something which we have not promised to do. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot construe what has been described to me as so many historical moments. So many historical bills have been carried and so many historical deeds have been done that the word has come to have no particular significance. This scheme is very illogical. Perhaps that is not surprising when it is considered that the first step taken in the fixing of the basic wage was in itself illogical. Among the illogical features of this measure is the fact that a great many persons will not be able to pass on the tax, whilst there are others who can and who will pass it on. The Government cannot prevent them from doing so. There are many others including primary producers who will not be able to pass it on. Fortunately a large majority of that section of the community is to be excluded from the operations of this legislation. </para>

                        <para>- I am in favour of their exclusion. It is one of the reasons why I consider the pay-roll tax is the better method of financing the scheme. It is also illogical that well-to-do people who do not employ much, or any, labour will escape payment of the tax. Then there is the case of the country man who has two sons, he is not on the basic wage, and so he will receive no child endowment for the first-born son. Further, the question of conflict with State wage-fixing tribunals must be considered. The industrial court in Queensland has now increased the basic wage in that State by 5s. a week, at a time when the Commonwealth Parliament is dealing with this analogous if not similar problem of child endowment. These considerations show that there is no logical reasoning expressed by the bill. Then the question of finance must be considered. The honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Evatt)</inline> has stated that the scheme of child endowment embodied in the bill is only a beginning - with an amount of ##£##13,000,000 to be distributed annually!

                        is expected to urge the party to-day not to risk postponing the passage of tile bill through Parliament because in the event of a grave turn in the international situation another opportunity to secure an important piece of social legislation like child endowment may not occur again for a long time.

                <para>The introduction of the scheme now is a form of gambling on the future safety of Australia. The present, when Australian economy might be on the verge of collapse, is not the time to scramble for benefits. Real unity in Australia cannot be obtained when special benefits are being conferred on different sections of the people. It is clear that, as a consequence of the increasing dearth of shipping, we are to experience the greatest difficulty in shipping our primary products overseas. It might be retorted, ##"## Why bother about primary products?##"## My answer would be that they represent nineteentwentieths of our exports ; only about 5 per. cent, of our exports are of secondary production. The primary producers have been bringing into Australia the new money which has enabled this country to progress, and surely if any section is to obtain special benefits, their interests must be considered as their claims become more urgent. Different sections will apply to the Government for assistance as the situation becomes graver, and the wisest policy in the interests of Australia would be to satisfy those whose need is the most pressing. My remark that the first reason why I opposed the bill which preceded this at the present juncture is because we are at war was greeted with some laughter. Many people do not seem to have the slightest notion that this country is at war. One has only to walk along the main streets of our principal cities to gain the impression that many people do not realize that our existence as a nation is being saved by a few thousands of our own men and the great might of the British Empire. The present is not the time when we should do anything to reduce our war effort. The more sectional benefits are granted, the more certain it will be that the eyes of our people will turn towards themselves and they will neglect to look beyond Australia and take heed of the tremendous events occurring overseas. I do not suppose many Australians feel that we need to study the attitude of the United States of America to gain a valuable lesson, because that country is not at war. However, we should take to heart the words of  President  Roosevelt, uttered in his broadcast address on the 16th March last, and ask ourselves whether we are acting according to his convictions.

                    <para>- The honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Duncan-Hughes)</inline> directed to me some questions which I endeavoured to answer across the chamber. I know that answers given in that way are capable of being misunderstood and I do not want to bc misunderstood. The honorable gentleman referred to a number of questions to which several lawyers were invited by a royal commission on child endowment in 1928 to give answers. I answered those questions and, although I have not refreshed my memory by looking at. the commission##'##s report and the opinions I gave, I fancy that the view expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Owen Dixon, who was then at the bar, was in agreement with my view. I have heard for the first time the quotations from the speech made in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales by the honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Evatt),</inline> but as a statement of what the Constitution provides what he said then was unimpeachable. With possible qualifications, it is equally unimpeachable now. I think that the Commonwealth Parliament definitely has no more constitutional authority to pass a measure providing for child endowment or family allowances than it had constitutional authority to provide for maternity allowances. The honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Duncan-Hughes)</inline> said that the maternity allowances legislation was not challenged and he seems to regard that as entirely an accident. In my view it was not an accident. There is nowhere in Australia any means of obtaining the court##'##s decision as to the  validity of an act of Parliament except as an incident to litigation. There must be a plaintiff and a defendant. There must be a party who bases his claim upon the questioned act or a party who bases his defence upon that act. To decide whether that claim or that defence is well founded the court may be compelled to consider and decide whether the questioned act is valid or invalid. Only in this way can the legislation of the Commonwealth be challenged and that principle applies to this legislation now proposed. My view is that the only authorities who could challenge this legislation would be the State governments of Australia on the ground that the Commonwealth Parliament, having appropriated this money for purposes over which it has no  legisla-ti  ve power, has admitted that it was surplus revenue which belonged to the States. Political considerations would deter the State governments from attacking the Commonwealth scheme of child endowment. The State governments are responsible to the very people whom the scheme seeks to benefit. Honorable members will remember how the Federal Aid Roads legislation was challenged on that basis. The Commonwealth Parliament passed legislation which provided that money should be given for the purpose of enabling the </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">States under Commonwealth direction and on conditions prescribed by the Commonwealth to build roads. The States said that it was quite true that they wanted to build roads, but that they wanted their own governments to have the credit, and that they did not want to do the work on conditions prescribed by the Commonwealth. They claimed that the Commonwealth, by using money in that way, had admitted that it was their money. The present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> gave an opinion which was supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fullagar,</inline> K.C., to that effect and I heard that opinion read to the Victorian Legislative Assembly by the Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Allan. Notwithstanding that opinion, the High Court decided that the Commonwealth could give money to the States on any conditions that it thought fit. Of course, that is the position to which the honorable member for Barton referred in his speech in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales. It was a speech probably in support of the view that, instead of the Commonwealth entering this sphere independently, it should assist the State of New South Wales in the work which it was already doing in that direction. I know that at least one of the States had been advised that the Commonwealth Parliament has not the constitutional power to pass this legislation applying the principle I have stated, I should think that the only parts of the legislation which could be successfully attacked in court by persons having competent rights to attack are the penal provisions, clause 24, for instance. If the validity of that provision were challenged in court the decision might be that the Commonwealth Parliament had no power to pass this legislation at all and therefore the clause was bad. In the opinion I gave to the royal commission I suggested a way round that difficulty which ! do not propose to discuss now. I should think, however, that in war time, having regard to the Commonwealth##'##s enlarged powers, it would be very unlikely that even that could be challenged successfully, l t seems to me entirely wrong to regard the Constitution as the sword of Damocles which, <inline font-style="italic">in terrorem,</inline> prevents the Commonwealth from doing anything at all. The American attitude is different. In the United States of America legislation invalidated ##'##by the Supreme Court is passed again and again until after a few years the majority of judges against it becomes a minority. For instance, legislation for the prevention of child labour was brought up time after time until the majority went with the administration. The Constitution has, after all, a meaning which expands with the growth of the community and the growing needs of the community. The most striking instance of that is this - I have cited it before - In  1915  when the Labour Conference outside and the Labour Caucus and the Government had resolved to put to the country proposals rejected in  1911  and  1913  for the expansion of Commonwealth powers, my predecessor, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anstey,</inline> incurred a great deal of obloquy by contending that there was no need to alter the Constitution, because in time of war any government possessed the powers proposed to be sought. He was no lawyer and his opinion was scouted not only by the Prime Minister but also by the then Prime Minister##'##s legal advisers. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran, I think, advised that the High Court would hold any attempt by the Commonwealth to regulate prices under its war powers as invalid, but, nevertheless, in the next year or two, the High Court held that it was valid. A former member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> told me the story. He asked <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran, ##"## What about your opinion of  1915?##"##  and##'## <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran replied, ##"##That was in  1915,  and the High Court would not have decided that way in  1915  ##"##. That is the real thing. We have to remember that the Constitution is not something the meaning of which was definitely stereotyped in  1900  for good and all. It is designed for a growing community with everchanging needs and desires, and it expands from time to time as the community whose vesture it is expands. </para>

                    <para>.- I congratulate the Government upon the introduction of this measure. There is no need for me to reiterate the speeches of the Minister for Labour and National Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> because they very fully  covered the history of the movement for child endowment and the case for its introduction <inline font-style="italic">on the present</inline> basis. I do, however, intend to make one or two other observations arising particularly out of some general remarks that have been made. I contest the statement that this is not an opportune time for the introduction of child endowment. I do not agree that the introduction of child endowment should be deferred until the termination of the war. If we are sincere in the statements that we make about what we are pleased to call a new social order to come after the war, then this is the time for some instalment to be made in respect of those promises. We should not hesitate to give effect to at least child endowment at this stage. I regard the introduction of an Australiawide scheme of child endowment as an indication of an evolutionary social outlook not only in Australia but also throughout the world. If Australia is to take its place among the greater nations it is fitting that it should display its political courage in the introduction of a scheme of this description. </para>

                <para>I am pleased that this bill does not include provisions which I regard as blemishes in other social service measures at present operative in this country. With the possible exception of the maternity allowance, child endowment will probably be the first complete social service of this nation. The blemishes to which I have referred, relate principally to the establishment of poverty standards. Most of the existing social services are not provided as the inherent right of the people, but are dependent upon the outcome of some form of inquisition. I have no desire to reflect adversely upon those responsible for the administration, but I am glad that such disfigurements are not to be found in this scheme and I hope that they will not mar the additional social services which I trust will follow in the train of this one. </para>

                <para>The Government is to be commended for having introduced what is a true child endowment scheme without any restrictions as to family income. I am glad too that this is to be a social service and not an adjunct to the basic wage system. I regard this as a sound principle, the advantages of which will be clearly realized. in the near future. Australia is as fully justified in making this investment in humanity at present, as it is in making investments of other descriptions. Past investments by the State governments in respect of education and health have returned substantial dividends, and I believe that this Commonwealth investment in humanity will also  return dividends of immense value to the nation. I trust that the bill will receive the unanimous approval of honorable members, for, in my opinion, it will yield benefits to the nation as a whole, the extent of which it is impossible for us at present to conceive. </para>
                <para>I have no desire to enter the field of constitutional controversy. In fact, I wish to keep entirely clear of it. Yet I express the hope that in the not distant future the Commonwealth Parliament will find ways and means to put into operation child welfare measures to supplement its child endowment scheme. I also look forward to the day when the Commonwealth Government will accept responsibility for a nation-wide scheme of pensions for widows. This National Parliament should also, in due course, undertake fuller responsibility in respect of housing and employment. These things may not all come at once, hut the step in the right direction which the Government is now taking must inevitably lead to further advances. </para>
                <para>The administration of this scheme should be simplified and decentralized to the greatest possible degree. As post offices under the control of the Commonwealth Government are to be found in every part of Australia, I hope that the Government will use these facilities in connexion with child endowment. It is also desirable that the details of the scheme shall be so drafted as to make unnecessary on the part of the people either lengthy correspondence or a wide knowledge of administrative details. The administration of the scheme should be designed on simple lines. I have had a good lead of experience of child endowment in New South Wales and I know that many difficulties can arise through lengthy correspondence. </para>

                        <para>- Not necessarily. I merely suggest that it would be wise for the Government to make officers available at post offices in numerous centres throughout the country to deal specially with inquiries and applications in respect of child endowment. I trust also that child endowment payments will be made by cheque. Our post offices offer a convenient method of delivering cheques to persons entitled to child endowment payments. It should not be necessary for people to call at post offices in order to collect their payments. Under the child endowment scheme of New South Wales cheques are posted fortnightly to persons entitled to the payments, and the scheme has proved remarkably successful. Only a minimum of clerical work is necessary. The cheques are prepared on machines and one girl is able to issue many thousands of cheques in a day. No administrative difficulties should be encountered in operating a cheque scheme through the post offices. </para>

                        <para>- Perfectly ; and the Minister will remember the remarks I intend to make longer than I shall remember the question asked by me. Despite the fact that the officers under his charge are in a particularly difficult position with regard to this royal commission, the Minister knew nothing of what was happening. I then asked the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> the same question. I wanted to know whether the commission was sitting, and what was its personnel. The Attorney-General, to whom I was politely referred by the Minister for the Army, informed me that he knew nothing about the commission. Yet the commission sat to-day in Sydney, and held a preliminary investigation ! The Attorney-General is responsible for the appointment of a commission that met to-day, yet he said that he knew nothing about it. We now discover, on the statement by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr.Fadden), that the commission was appointed on the 28th March, but the Attorney-General who is in charge of the department responsible for the appointment of the commission, knows nothing about it three days later. That, 1 think, is sufficient toopen the eyes of the people of Australia as to the general administration of this Government. One Minister whose officers are seriously involved in the inquiry knows nothing about the commission, and another Minister whose responsibility it is to deal with the legal formalities of the matter knows nothing about the commission three days after its appointment! </para>

                <para>I do not wish to again go over ground that I covered last week, but I reiterate that the constitution of the  commission which sat in New South Wales, and which had very restricted terms of reference, is precisely the same commission as will conduct the Commonwealth investigation. Again I say, despite all challenges made here and in the press, that nobody represented the public interest at the meetings of the New South Wales commission. Owing to the manner in which certain evidence was presented to the commissioner, he was not in a position to come to a decision that would adequately meet the situation. Yet we now find that exactly the same commissioner has been appointed by the Commonwealth Government. Despite any arguments which the Minister for the Army or the Attorney-General may submit, the fact cannot be denied that, because the case was not presented to the commissioner in New South Wales in its entirety, it is quite conceivable that, with regard to the other section of the bread scandal that has now to be investigated, the commissioner will find himself in a difficult position because of the decision already reached by him. I have not challenged the honesty or legal ability of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Maxwell. </para>

I did not in any way reflect upon either the character or legal ability of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Maxwell, but for the reasons which I had already stated, and which I repeat to-night, I think it was bad taste on the part of the Government to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Maxwell to take on what is, perhaps, the most important part of the inquiry after it knew that there had been presented to him only half of the ease in the State inquiry. That <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shand</inline> should be appointed to assist the Commissioner after his performance in the State case is even more reprehensible, if the Government really wants to get to the bottom of this business. I doubt, however, whether it does. I say to the Minister for the Army that he ought not to take the attitude he does when questions are asked regarding the conduct of certain persons in the Army. He ought not to presume that, because honorable members suggest that there is something wrong in the administration of the Army, they are making a personal attack on him. He ought not to come to this chamber with statements prepared by high administrative officers as answers to members##'## questions, and put them over here as if he were responsible for them, without ever questioning their accuracy beforehand. </para>

                        <para>- I refer to the statement prepared by the chief inspector that a certain contractor had fallen down on the job. The Minister first put that statement forward as if it were his own, but when he was challenged on portions of his comments, he crawled out by saying that it was not his statement at all, but the report of one of his officers. If honorable members of this House and of the Senate were to put before Parliament collectively the information in their possession regarding the general administration of the Department of the Army the Minister would be. in a very serious position. I advise him in the most friendly way not to treat every inquiry as if it were hostile, and not to accept unchallenged the reports of his administrative officers, but to go into matters a little more deeply. Despite the fact that thousands of men in the Army are prepared to sacrifice their lives in defence of the country, there are others connected with the Army in vital positions who are not fit to hold their jobs. The Minister is standing to-day over a cesspit of corruption, and when the framework of defence which he has built for his own officers collapses, as it will, he will collapse with them. I am only asking for a reasonable investigation. Since this matter was first raised in the House, a good many people have come forward with information. One person has placed in my possession a fifteen-page statement, which. I do not propose to read to the House, but I shall give to honorable members the gist of it. </para>

                        <para>- It may be placed before the Commissioner if the person concerned is given proper legal representation. On the 23rd October, 1939, the statement alleges, McLeod Brothers, who were then in control of the Abbco Bread Company Proprietary Limited, for a consideration of ##£##1, gave an option of purchase over their business to a certain agent in Sydney, the .price quoted being ##£##24,000, the option to expire within one calendar month. So anxious were McLeod Brothers, who have been the defendants in the short-weight bread case, to sell the bakery, and the flour-mill as well, for ##£##24,000, that they actually undertook to pay the person who effected the introduction to the prospective purchaser the sum of ##£##500 for his services should the sale be effected. On the 21st October, the person holding the option was given an agency document to proceed to Melbourne to interview certain government officials. First he interviewed the Prime Minister##'##s private secretary, and then on the 24th October, he was passed on to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hayter,</inline> secretary to the Minister for the Army. Later he was passed on to a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pedlar,</inline> and ultimately  Colonel Morris  took him to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Massey,</inline> who informed him that he had been already supplied with details of his proposition by the Prime Minister##'##s Department. When this person met <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Massey,</inline> who apparently is head of the Department of Supply, he told <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Massey</inline> that, if it purchased McLeod##'##s interests, the Commonwealth Government could save 30 per cent, on the cost of bread  by cutting down transport costs, and by utilizing the by-products such as semolina,  bran  and pollard. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Massey</inline> asked what price he was prepared to quote for the supply of bread for the Army, and the agent quoted 3s. 6d. a dozen. On the 26th October, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Massey</inline> told the agent that he had been instructed to proceed to Sydney to interview the principals. On the 6th November, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Massey</inline> went to Sydney, and there saw one of the McLeod brothers. The parties met at Asbestos House, in, York-street, where </para>

                        <para>- This happened on the 6th November, 1939. A difficulty then arose. Other interests were anxious to be ##"## in ##"## on the deal. When it was discovered that the gentleman who held the option was going to make a ##"## chop ##"## out of it, apparently the solicitor acting on behalf of McLeod Brothers and the firm##'##s accountants became interested. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Massey</inline> was pressing the negotiator to supply all of the documents, including the deeds, associated with the business, but, strangely, every effort this man made to obtain the documents was sabotaged. He suspected collusion between the solicitor, the accountant and McLeod Brothers, to prevent him from obtaining them, until such time as his option had expired. Ultimately, they stalled him off until the day before the option expired, and even then refused to hand over the documents, so that the Government had then to negotiate with McLeod Brothers for the purchase of the bakery and flour mills. Next, they went into conference with Massey and White oh the terms of purchase by the Commonwealth. <inline font-style="italic">##[##Leave to continue given.##]##</inline> McLeod Brothers, who, originally, were so anxious to dispose of their bakery and flour mills that they were prepared to pay ##£##500 for a mere introduction to a purchaser, suddenly went cold on the deal. But immediately after the negotiations for the sale of the plant for ##£##24,000 fell through, McLeod Brothers secured the Government bread contract. Every body knows now just what happened with regard to the supply of bread to the Commonwealth under that contract. This revelation discloses a fresh aspect of the matter. I am not pleading the case of the gentleman who was interested in this matter as the holder of the option, because he, like any other speculator, was in the deal for what he could get out of it. But when it is apparent that corrupt practices of  this kind in the supply of material to the Army and other Defence departments are going on, it is up to the Commonwealth to use anybody and any method to ##"## clean up ##"## those who are responsible for such practices. That is my only concern in repeating this man##'##s story. I hold no particular brief for him. He was out to buy as cheaply as possible from McLeod Brothers, and to sell to the Commonwealth at as high a figure as he could get. He was holding, for one month, an option of purchase on the very small deposit of ##£##1. However, his statement gives rise to speculation as to why McLeod Brothers, who were so anxious to sell, suddenly broke off negotiations, and preferred to take a Government contract for the supply of bread. It may he that the royal commission appointed by this Government will discover why the bread contract was more profitable than the sale of the business. That is a matter in which the Government and the commission should be interested. I have seen an alleged copy of an agreement signed by McLeod to give this man half of the profits from the sale of bread to the Army, providing that the contract lasted for six months. McLeod Brothers double-crossed this gentleman in respect of not only the sale, but also the promise to give him 50 per cent, of the profits made under the Army contract. I understand that he has taken legal proceedings in order to recover what he considers to be his share of the profits under that contract. That aspect of the matter also should be investigated. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that that will be done. These people were prepared to sell their business for ##£##24,000, and were so anxious to do so that they were prepared to give ##£##500 to the mere introducer of a purchaser, yet when government officials had actually gone to Sydney to complete the sale something went wrong. The sale was not effected, and, apparently, McLeod Brothers thought it better to supply bread under their army contract. In view of the circumstances in which the commission appointed by the Government of New South Wales carried out its investigation, I repeat that the Commonwealth Government would have shown better taste had it appointed some other judge as a royal commissioner to investigate this matter. From communications which I have received since this matter was raised in the House, I find that a considerable body of opinion outside, consisting not of irresponsibles, but including many members of the legal profession, is not satisfied that at the last commission <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shand</inline> was appearing in the public interest to assist the commissioner to the best of his ability. I believe that the White contract is the kernel of the matter. Because of the importance of that contract, the methods by which it was gained, and the circumstances in which it was finalized and carried out, I believe that the Government should provide legal representation for White in order that the matter may be investigated (thoroughly^ It is no new thing, I understand, for legal representation to be provided by the Commonwealth in such circumstances. That course was followed in connexion with other inquiries, including the investigation into the contract for additions to the Sydney General Post Office. I do not know whether White is in a position to afford adequate legal representation in order to ensure that the letting and losing of his contract will foe properly investigated. But I think that any persons who can throw light on this matter, regardless of who they are - and I hold no brief for any one - ought to be in the position that when they appear before the commission their case will be properly presented; and if they are not adequately represented by the gentleman who is supposed to be assisting the commission in the public interest, they should be provided with legal representation in order to ensure that, at least from their point of view, the whole matter will be sifted to the bottom. </para>

                    <para>. -  In view of the remarks just made by the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear),</inline> it is  appropriate to ask- honorable members to cast their minds back over the short history of the appointment of this royal commission. ##"##When the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McCall)</inline> pressed for the appointment of a commission, he was told, by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden),</inline> I think, that his request would be considered. Then, shortly afterwards, I believe, I stated to the House that I had been in touch with the Attorney-General of New South Wales with a view to making <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Maxwell available as a royal commissioner to inquire into the matter. My recollection is that it was at that time, or very shortly afterwards, that the honorable member for Dalley suggested that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Maxwell should not be granted this commission until after he had expressed his findings in respect of the commission given to him by the State. I fell in with that suggestion, and when the draft terms of reference of the commission were determined, I a dumb rated them in this House some time last week. I then indicated that the Government desired the fullest inquiry into the matter. It is idle for any honorable member to say that the Government regards the criticism which has been directed against the Abbco bread contract as reflecting personally upon any Minister, or that any Minister adopts a attitude of hostility because his department has been criticized. So far as I am concerned, all of these facts relate to a period long before I took over the administration of the Department of the Army. The Government invited the Leader of the Opposition to assist it in drafting and completing the terms of reference, and subsequently the suggestions made by  the Leader of the Opposition were incorporated in the commission issued- to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Maxwell. If the matter to which the honorable member for Dalley has referred is not covered by them they will be extended. There is no desire to shield any one. The allegations are of prime concern to the Government. I admit that there may be many causes of complaint in respect of the Department of the Army, just as there are in any other big department in time of war ; but I assure honorable members that if any one is responsible for an improper act or negligent conduct, the commission will be invited to indicate to the Government and to the people who those persons are, and I promise that they will be dealt with. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Let me indicate the basis of the suggestions made in respect of this commission. It is said, first, that the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Maxwell is, in the circumstances, an unfortunate one, and that his judgment may be prejudiced by what has already taken place. On examination, that criticism appears to be of as much value as the allegation made by the honorable member against the counsel who appeared for the Crown, whom I acknowledge as a friend and one who, whilst I was at the bar, earned a reputation for integrity, honour and ability. I have made it quite plain that I would defend him just as I would defend anybody else who, in my judgment, rightly bore that reputation. Naturally, the honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Evatt)</inline> supported the view I expressed regarding <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shand.</inline></para>

                        <para>- The cold fact is that the whole document was tendered to the commission. The honorable member uses the plea that the learned judge, a man trained in testing evidence, did not notice the document, and that counsel charged with the responsibility of seeing that the public interest was served, deliberately failed to refer to it. I say with great respect that the very fact that an honorable member bases his charge on such flimsy grounds shows how little reliance can be placed upon his allegations. The honorable member apparently does not like being told these things. He has challenged the integrity of the man charged with the responsibility of representing the public interest. It is easy to make such allegations in this chamber, but it is a different thing to make them outside, where there would be ways of testing what inquiry he made before he made his allegations. Upon this flimsy fabric the honorable member built up the charge against this man. What this Parliament is concerned with is the allegation that the Government has appointed to this commission a man who will not represent the public interest. I say with respect that when it is shown that the charge has no foundation, it follows that this counsel who bears a reputation for integrity and ability at the bar may be safely charged with the conduct of assisting the commission. I think the House will be satisfied that the man who has been chosen to assist the commission is one whose reputation and ability are such as to enable him to sift every piece of evidence that comes before him. </para>

The issue of royal commissions is under the control of the Prime Minister##'##s Department. Apparently the charge now is that the findings of this commission will be a whitewash just as it has been so irresponsibly alleged the findings of the first commission were. That of course involves a charge against counsel which I submit is groundless and, secondly, it involves a suggestion that the judge who sat upon the first commission cannot properly and impartially discharge his functions upon the Commonwealth commission. </para>

                        <para>- They are, and when charges of this description are made one expects them to be supported by substantial evidence. Let us examine the basis of this particular charge. The fact is that the commission, which issued to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Maxwell, was solely concerned with whether a Minister of the Crown in New South Wales had been guilty of improper conduct in reducing the fine. That involved a review of matters such as what was placed before the Minister, whose advice was tendered to him, and what was said by those who discussed it with him. The inquiry did not purport to go into the merits of the subjects covered by the commission issued by the Commonwealth Government. The royal commissioner had before him the depositions of the court when the Abbco Bread Company Proprietary Limited was fined, the various documents on the file at the  time and the matter to which I have made reference. </para>

                        <para>- Permit me to develop my view. The judge had a very restricted investigation. It was limited to the suggestion of improper conduct on the part of the Minister. The judge was not concerned with any of the details which are the subject of the present inquiry. How, in the light of that, a finding by him that the Minister was not guilty of improper conduct can in any way prejudice his impartiality in respect of this matter, I am entirely at a loss to understand. I believe that impartial members also will be at a loss to understand it. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot understand that proposition. In the first place, the judge did not say, so far as my knowledge extends, in his finding, that the reduction of the fine to ##£##500 was the correct thing to do. He was concerned with a more specific issue, as to whether the Minister, in reducing the fine, was guilty of improper conduct. If the honorable member for Dalley fails to realize the distinction, I cannot assist him. To suggest that, in those circumstances, the judge who was mentioned to the House a week ago as the royal commissioner to inquire into this matter, having dealt with this limited State commission, is not capable of impartially approaching the problems put before him under the terms of the new commission, is completely to disregard the qualities of judges of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. </para>

That is precisely the charge made by the honorable member for Dalley. </para>

To suggest that I passed over this report as my own, or that I gave countenance to anything in it, is to state something which is completely false and not in accordance with the facts. The Minister tables a report, which is read, and there the matter ends.

                    <para>.- Last week and again this afternoon I asked the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> to investigate the case of the income tax assessment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Yates who was finally assessed at ##£##220,000, which sum was reduced by ##£##42,000, following representations made to the then Treasurer by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. L.</inline> Martin, then Minister for Justice in New South Wales and now Minister for Works and Local Government. The facts are that James Yates, a glace kid manufacturer of Newtown,, Sydney, was making fraudulent income tax returns, particularly under sub-item D of Item 1 which comes under the heading of ##"## stock bought ##"##. Inquiries made by the Taxation Department revealed that the stock which Yates had described in his return as ##"## stock bought ##"## consisted, of houses, flats and shops. The department assessed Yates for the full amount for which he was liable, in addition to a fine, the total amount being ##£##220,000. A portion of that sum was paid, but apparently the department did not regard it as sufficient because a High Court writ was issued for the outstanding balance of ##£##95,000 and in settlement of the claim a further amount was paid to the department leaving the balance owing ##£##42,000. Yates had an old-established firm of ##'## respected solicitors in Sydney, Gale and Gale, acting for him and they made representations to the department for reduction of the balance claimed. When they were unsuccessful Yates employed a firm of accountants. Their representations to the department were also unsuccessful. Yates was then recommended to interview <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Martin.</inline> Yates did so, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Martin</inline> undertook to make representations on the express condition that he would receive 10 per cent, of any proportion of the outstanding balance that the department waived. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Martin,</inline> who was a Minister of the Crown in New South Wales ##"## ditched ##"## his ministerial business and went to Canberra to interview the then Treasurer, who, I think, was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey.</inline> Assurances having been given him by the Treasurer, he returned to Sydney and endeavoured to induce Yates to agree to pay him 15 per cent, of the amount by which the outstanding balance was reduced. At that time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Martin</inline> was aware that ##£##42,000 was to be written off by the department. It is apparent that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Martin,</inline> who is a solicitor, could not have been acting as Yates##'##s solicitor because according to the ethics of the legal profession one solicitor cannot act for a client for whom another solicitor is already acting. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Martin</inline> were acting as Yates##'##s solicitor the question arises as to whether the sum of ##£##4,200 which he was paid by cheque by Yates represented a fee commensurate with the amount of work he did for Yates. On the departmental file there was a notation, which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Martin</inline> could not have failed to note, that this was one of the worst cases of fraud since the Abrahams case in Melbourne. I have endeavoured in fairness to the Treasurer to induce him to acquaint the House with the facts of the case. It is a scandal of the first magnitude and calls for the closest investigation. I have given the Treasurer some of the facts and it is incumbent on him to investigate their accuracy. I invite him to institute an investigation of the matter. Men who are held in the highest repute and esteem in Sydney and are seised of the facts of the case, will gladly give evidence. If the Ministry respects public honesty, it cannot fail to establish the inquiry I have sought. </para>

                    <para>.- I bring under notice of the Minister for Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> the case of men who enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force from Western Australia and were sent to the eastern States for training. After spending six or eight months training, a number of them have been transferred to the Geraldton air station, but have not been given leave in Western Australia. They have only had a few hours##'## leave between trains. Many of the men have wives and children in Western Australia. One man who has three children left his farm to enlist and, after training for eight months and three days in the eastern States, was transferred to Geraldton and had only 22 hours of leave to visit his home, 180 miles distant from Perth. My request is that these men be given leave at the first opportunity and, because of the great distances between Geraldton and their homes, in some instances 600 miles, they be granted free railway passes to enable them to visit their homes. My remarks apply with equal force to men who have been training in the eastern States for the last eight months. I am aware that Air Force men from Western Australia were given ten days##'## ##'## leave last Christmas, but because of the tremendous distance between the eastern States and Western Australia and the passenger congestion on the transAustralian railway during the holiday season, they could not secure seats on the trains and, consequently, had to spend their leave in the eastern States. The families of many of these men have not seen them for eight months, even though they have been transferred to Western Australia. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am not familiar with the cases of the Air Force men referred to by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marwick),</inline> but I shall have inquiries made to ascertain if it is possible to grant leave at an early date to men who have been transferred to Western Australia after spending a considerable period of training in the eastern States. The honorable member expressed the hope that the men would be given pre-embarkation leave to visit their homes. I would point out that every Air Force man is given pre-embarkation leave adequate to visit his home and free railway warrants are issued. In view of the different travel concessions granted to service men by the State railway departments, the Government has considered the possibility of establishing a uniform system of free rail travel to enable these men to return periodically to their homes without paying railway fares. I think it will be possible for the Government to announce at an early date that such a system has been arranged. Since the outbreak of war, it has been the custom of the Commonwealth Government to provide free rail travel for service men on the Commonwealth railways. Free rail travel was provided to the extent of a special train and such other additional accommodation as could be provided on the normal train service to enable Western Australians to return to their home State for Christmas. With respect to the men who have gone to Geraldton I shall look into the circumstances and if it is possible, as I think it will be, I shall do what is requested. </para>

                    <para>.- On Thursday last I moved for the appointment of a select committee to inquire into the operations of the Apple and Pear Marketing Board. After I had indicated my reasons and a few other honorable members had supported the setting up of such a committee, the Assistant Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony),</inline> with some reluctance, undertook to arrange for the holding of some form of inquiry into the operations of the board. After receiving that assurance, honorable members who intended to -speak in support of and vote for my motion indicated their willingness to allow the debate to he adjourned. Subsequently the Assistant Minister, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Frost),</inline> and I had an informal discussion. I do not think that I am unfair to the Assistant Minister when I express my belief that he promised the four of us that he would to-day, or, in his own words, on the next day of sitting, indicate to Parliament the form of inquiry that he was prepared to set up. I approached the Assistant Minister to-day and he informed me that he would make an announcement at the end of the week. Iobject to the delay which the Assistant Minister apparently is deliberately causing. If this inquiry is to be of value it is essential that almost immediate arrangements be made for it to get under way. The season is in progress and it is essential that the committee of inquiry should see the crop being handled. I hope that the Assistant Minister will now give an indication of his intention and tell the House why he did not honour the promise he gave on Thursday. If he persists in his apparent attempt to delay action, I shall believe that an inquiryis even more essential than I first thought it was. I shall be inclined to think that influences are at work to encourage the Assistant Minister to delay an inquiry. I urge him, in view of all that has transpired about the apple and pear industry, to take immediate action to honour his promise. It is too late now to honour it in full, but he should inform the House of what form the inquiry will take. </para>

                <para>Official Commonwealth figures show that war orders have caused only 12.6 per cent. increase in New South Wales factory employment, as against a. 16.9 per cent. increase in Victoria. ##"##We are conducting an exhaustive investigation of the industrial capacity of Australia with the object of utilizing every possible factory,##"## said <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride.</inline> ##"##Another investigation is being carried out to ascertain whether the Commonwealth can assist smaller factories by supplying additional machinery and tools. </para>

                <para class="block">Those observations would have supported the arguments that I had intended to advance in support of my case, but in view of the admissions made and of the assurances given it is unnecessary for  me  to proceed further at this moment. </para>
                <para>An added reason why I did not proceed with my motion was that the Minister for Munitions <inline font-weight="bold">(##'##Senator McBride)</inline> to-day announced that it had been decided to establish an extensive group of Commonwealth Government explosive factories in New South Wales to be located near Sydney, the operations of which would include the large scale manufacture of several types of explosives. The Minister stated that the proposed expenditure would amount to several millions of pounds and that employment would be provided for thousands of additional workers when the factories were in opera- lion. He also said that immediate action was being taken to acquire the land and to begin building operations. I##'## understand that one of the factories is to be located in my electorate. This will have the effect of relieving the unemployment position. The necessity to devote attention to that matter was one of the main reasons why I had intended to move for the adjournment of the House. I desired to discover the bottle-neck which was hindering our war production. </para>
                <para>Information has also been conveyed to me that the Purcell Engineering Company, which was one of the organizations in New South Wales, and in my electorate, that had suffered severely through the discrimination in the placing of war orders in favour of the southern States as against New South Wales, would receive substantial orders in the near future, thus enabling the company to operate its plant to the fullest capacity and to provide work for several hundred more employees. The Purcell Engineering Company manufactures lathes of the type required in our munition industries. Such lathes are the very foundation of the successful production of munitions. I remind honorable members that the Minister for Munitions stated towards the end of last year - </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">Machines of the kind produced by the Purcell Engineering Company, namely, lathes, are, in my view, the nearest to human beings of all machines, because they can be used to reproduce themselves. They are designed for both constructive and destructive purposes. I would prefer to see them used for constructive purposes, but it happens that they are required at the moment for destructive purposes. I am sorry that the Department of Munitions did not discover, shortly after the outbreak of the war, that the Purcell Engineering Company, which is the pioneer tool-making organization of New South Wales, was able to render outstanding assistance in connexion with the nation##'##s war effort. However, I am prepared to accept the assurance given by the Government that this company will now be given satisfactory contracts and that New South Wales will, in the future, receive its proper share of war work. If I find, later, that these assurances are not being honoured, I shall return to the attack with renewed vigour. . </para>
                <para>I am quite satisfied that the difficulties to which I have directed attention have been due to the centralization of the service departments in Melbourne. But for that fact, our war effort could have been ##"## whipped up ##"## long ago. It is unfortunately true that our main business departments and also the Board of Business administration are located in Melbourne. It is true, too, that all of the members of the Board of Business Administration, and also all of the business managers of the several service departments, are resident in Melbourne: I invite honorable members to examine a newspaper sheet which I hold in my hand, showing on one-half of it the photographs of various persons holding executive positions in connexion with the war effort, all of whom reside in Melbourne, and showing on the other half of it a blank. This indicates that the States other than Victoria have been completely overlooked in this whole matter. That Victoria has received more than its fair share of war work is also demonstrated by the low unemployment returns furnished by trade union organizations in that State, compared with those furnished from New ##'##South Wales. The respective figures are 4.##'##3 per cent, and 8.5 per cent. Defence expenditure in Victoria over a certain period totalled ##£##27 14s. lOd. a head of the population, compared with the New South Wales total of only ##£##19 Os. 7d. The unemployment position in New South Wales has been directly affected by the centralization of the service ##'## departments in Victoria. Official figures published in Canberra recently show that 14,000 workers (mostly skilled men) have been diverted from Queensland and New South Wales to the southern States in recent months. </para>
                <para>In replying to a deputation that waited upon him in January of this year, the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> stated- </para>

                    <para>The problem of unemployment is one, in the form in which we find it in New South Wales at the present time, which is a challenge to the resourcefulness of the Government and its statesmanship. It cannot be claimed that we have achieved a maximum war effort while we have thousands of able-bodied mcn and women who are capable and willing to assist, but to date have been denied the opportunity because we have not been able to make work available to them. The problem, obviously, is not insuperable when we discover that unemployment in Victoria has been reduced to 5.9 pcT cent, as compared with 9.8 per cent, in this State. I myself have received a large number of letters containing requests for employment and from these it is evident that men in New South Wales are rinding great difficulty in being absorbed into employment. It has been a matter of significance to me that the great majority of these requests have come from people in New South Wales. I realized that it was clearly established that there should be a slack taken up in this State if the maximum industrial effort and defence effort of which this State is capable is to be achieved. </para>

                <para class="block">Our nation will not be able to develop its maximum war effort until the whole of the service departments are located in Canberra, and the Government administrative work is performed here. I hope that honorable members generally will give their attention to this subject in the not distant future with the object of rectifying the position. </para>
                <para>I had intended to speak at some length on the financing of munition annexes. On Thursday last, I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Munitions certain questions on this subject, and he informed me that 83 annexes had been authorized so far, involving the Commonwealth in a very large outlay. The expenditure by the Commonwealth upon individual annexes had ranged from nothing in two cases to ##£##980,000 in respect of an aero-engine factory. I was also informed that in several cases the Commonwealth Government had provided the land, buildings and plant of the annexe, although, generally speaking, the Government provided only the plant. In some cases the firms concerned had been granted loans to enable them to provide the necessary land and buildings. Such loans were to be repaid over a period of years. In my view, the Government could have provided the money necessary for this purpose by means of credits issued through the Commonwealth Bank, or it could have guaranteed contractors##'## overdrafts. It should have been possible for the Government to assist many small manufacturers employing from five or  six to as many as 200 hands. Had a carefully arranged plan been prepared with this end in view, it would have been practicable to harness very many of our smaller factories to the war effort, as, in fact, has been done in Great Britain. The Government should not have assisted big firms to the exclusion of small ones. I shall not say more on these matters at the moment, except that I have received communications from 40 different firms protesting against the manner in which the Government has favoured large firms to the exclusion of small ones. These firms, I have been assured, could all have assisted the war effort in a substantial way had they been provided with credit facilities for the purpose and given sufficient orders. </para>

In the last letter that I received from the Minister I was informed that he was about to place this matter before Cabinet. I now direct the attention of the Minister to the attitude of the Government of Victoria to my proposal. In the case of one school in my constituency, the names of a number of soldiers##'## children were sent in as those of children needing and desiring free books and school requisites, which are provided in some instances in Victoria. The instruction given by the Education Department in that State is as follows: - </para>

                            <para>- In any case, I urge the Government to provide free legal aid for persons who are not able to pay for it. Seeing that under the National Security Regulations summary prosecutions can be launched, involving high penalties, some consideration should be given to my suggestion that the principles set out in section 69 of the Judiciary Act should be extended beyond indictable offences. A man who is committed for trial, and is unable to meet the expense of legal assistance, can, under that provision, be given free legal aid. Persons who are charged with offences under the National Security Regulations are sometimes unable to pay for the assistance of counsel, and I hope that this matter will receive sympathetic consideration by the Minister and the Attorney-General##'##s Department. </para>

                    <para>regard an advertisement of that kind as an insult to the intelligence of Australian manhood. The suggestion that our young men should join the Australian Imperial Force in order to see the world is certainly not in keeping with the ministerial pronouncement about the seriousness of the international situation, and the sacrifices that our young men are called upon to make. We are told that members of the Australian Imperial Force are serving in England, Egypt, Palestine, Libya and Malaya, and that they are to serve in other parts of the world. If the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> can tell us where they are to serve, in addition to the places already mentioned, the information would be of interest to the people of Australia. The Minister might suggest to the Department of Information that its advertisements should be drawn up in a more sensible way than that in which the advertisement to which I have referred was worded. I understand that this department has handed over much of its advertising to three firms and that advertising contracts are being made with those controlling newspapers, radio stations and hoardings. Sampson, Clark, Price-Berry Proprietary Limited handles the newspaper advertisements ; George Patterson Proprietary Limited deals with the radio advertisements, and Goldberg Advertising Proprietary Limited control the advertisements on hoardings. I understand that ##£##80,000 is being appropriated to tell the workers of this country their duty in regard to enlistment, and in regard to war loans and war savings certificates. In the past, the Commonwealth Bank has advertised in most newspapers at the rate of 20s. an inch, but a master contract has been submitted to some weekly papers naming a price of 18s. 3d. an inch. That is a reduction of1s. 9d. an inch, but the scheme goes further thanthat. The agent for the department takes 10 per cent. of the 18s. 3d., which amounts to1s. 10d., so that the return to the newspaper works out at 16s. 5d. an inch, compared with the previous 20s. If the department was saving anything I might not object, but it is the big advertising firms which are getting the difference. The Commonwealth Bank has built up its own advertising department over a period of many years, and there seems no good reason why it should not continue to advertise in whatever newspapers it chooses. This tremendous power in the hands of a few big advertising firms will place the newspaper proprietors almost in a position of economic vassalage for fear that they will lose their contracts. The attitude of the department is wrong in principle, and is politically corrupt. Those who distribute this largesse will be in a position to influence the policy of newspapers during election time. Those who pay the piper are entitled to callthe tune. In my opinion, the workers will resent this propaganda. They are loyal and patriotic, and do not need to be told what to do by propaganda of this kind. Moreover, some newspapers, at any rate, would make space available for the publication of government announcements without the expenditure of this money. Many protests were published in the allegedly free press of Australia when the first Director of the Department of Information, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Keith</inline> Murdoch, suggested that newspapers should be compelled to print ministerial statements in full, but the latest edict of the Department of Information goes even further than that. I do not believe that it is necessary to publish government advertisements, however disguised, in order to maintain national morale. Such action is more likely to encourage defeatism. It is against the best interests of the public that any one should have power to bring pressure upon the newspapers, and those which criticize the Government should not be threatened with the loss of advertising. I trust that the Acting Prime Minister will give attention to my representations, and will revise the policy of the Department of Information in respect of this proposed advertising campaign. </para>

                - I am convinced that the Minister for Information
                <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Foll)</inline>
                will have an effective reply to the allegations of the honorable member, who will be surprised, and perhaps relieved, to find that he is under a misapprehension in regard to advertising contracts, and that the Minister is doing everything possible to safeguard the interests of the nation.

            <para>The honorable member for Watson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falstein)</inline> has been persistent in urging me to violate the secrecy provisions of the taxation law. As the honorable gentleman is a legal man I am surprised that he has not, apparently, read section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, or if he has done so that he would urge me as a responsible Minister to break that provision. It was well for the honorable member that he was not asked to answer any question dealing with taxation law when he sat for his examination for admission to the bar. For his edification, therefore, I shall read section 16 of the act -  (.1.) For the purposes of this section,  officer ##"## means a person who is or has been appointed or employed by the Commonwealth or by a State, and who by reason of that appointment or employment, or in the course of that employment, may acquire or has acquired information respecting the affairs of any other person, disclosed or obtained under the provisions of this act or of any previous law of the Commonwealth relating to Income Tax. (2.) Subject to this section, an officer shall not either directly or indirectly, except in the performance of any duty as an officer, and either whilehe is, or after, he ceases to be an officer, make a record of, or divulge or communicate to any person any such information so acquired by him. (3.) An officer shall not be required to produce in Court any return, assessment or notice of assessment, or to divulge or communicate to any Court any matter or tiling coming under his notice in the performance of his duties as an officer, except when it is necessary to do so for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of this act or of any previous law of the Commonwealth relating to Income Tax. </para>
            <para>Officers of the Taxation Department should not, and will not, divulge even to meas Treasurer any information that comes into their possession by virtue of their office. </para>

If such a note appears on that file, I want to know what officer of the Taxation Department violated the secrecy provisions of the act by divulging that information. I also desire to know the source of the information which the honorable member has disclosed to-night; and why he, a responsible member of the community, and particularly a legal man, should encourage violation of the secrecy provisions of the taxation law. </para>

                        <para>- No. Perhaps the honorable gentleman is prepared to throw his taxation returns upon the table of this House, but if the private affairs of any citizen could be bandied about in public as the honorable member requests, chaos would result. Successive governments have seen the wisdom of retaining the secrecy provisions of the taxation law. </para>

This latter connexion as an individual undertaking would, of necessity, require to be an entirely separate  truckfrom that now existing, with a large terminal yard at Melbourne to handle traffic. Conversion of the existing track between Albury and Melbourne would not be practicable without the unification of the entire Victorian railway system, as break-of-gauge points would be created at all branch line junctions to that main line. </para>

                        <para>The production of munitions in general must be organized on a basis which will ensure a continued and intensive effort. It will therefore be obvious that an industry which can only be made available at intervals, dictated by seasonal production demands, ##&amp;##c, would not be capable of affording material assistance in the desired direction. The field in which the engineering resources of the sugar industry could be utilized, therefore, appears to be in the direction of contracts for specific requirements which are dealt with mainly by public tenders by the Contract Board which is located at the Victoria Barracks, Petrie-terrace, Brisbane. The agency of the Department of Munitions in Brisbane, which is charged with the organization of industry, particularly in regard to munitions production, is the Board of Area Management, located at Ministry of Munitions, 341-343 Queen -street, Brisbane, and it is suggested that if representatives of the sugar industry could arrange to represent their claims, and furnish full particulars to the secretary of the Board of Area Management, the proposal could be dealt with on the spot. In order that the secretary, Board of Area Management, will be in a position to discuss matters with representatives of the sugar industry, I am arranging for a. copy of this question and reply to be forwarded for consideration by such board. </para>

                        <para>There is no shortage ofbar and ingot copper in Australia. Large security stocks are held both for defence and civil purposes. African supplies have been received and are continuing through British control and at lower prices than the United States of America is paying for South American copper. In consequence the average cost in Australia to consumers of copper is relatively low. Production has been increased in Australia also, but it was impossible in the time available to get, from the re-opening of old minus, the supplies now being received from Africa. Any proposals for the re-opening of old mines to increase Australian production will be considered if submitted to the Department of Supply and Development, with adequate information on capital requirements supportedby technical data. An; such increase would be welcome for its own sake and to conserve sterling exchange. A plan to promote further increases in production isnow being consideredby the department in conjunction with the Prices Commissioner. </para>
                        <para>Shortages of copper wire and other copper products are due to shortages of fabricating capacity for civil supply in the face of urgent defence priorities. Fabricating capacity has been extended and is being extended further, but the demands for defence purposes are increasing also, and civil supply has to he rationed. Essential services are supplied with their actual needs, but demands for stocks of fabricated supplies and demands for nonessential purposes cannot at present be satisfied. </para>

                    <para>I now inform the honorable member that the regulations referred to apply only to meat brought into the Territory for purposes of re-sale or for carrying on business. The Naval Wireless Station, therefore, does not come under the provisions of this regulation, and I am informed by the Health Department that the importation of meat, for use at the station, from outside the Australian Capital Territory would not constitute an infringement of the regulations. In any case, the method of purchasing meat for the use of the naval staff is one which concerns the personnel themselves, not the department, as under the system of messing in force at the station the men are in a position similar to that of private individuals, and make their own arrangements for obtaining supplies. </para>

                    <para>I now inform the honorable member that on investigation it has been ascertained that there are good and substantial reasons for removing the Command Training School from Fyansford, Geelong, to Lara, approximately -twenty miles from Geelong. The site at Fyansford is an old factory which has been condemned for winter accommodation owing to dampness, as a result of experience last year. The expenditure already incurred on the existing site will not be wasted, as the various huts, kitchen and conveniences will be transferred to the new site at Lara, which, at a small cost, affords much more habitable quarters and facilities, is surrounded by an excellent training area and, in view of unlimited scope for tactical training, is suitable in every way for this school. The expenditure involved in establishing the training school at Lara will not be any greater than the cost that would be necessary to improve the accommodation at Fyansford. </para>
