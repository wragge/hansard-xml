<para>—I present the report of the Commonwealth of Australia Branch Delegation to the 51st Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference held at Nadi in the Republic of the Fiji Islands from 1 to 10 September 2005.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The 51st Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference held in Fiji in September took as its theme ‘Commonwealth partnerships for global development’. Six workshops and three plenary sessions addressed a wide range of topics around this theme. A plenary discussion on effective early warning, relief and reconstruction in relation to natural disasters was particularly topical in the wake of the Asian tsunami a few months earlier and the more recent hurricanes in the Caribbean-American region and earthquakes in Pakistan and its neighbours.</para>
<para>Several workshops and one plenary session addressed issues related to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, with a particular focus on how parliamentarians could play a role in the achievement of the goals. The Commonwealth can provide a unique perspective on the United Nations development system because its members reflect every stage of development. Its 53 member countries span every economic group and region of the world but its size, unlike that of the UN, is not unwieldy: the Commonwealth constitutes over a quarter of the world’s countries and a third of the world’s population.</para>
<para>For example, the Commonwealth Policy Studies Unit, based at the Institute of Commonwealth Studies at the University of London, outlined work being done with seven Commonwealth governments—the United Kingdom, Jamaica, New Zealand, St Lucia, South Africa, Nigeria and Guyana—which supported discussing these issues at the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta. These governments believe, and so do I, that the United Nations needs to be reformed and revitalised and that meeting the Millennium Development Goals is a task of the utmost urgency and priority.</para>
<para>At present we are far away from the 0.7 per cent of gross national income pledged back in 1970 to contribute to overseas development assistance. In 2004 our contribution was just 0.25 per cent. Furthermore, voluntary funding from the international community for United Nations projects through bodies like UNICEF and the World Health Organisation decreases every year, so the UN ends up with the same amount of money to spend on staff but less and less money with which its staff can do their jobs. I support the call by the Commonwealth Policy Studies Unit and a range of Commonwealth countries for this situation to be addressed. How can we hope to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, such as the eradication of extreme poverty, promoting gender equality and combating HIV-AIDS and malaria, otherwise?</para>
<para>Daisy Cooper from the CPSU said a global partnership for achieving development is needed at the point of delivery where development actually happens. She suggested Commonwealth parliamentarians, through the CPA, seek observer status at the UN Economic and Social Council, mainstream debate on international development into our policy events and design, and implement a 10-year strategic plan on how parliamentarians can achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.</para>
<para>Delegation members participated actively in the sessions. I raised issues concerning the impact of climate change and the need to move towards more renewable energy. In addition, Senator Crossin and the member for Hughes, Mrs Danna Vale, participated in the meeting of Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians, which discussed ways to support the election and work of women parliamentarians.</para>
<para>The conference provides an opportunity for delegates to talk informally together, share experiences and build networks of support for the advancement of democratic practices across the Commonwealth. The conference is a key activity in the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association’s aims of improving understanding and cooperation among Commonwealth parliamentarians and promoting the study of, and respect for, parliamentary democracy. The CPA presents a unique opportunity as a forum to assist healing and rebuilding for states that are more fragile than others.</para>
<para>The hosting of the conference by the parliament of Fiji also provided an opportunity for us to hear first hand about the struggles our near neighbour has had with sustaining parliamentary democracy over the last two decades and its progress towards re-establishing a stable and equitable democratic system. Hosting the conference was a significant milestone in that journey. The Fijians are to be congratulated on the efforts they put into running the conference so successfully.</para>
<para>I would like to thank the delegation leader, Senator Paul Calvert, and other members of the delegation—the member for Hughes, Danna Vale; the member for Blair, Cameron Thompson; and Senator Trish Crossin—for their companionship and active participation in the conference. I also thank the Parliamentary Relations Office, the Parliamentary Library and AusAID for the assistance they provided to the delegation.</para>

</talker>
<para>—by leave—This report is entitled <inline font-style="italic">Taking control: a national approach to pest animals</inline>. The title sums up the key findings of this report. It is time to take control of this pressing problem facing Australian farmers, and it is time for nationally coordinated action. Pest animals are having a serious impact on the Australian economy and the environment. In big picture terms, pest animals cost Australia over $700 million each year. But the smaller picture, at the level of the individual farmer and land-holder, is just as frightening.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>It is important to recognise that the impact of feral animals is not just economic. It is also environmental and social. Constantly dealing with pest animals causes production losses, health problems, depression and family breakdown. The committee was shown pictures of sheep, still alive, with their insides exposed by wild dog attack. One farmer giving evidence broke down when describing how the impact of wild dogs has forced him out of the sheep industry. It is time to do something to rid Australia of this menace.</para>
<para>At the moment, approaches differ widely across each of the states and territories. That is why the committee’s first recommendation is for the establishment of a National Pest Animals and Weeds Committee, comprising representatives of the federal government and each of the state and territory governments. This body will play a key role in coordinating action across state and territory boundaries. The committee has also recommended the establishment of a national advisory committee, including representatives from local and community groups, industry bodies and interested organisations. These groups are already working hard to eliminate the problem of pest animals.</para>
<para>As well as national coordination, this report deals with some specific issues in relation to pest animal control. One of these is the importance of preventing new pests from entering the country and the need to improve quarantine and import risk analysis processes for that purpose.</para>
<para>The use of 1080 poison was a key feature of this inquiry. This poison is a vital tool in helping land-holders to control pest animals. The committee has recommended that the Australian government encourage states and territories to ensure the continued availability of 1080. The committee has also recommended that the Australian government encourage states and territories that have prohibitions on aerial baiting to remove them. Research completed recently in New South Wales indicates that aerial baiting has a minimal impact on native quoll populations. I understand that steps have recently been taken to reintroduce aerial baiting in Kosciuszko National Park, and this is a positive development.</para>
<para>A recurring theme was that government land managers are neglectful in controlling pest problems on their land. The committee believes that states and territories must ensure adequate funding is available for land management before national parks and wilderness areas are declared, and this is reflected in the report. The committee has also recommended that the federal government make environment funding conditional on states and territories carrying out their responsibilities for pest animal management.</para>
<para>In the case of some pest species, including some abundant native species, there is a potential to make commercial use of them, through either harvesting or hunting. The committee has recommended that the proposed national committee encourage commercial uses where appropriate.</para>
<para>Research, development and education are integral to dealing with the pest animal problem. The committee has recommended that the Invasive Animals CRC play a role in coordinating research across Australia to ensure that the maximum benefit is obtained from available resources.</para>
<para>This inquiry was commenced by the committee of the 40th Parliament with Mrs Kay Elson as chair. On behalf of the current committee, I would like to thank Kay and the previous committee for their work in relation to this inquiry. I would also like to thank the members of the secretariat, particularly our research officer, Ms Kylie Weston-Scheuber, and also Mr Ian Dundas and Mrs Marlene Dundas, for their hard work in preparing this report. I commend the report, <inline font-style="italic">Taking control: a national approach to pest animals</inline>, to the House.</para>

<para>—As the member for Hume has pointed out, this report has been far-reaching and I believe it should be acted upon quickly. We all moan about pests from time to time, whether they be the dreadful cane toad, the pesky rabbits, those bugs that infest the vegetable patch or feral cats that take our native birds. But the extent of pests in Australia was brought home to the committee in its deliberations across Australia. The number of species involved is quite incredible, and the states have been managing them in various ways over many years.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Pests are those species whose numbers have got out of control for various reasons and which are impacting on our economy and environmental communities. This needs to be sorted out if both vulnerable native species and farm crops and animals are to continue to survive. But, if one area manages to rid itself of a particular pest, there is often a problem of reintroduction from another area, as the species moves from place to place. Obviously, there is a need for a national approach in this area.</para>
<para>The main focus of this report, after the committee heard submissions from around the country, is to make recommendations to assist the overall management—and eradication, if possible—of pests. Also, there is some ability to harvest some of the pest species. A few animals are already being commercially marketed. Possums are one species for which a market for the meat has been found in China, and I believe the pelts can be marketed as fur, so another opportunity exists there. I had the opportunity to try camel steak while in Western Australia. Although it was quite nice, it may require the chefs of the world to look at recipes that would make it as popular as beef steak.</para>

<para>—It looks as though it has done him some good, but it has not done much for his hair! Horse, kangaroo and wallaby have been eaten for centuries, but many Australians have difficulties with this concept, not seeing them as pest species despite the evidence to the contrary.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Tasmanians had a good opportunity to give input to this report and, in fact, one of our northern farmers has developed a strategy to integrate all the stakeholders’ activities, including hunting, into keeping pests down through animal game management plans. I think that is something we could look at as we go into managing pests throughout Australia. In some species, it is a question of keeping animal populations healthy and in control. In others, it means eradication. Either way, it has to be done in the most humane, efficient and economic way that is possible. The government should take note of the 47 recommendations in this report and act upon them for the good of the regions and of rural communities.</para>
<para>I would like to thank the member for Hume for his interest and for the expert way he has conducted and led this committee. Thanks, too, to the committee secretariat, Ian, Kylie and Marlene. Also, thanks to my parliamentary colleagues for making the task a very pleasant and a very good, stimulating one. Thanks to all those who gave evidence right across this great country of ours and to those who have hosted us across the nation. I hope we can ensure that this report will be considered by both sides of the parliament and acted upon swiftly and in a sensible and responsible way.</para>

<para>—Might I first endorse the words of the member for Lyons. It was very obvious when we had our inquiry, particularly in Tasmania, that we are failing to make a resource of certain pest animals which, because of the nature of our own agriculture, have got to very large levels of population. Many of their predators are no longer available. The reality is that there is a huge opportunity to, in a compassionate way, create commercial incentives for these particular products to be exported to countries that are more aware of or more used to some of the meats that Australians do not eat. What is more, we were, unfortunately, able to discover that many of the reasons that this does not happen are simple bureaucratic barriers that certainly need to be broken down. They exist in the federal bureaucracy and the state bureaucracies, and it is certainly time that these matters were addressed. They do represent a real challenge to people conducting agriculture, even to the replanting of trees. They certainly can be minimised by that process.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I wish to take the opportunity today to specifically speak to another aspect of this report. I thought one of the more frequently recurring items of witness evidence that arose related to the management of public areas, particularly national parks, other public reserves and crown land, by government instrumentalities. Too frequently the government instrumentalities said, ‘We’re bound by the same law as Farmer John.’ They might be bound by it but they do not observe it. Of course the outcome is that Farmer John finds it an impossible task to protect his property from the ravages of pest animals that breed, sleep and live in national parks and come out at night-time to devastate his flocks. It was of great concern to me in the broader context of evidence being given that two- and three-month-old calves are being pulled down by some of these dogs. One wonders when we will get another Queensland example, where the government eventually reacted against wild dogs when a small boy was killed by them. We have people going into these public reserves bushwalking and doing all that. If the kangaroos are a bit hard to find that day, when is it going to be a human being? We should not have to have that sort of circumstance arise in order to address the problem.</para>
<para>It was of great interest to me, from a forestry perspective, that evidence was given that the wildlife has been so devastated by these dogs that we now have a massive increase in fuel loads in these national forests because nothing is eating them down. As you would be aware, Mr Speaker, that was further aggravated recently in Victoria by taking the cattle out of some of this country. But the reality is that there was a relationship clearly demonstrated in evidence. These pest animals, these crosses between dingoes and other dogs, are all representing a huge problem to the natural environment. When you get to the point where you cannot even build a proper fence because you cannot clear into the national park far enough to stop trees falling on your fence—and consequently you are giving simple access to these pest animals—you are really and truly getting into an area of high farce.</para>
<para>I think it is well worth a mention in this debate that it is time that the government instrumentalities involved took upon themselves the same laws that they are more than willing to apply to the private sector. It is no good having a property that is clean during daylight when you know you are going to be invaded at night by animals—even plant pests come out of these national parks. It is not a case of benign neglect; it is a case of culture. Many of those that manage it do not want to do these jobs, for whatever their personal belief. It is wrong. As I said, it could end up with a human tragedy.</para>

<para>—by leave—Mr Speaker, you are one of only a dozen current members who were serving in the House when the Procedure Committee was appointed for the first time, on 27 February 1985. You will recall how differently the House went about its business in those days. First, there was no time set aside each sitting week specifically for committee reports and private members’ business. Instead general business alternated with grievance debates on sitting Thursdays. Committee reports—and there were fewer committees—were presented on an ad hoc basis. Private members, frustrated by the inflexible way in which their notices came up for debate, were tempted into misusing other forms of the House to raise issues. Giving oral notices of motion or moving motions to suspend standing orders were favoured vehicles for making impromptu speeches on hot topics.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Second, the increasing pressure of government legislation saw a corresponding increase in the use of the guillotine. Twenty-six bills were declared urgent in 1985, and it got worse. In each of the three years from 1990 to 1992 more than 100 bills were declared urgent.</para>
<para>Third, the House sat later into the night. Sittings beyond 11 pm were not uncommon. In 1985 the House sat beyond midnight in seven of its 13 sittings in the month of May. This was life before the Procedure Committee: limited chances for private members, legislative congestion and late sitting hours.</para>
<para>The Procedure Committee addressed each of these problems. In 1987 the House adopted the recommendation of the <inline font-style="italic">Days and hours</inline> report, putting in place a comprehensive regime for arranging private members’ business and the presentation and consideration of committee and delegation reports. With minor adjustments, the same arrangement is followed to this day.</para>
<para>In 1994 the House established the Main Committee as a forum for parallel debate, relieving the House of some of its legislative burden and, in time, providing further opportunities for private members to represent their constituents. This was an outcome of the Procedure Committee’s <inline font-style="italic">About time</inline> report. One indicator of the Main Committee’s value is that only five bills were declared urgent in the three years to the end of 2004. More recently, in 2003, the committee played a strong role in restructuring the sitting hours, to reduce late sittings of the House. It is now unusual to sit beyond 9.30 pm, much less 11 pm or midnight. In 1984, the average time of rising was 10.04 pm; in 2004, it was 9.08 pm.</para>
<para>To newer members of this House, the most obvious of the committee’s notable achievements is the complete redrafting and reorganisation of the standing orders, started in 2002, completed in 2003 and put into effect from the opening of this parliament in 2004. It may be recalled that successive standing orders committees, the predecessors of the Procedure Committee, took almost 50 years to replace the temporary standing orders adopted in 1901. These are some of the major achievements of the Procedure Committee. They have had a broad impact on the way the House operates.</para>
<para>However, the committee also gets results that may be less obvious—although they are certainly no less worth while. In its first 20 years, the committee presented 44 reports. Eighteen, or about 40 per cent, of these were rapid reactions to immediate problems. They ranged over matters like how long the bells should ring for a division or a quorum call, the exclusion of visitors from committee hearings and—a recent example—the application of the anticipation rule. In most cases, the House has promptly adopted the committee’s recommended solution.</para>
<para>The genesis of the Procedure Committee can be traced to dissatisfaction with its predecessor, the Standing Orders Committee. The Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System reported in 1976 that there had been ‘few notable achievements’ made by either standing orders committee in the two houses. One of the systemic problems of the Standing Orders Committee was the appointment of senior office holders who were too busy to devote sufficient time to the detailed work of procedural reform. The Procedure Committee was designed with a less exclusive membership. The results, I think, speak for themselves.</para>
<para>A crucial element of the committee’s ongoing effectiveness is its relationship with those who guide the House through its business—especially you, Mr Speaker; the Leader of the House; and the Manager of Opposition Business; not to mention the whips and the clerks. The reader of this history will note how the working relationship between the committee and those key players has matured.</para>
<para>It would be a very harsh critic indeed who did not acknowledge the Procedure Committee’s many successes. Nevertheless, there are still some problems to be resolved. However, the reader of this history will discover the contribution that the Procedure Committee has made to procedural reform in the House of Representatives over the last 20 years. I hope that members will take the time to read it and better appreciate the work of the 53 past and present members of this industrious committee. I would like to pass on my appreciation to members of the secretariat for their work on the history of the committee; in particular, I pass on my thanks to John Craig for his very significant contribution. I commend the report to the House.</para>

<para>—It gives me very great pleasure to speak at the presentation of this history of the Procedure Committee. The report marks the 20th anniversary of the committee, which was first appointed by resolution of the House on 27 February 1985. The Procedure Committee replaced the Standing Orders Committee, although this was not originally intended. The chair has spoken of some of the achievements of the committee since its establishment in the 34th Parliament—over a period that encompasses eight parliaments and eight Procedure Committees. I endorse her comments.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There is no doubt that, during these 20 years, successive Procedure Committees have played a significant role in helping the House to become a more effective legislative chamber. Further, the tendency of recommended reforms has been to support ordinary members by increasing their opportunities to represent their constituents. It is perhaps symbolic that the very first Procedure Committee report, presented on 23 May 1985, had the title <inline font-style="italic">Alternative opportunities for private members to concisely address the House</inline>. Of course, it is one thing for the Procedure Committee to recommend change and quite another for change to occur. Pressure to improve the legislative and representative functions of the House commonly conflicts with the pressure to facilitate government business. The result is often predictable.</para>
<para>This report is a great deal more than a catalogue of committee activities and achievements; it is also a commentary on how procedural reform happens. Among other things, it touches on the fundamental struggle of all democratic parliaments with roots in the Westminster tradition between executive convenience or even dominance, on the one hand, and providing time for all members to fulfil their legislative and representative functions, on the other.</para>
<para>The media sometimes appear to regard this as a modern issue; it is not. From the beginning of the Commonwealth, major developments in the House’s procedures have tended to support the streamlining of government business at the expense of opportunities for private members. The closure or gag was introduced in 1905, during Alfred Deakin’s government, although it was not used until 1909. Speech time limits were applied from 1912 and the notice of motion to introduce a guillotine first appeared in 1918.</para>
<para>The report raises the interesting question of how a committee made up of backbenchers can be so much more effective at facilitating change than its predecessors—successive standing orders committees made up of House leaders and senior frontbenchers. As evidence of its effectiveness, consider the history of the standing orders themselves. The House adopted provisional and supposedly temporary standing orders in 1901 and did not succeed in adopting permanent standing orders until 21 March 1950. Even then, many of the temporary standing orders were not amended. Generations of standing orders committees, with their impressive membership of senior House officers, were unable or unwilling to make the standing orders more relevant to the needs of the House.</para>
<para>An extract from the minutes of the Standing Orders Committee of 20 September 1949 illustrates the pace of change during the House’s first half century. Members present at that meeting were the Deputy Speaker; the Prime Minister, Mr Chifley; the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Menzies; Mr Fadden; Mr Riordan; and Mr Williams. The minutes record:</para>

<para class="block">By contrast, the Procedure Committee recommended a complete restructuring and rewriting of the standing orders in 1999, resulting in revised standing orders being adopted in 2004. They have been in operation since the commencement of this parliament. Of course, there are a great many factors involved in determining whether a reform is adopted by the House. Nevertheless, I think it is arguable that one of the strengths of the Procedure Committee is its membership. It consists of ordinary backbench members who have tried to develop a detached view of what procedural reforms are in the best interests of the House itself. They have not had the same responsibility as their predecessors in the standing orders committees and consequently there are fewer vested interests.</para>
<para>Backbench members have a very sound understanding of the truism that what goes around comes around. They understand that the procedures which blatantly favour either opposition or government might be viewed differently if and when there is a change of government. Perhaps it is easier for backbench members to be statesmanlike than for statesmen or women. This is not to say that members of the Procedure Committee are less partisan than members in general. Of course they are not, but in general they realise that the arena of procedural form is not a particularly suitable venue for partisanship. Perhaps herein lies the secret of their success and the willingness of the House to trust their proposals.</para>
<para>I conclude my remarks by paying tribute to the current and former members of all House Procedure Committees. There have been 53 members since 1985—several having served in more than one parliament. The undoubted father of the Procedure Committee is the member for Chifley, former deputy chair of the committee, who has served on four of the last five Procedure Committees since 1993. The contribution made by members from both sides has been immense. Work on the Procedure Committee may not be as glamorous as that of work on other committees. There is less opportunity to engage with the community during public hearings. Members may be less likely in after dinner speeches to refer to their Procedure Committee work than to their work on investigatory committees. The media rarely report our work but it is worth while, even valuable. I recommend the report to all who are interested in the history of the House and in procedural reform.

<para>—by leave—I am pleased to present the annual report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. The annual report is an important accountability mechanism by which parliament—and through it the public—can conveniently assess the committee’s performance. The duties of the Public Accounts and Audit Committee are described in the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act. In general terms, the duties are: to examine the financial affairs of authorities of the Commonwealth and to examine all reports of the Auditor-General; to consider the operations and resources of the Audit Office; to approve or reject the Prime Minister’s recommendation for appointment of the Auditor-General and the Independent Auditor; and to increase parliamentary and public awareness of the financial and related operations of government.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>During 2004-05, despite the hiatus in activity due to the federal election, the committee has fulfilled each of these responsibilities. Unlike other committees, the Public Accounts and Audit Committee can initiate its own policy inquiries without permission or reference to any minister, government or the parliament. During 2004-05 the committee has undertaken two major policy inquiries. Report 403, <inline font-style="italic">Access of Indigenous Australians to law and justice services</inline>, was tabled in June 2005. The inquiry was initiated in March 2004 to further examine some issues raised by an ANAO audit report. The inquiry lapsed at the end of the 40th Parliament, but in December 2004 the new committee re-initiated the inquiry. The committee received a number of submissions and exhibits, and held public hearings across Australia. The committee’s report included 17 recommendations aimed at ensuring that Indigenous people have the best access to legal resources within available resources.</para>
<para>In May 2005 the committee resolved to review developments in aviation security in Australia since the Public Accounts and Audit Committee’s Report 400: <inline font-style="italic">Review of aviation security in Australia,</inline> which was tabled in June 2004. The committee decided to re-open the inquiry in the light of a number of disturbing incidents in Australian aviation security since June 2004. At September 2005, the committee had received 71 submissions and had undertaken a number of public hearings and inspections. The committee received briefings from Sir John Wheeler on the outcomes of his inquiry into aviation security and is looking to build on these with further recommendations. The committee intends to report during 2006.</para>
<para>The committee has been very busy during 2004-05 fulfilling its responsibility to review Auditor-General’s reports. Prior to the election, the previous committee tabled Report 402, which reviewed six Auditor-General’s reports. Following the election, the committee resolved to complete a review of three Auditor-General’s reports that had been started in the previous parliament. In addition, the committee selected a further eight new audit reports for a detailed examination. The committee recently tabled Report 404, which outlines the committee’s findings on 11 audit reports and makes 42 recommendations to improve agencies’ efficiency and effectiveness. A theme emerging in these audit reports is the need for APS agencies to be aware of their responsibilities for accountability, value-for-money contract management and compliance with legislative requirements for financial management. These are issues the committee intends to continue looking at over the next 12 months.</para>
<para>In May 2005, the committee reviewed the ANAO draft budget estimates for 2005-06. In my report to the parliament on budget day, I stated that the committee was satisfied that the Audit Office had sufficient budget allocation for 2005-06 but was concerned that the Audit Office might have to curtail some of its discretionary activities in future years. We will continue to seek advice from the Audit Office on its budget position throughout the year.</para>
<para>The Auditor-General Act 1997 established the Auditor-General as an ‘independent officer of the parliament’, with a 10-year term, and stipulated that the Prime Minister, when nominating a new Auditor-General, must seek the Public Accounts and Audit Committee’s approval of the nomination prior to recommending an appointment to the Governor-General. Mr Pat Barrett AO served as the Auditor-General from March 1995. Under the act, his 10-year term expired in March 2005. On 1 March 2005 the Prime Minister wrote to the committee, nominating Mr Ian McPhee as the new Auditor-General. This was the first occasion since the introduction of the Auditor-General Act that the Public Accounts and Audit Committee had been involved in the selection of an Auditor-General. The committee considered the Prime Minister’s nomination and unanimously agreed to endorse the nomination of Mr McPhee, a respected former Deputy Auditor-General. I commend the committee’s annual report to the House. (<inline font-style="italic">Time expired</inline>)</para>

<para>—I rise to support the chair in the tabling of Report 405. In doing so I support very strongly the role of the JCPAA in supporting the ANAO in making sure that the public are well represented in this parliament, that our government is accountable and that the public receives value for money and efficient and effective performance by government departments and agencies. With a government that has been in power for almost 10 years and is now controlling both houses of the parliament, it is an important time for avenues of accountability. This report represents significant work undertaken by committee members in two parliaments—the members of the committee of the 40th Parliament, when the committee was chaired by Bob Charles, and the members of the current committee of the 41st Parliament. For that effort I acknowledge the work of all committee members past and present.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The federal election in October 2004 created significant time delays. I particularly thank the secretariat, who have worked at an amazing pace to progress the audit of the ANAO’s reports and the completion of JCPAA Report 404 and of this annual report—Report 405.</para>
<para>Report 403, <inline font-style="italic">Access of Indigenous Australians to law and justice services</inline>, deserves special mention because of the particular willingness of the Indigenous community to present to the committee. The visit to Yuendumu in Central Australia at the invitation of the local community was of particular worth in demonstrating how isolated communities are working to combine local solutions with the legal and justice systems to bring about better outcomes in dealing with problems of domestic violence and substance abuse. I particularly thank the people of Yuendumu for their generous hospitality, and I acknowledge the cooperation and support of the Northern Territory government at that time.</para>
<para>This report makes some very specific recommendations to the government. In particular it recommends the extension of the family violence prevention legal services for Indigenous people throughout regional and metropolitan Australia. It also recommends the setting of clear targets for different types of legal services, so that none are overlooked or subsumed by the urgent and most critical cases. We look forward to a response from the government before the end of this year.</para>
<para>In the period covered by this annual report the committee has also resumed its investigation and inquiry into aviation security. In considering our role, it is interesting to note that this year the attention given to the continuing concerns of the travelling public regarding ongoing incidents of crime and security at airports assisted, as did our reopening of this inquiry, in bringing about an independent review of aviation security by Sir John Wheeler. Having met with Sir John, our committee are of the view that our work has been complementary. At the moment we are considering interim findings to be reported to the parliament.</para>
<para>This inquiry has been particularly onerous for committee members and secretariat staff, and I acknowledge their additional efforts, given all the travel, the extensive reading and the number of submissions that have been received. I also acknowledge all those organisations and government agencies that have made submissions and presentations to the committee. However, having been on both inquiries, I do raise my concern at the reluctance of Customs to provide full support and open disclosure. That has not been reflected in the attitude of Customs personnel on the ground—our visit to Perth Customs I found particularly useful. I hope that the management of Customs reconsider their reluctance to furnish us with a report that was obviously leaked to the media and to the public but not furnished to the parliament.</para>
<para>Report 404 was tabled and looked at 11 ANAO reports. From that report several themes have emerged that we consider require further work. Those themes were very much about financial management. As a result we have asked that the Public Service Commissioner and the Secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet meet with the committee, as they will in the next fortnight or so, to talk about the pursuit of performance improvement in the area of financial management. I would like to thank the previous Auditor-General, Pat Barrett, for his work and I extend to Ian McPhee the support of the committee and our willingness to progress his goals as the new Auditor-General.</para>
<para>Finally I draw attention to the need for a response to some of our committee’s recommendations. I hope that the government will respond. Our committee has a very good record in terms of recommendations being supported wholly or in principle—85 per cent have been. However, there are still some recommendations to be reported on. I commend the report to the parliament. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—by leave—The Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission tabled its report in the Senate some days ago. This is the first opportunity the House has had to consider that report. Generally the report is very favourable towards the transition that has been made from the National Crime Authority to the new structure of the Australian Crime Commission. However, this was the first major review of the Australian Crime Commission Act since the commission was established in 2002. In consequence, there are a number of matters to which the attention of the government and the parliament have been directed.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The report makes 18 recommendations. The committee is particularly concerned with the accountability and integrity regime for the Australian Crime Commission and for parliamentary scrutiny of law enforcement generally. The committee has worked in a most exemplary bipartisan way. I commend the chairmanship of Senator Santoro in that regard—and the work of the committee secretariat. Of course, parliamentary oversight of this organisation is important because the Australian Crime Commission exercises coercive powers, which are becoming more and more a feature of the law enforcement landscape. The committee wanted to ensure that those continue to be exercised with the utmost care and only in the circumstances that the parliament intended.</para>
<para>With that in mind, the committee has taken the view that, without parliament addressing certain matters, there will be the potential risk that the powers of the Australian Crime Commission will be used for routine policing rather than for the specialised purposes for which it was established—that is, for serious and organised crime.</para>
<para>For that reason, one of the key recommendations of the committee’s report is that the act be amended such that any expansion in the number of the examiners appointed to exercise the coercive powers granted under the Australian Crime Commission Act beyond the current three requires parliamentary approval, either by amendment to legislation or by regulations which are disallowable by both the House and the Senate. The important point is that the transition was not intended to facilitate a broadening of the range of the coercive powers into routine policing; rather, it was meant to make certain that there would be effective cooperation between state and Commonwealth law enforcement authorities but targeted towards the specific objectives of the act and consistent with the framework that this parliament has approved.</para>
<para>The other point that the committee has identified as requiring specific parliamentary attention into the future is the absence presently of any oversight body for the Australian Federal Police. The Australian Federal Police has an expanding role and, quite distinct to the other organisations which have significant security implications for this nation—the Australian Crime Commission and the intelligence agencies—no oversight through a parliamentary body. Its expanding role and budget, its place in counter-terrorism deployment—such as RAMSI in the Solomon Islands and crime fighting in South-East Asia—and of course the continuing and important work that it undertakes in the broad law enforcement of federal law mean that there are more reasons than ever for the Australian Federal Police to be brought within the system of parliamentary scrutiny.</para>
<para>Other recommendations include that the committee be able to refer matters of concern to the proposed Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, which the government is giving consideration to establishing; amendments to the act to clarify the responsibilities of all agencies represented on the ACC board, including state police forces, to provide information to the committee; and the formalisation of existing practices for the reporting of allegations of misconduct to the Ombudsman. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para class="block">As members of this House are aware, the human rights situation in Zimbabwe has been in a state of constant decline since well before the millennium. Zimbabwe’s President, Robert Mugabe, and his ZANU-PF party, which has held power since 1980, have been progressively strengthening their grip on the organs of government. They have intimidated the judiciary and the parliament, run the economy into the ground and terrorised large sections of the citizenry. The human rights situation is appalling and continues to deteriorate.</para>
<para>On 18 May the government of Zimbabwe launched its so-called Operation Restore Order, or Murambatsvina, which means ‘clean out the trash’. This operation is aimed at shanty towns in urban areas which supported the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, or MDC, party and has led to great suffering and misery. On 20 August Amnesty International released secret footage smuggled from Zimbabwe which graphically illustrates the plight of the victims of the clean out the trash program. The footage was filmed early in August and includes shots of victims being held in Hopley Farm with inadequate food, shelter and sanitation.</para>
<para>Operation Murambatsvina is estimated to have displaced 700,000 people. Approximately 6,000 have been placed into transit camps. The vast majority have been forced into overcrowded households in urban and rural areas, or in many cases are forced to sleep outside.</para>
<para>In July of this year the United Nations issued a damning report on the effects of Operation Murambatsvina. The Mugabe regime responded by closing the transit camps in Bulawayo and Harare, taking the displaced persons under cover of darkness to be scattered through various rural locations. The report states that this campaign has affected some 2.4 million people in Zimbabwe. This campaign has increased the impacts of hunger and malnutrition and has disrupted programs designed to address the spread of HIV-AIDS in southern Africa. This so-called Operation Clean out the Trash is just another example of the breakdown of the rule of law and the move to authoritarian government in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe is suffering as a result of Mugabe’s rule, with widespread food shortages in a country that was once the food bowl of Africa. Under Mugabe and the ZANU-PF, Zimbabwe has lost the right to hold its government accountable.</para>
<para>As members would be aware, Zimbabwe recently held parliamentary elections, which the Australian foreign minister, Mr Downer, described as fraudulent. Voters were intimidated to the point that the government threatened to disallow access to government grain stores for communities which voted for the opposition. There is grave concern over the rorting of the nation’s electoral rolls, with the respected Electoral Institute of Southern Africa expressing its deep reservations. Changes were made to electoral boundaries with the sole aim of favouring the ruling ZANU-PF candidates and disenfranchising the electors. The government ensured with these rigged elections that it not only clung to power but conferred upon itself a majority large enough to alter Zimbabwe’s constitution.</para>
<para>The notion of the rule of law has been in jeopardy for some significant time in Zimbabwe. In August 2005, shortly after the fraudulent general elections in Zimbabwe, the rigged parliament voted to confer new powers on Mugabe’s autocratic regime. The principal changes to the constitution allow Mugabe and his henchmen to nationalise seized properties, provide for the establishment of a new 65-member Senate and act to restrict overseas travel by opponents of the government. The main opposition party, the MDC, continues to work under extreme duress and harassment from the authorities in Zimbabwe, with several trade union and human rights activists arrested at the start of this month. We are deeply disturbed by the government’s move to suppress democratic opposition and basic freedoms, such as freedom of speech, freedom of movement and freedom of assembly. I congratulate the Australian government, which has been at the forefront of international action against Mugabe and his regime.</para>
<para>The Australian foreign minister announced in August that Australia would provide a further $1 million to assist the victims of Operation Murambatsvina. The Australian government has also led calls for the International Cricket Council to allow teams to forfeit tours to Zimbabwe. The Australian government is also lobbying to have the UN Security Council refer this situation to the International Criminal Court, but there are obviously complex legal and political obstacles to this course of action. Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to make it clear that we condemn the actions of the Zimbabwe government and call on its leader to change these measures that have been taken. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>—The previous speaker, the member for Cook, indicated that these problems started well before the millennium. In actual fact what we are seeing now is the culmination of two decades of suppression by the government of Zimbabwe. Back in 1985 they launched a massive ethnic cleansing operation in Matabeleland, slaughtering large numbers of the minority people. That left a situation where Joshua Nkomo was made an offer that he could not refuse: that his defeated people become part of the coalition government and basically become integrated into the Mugabe party. In 1989 Edgar Tekere, a former general secretary of the Mugabe operation, broke with the government and indicated that Zimbabwe was on the way to one-party rule and endemic corruption. So it is not a recent phenomenon that we are witnessing.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>One point I want to deal with is the allegation by the Zimbabwean regime that this is some kind of Anglo-Saxon conspiracy against the government. COSATU, the Congress of South African Trade Unions, recently attacked the arrest of virtually the entire leadership of 120 people, including the president and the secretary, of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, the ZCTU. The reason they were protesting was the economic situation in the country—growing poverty, an 80 per cent unemployment rate and 360 per cent inflation. That is the outcome of this regime’s measures.</para>
<para>Obviously, the issue that has been mentioned the most internationally is the question of the settlement of settlers’ properties. Originally, they were given 90 days notice. That was reduced some years ago to seven days notice. In reality the country has become a basket case in regard to food production. It is not only Britain and other Western, particularly English speaking, countries that have been critical of this regime.</para>
<para>Having cited COSATU I also refer to the United Nations. A special inquiry last summer condemned the operation to remove people as a violation of international law and a catastrophe. It has displaced 700,000 people and affected another 1.7 million. The very credible Human Rights Watch said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... the evictions had disrupted treatment for people with HIV/Aids in a country where 3,000 die from the disease each week and about 1.3 million children have been orphaned.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Over many years, starting in 2001 with the suspension of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily News</inline>, there have been severe restrictions on the press in the country. When journalists are not detained, or expelled if they are foreign nationals, then the presses are destroyed. People have to have licences to be journalists. The situation on that front has made it basically a one-party state with very little option for people to get alternative views, despite courageous efforts by some journalists and publishers.</para>
<para>In March 2005, as indicated by the previous speaker, there were elections. An amazing 3.4 million people who were political and economic refugees from this regime were deprived of voting rights. That is a fairly large part of the population. As people are aware, many people in the April elections were turned away and told they could not vote if they were regarded as living in areas hostile to the regime. The MDC faces a reality where its leadership is constantly jailed, people are refused food assistance if they do not vote for the ruling party, people have no rights of employment and there are, as I said, severe restrictions.</para>
<para>Rather than seeing this as some giant conspiracy against a very repressive regime, which at another stage interfered in the internal affairs of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, I would cite Andrew Mitchell, the shadow international development secretary, when he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Mugabe’s brutal expulsion of white farmers was only a trial run. He has since persecuted and starved hundreds of thousands of black Zimbabweans ... The government should be doing more to coordinate a response with what used to be called the frontline states, the UN and other African countries, particularly South Africa.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I certainly associate myself very strongly with the nature of this motion. It says that Australia has taken a reasonable role in these matters. I can only agree totally with the foreign minister of Australia when he condemned the recent Senate elections. He made the point that this new house, rather than acting as some kind of oversight within Zimbabwean politics, was simply a resting place for sinecures for stooges of the current government. As with the lower house, large numbers of people are essentially picked by either Mugabe personally or by the council of tribal chiefs, which he dominates as well. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—First, I thank the member for Cook for bringing this motion forward in this House. It is not the first time a motion of this sort has been brought to the House in relation to Zimbabwe. It is terrible to think that, in 2005, there are still what I call tin pot dictators running countries like Zimbabwe and treating their citizens appallingly. It is a terrible abuse of power and obviously designed to satisfy the leader and his cronies and to ensure that they have more than sufficient to meet their day-to-day needs while consigning many in that country to the most terrible deprivations. A lot of my concern rests with women and children—who, in these circumstances, always seem to be particularly vulnerable.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The human rights abuse in Zimbabwe is appalling. The situation can only deteriorate if the current regime continues along the path it is on. It is really concerning that on 18 May the Zimbabwean government launched what it calls Operation Restore Order or Operation Murambatsvina, which, literally translated in the Shona language, means ‘Throw out the trash.’ That the government or leaders of any country could consider as trash any of its citizens, no matter what their circumstances are, ought to be of great concern not just to us in this Australian parliament but to every member of every parliament internationally.</para>
<para>We in the House last debated this issue about three years ago, I think. I am very pleased that, from the beginning, our Minister for Foreign Affairs has taken a very strong role in urging, through the forums of the Commonwealth countries, action against Mr Mugabe and his regime. Australia has continued to not only take action in its own right but participate with the international community. In August this year, when Zimbabwe’s parliament voted for constitutional change to enable the government to expropriate farmland, restrict overseas travel by government opponents and create a new 66-member Senate to provide further opportunities for ZANU-PF patronage, our minister, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, spoke out very strongly against it. Just yesterday or the day before, I heard him on the radio speaking out again about this.</para>
<para>The Australian action has been very decisive. Australia has taken every opportunity to bring pressure to bear on the administration of Zimbabwe. We have had bilateral smart sanctions in place since late 2002. I support that. Once again, general sanctions serve only to create more hardship, particularly for women and children. The smart sanctions that have been in place have been periodically tightened. They have included travel bans and a freeze on the assets of Zimbabwe ministers and officials held in Australia, suspension of transit without visa privileges for Zimbabwean passport holders, the downgrading of cultural links and the suspension of non-humanitarian aid. Defence links and sales of defence related equipment have also been suspended. I support this.</para>
<para>I understand that Minister Downer has also worked with the foreign minister of New Zealand, Mr Goff, to represent the situation in Zimbabwe to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and to members of the UN Security Council, urging investigations of past and present human rights abuses and consideration of referral to the International Criminal Court.</para>
<para>Leaders such as those in Zimbabwe who do not have the interests of their country or their peoples at heart and who cause such pain and hardship should have to be accountable not only in their own country but to the international community. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Along with members who have previously spoken, including the member for Cook, who has brought this motion before the House, I want to record the support of members on this side of the House for the motion, particularly given the urgency of what is now happening in Zimbabwe and given the history that some members have already referred to.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I hope that motions of this kind can serve to add to both the political and the public discourse, which are approaching the tempo of universal condemnation for what is happening in Zimbabwe at present. I also note the reflections of the member for Pearce on what the government has done to this point in time. Certainly we very much support both the actions that have been taken and a continuation of them in the event that the Mugabe regime digs its heels in even further, as it seems to show some signs of doing.</para>
<para>There is no question that Zimbabwe’s continued disregard for human rights is now a pre-eminent concern for the world community. The fact that the government has kept in place repressive laws such as the Public Order and Security Act and the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act, which it uses to suppress criticism and open debate, is deeply worrying. These laws are directed at community leaders, at opposition parties and their supporters, and also at the independent media. The legislation that was recently tabled in the parliament and that has been referred to in the House now regulates the ability of non-government organisations, NGOs, to operate in the country as well. This is all deeply worrying. The AIPPA Amendment Bill will further restrict the ability of the media to report freely without fear or favour and will mark probably the last opportunity that the rest of the world community—apart from those who have direct connections with people in Zimbabwe—has to know about what is happening there.</para>
<para>We have witnessed a deterioration of the Zimbabwean human rights record over time, with the many reports of state sponsored intimidation, arbitrary arrest, torture and attacks on supporters of the political opposition, human rights defenders and the independent media.</para>
<para>I must make brief mention of the use of sedition laws by Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe is now one of the few countries in the world that makes active use of sedition laws. Those laws have been repealed in countries like Canada, Ireland and New Zealand. I had hoped that we in this parliament would not have to look at them. It is clear that the laws that have been enacted by the Zimbabwean regime demonstrate its contempt for its existing international obligations, including the fact that it is a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights. All of these international obligations are flouted by the Zimbabwean regime.</para>
<para>As members have previously referred to, the operation translated as Operation Clean-up—Operation Murambatsvina; ‘Getting rid of the filth’ is the literal translation—was initiated in May this year and, regrettably, has seen an escalation of the aggressive pressure on other voices and groups in Zimbabwe who seek to make their voices heard and to speak out against the regime.</para>
<para>I do not think it is any coincidence that we are discussing these issues at the end of a year which has, regrettably, seen human rights abuses take place in many parts of the world. Yet there is something poignant about the fact that the African continent very much ought to be able to follow the lead of the South American continent in seeking out ways in which they can move their polities to full democracy. I am sure that, when the colonialisation process finished, there were high hopes for countries like Zimbabwe. They have been dashed by Mr Mugabe and his regime.</para>
<para>We support the motion. We note, as previous members did, the release of the Human Rights Watch report which says simply that the Zimbabwean government is causing untold suffering to poor and vulnerable people and that that government is now delaying the provision of much-needed humanitarian assistance to those people who have been affected by the actions of that government. People are unable to vote and unable to have their voices heard and, as the member for Pearce rightly observes, women and children are particularly vulnerable. So we support the motion. It is tragic that that country should be heading towards a state of further unrest and suffering when, in reality, they ought to be heading in the opposite direction, toward a more fully realised independence. But at this point in time it is absolutely clear that we need to put increasing pressure on the intolerable Mugabe regime. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—It is with sadness that I rise today to speak on the member for Cook’s motion on the issue of Zimbabwe and on international concern about human rights in that country. It is sad that the member for Cook had to put this motion before the House. For a number of years now, Zimbabwe, under the regime of President Mugabe, has attracted international condemnation over the treatment of its people and the mismanagement of that country. Many issues and stories are emanating from Zimbabwe, and they all tell of the devastating conditions there. I would like to make the House aware of some of the terrible actions that are taking place in that country.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>President Mugabe has rejected an offer from the United Nations for $US30 million in aid to provide temporary shelter, blankets and food for all those people whose homes have been bulldozed by his government. This offer was rejected, despite the fact that more than four million people require food aid urgently. Any criticism of the Zimbabwean government has been made illegal under changes to the Zimbabwean constitution. These changes have legitimised the seizure of farms, prohibited court challenges to those seizures and prevented critics from travelling abroad. Many of the farms seized have been given to supporters of President Mugabe who have absolutely no interest in or knowledge of farming. This has resulted in a significant shortage of food, with the country’s agriculture minister himself admitting that the country has simply run out of food. Not only are millions of people in Zimbabwe without food but the significant fall in agricultural production has and continues to have a devastating impact on the country’s economy. More than 75 per cent of the population of Zimbabwe is unemployed; that is an absolutely staggering figure. Shortages of basic commodities are causing further hardship, and President Mugabe is not at all interested in helping his people.</para>
<para>The name of recent Operation Murambatsvina, or Operation Restore Order, can have many meanings, and we have heard many translations of that in this House today. One meaning is ‘sweep away the rubbish’, and another is ‘clean out the trash’. The one we have just heard is ‘getting rid of the filth’. But the one thing we know is that it all means one thing: that the Mugabe government is imposing penalties and causing impending hardship to the vulnerable people of Zimbabwe. This operation has resulted in more than 700,000 homeless and jobless and has affected another 2.4 million people indirectly. This campaign has also disrupted all the important HIV-AIDS treatment programs within Zimbabwe, something that we all hold dear and something that we aspire to overcome—the scourge and ravage of the disease of HIV-AIDS.</para>
<para>Australia has joined with other like-minded governments to pressure for change through a combination of bilateral sanctions and international action. Australia has had bilateral smart sanctions in place since 2002, which have been tightened on a regular basis. Included in these actions are travel bans, freezing the assets of Zimbabwean ministers and officials that are held here in Australia and suspension of non-humanitarian aid and sales of defence related equipment. The Howard government has also contributed financially to humanitarian aid, including $1 million through UNICEF for the victims of Operation Restore Order. There is about $90,000 in emergency relief and $2.5 million through the World Food Program specifically for Zimbabwe.</para>
<para>For six years now, President Mugabe has ruled Zimbabwe with little or no regard for human rights, democracy or the presence of opposition parties. Instead, he has turned one of Africa’s strongest agricultural producers into a nation of people who are now without food and shelter and with increasing economic and health problems. President Mugabe has blatantly ignored calls from the international community for change and ignored all pleas for an end to human rights abuses. I strongly support the motion put forward by the member for Cook, and we call on the Zimbabwean government to recognise the impact of its policies on its people. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I rise in support of this motion to discuss the ever-growing crisis in Zimbabwe and would like to add my voice to those of others who have spoken on the motion. I am going to start at the end, given the short time that is remaining for this debate. In adding to the range of concerns that have already been touched upon, I want to make clear, as other speakers have, that Labor supports the steps that the Howard government has been taking to continue to put pressure on the government of Zimbabwe to reform. We support all the measures outlined in this motion but believe that we can keep looking for more things that should and can be done. In particular, we believe that Australia should be leading the push to get the United Nations Security Council to refer Mr Mugabe to the International Criminal Court for indictment for crimes against humanity. The other speakers have made well and truly clear how this is justified, and I think it is a tool that should be used. If there is one lesson that we have learned from the last century, it is that, if a humane world is ever to be achieved in countries beyond just our own, brutal thugs like Mr Mugabe need to be brought to heel before the one power that will always have authority over them: the law.</para>

<para>—We are very proud of our public education system here in the ACT, and recently I had the pleasure of seeing a great example. Calwell High School, in my electorate, held an arts extravaganza which included dance, bands, drama and ensembles, visual displays including digital photography, arts and ceramics. The level of involvement and achievement on display was exceptional. The entertainment program was excellent, with a participation rate which included most of the students at this school in one way or another. It is good for me to have the opportunity to bring to the attention of this House the achievements of Calwell High School. I congratulate everyone at the school.</para>

<para>I also want to talk about Valley FM 89.5 community radio in Tuggeranong. At the National Community Radio Conference in Perth, Western Australia, on 18 November, Valley FM was presented with the award for the best value for money radio station in Australia. Three hundred and fifty community radio stations were competing for this award. The President, Chris Moy, very proudly accepted that honour. I am pleased to see that Valley FM has also received $1,500 worth of professional radio broadcast training, to be provided by the Australian Film, Television and Radio School in early 2006. I offer my heartiest of congratulations to Valley FM 89.5 on a really good result.</para>

<para>—I rise today to express the concern of the residents of the electorate of Cook and the Sutherland shire at the announcement made during the break by Premier Iemma in relation to the desalination plant at Kurnell. Further plans have been announced. We now have the private sector involved. Again, it is without any consultation with the local community. Again, it is without any plans for an environmental impact statement. Again, it is ignoring all the advice from every environmental expert in Australia that this is not the right way to go, that there are alternative ways of proceeding and that it would be much better to recycle waste water than to spend $1.2 billion on this particular program. This will be the largest desalination plant in the world. It is without testing in any shape, size or form. It is totally opposed by the residents of the Sutherland shire. Its impact on the waterways around the Cronulla area and into Port Botany and on the transiting whales that come past the headlands at Port Botany will be significant. We are totally opposed to it on environmental grounds and on economic grounds. It flies in the face of every environmental expert in Australia. On behalf of my residents, I condemn this action and ask for further consultation to occur. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—With the final hours of the life of Van Nguyen ticking away, he is constantly in the thoughts of many members in this House. I take this opportunity to ask that the government continue to pursue every avenue of appeal to prevent this sentence from being carried out. In our endeavours to save the life of this young man we must be satisfied that we have left no stone unturned. I strongly urge the government to bring the matter before the International Court of Justice. As the shadow minister for foreign affairs stated in a doorstop this morning:</para>

<quote>
<para class="block">Some in the government are saying that there is no point in doing this because Singapore will explicitly reject the jurisdiction of the Court. Our argument to that is let Singapore do that. It is not for us to decide what Singapore will do in advance, it is for Singapore to decide. It is for Singapore to explain publicly why they could not accept the jurisdiction of the International Court in this matter when they have already accepted the International Court’s jurisdiction in a territorial dispute with Malaysia.</para>

<para class="block">In a final plea to the government of Singapore, I can only ask on behalf of the mother of Van Nguyen that she be allowed to hold her son. As a mother, I can imagine the pain in the heart of the mother who brought him into the world and suffered so much to bring him to Australia, the mother who struggled to raise her sons in a new country and the mother who will now lose him this way without being able to hold him or to kiss him one last time. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

They are a unique experience, and they are also a way in which the local community can really get together and demonstrate the great things that they have in that region. My congratulations go particularly to the President of the AJC, as we call it, the Adaminaby Jockey Club—not the one on Sydney. The President, Jim Madden, and also Jenny Madden have worked tirelessly for a number of years to get this meet back into a position where it is one of the great country race meetings of the region. I also thank Country Energy, who came good in helping out with a new transformer so that we had no problems with power. It can be difficult in the mountains, with storms and various things, and it was great that that went well. Many people might know Adaminaby racecourse as the location for the filming of <inline font-style="italic">Phar Lap</inline>.

<para>—Today I wish to pay tribute in the House to Mr Alex Peken. On 11 November at Smithfield RSL, I was honoured to present Mr Peken with a plaque containing the sands of Gallipoli. This presentation was arranged by Smithfield RSL subbranch in recognition of Alex’s role in pioneering the commemoration of the Battle for Australia. This battle, of course, needs to be commemorated. Who can forget Kokoda, Milne Bay and Midway? Not many people can say, ‘I saved my nation,’ but the men and women who served in these battles can say exactly that. Mr Peken suggested that on the first Wednesday in September each year the club commemorate the Battle for Australia. The club took up his suggestion, and several other clubs have now also begun to commemorate the Battle for Australia. Mr Peken has much to be proud of. He has been instrumental in a growing movement to honour the people involved in this important episode in our nation’s history. I have discussed with the RSL subbranch and other subbranches in my area other ways that we can promote the legacy and memory of the heroes of the Battle for Australia. I am particularly keen to promote the legacy of Kokoda to our younger generations, and I look forward to working with the RSL clubs in my electorate towards this aim next year.</para>

<para>—I would also like to take this opportunity to personally make a final plea for clemency for Mr Van Nguyen, as many other members have done both in the House and outside. Last Friday in my electorate we had a ceremony at the Buddhist temple in Braybrook. A large number of community members who had contacted our office, the local papers and elsewhere expressed their distress at the actions that the Singaporean government seemed determined to take, and they wanted somewhere that they could publicly voice their opposition to the death penalty. We were very pleased that the Venerable Thich Phuoc Tan agreed for us to have our ceremony in his temple. Although it was not a religious ceremony, for many people it was an opportunity to be part of the Reach Out campaign and to voice their opposition to the death penalty and their support for Mr Nguyen’s family at this terrible time.</para>

I would like to pass on to the House the local electorate’s concern about this issue and to add the voices of those who attended this local ceremony to those of the many other Australians who hopefully will attend the events that Amnesty International has organised on Wednesday and Thursday to urge the Singaporean government to issue clemency in this case. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I congratulate the Springwood Bowls Club for organising the prestige fours bowling tournament. I had the pleasure of opening that tournament yesterday at 8.30 am. Springwood Bowls Club is the epicentre of social activity in Logan East. It is a tremendous club. All those who participate in the club, those who manage it and the ladies who organise the Springwood Bowls Club deserve the highest accolades. We in our community know that it is very important to have at least one major centre where people can congregate as a community. The Springwood Bowls Club provides that in Logan East not only for those with an interest in bowling but for those with an interest in any sport or range of activities. They are a tremendous bunch of people and they deserve to be mentioned in the House of Representatives in front of such a big gathering. I trust that they have a great tournament over the coming days.</para>

<para>—On the issue of the <inline ref="R2465">Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005</inline>, I remind the House that the $46 million that the union movement has contributed to the Labor Party over the last 10 years has been done in a very partisan way. I am sure there are many unionists who do not agree with that approach. Just remember that no-one has the monopoly on wisdom in this place. With union membership in the private enterprise work force being at 17 per cent, surely it is time for the ACTU to consider the reality that they need to appeal to a much broader base.</para>

The international tournament for women’s hockey started three days ago, and it goes through this week to next weekend. It is hosted by Hockey ACT, under the auspices of Hockey Australia. We have teams from many countries, including Germany and the Netherlands. Everyone will be pleased to know that so far the Hockeyroos are doing us proud, having won two-nil so far. The competition is being held at the ACT Hockey Centre in Lyneham. I commend everyone who is involved with Hockey ACT for the enormous amount of work that has gone into bringing this international competition together. They are to be congratulated. If anyone in this place is here over the weekend, I strongly endorse the idea of going out to see some world-class women’s hockey at the ACT Hockey Centre at Lyneham. I suggest that you would enjoy it very much. Again, my congratulations to everyone involved.</para>

</talker>
<para>—First, I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question and for his interest and concern. I know a lot of the members of the House—if not all, for that matter—are very concerned about the fact that an Australian citizen, Van Nguyen, faces execution on Friday morning, having been convicted of a very serious drug offence. In this House, members overwhelmingly oppose capital punishment, and this government and the previous Australian government have always campaigned for clemency for Australians who have been sentenced to death.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The government began making representations in support of Mr Nguyen when we argued that the charges against him should be reduced to a non-capital charge. This was before the trial began in November 2003. Going back over the files, I note that the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison, raised the issue at a ministerial level with the Singapore government on 16 December 2002, four days after Mr Nguyen was arrested. Our High Commissioner in Singapore also made representations on these grounds to the Singapore Attorney-General in June 2003. When Daryl Williams was the Attorney-General, he did the same in August 2003, and I wrote to the then Minister for Foreign Affairs of Singapore, Professor Jayakumar, in November 2003, making the argument for reducing the charges to a non-capital charge. If members of the House are interested, I will table the letter that I sent to Professor Jayakumar back in November 2003, so that people understand the length of the period for which we have been making representations and the different arguments that have been made during that period of time.</para>
<para>Until clemency was formally rejected recently, the government deliberately pursued a purposeful and targeted approach with the Singapore government. We tended to keep the issue away from the media spotlight. That was a strategy that we developed with Van Nguyen’s lawyers. As the House knows, strong representations have been made regarding this case to our counterparts in Singapore at the most senior levels on numerous occasions. I will not delay the House by reading them all out, but, again, I will table a list of some of the representations that have been made over recent times. These are over and above those that I have spoken about already.</para>
<para>The fact is that an enormous number of representations have been made. Those who have been following the media recently will be aware that during CHOGM the Prime Minister again took time to raise the issue with Prime Minister Lee of Singapore. During those discussions with Prime Minister Lee, the Singapore Prime Minister again made it clear, of course—not to our surprise, and sadly—that Singapore intended to go ahead with the execution.</para>
<para>I can only say in conclusion that I know members are saddened that the death penalty now confronts Van Nguyen. I think honourable members are aware of the enormous amount of effort that has been made by not just the government but other members of the House, both government and opposition. I know the member for Pearce and the member for Fowler, for example, made representations as leaders of a parliamentary delegation recently. They made them at amongst the highest of levels. You, Mr Speaker, have made representations, as have many others. So an enormous effort has been made. I have said all along—because I think it pays to be honest with people and to be frank about it—that, since the letter came from my Singapore counterpart, George Yeo, saying that the appeal for clemency had been rejected, I have been very pessimistic that there is anything more we can do. I have not wanted to hold out false hope.</para>
<para>We continue to do what we can. We continue to work our way through all of the issues. But there is no doubt from the representations we have made to the Singapore government that, right from the very beginning, they have been absolutely determined to stick with their policy of capital punishment. As they have often said to us, bearing in mind that they execute their own people, to grant clemency to a foreigner would be impossible for them to explain to the families of Singaporeans who have been executed. That is their argument. They believe capital punishment acts as a powerful deterrent to drug trafficking, as well as other serious crimes. We do not all agree with that argument, but we have done everything we can in terms of diplomatic representations. In particular, over the weekend the Prime Minister has made a very real last effort with Prime Minister Lee.</para>

<para>—My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Noting the positive efforts that the government has undertaken so far on Mr Nguyen’s behalf, I refer to the legal opinions of Dr Chris Ward, university medallist in international law from Cambridge, and Professor Don Rothwell, Challis Professor of International Law at the University of Sydney. The opinions argue that there is a credible basis in international law for an action to be brought against Singapore in the International Court of Justice in relation to the case of Mr Nguyen. I refer also to the reported statements by the minister’s officials today in the press that this proposal is still under consideration by the government. Mindful of the diplomatic actions already taken by the Prime Minister and the foreign minister, I ask: will the government please give positive consideration to now acting on the Ward and Rothwell advices and initiate an action in the international court?</para>

<para>—I thank the honourable member for Griffith for his question and for his concern. The government has examined very carefully the legal options that have been put forward, including those by Don Rothwell and Chris Ward, to whom the honourable member referred. Obviously I have also been in close contact with Lex Lasry and his team, and I have examined—and had examined, which is probably more to the point—the suggestions that they have brought forward.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The problem is that every suggestion that has been put forward—with one exception, which I will come to—has required Singapore’s agreement to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice for a case to be taken to the court. I had a letter yesterday from Don Rothwell, the professor of international law at Sydney university, and of course I have had some contact with him over the last week on this matter. His letter was really just to the effect that he would like us to ask Singapore to accept the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice in this matter, which is a reasonable proposition.</para>
<para>I can tell the honourable member and the House more generally that the Prime Minister raised this very same point with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in Malta. Prime Minister Lee made it clear that Singapore would not accept the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice, and that had been the impression that we had had all along. That is, of course, not a surprising response from Prime Minister Lee, bearing in mind that Singapore have made it very clear they want to pursue the execution of Van Nguyen for heroin trafficking. We regret that the Singapore government have taken that view.</para>
<para>The only other alternative which has been put to me, which was put to me by Chris Ward and Don Rothwell last week, related to article 36, from recollection, of the 1961 UN narcotics convention. We referred this proposition to the government’s lawyers in the Attorney-General’s Department and my department. They had a meeting with both Ward and Rothwell the following day, and they were very strongly of the view that no credible case could be brought to the International Court of Justice on the basis of the 1961 narcotics convention.</para>
<para>Not prepared to give up on that, I then referred this case to Professor James Crawford, whom honourable members may know of. Those who have studied international law will certainly know of Professor James Crawford. He has represented Australia in the International Court of Justice and is a professor of international law at the University of Cambridge. Chris Ward suggested that we refer this case to Professor Crawford. Unfortunately, the advice we received from him was that there was no basis whatsoever for taking Singapore to the International Court of Justice on the basis of that convention.</para>
<para>All of this is disappointing. I suppose that these same issues were examined back in 1993 and in the 1980s when Australians were executed by Malaysia. The sad thing is that at this stage we can find no aspect of international law which would enable us to take Singapore to the International Court of Justice without Singapore’s consent, without them being prepared to allow the International Court of Justice to arbitrate and make a decision.</para>
<para>Singapore have on one occasion accepted the court’s jurisdiction, in relation to a territorial dispute with Malaysia, and I know the honourable member for Griffith has referred to this in public statements and press releases. But they have certainly made it clear that they will not accept the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice in relation to capital punishment and specifically in relation to Van Nguyen’s case.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I thank the honourable member for Maranoa for his question. The member for Maranoa recognises only too well the significance of an ambitious outcome as far as the Doha Round of multilateral negotiations is concerned. Given that this round was launched in 2001, we are in the final stages of trying to conclude an outcome that will assist Australian farmers, manufacturers, service providers and exporters.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Prime Minister has just concluded the CHOGM in Malta. Prior to that, he was at a meeting of APEC leaders in Korea. At both those meetings he argued and led the case for a very strong call for those countries, those wealthy nations across the world, who are still currently holding out against an ambitious outcome in the Doha Round, to come to the party and to increase their proposals and their offers to do more, particularly as far as agricultural market access is concerned.</para>
<para>It is important to note that the statements from CHOGM and the statements from APEC cannot be taken lightly. I am sure the rest of the world will take notice of what these two major groupings have had to say. Together, those two groups represent 4.4 billion people out of the world’s population—more than two-thirds of the world’s population—well over half of the world’s total trade and about 65 per cent of global GDP. Those countries are calling on countries like those in the European Union and like Japan, Korea, Switzerland and Norway to increase their offers in terms of market access for, particularly, the agricultural producers from the developing countries of the world.</para>
<para>Negotiations will continue in Hong Kong next month, where Australia and our allies, including the Cairns Group, will keep the pressure on those who are not ambitious enough to finalise the round in 2006. We now consider that this round is closer to fundamental reform in this area than the WTO has ever been before. But it is still balanced on a knife’s edge. It could go either way. It is important that the strength of the voices of those 4.4 billion people are heard in the councils of the WTO, because we believe significant reform in agriculture will deliver the biggest dividend for the developing world. Without new trade flows in agriculture, we will lose the opportunity to lift millions of people out of poverty, not to mention the benefits that will accrue to Australia’s farmers and manufacturing industries.</para>
<para>I am pleased that the Prime Minister has been able to play such a crucial role in developing this and in convincing his colleagues at CHOGM and also in the APEC leaders meeting to make very positive statements and to call on those nations, particularly those member states in the European Union, to be more forthcoming and engaged in seeking a decent outcome that will lift millions of people across the world out of poverty as a result of trade liberalisation.</para>

<para>—Can I clarify a couple of points made by the Leader of the Opposition. First, our workplace reforms are not extreme; they are fair and reasonable. Second, he referred to proposed amendments as ‘token’. The government is still working through those and having discussions with those that have expressed concerns, in terms of addressing some of these issues. Third, it is not true to say that all workers will not be paid penalty rates on public holidays. Workers, even today, that are under certified agreements or awards have that structured in that area. Workers today who have negotiated AWAs have already made their own arrangements in the rates of pay they will have. So to make the allegation that people will be forced to work for peanuts is just ludicrous. Certainly it falls into the same category as many of the other ludicrous allegations that the Labor Party have made in this whole debate.</para>

Like me, I am sure that he will believe that a company like James Hardie, which is responsible for manufacturing a dangerous product and which has a liability to users of that product, should observe its liabilities to victims and their families. The attempt to restructure assets to put them away from the reach of potential claimants ought to be thoroughly condemned.

The Commonwealth has not been a party to those negotiations, but there has been a suggestion that as part of the settlement directors of James Hardie will be given civil immunity by the New South Wales government. The Commonwealth will not support any civil immunity for directors of James Hardie given by the New South Wales government or otherwise.</para>
<para>I call on the federal Labor Party to endorse the Commonwealth government’s position. The Commonwealth government has set aside $7½ million to fund an investigation and litigation of issues arising from the Jackson report. If an immunity is given to the directors of James Hardie, that will frustrate that investigation. As the Deputy Chairman of ASIC said to a Senate estimates committee in the week of 30 May, extinguishing civil penalty for James Hardie directors ‘may have the effect of neutralising the entire investigation and the outcome’. So we call on the New South Wales government not to give any immunity whatsoever to the directors of James Hardie and we indicate to the New South Wales government that the Commonwealth will not be assisting.</para>
<para>In addition to that, I would make clear that James Hardie, as responsible to the victims of asbestosis, will be required to comply with Australian tax law. If it makes a payment that is tax deductible, that will be deductible under Australian tax law. If it makes a payment that is depreciable, that will be depreciable under Australian tax law. If it wants to take advantage of black hole expenditures, it can take advantage of black hole expenditures. James Hardie can structure its payments to take advantage of the tax law.</para>
<para>The suggestion however that this parliament should pass a new tax law so that the taxpayer picks up some of the obligations of the directors and the shareholders of James Hardie will not be agreed to by the Commonwealth parliament. Passing a special law so that shareholders’ obligations are picked up by the Australian taxpayer is the equivalent of asking that the taxpayer pay a sum—which would be a much more honest way of doing it—to pick up the obligation of James Hardie’s shareholders. It is not the taxpayers’ obligation to pick up the obligation of the James Hardie shareholders or their directors. The James Hardie directors ought to accept responsibility for the victims, for the poor people who have been injured by their product, and the shareholders ought to be bearing the cost of that rather than putting it off onto the Australian taxpayer.</para>

<para>—In this place, there is a robust exchange from both sides. It is a life that is very difficult for a Speaker and I thoroughly understand that. Nevertheless, Speakers have certain obligations and the obligation that is on the Speaker is to be even-handed as well as to uphold order in this place. Disorder can come from both sides of the House. One of the reasons why there are standing orders against disorder from either side of the House is that, obviously, when it occurs by somebody speaking when they do not have the call, the person who has the call is likely to respond in a way that is not in keeping with standing orders.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The simple fact of the matter is that Mr Smith rose to ask his question here and was subject to constant heckling. That is neither here nor there. We do not claim any particular privileges in this place. We are not worried about a bit of heckling, but we are quite prepared, when we get it, to respond. What Mr Smith was doing was responding repeatedly to questions or epithets that were being thrown at him; that is all. He would have asked his question straight up, without any interruption, preamble or side matters to it, had he not been being constantly questioned by the other side of the House.</para>
<para>The government have come to believe themselves to be terribly privileged. After 10 long years in office, they think they have a right to rule. They think they have a right to stand up and do anything they like in this chamber. The government have decided that, as far as they are concerned, the rules in this place do not matter, because the rules can be twisted in their favour. As far as they are concerned, the public does not matter, because the public elected them. As far as they are concerned, only they know how this country should be governed and only they know what is right for ordinary Australian workers. Only they could have an operation in which they put in place something that is based on no form of public endorsement and mandate. What they are entitled to do, as far as they are concerned, is anything they like—anything goes—and when we stand up in this place and question them that attitude remains.</para>
<para>I am not unfamiliar with governments that last in office for a very lengthy period. I recollect ourselves in office and I recollect too that anybody—it is an aspect of normal human frailty—after eight or nine years on the job, begins to get into a shorthand way of thinking: you get to think that this is a permanent occupation. You begin to forget that you have certain democratic obligations to conform to that will impose on you—or at least suggest to you—certain types of behaviour. But there is one person in the chamber, and that is the Speaker, who is supposed to recognise and have a feel for these sorts of moves in parliament and in politics and to attempt to keep a level of impartiality in proceedings, so that, when he sees a person with the call from him, he has an absolute obligation to protect, in the first instance, the person with the call. In the second instance, of course, he protects the good order of the chamber, but in the first instance he protects the person with the call.</para>
<para>If the person with the call, unprovoked, then abuses their right, it is not an unreasonable thing for the Speaker to sit them down, but the first question that the Speaker ought to ask, before he pursues that course, is: was he being provoked in a disorderly fashion? And, if he was being provoked in a disorderly fashion, the first obligation of the Speaker is to deal with the disorder. If the member persists after the disorder is dealt with, by all means sit him down. But there was not a word uttered about what was going on on the other side of the House, and the member for Perth was responding repeatedly to the interjections that were directed at him.</para>
<para>According to <inline font-style="italic">House of Representatives Practice</inline>:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">One of the hallmarks of good Speakership is the requirement for a high degree of impartiality in the execution of the duties of office. This important characteristic of office has been developed over the last two centuries to a point where in the House of Commons the Speaker abandons all party loyalties and is required to be impartial on all party issues both inside and outside the House. In concert with this requirement the principle has been established that the Speaker continues in office until ceasing to be a Member of the House. According to <inline font-style="italic">May</inline>:</para>
<para class="block">Confidence in the impartiality of the Speaker is an indispensable condition of the successful working of procedure, and many conventions exist which have as their object not only to ensure the impartiality of the Speaker but also to ensure that his impartiality is generally recognised. He takes no part in debate either in the House or in committee. He votes only when the voices are equal, and then only in accordance with rules which preclude an expression of opinion upon the merits of a question.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Then there are a couple more paragraphs:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Speaker must show impartiality in the Chamber above all else. A Speaker should give a completely objective interpretation of standing orders and precedents, and should—</para>

<para class="block">In the case of the member for Perth, that meant an opportunity to ask a question without being heckled. That is what that sentence means.

<para>—It was premature because there was a matter of disorder on the other side of the House that had not been dealt with. The member for Perth was sat down as a result of responding to the disorder on the other side of the House, a disorder from which he was entitled to protection. <inline font-style="italic">House of Representatives Practice</inline> goes on:</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<quote>
<para class="block">As a rule Speakers make themselves freely available outside the Chamber to give advice or discuss matters with Members. Members are entitled to expect that, even though politically affiliated, the Speaker will carry out his or her functions impartially. Likewise a Speaker is entitled to expect support from all Members regardless of their party.</para>
<para>The Speaker embodies the dignity of the nation’s representative assembly. The office is above the individual and commands respect. The degree of respect depends to some extent on the occupant but it is fair to say that the office, despite isolated incidents, has been shown to be respected on both sides of the House.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Indeed it has. Mr Speaker, in my anger I got up after you had sat the member for Perth down and I reflected upon you personally as Speaker. I was not entitled to do that. You ordered me at that point in time to withdraw what I had said and I did. I withdrew what I had said, because I deeply believe in the values of this chamber and I deeply believe in what this House does. It is a sounding board, if you like, for the nation. All the opinions that are out there in the community can be expressed in this place. It would not be right for me as an office holder in this parliament to challenge so fundamentally the standards of this place by continuing to reflect on you to the point where you had to take further action and were further called into question as a result of having to take that action—at least in the minds of some. So I withdrew and then moved this motion, which is the proper way to proceed when there has been an action taken by the Speaker which has not, in the view of some members of the House, upheld the traditions of the House for fairness.</para>
<para>Your reputation here—and I say it with all friendship and as much kindliness as I can muster—is under challenge as a result of the events of the last few weeks. We witnessed in the last two-week sitting of parliament the ejection of 23 members of the Labor caucus; more than a third of the Labor caucus was ejected during the course of the last week of sittings. We saw one government member, despite the baying and hollering of the other side, ejected along with those 23.</para>
<para>The simple fact of the matter is that in this particular instance fairness was not performed. In this instance, the member for Perth was ordered to sit down while trying to defend himself against attacks from the other side of the House—verbal attacks obviously. He was entitled to protection from the one official here who has the capacity to deliver it. That does not happen to be the Leader of the Opposition; it happens to be the Speaker of the House. That is why this resolution should be carried. In order to uphold the dignity of this chamber and in order to uphold the rights of individual members there is an obligation now on this House to dissent from your ruling and allow, therefore, the member for Perth to ask his question.</para>
<para>There is another reason why this should happen. This is the point in time—after this government has been in office for too long; for 10 long years—when the capacity of the House to hold the government to account is most important. This is when governments slide, sometimes intentionally, sometimes unintentionally, into corruption. This is when governments slide, sometimes deliberately, sometimes without deliberation, into arrogance. This government is. It has total control, but this government is out of control. It is a government that is arrogance incorporated. It simply has to be held to account, and only the people’s house can do that. We will not let the people’s chamber be taken away from the people by an inability to be able to get up here and ask questions. We are not to be put off in an unprotected way as we attempt to do that.</para>
<para>We do not want to see people’s rights taken away from them, whether they be rights in this chamber or rights in the workplace. Just as we are not going to let this government Americanise our industrial relations system, we are not going to see this chamber collapse from a lack of democracy and a lack of respect for what ordinary members are entitled to receive in terms of just treatment. We do not want the Americanisation of workplaces, health care or universities and we do not want to see parliamentary capacities—to uphold the people’s will in having a government held to account—torn down.</para>
<para>This parliament is the last bastion of hope for an Australian people now under total control. You have a role in this, Mr Speaker, and we expect it to be discharged with honour and impartiality. Your role now, Mr Speaker, is most critical, because we have a government that does not believe it can be beaten. In its heart of hearts it assumes it will win no matter what. It believes that it can conduct internecine warfare amongst its leaders because it is unbeatable, and it believes it can focus its backbench and its frontbench on whether or not they will hold their jobs or whether or not they will come in and find themselves on the front bench. Of course, for the next couple of years, it can do all that with impunity.</para>
<para>They believe they can indulge their ideological fantasies—ideological fantasies that bear no relationship to the real lives of ordinary Australians—because they can do it with impunity. There is only one place where we can say to the government, ‘Listen, there are a few people out there who are not part of your triumph. There are a few people out there who believe you are going the wrong way.’ There is only one show in this chamber that can do that, and that is the opposition, because all the rest in this parliament, I am afraid to say, are holding competitions on heel clicking and bowing as they await their opportunities to serve the government on the front bench—not serve the people; serve the government on the front bench. That is simply not good enough.</para>
<para>The Prime Minister has said to me that he will not debate me. He has said that he will not debate me in public on industrial relations in the way that these things are normally debated. I would not have asked the Prime Minister to debate me on these matters in public if he had done the decent thing during the last election campaign and told the Australian people what he was up to—if he had told the Australian people that he intended to remove their penalty rates; if he had told the Australian people that he intended to remove their holidays; if he had told the Australian people that he intended to knock off the fair umpire; and if he had told the Australian people that he was going to criminalise most union activity in this country. If the Prime Minister had said all those things in the last election campaign, you would not have seen us asking questions here in question time; you would have seen us, although of course regretful and the rest of it, having to accept some degree of legitimacy for what the Prime Minister had done.</para>
<para>We accept no legitimacy in what the Prime Minister has done—none whatsoever!—which is why we in the opposition say that when we get the chance to deal with this at the next election campaign we are going to rip this legislation up and cast it out. It has no place in the great Australian social compact of a fair day’s work for a fair day’s pay with a fair umpire presiding over it when the two sides cannot work out what fairness means.</para>
<para>For 100 years Australia has had that, and this government have decided, at the start of this century—almost a century to the day since that system was created—to rip it away. In this chamber, they want nothing but claquers. I plead with you, Mr Speaker, not to be one of them; you do not have to be. We will always uphold your capacity to exercise your role independently in this place, as we have done, I might say, with your predecessors. We did our level best on a number of occasions.</para>
<para>But it means that in this place both sides need protection. We heckle; we operate from time to time in a disorderly fashion. When you are as massively provoked as we have been in recent times, you can understand why that would be so, but, at the end of the day, when you order somebody from this chamber, they do not hook their feet under the table and refuse to go so you have to get the Serjeant-at-Arms to drag them out. They do not do that, because they have respect at the end of the day for the rulings that you give, including on their behaviour, but by golly when we stand up here we expect protection. If they are going to get protection from us, we expect it from them at the times that it is entirely appropriate for us to get up to ask questions, which, by His Grace the Prime Minister, is all that we are allowed to do as far as a debate is concerned in this place—his having shut down the debate before it had properly concluded. In order to protect the rights of members of parliament, in order to ensure that we can do what we must do to hold this government accountable, we move dissent from your ruling. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Mr Speaker, I second the dissent motion from your ruling, the effect of which was to ensure that during question time I was unable to ask a question of the executive. It is important to put in context the dissent motion from your ruling, which deprived me of the opportunity to ask my question.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The context was as follows: firstly, in the course of question time, endeavours by the Leader of the Opposition to put the Acting Prime Minister, the Leader of the National Party, under scrutiny so far as the government’s extreme industrial relations legislation was concerned; secondly, the answer by the Treasurer where he sought to pretend that somehow he and the government had taken any interest in the asbestosis and mesothelioma victims of James Hardie; and, thirdly, the way in which, in the course of and since the introduction of the government’s extreme industrial relations legislation, we on this side believe that we have been unfairly dealt with and that our opportunity for scrutiny has been unfairly treated, including in the way in which general rulings have seen 23 people on this side of the chamber removed and one from the other side.</para>
<para>That is the context of, firstly, us trying to put the government under scrutiny on its extreme industrial relations legislation; secondly, the government trying to pretend that it has had one thought or lifted one finger for the asbestosis and mesothelioma victims of James Hardie; and, thirdly, Mr Speaker, your conduct in the course of our attempt to hold the government to scrutiny.

</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Let us put that in context. On Sunday 9 October, when the government gave an exclusive briefing to employers, employer associations and employer representative groups—we had the Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations there, and we may well have had the Treasurer there—there was not one person in that room who had lifted a finger to come to the aid or assistance of the asbestosis and mesothelioma victims of James Hardie. The Treasurer stood up at question time and feigned concern for those victims, when neither the government nor any organised institution in Australian society, other than the organised trade union movement, have lifted a finger for those victims. The only institution in Australian society that has lifted a finger for the asbestosis and mesothelioma victims of James Hardie is the organised trade union movement through the ACTU.</para>
<para>The government’s extreme industrial relations legislation has as one of its central features a public policy view from those opposite that there is no role in the modern social and economic affairs of Australian society for the organised trade union movement. That is one of the features of the legislation that we are seeking to subject to scrutiny. You need not more than one example other than to say it was only the organised trade union movement that came to the rescue of the asbestosis and mesothelioma victims of James Hardie to justify the ongoing role in the modern social and economic affairs of Australian society for the trade union movement.</para>
<para>Mr Speaker, you then called me to ask my question. I was subject to interjections from the Treasurer and from the Minister for Human Services, Mr Hockey. In response to the interjection from Mr Hockey, I made a generalised reference. I might add that at that point I could not quite hear all of the interjections. I heard the Treasurer’s interjection, and my response to the Treasurer was words to this effect: ‘Pete, you are sitting there waiting for it to drop in your lap’—a reference to the ongoing leadership tensions between him and the Prime Minister. The Prince Charles of Australian politics is waiting for the Prime Minister to drop it in his lap. The Prince Charles of Australian politics is just sitting there, waiting, hoping and dreaming. You never quite know with the Treasurer, because in his heart of hearts we know the Treasurer is a bully. You never quite know whether the Treasurer is leading with his glass jaw or his smirk.</para>
<para>Having been subject to those interjections, Mr Speaker, you then called me to take my seat. I thought, not unexpectedly, that you were then proposing to restore some semblance of order to the House and give me the opportunity of putting the government, the executive, to scrutiny during question time. Why might I think that? Because, if you go to the <inline font-style="italic">House of Representatives Practice</inline>, on page 527 in chapter 15 we find ‘Question Time’. That may be a novel concept to some but it is not a novel concept to the <inline font-style="italic">House of Representatives Practice</inline>. On page 527 we find the following:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The accountability of the Government is demonstrated most clearly and publicly at Question Time when, for a period (currently usually over an hour) on most sitting days, questions without notice are put to Ministers. The importance of Question Time is demonstrated by the fact that at no other time in a normal sitting day is the House so well attended. Question Time is usually an occasion of special interest not only to Members themselves but to the news media, the radio and television broadcast audience and visitors to the public galleries. It is also a time when the intensity of partisan politics can be clearly manifested.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I think most honourable members would agree with that. But if you then go on to ‘Rules Governing Questions’ on page 532 it says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Questions without notice by their very nature may raise significant difficulties for the Chair. The necessity to make instant decisions on the application of the many rules on the form and content of questions is one of the Speaker’s most demanding tasks. Because of the importance of Question Time in political terms, and because of the need to ensure that this critical function of the House is preserved in a vital form, Speakers tend to be somewhat lenient in applying the standing orders, with the result that, for example, breaches of only minor procedural importance have not prevented questions on issues of special public interest.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Mr Speaker, I would have thought that that was front and centre of the issues that we were seeking to raise during question time—front and centre of the opposition, the Labor Party, holding the government to account on its extreme industrial relations legislation.</para>
<para>I said that there were two contexts for this—the Treasurer’s answer in respect of James Hardie and the Labor opposition seeking to hold the Deputy Prime Minister to account during question time. The first question that my colleague the Leader of the Opposition asked the Acting Prime Minister was:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Isn’t it the case that, under the token changes the government is proposing to its extreme industrial relations legislation, an employee can be sacked on Christmas Eve unfairly and without reason or remedy? Isn’t it also the case that, if that same employee is not sacked on Christmas Eve, he or she can work on Christmas Day without a penalty rate and without fair or adequate pay?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Acting Prime Minister made no response to that, other than to say that they were considering suggestions. So the thrust of that question, in the context of a glaring front page in one of our national newspapers today, was that the government was going to not allow employees to be sacked on public holidays like Christmas Day. It is not a surprise that the opposition might ask a question about that, given the fallacious and stupid nature of such a proposal. As if such a fallacious and stupid proposal could somehow protect two things: firstly, the unfair dismissal rights of Australian workers and employees; and, secondly, the current penalty rates, overtime, shift allowances, living standards and conditions entitlements which are secured by the so-called no disadvantage test—which this government seeks to abolish.</para>
<para>The second question that the Leader of the Opposition asked the Acting Prime Minister after a digression onto another important matter—which is not the subject of partisan dispute; but this one is—was:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... isn’t it the case that, under the token changes the government is proposing to its extreme industrial relations legislation, an employer will not be required to compensate employees adequately or fairly for working on Christmas Day? If some Australians have to work on Christmas Day, why should they work for Christmas peanuts?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Acting Prime Minister did not respond to that either. Why wouldn’t, or couldn’t, he respond to that? He would not or could not respond to that because what secures a fair, adequate or just compensation for someone who chooses to work on Christmas Day are the 20 allowable matters, including penalty rates, overtime, shift allowances, leave loadings, special payment rates for public holidays and the no disadvantage test—both of which the government is proposing to abolish! So it is no wonder we wanted it to be the subject of scrutiny.</para>
<para>What a surprise, Mr Speaker, that my question to the Acting Prime Minister might have been on the same subject matter. And you unfairly sought to deprive me of that opportunity. That is why there is dissent to your ruling. In the context of you unfairly depriving me, because of your ruling, from being able to subject the Acting Prime Minister to scrutiny, it is no wonder we might want to take into account the last two weeks of opportunity to put the government under scrutiny.</para>
<para>I was interested in that context to see in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on Saturday, 12 November—which, from memory, was the first weekend after the last sitting fortnight—Mr Seccombe, a well-known observer of affairs in this place, making a point. I will not read the entire article—I am sure, Mr Speaker, that it has been drawn to your attention. In the course of that commentary Mr Seccombe said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">During the pandemonium that followed, a Labor MP Warren Snowdon, got booted out for angrily shouting something about dogs and rodents. But the Speaker took no action against either minister for defying him. Downer’s interjection came at the end of a long, evasive answer from the Trade Minister, Mark Vaile, about $300 million in secret kickbacks paid by the wheat exporter AWB to Saddam Hussein. Vaile and Downer have answered every revelation about this scandal with the standard Government defence that they had been kept in the dark about the whole thing.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The preceding commentary in that went to consistent and constant abuse by two government ministers during question time and you failing to bring them to account.</para>

<para>The House needs to dissent from your ruling, Mr Speaker. Unless the House dissents from your ruling, this House is not able to hold the government to account as the government seeks to ram through the parliament its extreme industrial relations changes, changes that we heard nothing about in the last election campaign. Now the Prime Minister asserts in this House and in the community that, unless these changes are adopted forthwith, our economy will crumble. We heard nothing about these proposals until the government got the arrogance that comes with total control of the parliament.</para>
<para>What we see in this House being reflected now in question time is that total control: a government drunk with power, too close to the sun, believing that they can think, do and say anything that they like, acting not for the great Australian nation or its people but for themselves—acting for themselves in their blind ideology and arrogance. Mr Speaker, your ruling needs to be dissented from because you have become infected with that arrogance.</para>

<para>—The Leader of the Opposition is such a tactical genius, isn’t he? He is such a great parliamentarian, such a tactical genius! Today was the big day when the Leader of the Opposition was going to come into the parliament and expose what he thinks are the weaknesses in the industrial relations legislation of this government. What does he do instead? He wastes an entire question time moving a completely frivolous dissent motion on a perfectly proper ruling by you, Mr Speaker.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In this totally self-indulgent motion to defend the shadow spokesman, who simply cannot control himself, the Leader of the Opposition has frittered away an opportunity to make some points about the workplace relations legislation. The shadow spokesman simply cannot control himself, Mr Speaker: he defied your instructions not once, but twice, at the dispatch box. You perfectly properly sat him down. Now the Leader of the Opposition has entirely wasted an afternoon that was supposed to be devoted to attacking the government’s workplace relations legislation.</para>
<para>The scowls on the faces of members opposite! In particular, the scowl on the face of the member for Lalor demonstrated what she thought of the Leader of the Opposition’s bodgie tactics today. And, if that was not enough, if the looks of dismay on the faces of the people who do understand something about parliamentary tactics did not say it all, what proved the complete political bankruptcy of the Leader of the Opposition’s tactics today was the fact that the member for Perth, having caused all of this, by his self-indulgence and inability to control himself, then felt that it was necessary to read subsequent questions onto the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> in the course of his speech on this dissent motion. This is an act of complete political folly by the Leader of the Opposition. He claims to believe in the primacy of this parliament, but he completely fails to use this parliament for its fundamental purpose.</para>
<para>Let us get to the actual point that the member for Perth has transgressed against. Not once, but twice, the member for Perth was asked to come to his question. Not once, but twice, the member for Perth refused to do so. The member for Perth came to the dispatch box. He did not ask his question. He instead engaged in a lengthy criticism of the Treasurer’s answer to a previous question. That is what he did. He did not come to the dispatch box to ask a question; he came to the dispatch box to make a statement—a statement designed, no doubt, to demonstrate his credentials with his paymasters but certainly not a statement that he was entitled to make in that context.</para>
<para>The member for Perth did not ask a question. He was called by you, Mr Speaker, to ask his question, but he did not do so. He continued to engage in partisan heckling—as he admitted himself in the contribution that he just made. Having failed to ask his question and having been asked the first time to return to the question, he did not do it. Asked a second time to return to the question, he continued to engage in partisan heckling and he was quite rightly sat down by you, Mr Speaker. He had not one warning but two warnings. In a cavalier fashion, he completely ignored both of them. He was rightly sat down.</para>
<para>Mr Speaker, I put it to you and to all fair-minded members of this House that since 1990, in the years that I have been part of or observing this House, there is not a Speaker who has sat in that chair who would not have sat down the member for Perth at that time. Not former Speaker Martin: he would not have put up with this by a questioner. Former Speaker McLeay would not have put up with this from a questioner. Deputy Speaker Jenkins, should he have been in the chair, would not have put up with the kind of behaviour that we saw from the member for Perth today. Not a single Speaker that this parliament has seen since 1990 would have put up with this behaviour by the member for Perth. Let me make it very clear. Standing order 91 says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">A Member’s conduct shall be considered disorderly if the Member has ...</para>
<para class="block">(e) persistently and wilfully disregarded the authority of the Speaker ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is precisely what this member did: he persistently and wilfully disregarded the authority of the Speaker, and he was rightly sat down by the Speaker, in total accordance with the standing orders of this place. The best the Leader of the Opposition could come up with was that in some way the member for Perth was responding to interjections. As all long-serving members of this House would know, it is in fact disorderly to respond to interjections, and it is doubly disorderly to respond to interjections when instructed not once but twice by the Speaker to return to the subject matter at hand, which was a question.</para>
<para>Mr Speaker, your high duty is to maintain the standing orders of this place. As I have just demonstrated, the member for Perth flagrantly disregarded standing order 91(e). Mr Speaker you did not just have the option to sit down the member for Perth; you had the duty to sit down the member for Perth. You are to be commended for doing your duty and for doing it so well in this place. We have to ask ourselves why we are having this debate. We are having this debate because the Leader of the Opposition seems to have decided that it is now time to become the muscle-up merchant of this parliament.</para>

<para>—Mr Speaker, I am very happy to defend your ruling, because there is not a Speaker whom I have seen in this parliament over the last 15 years who would have tolerated the kind of behaviour that the member for Perth has demonstrated this afternoon. Mr Speaker, you have acted in full concert with the traditions of this House. You have acted in accordance with the high standards that this House should expect. You have tried to ensure that this House today debated important questions that are rightly of concern to the Australian public. Instead, from members opposite we have had a persistence in wilful disobedience to your instructions and a series of scurrilous personal attacks when members opposite should have been getting on with asking questions in this House.</para>

<para>The truth is: what more can we expect from members opposite? As I said, we have no better authority than Mark Latham, who said of Mr Beazley, ‘I’ve listened to hundreds of his speeches now and not once have I heard anything interesting.’ ‘The big difference between him and Keating and Whitlam’ is that Beazley is a ‘boredom machine’; ‘he’s always dumbing down the debate’. They are not my words; they are the words of the person that members opposite wanted to make Prime Minister just 12 months ago. They are the words of the person that the member for Lalor says is speaking the truth. We have just heard 35 minutes of assertions from members opposite about the need to uphold the standards of this House, and now we have the kind of incessant caterwauling that makes debate in this House absolutely impossible. This is a politically and morally bankrupt opposition led by a leader who has lost the faith of thinking people inside the Labor movement. Mr Speaker, your ruling was perfectly correct, and it will be upheld by this House. I move:</para>

<para>—On 16 November this year during an interview on Canberra Radio 2CC, the ACT Chief Minister, Jon Stanhope, launched a very personal attack on me regarding the new Defence operational headquarters to be built between Queanbeyan and Bungendore. As part of that attack, he claimed I deliberately issued a press release about his prison on the very day that financial advisors to the Australian government announced they were not continuing in that role, and he said I refused to defend the headquarters project.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Mr Speaker, I did media interviews with ABC TV, WIN TV and ABC Radio on the Defence headquarters. Also, my press release was not issued on the same day as that announcement, but it was released the day after Mr Stanhope’s development application for his jail was finally lodged. It was lodged in secret, so I had a responsibility to let my constituents know so that they could object, as Mr Stanhope had not consulted with those residents of Jerrabomberra and Letchworth who will be most affected by his jail.</para>

That was question No. 2343. I am surprised that more than two months have elapsed and I have not got a response from the Prime Minister. I would be grateful if you would facilitate an early reply.

<para>—This is a very important private member’s bill for the small business community. I found it necessary to move this bill because the government refuses to give a break to small business unless the parliament extends a similar break to the big end of town. On 15 October 2001, the Prime Minister announced a review of the competition provisions of the Trade Practices Act. He subsequently commissioned Justice Daryl Dawson to hold an inquiry into the efficacy of those provisions.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Many years on, small business are still not enjoying one of the very important recommendations of that inquiry—that is, the recommendation to give a new, streamlined approach to small businesses for the way they secure authorisation to bargain collectively. As you know only too well, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, just like the employer-employee relationship, the bargaining relationship between big businesses and the small businesses with which they do business is not even close to equal. For some years, small businesses have had the opportunity to secure authorisation for what is, I suppose, a per se anticompetitive practice. That is the practice of bargaining collectively. In other words, small businesses purchasing from or selling to a larger business can band together to secure a better deal and to try to even up the bargaining relationship. An example might be producers of agricultural products selling apples to Coles or Woolworths. Apple producers can get together to bargain collectively to secure a better price for their product, rather than simply be subject to the market power of the Coles or Woolworths of this world, the businesses to which they are proposing the sale.</para>
<para>Justice Dawson recommended that, rather than go through an expensive, time-consuming and cumbersome authorisation process under the Trade Practices Act, small businesses should simply be able to notify the ACCC of this practice and get on with their lives. This is a proposition supported by all parties in this parliament—Liberal, Labor, National Party, Independent, Family First; you name it. This is a proposal that enjoys support across all of the parties. The problem is that small business still does not have this new, streamlined collective bargaining arrangement. Why hasn’t it got that arrangement? Because the government is insisting on linking its proposals to water down the Trade Practices Act—which put consumers and small business at risk—with the proposal to streamline the collective bargaining processes. That means that small business, which has been waiting since 2001 for this opportunity, still waits, simply because the government is insisting on linking the two issues.</para>
<para>Senator Joyce and Senator Fielding did a very good thing a few weeks ago in the Senate. They said they would not stand by and allow the watering down of the merger laws to proceed. They joined Labor and the other minor parties to reject the watering down of Australia’s merger laws. Subsequently, because the government has sought to link the two issues, the collective bargaining arrangements also failed in the Senate. The Treasurer has decided it is all too hard and he has shelved the bill, which means that small business is still waiting for the collective bargaining arrangements and will be waiting for them for the foreseeable future.</para>
<para>Today I am giving the parliament an opportunity to decouple the two issues. My bill takes the collective bargaining provisions for small business alone and presents them as a single bill. I have made the point that this is an issue that has multiparty support in this parliament. I am calling upon the government to grant precedence to my private member’s bill to allow a proper and protracted debate on the bill in this place and to subsequently allow this bill to pass the House of Representatives and consequently pass the Australian Senate so that, after almost five years of waiting, small businesses in this country will have the opportunity to access a new, streamlined collective bargaining arrangement, rather than be held to ransom by the government’s insistence on watering down the merger laws under the Trade Practices Act at the same time.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Hunter for bringing this matter before the House. The <inline ref="R2434">Trade Practices Amendment (Collective Bargaining for Small Business) Bill 2005</inline> is a very important bill. As you have heard, this has support from all parties in this place. It has long been held—and I think it is fairly so—that small business is the backbone of this country. We on all sides of the parliament are pretty united on the fact that we need to have one position when it comes to granting small business the ability to collectively bargain.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>People in my electorate of Werriwa who have approached me directly, including those involved in the transport industry, believe it is a necessity for them as small business operators to sit together and negotiate with the larger companies they contract to. That is not all that dissimilar to what occurs, as we have just heard, with respect to agriculture and other areas within the economy.</para>
<para>Small businesses are certainly at the forefront of the drivers of the Australian economy, but in my electorate and in many of the electorates represented in this House they are also the generators of employment. The fact that small businesses can collectively bargain in their arrangements and have a streamlined effect in their dealings with the larger corporations paves the way for them to have some security of outcome and gives them some certainty in their arrangements when employing people for the future. Therefore, this is a significant bill, one which sees enshrined in legislation the ability of small businesses to collectively bargain and one which gives them a very genuine right to engage in a practice which most people would regard as commonplace.</para>
<para>I do not think anybody in this House would think it was fair for a small business person without collective arrangements to simply have to negotiate their way clear on economic matters direct with either national or multinational companies. This is particularly so for those in country and regional areas who need to secure products through arrangements with transporters and with central markets. To secure the livelihood of country and regional Australia, this would be regarded as not only common practice but fair practice within those regional economies, and I doubt whether any member opposite would say anything different.</para>
<para>It gets back to the point that I made about the people in my electorate who have approached me, especially the small transport operators, about their dealings with larger companies, whether they be TNT, Toll, Patrick or others. When they are dealing with their principal employer, if you like, in this instance, or the principal body which is going to engage their business—whether the business is providing labour and transport or whatever—they would like to know that they are not going to be dealing one out and then be left solely to their own devices, when they are seeking to secure not only their own position but the positions of their families, the people who work for them and, to some extent, in many instances in various electorates, the viability of small business as it operates in those areas. It is appropriate that this matter be dealt with now. It has been sitting around for some time. It has bipartisan support in this regard and it is a tragedy that—</para>

<para>—The issue of renewable non-polluting fuels has been well debated in this place. However, the accent has been upon the environmental aspects, with little regard for the associated economic cost. For example, wind power is much more expensive than, say, coal fired electricity. Further, as reported in numerous recent media reports, it is placing undue stress on electrical transmission systems. A New Zealand study recently reported 100-megawatt fluctuations over a five-minute period in 150 megawatts of generating wind capacity. To accommodate such downward swings, base load generators must have stand-by power available, thus creating emissions that counteract the so-called gains from the wind generators. In fact, it could be stated that wind power is most productive when the lights are out and factories closed, and solar energy is not available when the lights go on. Put simply, without an interface such electricity generation is not compatible with the electricity grid demand system. They would therefore service our community better were they generating a fuel for our transport system.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I note that a further motion this day suggests a regulatory approach to the escalating price of petrol and diesel. If we changed to a fuel produced locally, we could fix the price forever, as it would no longer rely on a volatile overseas market. It is my intention today to identify how Australia can have its environmental cake and eat it, through an efficient, low-cost fuel alternative called hydrogen.</para>
<para>I recently visited General Motors in Detroit to be briefed upon their hydrogen fuel cell passenger car program. I also visited London Buses to be briefed on their operating fuel cell buses, three of which are also operating in Perth as I speak. General Motors advised me that only 12 per cent of the world population owns a car today. This is projected to increase to 16 per cent of the world population, which will also increase from six billion to eight billion by 2020. In the USA alone, to retain a flat petroleum fuel consumption graph would require an improved efficiency of all operating reciprocating motors of 62 per cent. So much for the hybrid concept or the role of regulating the price of petroleum products. The hydrogen fuel cell delivers 60 per cent fuel efficiency compared to sub 30 per cent for these other vehicles.</para>
<para>Transport consumes 50 per cent of all the energy consumed in Australia. Australia has the renewable resources, including wind and solar, to produce sufficient hydrogen from the electrolysis of water, which would achieve both the environmental benefits and the cost control so essential to our nation’s future. However, the largest and most predictable of our renewable resources is the tides of the Kimberleys—which I will rely upon the member for Kalgoorlie, whose electorate contains this wonderful resource, to describe to the House in detail.</para>
<para>However, the concept of farmers producing their own fuel on property using photovoltaic cells and wind generators to electrolyse the ground water that presently pollutes their land is in my mind feasible and much better than utilising half their land to grow an oil seed crop for next year’s cropping program. CSIRO the other day released a book in which they refer to a small electrolysis unit, now available although not in mass production, which you could put in your garage. You could electrolyse enough water per day with solar panels to drive a car with a fuel cell for 150 kilometres.</para>
<para>The purpose of this resolution is to call on the government to rapidly advance our nation’s preparedness to lead, not follow, by encouraging our manufacturers, scientists and financial institutions to be hydrogen ready for cars and other vehicles which could be in mass production within five to 10 years, as fuel demand alone will ensure. The car industry is well advanced in the development of fuel cell vehicles. Most major manufacturers have operating concept cars. Development, improved durability and fuel distribution are all challenges, but it was hydrogen that delivered men to the moon. Australia should be proactive in overcoming these challenges. It should be planning to meet niche markets, such as specialist taxis and light delivery trucks, for our polluted cities. I hope that the motion will be supported by everyone in this House.</para>

<para>—It is a regret that a motion like this only gets 20 minutes of the time of the parliament. In saying that, it is not a reflection on the selection committee, who have a hard job. But I think the issues that arise out of this motion moved by the honourable member for O’Connor are very important to the future of our nation and to the future of the globe. We confront a very big crisis in the globe as a result of the use of carbon based fuels. Whilst the honourable member for O’Connor and I might disagree on the environmental importance of that fact, I think we do share a willingness to have these issues discussed. I believe that the conclusion of his speech, where he called on the government to take the international lead in a subject like this, is something that both sides of this chamber can agree with.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As a nation, Australia, with the alternative power generation outputs—tidal, wind and solar—that we can see here, is in a unique position. As a country we should be showing leadership in moving towards a hydrogen based economy. In the member for O’Connor’s state, Western Australia, there is a trial of the EcoBus, which is something that is showing the way. It shows that this type of power generation, using hydrogen, can be put into place and engines can be developed that will power buses and be used very successfully. That has been demonstrated by public transport in Perth. The unique feature of that trial is that the hydrogen used in the fuel cell buses in Perth is produced as a by-product from BP’s Kwinana oil refinery. Whilst the member for O’Connor’s motion today talks about other ways of harnessing renewable power to create hydrogen, the important thing is that we need these projects and trials to show that these things are successful.</para>
<para>The science of electrolysis is well known. Based on that principle, the first fuel cell was invented by William Grove in 1839, so this is not new technology. We are saying here that we must get on top of all impediments that exist to putting this into practice and we must put a whole host of energy and resources into dealing with those impediments. For instance, if a hydrogen based fuel cell is to be used to power public and private transport vehicles, think of the distribution network that must be created to replicate what we see with carbon based technologies. At the moment, there are safety factors in the transfer process. You can go to the bus depot, which I think is in the suburb of Morley, to see the care we have to take in the transport and storage of the hydrogen and then the care we have to take with the placing of the hydrogen into the vehicle. But these are matters that, if we have the will, can be overcome.</para>
<para>The Derby tidal scheme has been debated in this place but, as I understand it, that has drifted off. But we must use our natural renewable sources of energy in smart and innovative ways and I think that is what this motion tries to achieve. The suggestion the honourable member for O’Connor made about outlying rural stations—where solar energy could be used to convert groundwater that at the moment is not useable—is a very good example of the way in which this could be done.</para>
<para>I would like to compliment the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources. In May of this year it published a booklet entitled <inline font-style="italic">Australian Hydrogen Activity</inline>, in which it tried to aggregate all the work that is being done. That is why there needs to be leadership by government. If you go through this booklet, you will see a whole host of projects, here and there. In their totality, they will be very important. I was disappointed in looking through the international literature, because it does not seem that Australia has shown leadership in this regard.</para>
<para>So there are two things about this. Australia is potentially rich in the renewable energy sources outlined in this motion: tidal, solar and wind. But the hydrogen economy is going to be perhaps the most important thing that the international community must tackle, and Australia must show leadership. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—It is with great pleasure that I rise to support my colleague the member for O’Connor in this particular motion, and I am encouraged by the comments made by the member for Scullin. I regret also the limited time that we have in which to debate this particular motion, because the issues raised by the member for Scullin are numerous. Of course, first and foremost, I must take umbrage at his pronunciation of Derby—the fine town of Derby in the West Kimberley, which is part of my electorate.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We are very fortunate in Western Australia to be blessed with many, many resources. Outstanding amongst those resources is the capacity of the coastline of the Kimberley region to generate tidal power. It was assessed some years ago by CSIRO as having the capacity to generate an amount of energy equal to all the energy consumed in Australia today—a mind-boggling amount of energy capacity. Approximately 50 per cent of the energy consumed today is consumed in achieving mobility. If we look around our cities, to say nothing of the outstanding and congested cities of the world, and consider the smog contamination of those cities and envisage a fuel of mobility being not carbon based but hydrogen based, with the use of a hydrogen fuel cell—and all of that mobility being achieved with no pollution whatsoever—what a wonderful world that would be.</para>
<para>The tides of the Kimberley have the potential to produce enormous quantities of power—renewable power, absolutely clean power, absolutely predictable rates of power and power that is absolutely suited to the production of green hydrogen. As my colleague on the other side of the House said, the hydrogen being used for the trial of those buses in Perth right now is derived from a carbon source. Imagine that being derived from tidal power, absolutely renewable, with no pollution at any stage of the cycle. Barrages built to harness that tidal power would exist for 100-plus years. They have a very long useable life. The cost of harnessing power with the equipment required is expensive, but the day-to-day operating costs are almost zero. It is a case of the will of corporate Australia, if you like, supported by the government of Australia to advance the funds.</para>

<para>—One of those great sources of funds, as my colleague the member for O’Connor has just mentioned, would be the superannuation funds that are contributed to by the workers of this country—and in many cases, of course, controlled by the unions of this country. It would be a grand day indeed if the union leadership saw a vision of Australia whereby Australian cities, for a start, were pollution free. That money would be put to very good use, for once.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>As my colleague has said, we have the capacity and the technology to harness sources of renewable energy. Tidal energy is an outstanding example of renewable energy. All of the technology required is existing technology. There is nothing new. Therefore the movement to a hydrogen based economy is not a case of if; it is a case of when. The question of when can be most readily answered by those who hold the key to where the motivation lies. Is the motivation to be found in discounting the significance of the ever-increasing price for a commodity called hydrocarbons—a commodity which is ever decreasing as far as availability concerned? Is the debate going to be one that we are driven to and forced into, at a point in time when we have no petroleum product left and we are in a panic, or are we going to have vision? Will we, with good sense, the commitment of finances and the backing of a forward-thinking government, move into hydrogen sooner rather than later? Are we going to really have some foresight and harness tidal power?</para>

<para>—I too rise to speak on this motion on renewable sources of power. I thank the member for O’Connor for placing it on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper.</inline> I am happy it is now being debated in the chamber. Before I refer to hydrogen and its potential use, it is important to respond quickly to the member for Kalgoorlie’s comments on superannuation. Only members of this government could move a motion on hydrogen and spend some of the debate bashing unions. I do not know how they manage to do it. Superannuation—as the member for O’Connor would know, as he represents many workers in his electorate—is a very important social advance in this country. The universal application of superannuation was a result of the efforts of the trade union movement, in collaboration with the Labor Hawke-Keating governments. That is the reality. If we are going to raise the issue of superannuation in the hydrogen debate, we should at least put that on the record and acknowledge who the creators of such a great advance in our society were.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>But I thank the member for O’Connor for putting this matter forward for debate. It is a critical issue. I think it was President Clinton who said that the first car driven by a child born today could be powered by hydrogen—pollution-free.</para>

<para>—I hear the member for O’Connor indicating that President Bush quoted President Clinton some years after. I am happy to say that both presidents have acknowledged that important fact—and let us hope that within such a short time frame it is indeed possible. The question is asked: if we have gasoline, diesel, electric and hybrid cars, why would we want to use hydrogen powered cars? Clearly there are many advantages. Hydrogen stores energy more effectively than batteries. It burns twice as efficiently in a fuel cell as gasoline does in an engine. It does not rely on fossil fuels. It produces a single waste product—water. There are no carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warning, no more smog forming exhaust gases and fewer worries about diminishing oil supplies and rising prices. I know that is a matter for some discussion in the future—in an imminent motion before this chamber. Clearly, there are great advantages if we can find the answers to the obstacles that are in front of us in finding an effective way to use hydrogen.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>However, I must refer to those obstacles, because without referring to them we would not be placing this debate in its proper context. I think it is fair to say that the motion is a positive step. It is asking the government to take a lead. I suppose asking this government to take a lead in research and development is an exercise in wishful thinking, but I take it in good faith that the member for O’Connor and the member for Kalgoorlie—and indeed the member for Scullin—have called upon the government to take an international lead because there are so many obstacles. The first of those obstacles is that, whilst hydrogen power sounds great, a fuel cell vehicle’s driving range is only half that of a conventional car. Hydrogen must be manufactured, stored and transported using other energy sources, whether natural gas or coal or renewable generation strategies such as wind. I understand that the speakers already in this debate have indicated their interest in alternative sources. Indeed, you, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, have indicated that alternative sources of energy are being investigated and utilised by this country. It is for that reason this country should be taking a lead.</para>
<para>Hydrogen creation needs a hydrogen source and an energy source. At the moment most hydrogen is produced from natural gas, which acts as both sources. Unfortunately, because something is lost whenever one form of energy is converted to another, the hydrogen produced has only 50 per cent of the energy value of the original gas. Since the problem we are facing is the depletion of fossil fuels, using gas to create hydrogen does not seem very sensible. So clearly we see major problems with the effective use of hydrogen, but I do believe that if we focus our energies—pardon the pun—we will do a lot better.</para>

<para class="block">The government members contributing to this debate are going to tell us that petrol prices are all the result of world oil prices, that the government’s hands are tied and that there is nothing that can be done. It is true that the major factor impacting on Australia’s petrol prices has been world oil prices. The Labor Party has never denied this. Nor has the Labor Party adopted the easy road on this matter. The easy road would have been to call on the government to cut petrol taxes. This would have resulted in some political points for the opposition, but it would have been fiscally irresponsible. But it is untrue to say that there is nothing that the government can do about petrol prices, just as it would be untrue to say that global oil prices are the only determinant of Australian petrol prices. They are a major factor, but they are not the sole determinant.</para>
<para>Let us examine the evidence that it is time for the ACCC to closely examine petrol pricing in Australia. Firstly, the ACCC itself, through its chairman, Mr Samuel, has said that something funny is going on when it comes to petrol prices. It is not hard to see how he came to this conclusion. Take for example the city in which this parliament meets. The <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> reported on 7 November that Canberrans were paying 10c a litre more than Sydney motorists for their petrol. Given that Sydney’s average prices are, of course, at record highs, this is of understandable concern to residents of the national capital.</para>
<para>I was interested to see what one of the ACT’s senators had to say about this. Senator Humphries said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The relatively opaque nature of petrol prices means that there is an opportunity for parties in the supply chain to make discretionary decisions about how much to charge to exploit motorists.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I cannot but agree with the Liberal Party senator for the ACT. If Senator Humphries truly believes this, I cannot see how he can resist the Labor Party’s call for the ACCC to investigate petrol prices and report every six months.</para>
<para>Another recent example of something funny going on in petrol pricing comes from South Australia. The Royal Automobile Association regularly surveys petrol prices throughout South Australia. In the 12 months to October, the average price difference between Adelaide and Whyalla, for example, was 1.7c a litre. This difference is easily explained by the heavy cost of freighting petrol to a regional centre like Whyalla. However, the average price difference between Adelaide and Whyalla in October was 11.6c a litre. The difference went from 1.7c a litre straight up to 11.6c a litre. This massive differential cannot be explained by freight costs. This sudden increase in the differential would lead any objective observer to conclude, as the ACCC has done, that something funny is going on.</para>
<para>With petrol prices having such a widespread impact on people’s lives and on our economy, there can be no valid reason for the government not to adopt Labor’s plan of action to combat high petrol prices. Just these two examples of wide variations in prices that I have shared with the House today lend themselves to the conclusion that the federal government must ask the ACCC to make a point of exploring every link in the petrol supply chain. If petrol prices are exploitative in country Australia, people in Australia’s cities have the right to question whether the opaque pricing mechanism that Senator Humphries referred to is not also disadvantaging them.</para>
<para>There is more prima facie evidence that would lend itself to the need for an ACCC inquiry. Australia gets a large proportion of its oil from Singapore. Recently, the Singapore price of oil rose to $120 a barrel. In the meantime, the price of crude oil has consistently been $80 a barrel. This distinction again leads one to support the view that there is something funny going on when it comes to petrol prices. The Victorian Automotive Chamber of Commerce believes that refiner margins are 8c to 10c higher than they should be.</para>
<para>What can be done? Labor’s multipoint plan does not present panaceas, it does not present easy answers and it would not bring about a miraculously large reduction in petrol prices overnight. But it does represent real and practical steps that this government could take, if it was of a mind to. The government could adopt Labor’s plan to strengthen the Trade Practices Act to prevent the abuse of market power, to have the ACCC investigate petrol prices and report every six months, to promote competition and protect independent service stations from anticompetitive behaviour and to encourage the development of an ethanol industry by adopting ethanol for the government fleet. I understand the government has already taken some steps to adopt the last point of the Labor Party’s plan. I call on them to adopt Labor’s plan in totality. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I am pleased to speak on this motion. The member for Prospect is a new Labor member in this House. I know that he is still learning the ropes, but this motion is a bit of an own goal. He is trying, of course, to challenge the credibility of the Howard government on petrol prices, but he clearly has not done his own homework, because a very senior member of his backbench has made statements in public that actually reflect the position of the government and the coalition parties.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There is a very sneaky inference in this motion that the Howard government should be blamed for any rise in petrol prices when they occur. Clearly this motion is misplaced and misrepresents the true position. It fails to tell the complete, accurate story behind how fuel prices are determined in this country.</para>
<para>For anyone who is listening to this debate, the member for Prospect in his motion talks about the average price of petrol in Sydney being $1.19 a litre. I thought I might take a look at today’s prices in Sydney, because of course when the opposition speak it is not a good idea to take as gospel what they say; it is always good—indeed, very prudent—to check on what they say, because quite often their words do not reflect the truth.</para>

<para>—As the senior minister at the table says, they gild the lily quite often. I went to the MotorMouth fuel price watch—a web page at motormouth.com.au—which, of course, gives consumers up-to-date information on fuel prices across the country. I discovered, much to my amazement, that what the member for Prospect alleges in his motion about the average price of petrol is very different to what the true price of petrol is. We can see quite clearly that there is a yawning gap between the member for Prospect’s figures and his motion and what the price of petrol is today in Sydney and in my own electorate of Ryan in Brisbane.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Let me again state for the record that the member for Prospect says that $1.19 is the average price of a litre of petrol. Let us look at some of the petrol stations in his electorate. At Speedway in the suburb of Smithfield petrol is $1.09; at the Mobil site on the corner of Smithfield Road and The Horsley Drive, also in Smithfield, $1.10; on the corner of Sackville and Hamilton in the suburb of Fairfield, $1.10; on the corner of Blacktown Road and Leabons Lane in Blacktown, $1.10. The motion says that the average price of petrol in Sydney is $1.19 per litre, but when you look at the prices today you see that there is quite a difference.</para>
<para>The member for Prospect asked this House to take note of the exorbitant fuel prices. Where do high petrol prices come from? The member for Prospect said that his party’s solutions are no panacea. Of course they are no panacea, because the way petrol prices are structured is quite complicated. They concern international economics and international relations, and anyone with an ounce of understanding of these dynamics would know that the government of this country has minimal influence on the price of petrol for consumers.</para>
<para>Anyone, other than the new member opposite, the member for Prospect, who of course I welcome to this parliament, would know that there are essentially three reasons why petrol prices have been higher than normal in recent months—globally high petrol prices, restricted supply from oil-producing nations and China’s unusually high demand for oil. Do not take my statements as being reflective of this position; this combination of factors comes from the words of none other than someone on the back bench of the Labor Party—a former shadow minister, who I understand holds a PhD in economics and is a former adviser to a Labor Prime Minister. I think the new member opposite might like to consult with his senior backbench colleague, who is banished to the back bench because he has some thoughts.</para>
<para>Let me quote the member for Rankin. I very much regret that time is escaping me. This is what the member for Rankin said in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> on Monday, 4 July 2005:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Australia’s record petrol prices have one cause and one cause only - high world oil prices. The OPEC oil-producing countries are pumping oil out of the ground as fast as they can, but not as fast as the world wants to use it. China is burning oil products for its industrialisation as if there is no tomorrow.</para>

<para>—The arrogance of the government never ceases to amaze me. I guess we are to believe by the honourable member opposite that the Australian public should feel at ease that petrol prices are $1.10, $1.08 or $1.15. The reality is that petrol prices are very high and have continued to soar in the past months. Therefore, I am very pleased to be seconding the motion of the member for Prospect. This motion, like the motion from the member for Holt before him, recognises the severe implications which rising fuel prices are having on both local businesses and household budgets. It also recognises that there are sensible ways, despite what the government advocates, of addressing this problem, which the government and its members are choosing to ignore.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Just last week in my electorate petrol prices ranged from between $1.10 per litre, with the best price being $1.08—if you could hunt around long enough to find it, and it remained steady at $1.08—and the highest price of over $1.20 per litre. For an electorate with an average income of just under $930 per fortnight, the skyrocketing, inconsistent prices are taking a heavy toll, as household budgets are put under additional strain. Not only are the direct effects of these prices hitting hard, but the flow-on effects of high petrol prices are proving disastrous for our local community.</para>
<para>In the township of Sunbury in my electorate, for example, there are many reports of these flow-on effects, with local businesses being unable to sustain the absorption of high petrol costs. As a result, the local supermarket, for example, and other takeaway businesses have had to increase their delivery fees, bus charter prices have gone up by about eight per cent, driving lessons have increased by about $5, fruit and vegetable prices have begun to creep up and the local police stations have reported a noticeable increase in the number of petrol thefts in the town.</para>
<para>In addition, my local community is increasingly concerned about the inflationary pressures that such high petrol prices have, the increased risk of interest rate rises and further depressing economic activity. This year, higher petrol prices mean that Australians will spend an extra $2.3 billion on petrol. On average, Victorian motorists are spending nearly $10 per week more on petrol than they were at the beginning of the year. Yet, as the government surplus grows to $14 billion, there is still no sign of any real effort to do something meaningful about these petrol prices.</para>
<para>Petrol prices are at record highs across Australia, and the government needs to take some sort of immediate action to provide relief to motorists. Although the Prime Minister acknowledges that soaring petrol prices are painfully high, he continues to maintain that there is nothing he can do about them, but this is not washing with the Australian public, and it is certainly not washing with the people of my electorate.</para>
<para>Unlike the government, Labor believe that there is plenty that can be done, and we have a sensible plan to address this problem. Our plan for the development of a diversified fuel industry, so as to reduce our reliance on foreign oil, is one way of addressing the issue in the long term. Australia must develop and use those fuels that will become cheaper in the future. But this crisis of soaring petrol prices is hurting people now, and the government must take appropriate action now. It can do so, as my colleague the member for Prospect has suggested, by providing the ACCC with adequate powers to fully investigate the inconsistency of prices across the state and across suburbs, by strengthening the Trade Practices Act to prevent the abuse of market power, by placing petrol prices under the prices surveillance provisions for monitoring purposes and obtaining six-monthly reports on price movements and by modernising the regulatory regime for the petrol sector so as to promote competition and protect independent operators.</para>
<para>Over the last two years, petrol prices have gone up some 23 per cent, and every time someone fills up at the bowser 38c from every litre goes to the federal government. The government’s response to this is to shift responsibility to the states, but, with the Commonwealth taking around five times more revenue from petrol taxes than the states, the government’s claims just do not add up.</para>
<para>There has been enough excuse making and enough denial by this government. People in my electorate cannot afford any more buck passing, and nor can people across Australia. There are measures that can be taken, and the government must act upon them to provide relief to motorists, small businesses and families who are struggling with high petrol prices and the flow-on effects of those prices.</para>

<para>—The more we scratch the surface of this motion the more we realise that many of the contributions from members on the other side were written in September this year and have not been revised by their staff. I make the very clear point to the member for Prospect and the member for Ryan, the two who have spoken already—and I am sure the third, who will follow—that you can make all the points you wish about the pain in the electorate from a rising petrol price but, in the end, you cannot compensate for responsible economic management and the fact that we live in a globalised financial economy, from which we are reaping rewards every day. Part of that is that we will be subject to the movement of international fuel prices. As soon as you realise that, you realise that the fluctuations of which you complain are actually the workings of a highly competitive industry that is monitored by the ACCC, for which reports have been written and rewritten since 1996—in fact, over the last 25 years, there have been no fewer than 43 reports on fuel prices. Since 2001 there have been two very substantive contributions in that area.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>You can look at any web sites you want, anywhere in the world, and they will make an unequivocal case that the movements of fuel prices in Australia follow fuel prices in the world. And they do not follow them with parity. In fact, our prices are 20 to 30 per cent—sometimes 50 per cent—lower than many economies with which we compete. We have surprisingly low petrol prices, beaten only by Canada, Mexico and the United States. We have some of the lowest petrol prices in the world. Sure, there are Commonwealth and state taxes derived from fuel. I am yet to hear anyone from the other side of the chamber propose that we alter that.</para>
<para>We had four submissions made to us by the Leader of the Opposition a month or two ago, when he thought that he would try to tap into that spiking fuel price period of August to September this year. Three propositions were advanced. The first one was that we need a fair dinkum tax cut, and that that would be in some way a solution to rising fuel prices. I will address that later.</para>
<para>The second proposal was that we need to grow our liquid fuel market, as though an answer to high fuel prices is to simply convert our gas into liquid fuel and then sell it in Australia cheaper than the international market will pay for that same resource. I would like an answer to this question from the member for Werriwa, who will follow me: if we make fuel prices slightly lower in Australia than those they can attract overseas, are you proposing that manufacturers in this country stop exporting for the high dollar and say, ‘No, we will sell in Australia for some price that is cheaper’? Are you proposing government transfers directly to fuel stations, as we have seen in a number of economies, to take 3c, 4c or 5c a litre off the fuel price? Are you proposing a cash transfer? Are you proposing that we follow model economies in this area, like Mauritius, where we can guarantee that fuel prices are the same right across this country, and the member for Ryan, who has just spoken, can be guaranteed that there will be no more fluctuation of fuel prices because they will be set from Canberra? Are you proposing that we do away with the competitive forces that we have seen reported just this week in South Australia, where there will be 30c a litre discounts offered to people who shop in certain places as loyalty incentives? Are you proposing that we do away with those kinds of competitive processes in fuel retail? Of course they are not; they are not brave enough to say that. Instead, they just tiptoe around the edge and say we should strengthen the Trade Practices Act.</para>
<para>They propose on the other side that we should do more evaluation, more investigation, more reporting. In the end, that has already been done by the ACCC. Perhaps you are proposing a body over and above the ACCC to monitor petrol prices in an ongoing bureaucratic battle to place yourselves in between the competitive economic workings of the international petroleum industry. I would like them to propose that.</para>
<para>With the third proposal they have a hide, having completely and utterly discredited the biofuels industry when ethanol was first proposed. Do we remember the opposition then, when they spoke about the enormous damage done to the hard battler’s local vehicle—that every battler’s vehicle could be damaged by ethanol? The damage that did to the biofuels industry at that time was inestimable. There was a fourth proposal on top of all of that, and that was the tax cut. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—This is not the first time that I have raised the price of petrol in this place—and, given the government’s inactivity in this regard, I daresay it will not be the last. I support this motion because petrol prices are having a crushing impact on the family budgets of the people of my electorate of Werriwa and no doubt in the electorate of Bowman as well. The family budgets of Western Sydney are certainly suffering.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It continues to shock and amaze me, with the claims that we hear so often that this government is a friend of the Aussie battler, that, when it comes to making decisions about anything to do with higher petrol prices, this government is not to be seen. You wonder what it would take for this government to actually do something. This government at least has to try to do something when it comes to higher petrol prices.</para>
<para>The motion before us is quite clear. It seeks to have the government, in the first instance at least, direct the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to monitor petrol prices. While this government is sitting on its hands, watching over the shoulder of petroleum companies operating in Australia, the Australian population is continuing to ask how it is that petrol prices can fluctuate by up to 10c per day. Motorists deserve an explanation for this phenomenon; they deserve to know that somebody independent is at least looking out for their interests.</para>
<para>High transport fuel costs have a significant impact on this nation’s economy. In the first instance, they lower the level of household discretionary income, as was reported recently in the <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph</inline>. I cannot recall the date, but it reported that it was costing workers from Western Sydney up to $300 a week to travel to work in the Sydney CBD. While petrol prices increase, so does the cost of getting to and from work—obviously. As the cost of getting to and from work increases, discretionary income falls. Once this starts it puts immediate pressure on household budgets, it puts a dent in consumer confidence and the problem starts to multiply.</para>
<para>Small businesses are feeling the pinch. Firstly, the high prices have an impact for people in the cost of operating their own businesses and decreasing their profits. Secondly, the decrease in household discretionary income starts to impact on the pool of money that is there and available to be spent either in their stores or on the services which they provide. Small businesses are always in highly competitive industries. There is very little room for them when it comes to maintaining their profitability. The longer the government refuses to act on petrol prices, the more these small businesses are going to suffer and the more families in urban, rural and regional Australia are going to suffer. In the first instance, let us give the Australian taxpayer the tax cut they deserve so that the unprecedented petrol prices faced by Australian families can at least be dealt with.</para>

<para>The Australian government needs to act when it comes to Australia’s fuel self-sufficiency, and it needs to act now. I have spoken about this on many occasions.

The lack of action on the part of the government when it comes to securing the future of Australian transport fuels is going to have a severe cost on our economy and on Australian society. The issue needs to be acted upon, and it needs to be acted upon now. I support the motion and I call on the government to act rather than hope the issue will go away.</para>

The Labor Party say on the one hand that there is a lot more you can do about the price of fuel for motorists and, on the other, that it is true that high world oil prices are the key issue. The opposition never talk about the fuel tax over the last 20 years. We could talk about a spike in the price here or a spike in the price there, but the Labor Party will never talk about the period from 1983 to 1996 when there was a rise in fuel excise from something like 6c a litre to approaching 40c a litre. That is a fair bit of tax, a fair bit out of people’s pockets over at least 13 years. This government is the only government that has turned that around.</para>
<para>We are not here for the short term or the smart quote from one week or one month to the next. We are here for the sustainable, long-term good of this nation, based on our very strong economy. If you want to have that much control on the price of fuel, where do you stop? Do you want to stop with soft drinks? Do you want to go through the corner deli or the supermarket or rearrange the whole retailing system of Australia? These arguments are just not sustainable.</para>
<para>As far as the issue of alternative fuels is concerned, it is very important to remember, as we have been reminded, the alternative fuel that is added to petrol to make it more valuable and more economic for the Australian consumer to use.</para>
<para>I also want to talk about the broad range of transport reforms. If you look at the rail industry since 1996, when this government came into office, you will understand that the modernisation of the rail industry has been an enormous benefit to the transport task of Australia. It is not spoken of very often, but if you look at the amount of freight going interstate and the reason that it is now on rail rather than on road you will find that it is very much to do with the framework laid down by this government from 1996 onwards.</para>

<para>—The events of the last few weeks, with the government’s antiterror legislation and highly publicised raids on homes in Sydney and Melbourne, have left many Australian Muslim families greatly distressed. Their feelings were well expressed in an article by Muslim journalist Taghred Chandab in the <inline font-style="italic">Sun-Herald</inline> of 22 November. She wrote:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">I am tired of defending a peaceful religion and condemning the actions of those who have turned Islam into a mockery.</para>
<para class="block">I am tired of hearing how we as Muslims need to be more vocal about denouncing terrorism.</para>
<para class="block">We have condemned terrorism over and over again but it doesn’t seem to be enough for the wider community.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Those words echo the thoughts of many of my Muslim constituents. Taghred Chandab went on to give examples of how taunts and jibes in the workplace and elsewhere are causing great distress. I know from walking around shopping centres in my electorate, with its small but significant Muslim population, that the reaction to women wearing the hijab or to men in traditional Pakistani dress is more than noticeable. Muslims may not be the target of terror laws, as the Prime Minister tells us, but Australian Muslims are certainly the target of unwarranted and divisive campaigns of whispers, smears and insults, and they could easily be excused for thinking that they are the target of proposed terror laws.</para>
<para>At a time when the government proposes to make changes to sedition laws, it focuses on direct incitement rather than on the more destructive whisper campaigns against Muslims in Australia. The rantings of late night radio talkback hosts and their ratbag callers are usually kept to whispers, but the message is clear—the ‘we know what you’re thinking’ kind of dog whistle that leaves some things unsaid but gets its meaning across all the same. Then there are those like the Prime Minister who use words like ‘fundamentalist’ when they really mean ‘violent extremists’. The two terms are not the same. If I were to say that someone was a fundamentalist Christian, I would be referring to someone who held the belief that the Bible was the literal and factual record of history and prophecy, as well as matters of morals and faith. But, while a Christian fundamentalist might cause some concern with regard to particular beliefs, few people would quake in fear at the term ‘Christian fundamentalist’.</para>
<para>Those who refer to Muslim fundamentalists may choose to quote from the Holy Koran, and there are passages that might be taken to show a vengeful God. But when it comes to good old-fashioned violence, the Judaeo-Christian God is hard to beat. I will take one example from the Bible story of the Exodus. In that story, God first hardens the heart of Pharaoh to make sure that the Egyptian ruler will not be moved by the pleas of Moses to let his people go. Then, because Pharoah’s heart is hardened, God turns the Nile into blood so that people cannot drink its water and will suffer from thirst. Not satisfied, God sends swarms of locusts and flies, rains hail, fire and thunder on them and destroys all the trees and plants until nothing green remains. God orders every firstborn male child to be slaughtered. The massacre continues until there is not one house where one is not dead. Then, while the Egyptian families are mourning their dead, God orders Moses to loot from their houses all their gold and silver and clothing. Finally, God’s thirst for blood is satisfied and God pauses to rest and boasts, ‘I have made sport of the Egyptians.’</para>
<para>If that is not enough, the story continues as Moses heads into the Promised Land. There he is urged to hack women and children to death, rip unborn babies from their mothers’ wombs and level the cities. The virgins are taken at God’s command for the pleasure of his holy warriors and, when his holy warriors spare the lives of 50,000 captives, God sends Moses back to finish the job saying:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">And when the Lord your God gives them over to you, and you defeat them, then you must utterly destroy them; you shall make no covenant with them; and show no mercy to them ... and your eyes shall not pity them.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">If I were to take those verses as written, I could easily associate any Christian fundamentalist with a dangerous and extreme mindset, but we are more likely to associate the term ‘Christian fundamentalist’ with psalm singers and happy clappers, although we could hardly take that view from the actions of US Army Lieutenant General William Boykin. After leading US troops into battle against a Somalian warlord, Boykin announced:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I know my God was bigger than his. I knew that my God was a real God and his God was an idol.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Boykin later attended evangelical revivals, giving the message that as a Christian nation America was in a holy war battling Satan and that America’s Muslim adversaries will be defeated only ‘if we come against them in the name of Jesus’. General Boykin has since been promoted and is now the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence in the United States of America. Is it any wonder that people like Taghred Chandab are tired of defending a peaceful religion?</para>
<para>But the fundamentalist Christian views expressed by Boykin are not the only views of Christian churches or, for that matter, the views of military intelligence professionals. David MacMichael, a retired US marine captain, Professor of History at the University of Oregon and a member of the steering group of Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity, makes this clear in his recent summary of the report by bishops of the Church of England titled <inline font-style="italic">Countering terrorism: power, violence and democracy post 9/11</inline>. He says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">They express concern about the strong sense of moral righteousness behind U.S. policy in the Middle East which they said is fed by the major influence of the Christian right whose reading of current history in the light of texts is illegitimate. The bishops stressed that those texts need to be read in a different way altogether; namely as a critique of imperialism, rather than a justification for it. Churches they concluded have a particular message here based on biblical insights about fear and how playing on the fear of enemies makes for unwise policies ... According to the Church of England bishops it is not terrorism but American foreign policy and expansionism that constitute the major threat to peace.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The bishops’ views are expanded on by John Shepherd, Principal Lecturer in Religious Studies at Saint Martin’s College in Lancaster. Shepherd responded to journalist Robert Fisk’s comment that:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Deep down we do, however wrongly, suspect that religion has something to do with the London bombings.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Like the bishops, Shepherd sees the roots of violence and extremism in Judaism, Christianity and Islam—and the urgent need to render all religions safe for human consumption. Fisk says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We prefer not to accept the fact that the religions of the children of Abraham are inherently flawed in respect of intolerance, discrimination, violence and hatred.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Only by putting respect for human rights above all else and by making religion submit to universal human values can we grasp the nettle.</para>
<para class="block">But human rights values sound all too bleeding heart for many local commentators when Christians have failed to condemn our own atrocities, like the massacre by Christians of Muslims in Bosnia or the massacre by the Christian Lebanese allies of Israel of Muslim Palestinians at Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. However Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> columnist Piers Akerman seems to think that Muslims have a monopoly on extremism and violence. In a column headed ‘Tolerance they despise, hate they learn at home’, Akerman attacked the member for Grayndler and me, suggesting that we are preventing Muslims from integrating fully into the Australian community. I can only assume that encouraging integration means preaching good old Judeo-Christian values. That seems to be the message of the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney, Dr Peter Jensen, in the first of his recent Boyer lectures. He says that we should not make the story of Eureka our national myth but, rather, we should take the biblical history of Israel as if it were our own. But unless they are values that have been rendered safe for human consumption and purged of all hypocrisy, they will do little to promote tolerance and harmony and even less to promote the integration of the followers of a peaceful religion.</para>

<para>—I rise to reflect on some success during the last 12 months but also to point to further opportunities for our community around higher education. Last year, Mr Deputy Speaker, you might recall that I spoke on a number of occasions about the need to renew and revitalise Monash University’s Peninsula campus. This, I thought, was the forgotten campus of the Monash University network. Minister Nelson and I and the leadership of Monash University saw a delicious range of possibilities for that campus looking towards the future—building onto its existing strengths but also recognising new opportunities that the higher education reform, led by the Howard government, will provide for this campus. We were looking to secure additional student capacity to support an expanded health and wellbeing academic and research focus at Monash Peninsula campus as a high priority not only for that university and particularly for the Peninsula campus but, in addition, as a priority for our community.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Monash University is receiving additional public funding through the federal government’s $2.6 billion higher education reform, and I was looking to see Monash reinvest some of that windfall, supported by additional HECS funded campuses, to bring to life this vision, this renewal and revitalisation plan to create the Peninsula campus as the health and wellbeing focus not only of Monash University but of our community and, more broadly, in the east and south-east of Melbourne.</para>
<para>The plan involved securing additional student places to establish new courses in physiotherapy, occupational therapy and social work to boost the range and appeal of undergraduate programs offered at the Frankston campus. Thankfully, that work has borne fruit and last week, while we were away, I was pleased to be a part of the launch of the Bachelor of Occupational Therapy as one of the tangible and practical examples that this vision is coming to fruition. The Monash University Vice-Chancellor, Professor Richard Larkins, the Peninsula campus director, Professor Phillip Steele, and the team involved in this revitalisation strategy to make the Peninsula campus a very attractive and purposeful campus with a clear idea about its future all deserve to be congratulated for their work.</para>
<para>The Howard government have got behind this vision. We have provided additional HECS funded places to bring some of these programs on stream. I was delighted that Minister Nelson made available an $85,000 grant to tease out some of the further fine detail on this vision for the campus to see not only what facilities were needed to bring this campus vision to fruition but how it might support, integrate and collaborate with the broader goals that we have for our community. That $85,000 grant has seen a very comprehensive strategy develop to establish the Peninsula campus’s regional aquatic, health and wellness centre. It is an ambitious plan, but it is a good plan, a realistic plan and a practical plan.</para>
<para>With the additional 260 HECS funded places, we have seen the program in health sciences, occupational therapy and physiotherapy come into reality. Those extra HECS funded places have meant we can bring forward the start of the new OT program in the next academic year and not have to wait beyond that. But there is a broader vision about the wellbeing centre that I feel is the key to the success of this campus and presents some delicious opportunities for our region in general.</para>
<para>Traditionally the Frankston and Mornington Peninsula regions have been characterised by low tertiary education participation rates. Together with the Frankston Council, the Monash campus and the region in general, I am keen to develop Frankston as a learning city, not only one where higher education is valued as one of a range of opportunities for younger people in our own area but one where our educational assets can act as a focal point, a point that we can work around, to boost the credentials of our city and the opportunities we offer to those from outside our city, whether they are students from the east and south-east of Melbourne or the international students that are finding the environment of the Peninsula campus very attractive.</para>
<para>The latest VTAC statistics show that Monash University has entered the fray as a true agent for this evolution. It has made monumental gains in attracting new students, not only from the local area but also from abroad. The reputation the Peninsula campus is rapidly earning is one of excellence, highlighted by an extraordinary upward spike in enrolment interest. We have already seen a 30 per cent increase in first preferences for students in 2006 courses. All preferences are up by a wonderful 50 per cent in student interest for this campus. The campus is rapidly developing with a full head of steam and a clear vision on what can be achieved into the future. The campus currently offers outstanding educational opportunities for a little over 3,000 students, including 300 international students. There are four faculties—business and economics, education, IT, and medicine, nursing and health sciences.</para>
<para>There are exciting plans to increase enrolments to about 4,500 and to establish at least one major, internationally recognised research centre. Frankston City, Monash and other education providers are getting behind this practical, realistic vision that not only boosts the learning opportunities offered by Monash but also supports the programs offered by Chisholm TAFE. Vocational support from Peninsula Health is also expected to trigger significant increases in participation rates and student enthusiasm not only for tertiary education at the Peninsula campus but for tertiary education in general.</para>
<para>Another part of this vision is the prospect of a health and wellbeing precinct. This vision has been planned and evaluated and shown to be a pragmatic, realistic goal with the assistance of an $85,000 grant that enabled this concept to be researched. The idea is to carry forward healthy and successful living as a theme, with courses structured around this branding. In 2006, new undergraduate degrees in physiotherapy, occupational therapy, health sciences, social work and psychology are planned but there is a vision for a centre for fitness training, dietetics, massage, pilates, yoga, wellbeing and health and human movement.</para>
<para>The planned wellbeing hub would also feature a multidisciplinary clinic that would provide not only services to the community but also a practical opportunity for students to learn their craft and their skills. It will provide a chance for further invaluable clinical education and research that will help underpin this vision. We have put forward with much vigour—and I hope with success, but we will wait and see—a proposal to the federal government’s Capital Development Pool program. That program identifies a number of priorities that we should be working towards. Objective 1 is the development of campuses in suburban growth corridors and regional centres, with priority given to projects which support collaboration between providers. We have a very neat fix with objective 1.</para>
<para>Objective 2 is for capital developments that will assist higher education providers to establish or expand the provision of courses identified by the government as discipline areas of national importance. We are very well placed with that vision but, to make it become real, we need not only the resources of Monash University—and they have indicated a willingness to participate—but also the support of the Howard government, bearing in mind that these funding grants go to academic goals.</para>
<para>To expand the project into a community facility, we need community representation and community participation. If we are to take the infrastructure needed to develop the course curriculum that I outlined as part of this vision and make it a community and a regional asset, we need other players to turn up. We need other players that recognise that the co-location of this university infrastructure in a way that makes it available for the broader public means we have to collaborate effectively not just with those concerned with the delivery of tertiary programs but with those beyond. It is an opportunity to extend educational aquatic facilities into a 50-metre competition pool that involves other facilities around water play—beach areas, hydrotherapy pools, spas and saunas—so that the general public and the region in general, including the taxpayers of Frankston, will have a leisure complex that they can be proud of.</para>
<para>But just talking about it will not be enough. I know that one of the state members of parliament has been rattling on about this project for some time as if it were the only tool to secure his re-election. But it needs more than talk. It needs more than the measly $2.5 million, if we are lucky, that the state government could provide. This is a $30 million project. I urge the Howard government to play its part in its space—in its policy area. Monash can rightly play a role and is willing to do so, but I say to the state local member: do not fit up the local council with a huge bill to make this vision become real; you need to turn up. The Bracks government needs to at least match its $5 million contribution towards the Casey pool, recognising that that was a $17 million project. More than small change is needed to make this $30 million project real. I urge all of those parties to recognise that each needs to play a constructive role. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Today I am grieving for the state of democracy in this country. Hopefully the result in the Pittwater by-election at the weekend is a healthy sign that voters are rejecting major party arrogance, whether it is in the form of industrial relations changes with absolutely no mandate or in the form of party candidates being imposed on electorates from the outside. We must never assume, as some may try to tell us, that we are a paradigm of democratic values in this country. The more I look at local, state and federal electoral systems in Australia the more I see an erosion of individual rights and suppression of individual will.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Within our parliaments, executive dominance is a cancer eroding the role of members of parliament in debating, amending and overseeing laws. The role of legislators is being usurped by executive federal government and its extraparliamentary body, the Council of Australian Governments. The current farce of an informed debate and inquiry into counter-terrorism laws stands in stark contrast to the United Kingdom. There, the three major terrorism laws prior to 2004 are reviewed annually by independent reviewer Lord Carlile, while the latest 2005 law is subject to a three-monthly report on control orders from the Home Secretary as well as Lord Carlile’s annual review. In Australia there will be no independent review. Will the government accept the inquiry recommendations being outlined as I speak?</para>
<para>COAG has become a de facto governing council. When Australian Capital Territory Chief Minister, Jon Stanhope, chose to let the people know about the draft counter-terrorism bill, he was pilloried for making it available on his web site. Stanhope’s actions led to the public debate we were not supposed to have. It forced an extension—pitifully short as it has been—of the scrutiny and debate of this momentous legislation. There is a lack of transparency in COAG that threatens the role of parliament. Conventions of secrecy and bureaucratic confidentiality plague the process, further reducing parliamentary scrutiny, especially of crucially important human rights legislation such as the terror laws.</para>
<para>Here in this winner-take-all democracy, crucial public policy issues—for example, the IR reforms, the sale of Telstra and the security legislation—have had totally inadequate scrutiny, truncated inquiry and truncated debate. There are no House legislation reference committees. We—or at least those of us who might be interested in being anything other than a number in the division—pathetically wait here for the outcome of Senate inquiries. How many times have we debated bills before even a draft <inline font-style="italic">Bills</inline> <inline font-style="italic">Digest</inline>, let alone any inquiry outcomes, was available? I related this lack of process to a former magistrate the other day, and he was absolutely horrified at this disrespect for elected representatives.</para>
<para>Despite less than flattering descriptions of the Senate, notably by former Prime Minister Keating, that chamber is far more representative of the kaleidoscope of Australian politics than this democratic backwater. One can only hope the voters will appreciate the loss of review in that place post July and restore a Senate representation that truly reflects the public’s will, not one manufactured by party preference deals. Such representation will not, unfortunately, be achieved in the people’s house. That cannot happen until we have proportional representation in this place, too. An overwhelming number of Western democracies—apart from the UK, Canada, the USA and Australia; all relics of outdated and irrelevant Westminsterism—have a form of proportional representation. Despite those who would try and discredit proportional representation, the truth is that first-past-the-post and majoritarian preferential voting deliver far less democratic outcomes than proportional representation.</para>
<para>There is nothing wrong with minority government. We have had it in the Senate for two decades and people like it. It provides for consultation, compromise and even consensus. They are strange words, I know, for this government and the major political parties, but it is exactly what people expect. Alliances, consensus and negotiation are the cornerstones of modern democracies. Look at what is happening in Israel, in Germany and in New Zealand. The electorate can engage on an issue-by-issue basis—as it yearns to do now in Australia on the industrial relations legislation, which was rammed through with no mandate; on the privatisation of Telstra, in the face of overwhelming opposition; on the antiterror legislation; and no doubt on changes to electoral laws and media ownership just down the track.</para>
<para>At every opportunity, the major parties in this country are trying to shore up their falling primary vote by corrupting the process. An amount of $55 million of public money was squandered on an IR propaganda campaign. There were 11,000 television spots bought by the government in October and $26 million—on top of the $55 million IR blitz—was spent by the government on advertising across all media in October. That is government by spin, government by media event and government by deceit. And the tap is not turned off for elections, as it should be, with parties using their own resources. It is opened even wider, with flagrant abuse of the so-called conventions applying to the use of staff and overtime, printing allowances, cars, phones, air travel, electorate offices and so it goes.</para>
<para>Now there are plans to lift the disclosure limit for donations to major parties to $5,000, parties who already share around $40 million, at the last dip, of public funding. The Australian Electoral Commission is unable to track many donations, Auditor-General recommendations are ignored and we see the brazen selling of access to ministers through devices like the Victorian ALP’s Progressive Business or the Prime Minister’s Millennium Forum with price tags up to $20,000.</para>
<para>At a local government level, there is the sad tale of the corrupted Tweed council, sacked after some pseudoindependent candidates were sponsored into council by developers. Commissioner Maurie Daly’s suggested cap on the individual campaign spending of council candidates should be extended to state and federal parliaments. I have suggested that $50,000 per candidate, properly audited and reported by each candidate—not the party—is the only way to go; otherwise, we will be the second-best democracy after the US that money can buy. Congressional candidates there require $750,000 every two years, raising money from those who expect a political return for their investment.</para>
<para>So not only are prospective independent candidates blown off the park by the big fundraising of major parties and ticket voting at local, state and federal polls but the privileges of office are continually increased to support incumbents, along with a system of allowances—code for lurks and perks—that unfairly advantage all MPs if they choose to exploit it. In 2004, $95 million was spent on so-called government advertising in the lead-up to the election. From July this year, that figure is already about $80 million—political propaganda, sustained by the taxpayers.</para>
<para>To what degree does such largesse from incumbent governments influence the behaviour of media in their coverage of politics? Since the Howard government took office in 1996, $980 million—almost $1 billion—has been spent on federal government advertising. Such spending, along with that of the state governments—over $2 billion for the same period—constitutes a significant income for media organisations, especially print and television. Add to that a likely relaxation of cross-media laws and it is easy to see why the media moguls and many of their correspondents are all for the political status quo, especially when it coughs up the cash and the policies. How often have we heard any criticism of government advertising spending on commercial radio and television? Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans—an essential burr under the propaganda blanket of government—in his submission to the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee inquiry into government advertising, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It is suspected that advertising firms accept lower fees for advertisements paid for by the party in power with an assurance that more lucrative government advertising contracts will fall their way. In effect the expenditure on the government advertising projects subsidises the party political advertising of the government party.</para>
<para>This is tantamount to corruption.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">At local, state and federal government level there is a gradual erosion of democratic processes and increasing executive rule. Federally, we have Orwellian propaganda units—such as the Ministerial Committee on Government Communications—with no accountability to parliament. Even the parliamentary committee process is largely powerless, with government contempt for the findings of most inquiries, except where partisan recommendations might reinforce executive policy. And so it goes.</para>
<para>Further undermining our right to have a say about all this are plans for four-year federal terms, not fixed as they should be, but simply extending the maximum length of a term to shore up the foundation of a party system which, if tested by proportional representation, would see its parliamentary numbers dramatically reduced. Finally, just to make sure it further cements minority rule—for that is what it is—this government wants to close the rolls as soon as an election is called, denying tens of thousands the right to vote, and also to ban prisoners from voting, and there are strong moves within its ranks to introduce voluntary voting. This is the agenda: selective democracy, not representative democracy.</para>

Colleagues from both sides of the House might like to know that finally our group now has a positive focus, after many false starts on the way.

Everyone whispered, ‘She has Parkinson’s disease.’ I turned to Ken and said, ‘I don’t want to finish up like that woman’—probably the most prophetic statement I have ever made. Forward to 1982 and I went to my local doctor with what I can only describe as a ‘heavy’ left forearm. After careful examination I was told there was nothing wrong with me at all. Little did I know this would be the start of 13 years of being looked upon as a hypochondriac and probably a premenopausal woman.</para>
<para>At this time I had a happy life living beside the water at Sussex Inlet. I had a part-time job, a hard-working husband, my three sons, one blue cattle dog, two cats, one very ancient goldfish and a budgie named ‘Somebody’. So you see there was no reason or time for me to imagine things. Eight years after my first symptom I was very ill, spending a lot of time lying on the lounge with my ‘heavy’ left arm supported on pillows, with worsening leg shakes which I had been assured were only a pitched nerve in my back. I had also lost my sense of smell. About once a year I would visit the local doctor. ‘No, you definitely don’t have Parkinson’s disease’—although I hadn’t asked—‘you are far too young.’</para>
<para>Early 1994 saw me sent to a neurologist. ‘Do you drink, Mrs Barkley?’ ‘No, I don’t.’ This question was asked twice on my initial visit. ‘Off you go for CT scan then.’ The scan was clear but as I walked out of the neurologist’s office his parting comment was, ‘Of course, Mrs Barkley, there is always the grog!’ How degrading and how dare he. Eighteen months later saw me back to the same neurologist. He could not believe the deterioration but was still not prepared to diagnose PD. He sent me to Dr Leo Davis at RPA who, with three of his colleagues, put electrodes on my fingers and toes—first on one side then the other—and asked me to count backwards from 100 in sevens and seven-and-a-halves. I concentrated so hard I was literally bouncing off the walls. They then gave me 125 milligrams of levodopa. Total relief within 20 minutes. ‘Yes, you do have PD.’ I came away happy that I had an answer.</para>
<para>Then of course the shock set in but I refused to feel sorry for myself. Every so often, however, I allow myself to be a little bit angry or depressed. What to do? Sit in the corner and let things destroy me or learn as much as I could and fight? Really it was no contest. The only ripple came as we arrived at our first supporters’ meeting. Many tears and me saying everyone looked so old. We nearly went home but I realised if we did we wouldn’t return. We now know we made the right decision.</para>
<para>And now to tell our three sons, one of whom to my dismay hung up on me. Soon after, he phoned back saying how much he loved me and how could this happen to his beloved mother. There is no cure, symptoms can be controlled with drugs and for some there is deep brain stimulation. But remember, Parkinson’s remains relentless and always progressive. At this stage I would not consider DBS but I have absolute faith in my neurologist, so never say never.</para>
<para>Ten years since diagnosis has seen me slowly deteriorate but the positives have been amazing. I am now a confident, middle aged tending to elderly woman who sleeps in satin PJs with satin sheets to lie on, satin pillows to cry on—not to mention dribble on! The bed has so many bars it looks like a cage. When I wake it’s into my electric wheelchair and down to the bathroom to yet more bars. Eventually, out of the wheelchair after medication has cut in and I am half ‘on’. I actually find it easier to walk backwards. I think perhaps I need rear vision mirrors! My mind is active, with at least one ordinary crossword per day plus my best cryptic effort. I’ve taken up drawing with coloured water pencils, pastels and charcoal. I have mastered the computer myself and go to a discussion group twice a month.</para>
<para>In Sussex Inlet I have amazing support from so many caring people. I am very proud to live there. Best of all I have become, I believe, a better person—much more tolerant and caring, with a new-found ability to relate to others. Who knows if my life will be shortened? I will enjoy each day to the fullest. My future hopes are for a cure, if not for me then at least for the next generation. Last but certainly not least is my husband—my soul mate and my carer. I sometimes wondered what would happen if ever became incapacitated. I found out, didn’t I? Life is not a fairy tale.</para>
<para>My wonderful husband is now also a victim. On Christmas Eve last year we went to our local doctor and he followed us down the hall to the surgery. When we sat down he took a long hard look at Ken and said, ‘I’m sorry mate, but you have Parkinson’s disease, too’, confirming what we already knew in our hearts. How would we tell everyone? How would we deal with this double whammy? The same way we dealt with me, of course: with love, determination, a sense of humour, lots of cuddles and maybe—just maybe—one martini, shaken not stirred. We have the love and support of our sons, family and friends but most of all we have each other. We are lucky people.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Now you can see why I call Pat so courageous. Not only that, it is people like her and Rod Irwin who have made me realise that we in parliament have a responsibility to do more for those who suffer from Parkinson’s disease. Some might say it is a state matter but it is like everything else: no government can do all and it is sometimes far too little. I know that with our bipartisan friends we will do all we can to see the profile of Parkinson’s lifted and recognised, as are other debilitating diseases, by the government.</para>
<para>I might add some statistics. While as many as 100,000 Australians are living with this disease, 85 per cent of people polled by Pfizer think it is unlikely they will ever be affected. Sixty-one per cent admit they have little or no knowledge of the condition. Thirty-seven per cent of Australians overall know of someone with Parkinson’s. In 1997 the average cost for admission to hospital in Australia for sufferers was $17,000, which equates to about $1 billion per year. A scoping study is under way to determine when assistance is needed most. Education is at the forefront as there are many cases of doctors still not being able to determine when Parkinson’s has struck, as well as many in our community who are certainly not aware of this condition.</para>
<para>To me, the debilitating effects of Parkinson’s disease are heartbreaking. We will also use this forum to lobby government to provide assistance to enable doctors to diagnose this disease earlier so that treatment can be targeted but, most of all, we want to do something positive to counter the feelings of inadequacy felt by families and friends. Sufferers need to feel that they are not carrying the additional burden of what people may be wrongfully thinking about the way they are. In conclusion, may I again thank Pfizer, David Miles and Gillian Adamson, who did so much to make the breakfast a success.</para>
<para>In my remaining time, I would like to mention that on Sunday there will be a bike ride, Toys for Christmas, in my electorate. It is no ordinary bike ride—in fact, it will be run by the many members of the Ulysses motorcycle club. For me, I will get to ride a Harley Davidson. Our special guest is none other than Dr Brendan Nelson, who is still a member of the Ulysses bike club. He will be joining us. It is a great cause. I thank Brendan Nelson for participating in the event. He is certainly no stranger to Gilmore and, when Danny Kennedy from the South Coast club invited him, he immediately said yes. So we will be putting on this event, and I cannot begin to thank all the people who donated a truckload full of toys to be distributed to local charities.</para>

</talker>
<para>—During the parliamentary break I had the privilege of attending the Fourth World Parliamentarians Convention on Tibet, held in Edinburgh in the Scottish Parliament. The convention was organised by the Assembly of Tibetan People’s Deputies and hosted by the Cross Party Scottish Parliamentary Group for Tibet and the UK All Party Parliamentary Group for Tibet. The guest of honour was His Holiness the Dalai Lama, the leader of the Tibetan people and one of world’s great moral and spiritual leaders. I want to thank Mr Tenzin Phuntsok Atisha from the Tibet Information Office here in Australia for facilitating my attendance at this important international gathering.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The large and widely representative attendance at the convention showed in the most striking way that the world has not forgotten the people of Tibet. After more than 50 years of Chinese occupation, the world is still not prepared to see the legitimate political, religious and cultural rights of the people of Tibet trampled underfoot. I might note in passing that the Dalai Lama is not demanding independence for Tibet; he is certainly not demanding the break-up of China. His Holiness’s plan for a Third Way asks for no more than that the Tibetan people be allowed local autonomy and control of their own affairs within a Chinese federation and China retain rights to foreign affairs and defence—and this parallel is of course why the Scottish Parliament, within a UK federation, evinced such sympathy for their friends the Tibetans. That right to cultural autonomy is actually guaranteed to the Tibetans under the Chinese constitution but has been systematically denied in practice.</para>
<para>In fact, the people of China—the whole 1.2 billion of them—are systematically denied human rights which are supposedly guaranteed to them by their own constitution. They are supposedly guaranteed freedom of speech, assembly and religion, but in practice they are denied all of these things. I acknowledge of course that things are better in China today than they were 30 or 40 years ago. Since the reforms of Deng Xiaoping, China has become a much more prosperous country and a country which in some ways has more freedom than it did in the days of its megalomaniac dictator Mao Zedong.</para>
<para>But it is still a country in which millions of people are being worked to death in the labour camps of the Laogai—hundreds of camps which are run on the same lines as or an ever greater scale than the camps of Stalin’s Gulag, despite the fact that this government and many people in the Australian media would like to ignore that. China is a country in which respected writers, doctors, scholars and artists are arrested, harassed and intimidated when they exercise their legal right to criticise their government’s policy. It is a country where religious minorities—whether they are Catholics, Protestants, Muslims or Falun Gong—are routinely arrested and sent to labour camps. It is a country where tens of millions of people work in dangerous, insanitary, oppressive work conditions, in which they have been denied the right to organise or form free trade unions. We see the dreadful pictures of the people of Harbin crowding, quite understandably, into every bus and train station to escape the lack of drinking water and avoid the environmental catastrophe that is coming down the river towards them because of the gross mismanagement of environmental issues in China.</para>
<para>China is a country which seeks to be admitted to the ranks of great powers, with all the rights that go along with that status. China is a great country, with a great history and a truly impressive civilisation. China deserves to be treated with the respect that its size, its history and its culture command. China’s spectacular economic growth and its new prosperity and power certainly must be recognised. But China cannot expect to retain the respect of other nations if it does not behave as a responsible member of the world community.</para>
<para>How do the current rulers of China use their new position of power and influence in the world? First of all, they are conducting a massive military build-up in the Taiwan Strait, posing a growing threat to the security of Taiwan and Japan and creating the risk of a war into which the United States and other countries, possibly Australia, might be drawn. They block efforts at the United Nations to censure the military regime in Sudan for the genocide that has been conducted against the people of Darfur. A genocide finding was specifically blocked at the UN Security Council because of Chinese intervention. They aid and prop up the sinister military dictatorship in Burma, which for more than a decade has kept the elected leader of the Burmese people, Aung San Suu Kyi, under house arrest. China block efforts to refer Iran’s nuclear weapons program to the United Nations, despite the recommendations of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and they provide an economic lifeline which keeps afloat the North Korean regime, probably the world’s most oppressive Stalinist regime. Of course, we have seen the pictures of Hu Jin Tao with the disgraceful mass plunderer and genocidist Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, who was an honoured guest in Beijing just some months ago.</para>
<para>Many people have become convinced that China’s rise to great power status is inevitable, and some have even argued that it is a good thing, apparently because they believe that a strong China will provide a counterweight to the United States. Many rather rash predictions have been made that China will soon overtake the US and become the world’s largest economy and that in time it will overtake the US in military and political power as well. These assumptions about China’s rise are by no means inevitable. While its economic growth over the past 20 years has been spectacular, there has been no guarantee it will continue. Most of China’s growth has flowed from Deng Xiaoping’s bold reforms in agriculture, which abolished Mao’s people’s communes and allowed the peasantry to once again own land and produce grain for profit. In an economy which was 80 per cent agricultural in the 1970s, this produced a huge rise in living standards, creating a market for manufactured goods which boosted the whole economy, as well as providing the state with huge taxation revenues.</para>
<para>But since the death of Deng the pace of basic reform in China has slowed. The state still controls large parts of the means of production and allows its state banks to prop up unproductive industries with soft loans which are never repaid. China also replicates the mistake of the former Soviet regime in spending a disproportionate share of state revenues on armaments acquisition—12 per cent growth by its own underestimation in recent years. By artificially holding down the wages for the sake of quick export profits, China not only grossly violates the human rights of tens of millions of Chinese workers but also retards the growth of its own real economy. The flood of cheap exports created through this system of exploitation destroys jobs in other countries, including in the Australian manufacturing industry, and threatens the structure of international trade. One could add to that the deliberate undervaluing of the yuan, but that is a whole separate topic.</para>
<para>The belief that China will overtake the Western powers is not shared by many observers who know China best. Australia’s leading China expert, Professor Ross Terrill, wrote recently:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">China may gain lasting prosperity. China may retain its Leninist party-state. But both will not occur; either the economic or the political logic will soon gain the upper hand.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This is the heart of the matter. China will not become a great power unless it becomes a genuine market economy and a genuine democracy rather than a Soviet style command economy which mixes the worst aspects of 19th century capitalism with its communist command system. It will not become a respected power in the world until its economic reforms are continued and matched by reforms in the political sphere. The Chinese leadership drew some correct conclusions about the fall of the Soviet Union but not the essential one, which is that the command economy and the Leninist one-party state are failed models of political development and cannot be replicated in China to achieve its place in the world, especially the place in the world it aspires to.</para>
<para>There are those in Australia who believe that since China is bound to become a dominant power in our region we had better jump on the bandwagon and become a Chinese client state so we can get in the good graces of the new regional hegemony and share in the vast Chinese market for raw materials. That some people on the extreme Left who have long admired what they fondly imagine to be Chinese socialism would take this view is not surprising. It is more surprising that this view seems to be shared by senior ministers and many members of the Howard government. That seems to be the only conclusion that can be drawn from some of the government’s recent statements and actions, most obviously its shameful delay in granting a protection visa to Chen Yonglin or in taking any interest in the activities of Chinese espionage in Australia.</para>
<para>In fact, there is no need for Australia to be overly deferential towards China. It is true that China may well be Australia’s most important trading partner, but trade is a two-way street. China’s economic growth is being literally fuelled by Australian coal, iron ore and natural gas. There is no other source of these essential commodities as reliable as Australia. China needs Australia as much as Australia needs China, and it will go on buying our raw materials whatever the state of our political relationship. A healthy and mutually profitable trade relationship need not make Australia follow a policy of the pre-emptive kowtow.</para>
<para>I am not advocating a policy of hostility towards China. I consider myself a friend and admirer of the Chinese people and I am in favour of a good relationship between the countries. That has been Labor’s position since the Whitlam government, followed by Bob Hawke and Paul Keating. But I do recall that Bob Hawke never allowed the economic relationship to obscure the essential human rights issues, such as when he objected to the Tiananmen Square massacre in which 3,000 unarmed protesters were slaughtered by the Chinese army. While developing our trade relations with China, we should not forget the interests of the Chinese people, particularly the people of Tibet, the people of Hong Kong and the people of Taiwan, who are living proof that democracy can exist in a Chinese republic. We should continue to use whatever avenues we have to press for fundamental political reform in China, including giving up our fraudulent human rights dialogue which seeks to artificially suppress real political concerns about human rights. This is the best way, in the long run, of demonstrating our friendship with the Chinese people. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<name role="display">Mr HENRY</name>
</talker>
<para>—I am grateful for this opportunity to address the House on a grievance of critical importance to over 25,000 residents within my electorate of Hasluck and perhaps thousands more in adjacent areas. In March this year I brought to the attention of the House the intention of the Perth airport operator, Westralia Airports Corporation, to lease airport land for the purpose of developing a brickworks by the construction group BGC. The first casualty of that intent, the community based West Aviat Golf Club, has already been forced off the land where a major development plan for the proposal has been prepared and closes for public comment this Wednesday, 30 November.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Opposition from within the local community to this development on what is Commonwealth land, just 200 metres from residential housing, is overwhelming. That opposition has my full support. The brickworks is not wanted, it is not welcome and must not be built. It is a totally inappropriate development on Perth airport and a blatant attempt by BGC to use the shield of the Crown to evade the need to deal with the state government. I will not support such a proposal.</para>
<para>This government should have no truck with such an arrangement. I call upon the Hon. Minister for Transport and Regional Services to reject the BGC brickworks proposal as an inappropriate development for Perth airport. It would be a noxious industry without precedent at any other major airport. While I might have sympathy for Mr Buckeridge and accept his claim that the Labor controlled state government has been unreasonable in its dealings with him, that does not make it right or appropriate to build a noxious plant in an urban area—a plant that will pump out between 120 and 230 tonnes of acid gases into the airshed already overloaded by similar operations. It will bring the amount of acid gases being pumped into the atmosphere in the Swan Valley area to over 2,000 tonnes.</para>
<para>A report on brickworks in the Swan Valley prepared by WA’s Department of Environment in 2003 found:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... it is clear from the weight of evidence over many years that exposure to acid gas emissions ... have caused demonstrable adverse health effects, primarily itchy eyes and respiratory sensitivity.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That report was prepared in response to community concerns about the accumulative health impact of existing brickwork operations on residential areas. The report went on to state:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Odour emissions from brickworks do adversely affect amenity in the area, and may be associated with reported health impacts.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Key to the issue is BGC’s and Westralia Airports Corporation’s failure to deliver undertakings to the local community that the operation of the brickworks will not adversely impact upon their health. That can lead to only one very telling conclusion: the opposite is true and, indeed, it will impact on the wellbeing of local families and their children—and they know it.</para>
<para>In 1990 the then WA education minister and now state Labor Premier of Western Australia closed a Swan Valley school, Middle Swan School, as a direct result of the odour and reported health issues associated with emissions from a nearby brickworks. We must learn from that experience; we must not allow history to repeat itself. There are nine schools, including primary and preprimary schools, in the area that will be potentially affected by this brickworks proposal. I for one put the health and wellbeing of our children above that of BGC’s need to make additional profit or the need to ease any brick shortages in Western Australia. Given the proximity of the proposed brick manufacturing plant to residential neighbourhoods, including Rosehill, High Wycombe, Hazelmere and South Guildford where over 25,000 people live, the likelihood of these communities being subjected to regular weather related fumigation events is very high indeed. Such events occur when emission gases touch down at ground level rather than disperse into the atmosphere. When that happens, every man, woman and child in the area will be subjected to brickworks exhaust gases at near-full concentration. The 2003 Department of Environment report concluded that the topography of the Swan Valley was likely to be a direct contributor to the accumulation of higher than expected ground-level concentrations of brickworks emissions.</para>
<para>The proposed brickworks has a stack of a height that many believe is totally insufficient to guarantee dispersal of the acid gas emissions. That height that has been set to bring the stack under the limits for air safety fixed by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, not to ensure the health and wellbeing of the local community, whose air it will pollute. Raising the stack height would significantly reduce the incidence of touchdown by emission gases—but that cannot happen. It cannot happen because of its airport location. This is an absurd situation, and it is wrong. The 2003 report to which I have alluded drew this conclusion:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... with increasing urbanisation and residential development in the area, the health and odour issues will become more evident and lead to increased pressure to reduce brickworks emissions.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It is a compelling conclusion and it should be given weight. The reality is that this new plant, no matter how advanced its technology, will be pumping many hundreds of tonnes of exhaust gases into the atmosphere and the lungs of local people. It beggars belief that we even have to consider this proposal. Should the development of the brickworks be approved, it would mean that up to 100 heavy haulage trucks a day would trundle through a residential area as they turned off Roe Highway and onto Kalamunda Road to reach the brickworks site. The impact on the safety and security of the local community would be devastating. Funnelling this level of heavy industrial traffic through residential neighbourhoods is totally unacceptable.</para>
<para>The bipartisan approach that has been developed to address this critical local issue sends a powerful message that something about this proposal is fundamentally wrong. However, it is disappointing to see that this united front has come under pressure from a self-serving attempt by a Johnny-come-lately, WA’s Senator Sterle, to suggest that my opposition to the brickworks is a facade and that I am in the pay of BGC and Mr Buckeridge. I have a message for Senator Sterle and his union mates: unlike you, my soul is not for sale and never will be. I attended a public rally earlier this month attended by around 500 local people. Senator Sterle was invited to speak but declined. It would have been an opportunity for him to tell the community what he had done to oppose the brickworks. I can tell the House the answer to that question—nothing.</para>
<para>The Labor controlled state government bears a great deal of responsibility for the current situation. It has obstructed BGC and has failed to deal with the company in an honest and appropriate manner. The state members for Midland and Belmont, senior ministers in the state government, along with the state Minister for Planning and Infrastructure, Alannah MacTiernan—she has expressed concern about the brickworks at the airport, but there has been little substance to her opposition; she does not want to deal with BGC—would much rather point the finger of blame for any development at the federal government. Ultimately, Alannah MacTiernan must shoulder responsibility for her failure to assist in finding a more appropriate site. In my view, the state government should have been actively promoting alternative sites to BGC. It can still do so. That requires but the will and an honest commitment to deal fairly with one of Western Australia’s major employers.</para>
<para>The brickworks proposal is a totally inappropriate development for Perth airport, as it will be sited adjacent to a flight path, and it is totally inappropriate so close to the growing residential neighbourhoods that have preceded it. The passive recreational buffer that the West Aviat Golf Club provided between airport development and people’s homes should have been retained. Indeed, it is not too late to see the club restored. Many hundreds of personal representations, emails, letters and phone calls have been made to my office regarding this issue. It would be impossible in the short time allotted to me to convey the anger and despair described to me by the local community. The community has a right to expect the Westralia Airports Corporation to have regard for the corporation’s commitment within the Perth airport master plan that said the airport ‘will incorporate good-neighbour policies and will contemplate only land uses that will complement that of adjacent communities’. Mr Deputy Speaker, I can tell you now that a brick manufacturing plant does not fit that bill. I call upon the members of this House to join me in opposing the proposed brickworks at Perth airport.</para>

</talker>
<para>—My contribution to the grievance debate is in respect of a motion passed by the United States Senate two weeks ago. The US Senate resolved all but unanimously to call upon the United States administration to set out some clear benchmarks for the involvement of the United States in Iraq and, essentially, to put greater pressure on the Iraq administration to get their own house in order and so be in a position to take responsibility for their own security. In other words, the US administration should not provide an open chequebook to the current Iraq administration, so removing the incentive for them to think that they could go on with faction fighting, a continuation of past differences, without consequences.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We should be entitled to nothing less from the Australian government. The Australian people are entitled to know clearly what our mission and benchmarks are in Iraq, let alone when they will be achieved. For instance, one would think that if through the Al Muthanna Task Group we have trained a battalion of Iraqi forces for the Al Muthanna province—which training I understand will be completed in April or May—it would not be unreasonable to expect the Japanese military to provide us with a scope of works as to the civil construction projects that are currently being undertaken in Iraq and the timetable for completion of those projects. Those factors are rational planning tools, one would think, before any exercise is undertaken. Certainly, the Australian people are entitled to ask: is that our mission, are they our benchmarks and when is it estimated they will be completed? Again, it is important that the current Iraqi administration does not think it has an open chequebook from the United States or Australia—or any other country, for that matter—but rather that they have to put factional differences aside, get their own house in order and take responsibility for their own security. But, instead, on 17 November Senator Hill, the Minister for Defence, was reported as saying:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It shouldn’t be assumed that … by the end of next year, we’ll have less forces there—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">that is, in Iraq—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... there will be plenty of important work in Iraq to help the new government.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Again, this is venturing into the open chequebook situation where we do not have tasks or benchmarks so that we all know when our troops in the Al Muthanna province can return home. That is a concern and, moreover, it suggests that, without identifying a mission and without setting out the benchmarks for that mission and when they are likely to be obtained, you very quickly slide into the conclusion that our presence in Iraq will continue for as long as the current administration in the United States thinks it will be of assistance to the political message for their domestic political audience. That is no way to address the fundamental security priorities of our country.</para>
<para>Indeed, you can conclude that our security contribution is focused more on that political impact than on an actual physical contribution to the alliance when you look at how the United States considers our capacity to provide military resources to the alliance. Providing what is essentially political symbolism is no substitute to value adding to the alliance. Our troops—our men and women who serve in the defence forces—are universally regarded as playing above their weight. But, when you look at the political policy that is judged in the United States Department of Defense presentation to Congress each year, ‘Allied contributions to the common defence’, you see we are nowhere near playing to our weight, let alone above our weight. That document rates the contribution of allies according to a ratio. A ratio of 0.8 and 1.19 per cent indicates that a country’s contribution is roughly in balance with its ability to contribute. A ratio of 1.2 per cent or greater indicates a substantial contribution relative to a country’s ability to contribute. A ratio of below 0.8 per cent indicates a very low effort relative to the ability to contribute.</para>
<para>In the United States military’s assessment of our contribution, other than in one area we are rated as providing a very low effort to the alliance. For personnel, which includes all military personnel, our rating is 0.56; for ground combat capability we are rated at 0.33, less than half of a very low effort; for combat aircraft capability we are rated at 0.74; for naval supplies, tender and transport tonnage we are rated at 0.57; for transport aircraft capacity we are rated at 0.45; and for tanker aircraft fuel offload capacity we are rated at 0.38—again, less than a half of a very low contribution. Indeed, the only area where we achieved more than a very low effort was in the funding share of our overall defence commitment compared to gross domestic product, which was rated at 0.87, just above very low in the acceptable category.</para>
<para>My point is that, if you were picking a team for the alliance on the basis of its ability to contribute on the field, we would not be among those chosen; we would be left on the bench on the basis of our physical contribution to the alliance. We should not be compensating for our inability to contribute with physical resources by adopting a strategy where we make policy on the basis of how that policy will appear to the domestic political audience to satisfy the current United States administration. We should be focusing on where Australia’s strategic interests lie and, indeed, where the strategic interests of the alliance lie and where we can value add to that military contribution.</para>
<para>The answer obviously has to be in the South-East Asian region. That is where we have our geographic connection, our historic connection, our diplomatic connection and our closest military ties. It is an area where the interests of both our nation and the United States coincide. It is not hard to say to the United States: ‘Yes, we’re all involved in the war against terrorism, but where we can value add with the physical resources we provide and the expertise that we have available is in the South-East Asian region. That is where we both have extensive interests and that is where our neighbourhood is.’</para>
<para>The regrettable fact is that it is a very dangerous neighbourhood. The United States already have considerable resources not only through the military but through programs such as the Joint Interagency Task Force West, fighting the drug trade in the region, which finances terrorism. A range of resources are being put in there, a range of resources that we can value add to and that must be Australia’s strategic priority. The $1.2 billion that we have spent being involved in the war in Iraq is a massive opportunity cost: a cost that we have not been able to contribute to resources, that we have not been able to contribute to value adding where our mutual security interests lie with the United States—in fighting terrorism, drug smuggling and a range of illegal activities in our region.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I want to take the opportunity in this grievance debate today to address Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism generally. In doing so, I want to address not just the global challenge which free people and democratic nations face but also the local and regional challenge we face as Australians—that is, of course, in Indonesia. The global reality of Islamic fundamentalist driven terrorism has been with every person in every country for a little over four years. Although the signs were evident before 11 September 2001, the events of that day marked the end of a peace and the beginning of a new era of violence. Those attacks in New York and Washington DC certainly marked the beginning of a new conflict. In my first speech in this place, back in 2002, just a few months after those attacks, I reiterated the point that many experts had made well, which was that this conflict, unlike conventional war, was likely to last for a very long time indeed. Whereas previous generations had defended our free and democratic way of life in wars and battles between nations, today we must defend those democratic ideals against terrorists who are joined and bonded not by national borders but rather by fanatical beliefs that cut across borders.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Over the last four years we have seen the tragic work of terrorists not just in New York and Washington but in Madrid, in London and twice in Bali. We lost Australians in New York and London, a very high number in the first Bali bombing and more in the second bombing just a few short weeks ago. At our doorstep, both Bali bombings, a couple of years apart, illustrated two sobering and depressing facts for Australians—namely, that terrorism was not a distant threat but rather a reality in our region and that the war against it will not be won quickly. In August this year, as we commemorated the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, we could not help but reflect on the fact that this conflict with terror is a very new and different war from the Second World War. The war on terror will last much longer and be more complex than the Second World War, a monumental event which lasted six long and bloody years. The rise of terror groups in various locations and countries around the globe was evident prior to September 11, as I said. Indeed, the first bombing of the twin towers of the World Trade Centre occurred in 1993.</para>
<para>Whilst all Australians are painfully aware of the devastating bombings that have killed so many people—particularly in Bali, from an Australian perspective—what have not been as well known are the other day-to-day activities of Islamic fundamentalist terror groups engaged in the regular slaughter and murder of citizens in various parts of Indonesia. This was brought home recently in a timely contribution by my colleague the member for Wakefield, who joins me here in the House. He highlighted the recent beheading of three high school students in Poso, Indonesia. The three students were Christians, their brutal murder clearly perpetrated because of their faith. Those young victims join an estimated 8,000 or more who are thought to have been killed in a persecution purge of non-Muslims in Indonesia over recent years.</para>
<para>The member for Wakefield eloquently made the point that this awful, barbaric event—the beheading of three young students—appeared on page 15 of one of our national newspapers. I am not sure whether the other newspapers carried it at all. The point he made was its lack of prominence, and he rightly pointed out that we cannot allow this sort of barbarity to slide to the back of our newspapers if we are to hold those responsible to account, if we are to make a difference and if we are to progress in the struggle against Islamic fundamentalist intolerance that is the driver of terrorism not just in our region but all around the world. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, correctly pointed out that the Indonesian government and the Indonesian President strongly condemned those killings. It is true that the Indonesian government has taken great strides in recent years, and it deserves credit. But more needs to be done. Countries such as Australia have contributed in many ways to assist as well.</para>
<para>I take this opportunity to point out the contribution of those Australians who are working to make a difference in Indonesia. There are many unsung heroes who deserve our praise and this parliament’s recognition—men and women from around our country who have volunteered to go to Indonesia to help build a better life and provide better circumstances for those who are the victims of this sort of terrorism. Today I want to acknowledge and highlight one group of people, about whom I have spoken in this House before, who do so much for so many in very dangerous parts of Indonesia—the men and women associated with the Careforce church in the town of Mount Evelyn, which is in the heart of the Casey electorate. It is a church which has had a great deal to do with Indonesia. They know only too well the difficulties that have been present in Indonesia with Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism. Their commitment and their tangible involvement predates September 11. They have been working in the region for more than five years. Unfortunately, they are all too familiar with the tragic barbarity of events such as the dreadful deaths of those students, which the member for Wakefield has outlined.</para>
<para>The men and women associated with Careforce have witnessed these tragic events time and time again. They have seen extremists burn down buildings and villages and maim and murder people because they dare to pursue their own religion and refuse to yield to a murderous minority in Indonesia. In the face of this, the people of Careforce have continued with an unyielding passion and commitment to help others in a practical way because they know that if they fail they will let down the futures of those with whom they are working and living today.</para>
<para>Pastor Allan Meyer and all those involved in the church want to see an end to terrorism and see people live in peace and safety like the rest of us. But they also want to do something to help. And they have. Their tangible commitment over five years has resulted in land being purchased to provide homes and a livelihood to those who have suffered from acts of terror and religious extremism. Medical training is being provided to help those suffering needlessly. In northern Maluku a medical service is being established to help the poor. Drilling has been undertaken to obtain clean water. There is now a permanent clinic with mobile medical teams providing important care. In addition, Careforce cares for children who have been abused or neglected.</para>
<para>People in groups such as Careforce deserve recognition. Their resolve, their goodwill and the assistance they commit at great personal risk is a reminder to us that we need more than just the work done by nations and governments—as critical as that is. We also need the work done by committed individuals such as those from Careforce who demonstrate and personify the strength of our commitment to the principles of freedom, democracy and tolerance.</para>

<para>—All of us would prefer that we had no need to make laws of the kind contained in the <inline ref="R2469">Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline>. This bill is a response to the threat of terrorism. It is a responsible and measured strengthening of our capacity to perform the highest duty of any society: protecting the security and safety of its citizens.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We live in dangerous times. We are facing an assault on our free society from murderous totalitarians who, in the name of Islam—a religion they defile with their violence and intolerance—are determined to destroy us. We speak of a war against terror, but we know that truly this is no more a war against terror than the Second World War was a war against tanks or aeroplanes. Terror is the tool used by those totalitarians who not only seek to destroy Western society and our freedoms, but seek to overthrow the vast majority of governments of Islamic nations which do not conform to the extreme totalitarian ideology of the terrorists.</para>
<para>All of us have been horrified by the way in which young men and women born in the West have been brought into this terrorist campaign. One of the London bombers was a 20-year-old, cricket-loving son of a small businessman. How many of us would have fitted that description when we were 20? Yet he decided, or was persuaded, that his mission was to destroy his own life and that of many others.</para>
<para>It has already become obvious that there have been efforts to radicalise members of the second generation of Muslims living in Europe. Too many of the children of immigrants from North Africa and the Middle East, far from integrating with the host society—and seeing themselves as French, British or German—are being urged to adopt a pan-Islamic identity as a substitute for the national identity of the countries of which they are citizens.</para>
<para>The identities of all of us are made up of different elements—nationality, religion, cultural background and locality, to name just a few—but a cohesive and secure society cannot afford to allow those trying to subvert it to develop within that society a hostile minority which not only rejects any common identity with other citizens, but is so despising of the host society, our society, that it seeks to destroy it. There are people in our midst who promote hatred and who glorify terrorism and violence—both within and without our borders. Our greatest challenge is to stop these inciters of hatred from misguiding the young minds they seek to pervert to violence. And to do that we need strong laws, good intelligence and efficient police work; but above all we need the co-operation and support of our fellow Australians of Muslim faith. We must not forget that a key objective of the terrorists is to stir up resentment against Muslims, so that as they feel more alienated from the wider Australian society they are more vulnerable to the terrorists’ propaganda.</para>
<para>The only truly effective weapon against extreme totalitarian Islam is moderate Islam. Any Australians who respond to terrorism by demeaning or denouncing Muslims are reacting precisely in the way the terrorists intend them to. And that is why our defence against the terrorist threat must be conducted on many fronts. Swift action by police and intelligence agencies is vital and should be applauded, but so is the winning of hearts and minds. And in that regard, the leadership shown by the Prime Minister in engaging the Muslim community of Australia has been as important as his leadership in responding decisively to immediate threats of terrorist attack.</para>
<para>The Prime Minister met with leading members of the Muslim community on 26 August 2005 and a Muslim community reference group was subsequently formed, which could work with the Australian government, and with their respective community groups in creating communication and support networks that will promote understanding between the Muslim community and the wider Australian community. The obligation is upon all of us to promote communication, understanding and mutual support between the wider Australian community and the Muslim community—because it is the Muslim community that is most under threat from terrorism.</para>
<para>This bill effects several significant changes to our law. When we last considered it I confined my remarks, in the time I had available to me, to the provisions concerning sedition. Since then the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee has produced its report on this bill. That report was tabled only an hour or so ago. I note that the committee recommends that the sedition amendments be removed from the bill in their entirety and that the Law Reform Commission be tasked with conducting a public inquiry into the most appropriate legislative vehicle for addressing the issue of incitement to terrorism.</para>
<para>As you know, the Attorney-General has already undertaken that he will conduct a review of the sedition provisions next year. So the Senate committee contends that the government would be better conducting the review before any changes at all are made to the law on sedition. The government has in the time available, therefore, a choice between leaving the law on sedition in its current unsatisfactory state—unsatisfactory not least because a spotlight has now been shone on provisions that had generally been considered dead—and having a thorough inquiry into the best way to proscribe incitement to terrorism before passing new laws, or on the other hand, passing the amendments in this bill, which, as I said previously, arguably improve the law, and certainly make it no worse, and then reviewing it all in the New Year. This is essentially a practical question for the Attorney-General to determine. The course of action recommended by the Senate has much to commend it, but, as I said when parliament last sat, I am content to support the bill in its current form on the basis that there will be a review of the law on sedition in the New Year. I do not resile from that commitment.</para>
<para>The most important provisions of this bill, however, are the introduction of control orders and preventative detention. These provisions bring about a significant change to our criminal justice system because they enable persons to be detained where there is insufficient evidence to bring a criminal charge. All governments, and the vast majority of Australians, while recognising the significance of these innovations, accept that the threat of terror calls for a strong response.</para>
<para>The control order provisions enable a court to impose, at the request of the Australian Federal Police, restrictions on the movement and conduct of a person in circumstances where the court is satisfied that making the order would substantially assist in preventing a terrorist act or where the person concerned has provided training to, or received training from, a listed terrorist organisation.</para>
<para>The court is obliged to satisfy itself that the restrictions are appropriate and necessary for the purpose of protecting the public. In forming that view, it must take into account the effect of the prohibitions on the person’s financial and personal circumstances. The court’s order is appealable in the usual way. Applications may be made to revoke it or vary it at any time.</para>
<para>Preventative detention works somewhat differently. In that case, a person may be detained for a short period to prevent an imminent terrorist act occurring or to preserve evidence of a recent terrorist act. A senior AFP officer may, if he or she suspects a person will be or has been engaged in terrorist activity, detain that person for 24 hours only. An additional period of 24 hours can be obtained from a judge, former judge or magistrate.</para>
<para>Such orders are subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and, of course, judicial review by the Federal Court and High Court in their original jurisdictions. An officer independent of the investigation has to monitor the person in detention, report on their situation and treatment and receive representations from them. In each case, if one accepts that control orders and preventative detention are necessary additions to our counter-terrorist capacity—as I believe all of us in this House do—it must be recognised that the bill provides a high level of accountability, review and oversight, including by parliament.</para>

<para>—The opposition support the passing of the <inline ref="R2469">Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline>, with appropriate amendments. Our desire for appropriate amendments is strengthened by the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, to which the former speaker, the member for Wentworth, just referred. That report was tabled an hour or so ago. It made some 52 recommendations, including—as was indicated in the former contribution—the removal of schedule 7, which related to the sedition offences, and called for a review of that area of the law to be conducted by the Australian Law Reform Commission.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>That recommendation in particular—indeed, the 52 recommendations, on my necessarily brief perusal of them—would appear to be commonsense and balanced. The recommendations go to a number of issues, including greater particularity of the basis of orders under the legislation, which obviously refers to the issue of procedural fairness, and in some cases tightening of the principles upon which orders will be given or made under the legislation. The recommendations also include the safeguarding of videotaping of any questioning period, greater access to legal advisers, and a requirement for the Attorney-General to report on Commonwealth preventative detention orders on a six-monthly basis. The committee also recommended that the legislation have a five-year sunset clause. All of these recommendations would appear to us to be sensible, particularly the ones going to greater oversight by the Ombudsman and to the development of protocols through the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and the Ombudsman for the conditions under which people may be detained under the regime.</para>
<para>In the short time available to it, the committee—once again in the area of national security—has clearly done a commendable job, as indeed has been the contribution of a number of Australians who give their evidence, often highly expert evidence, before these inquiries without cost to the Commonwealth. A number of Australians feel very strongly about this legislation. It is appropriate that there be a thorough analysis and scrutiny of legislation of this kind.</para>
<para>It is necessary to balance the need for stronger powers in the fight against terrorism. When we speak of the ‘war against terrorism’ we have to be realistic about whether or not that is an appropriate phrase. It is not ‘war’ in the classic sense of aircraft carriers, fighter planes, tanks and so forth. It is necessarily—when we are talking about our region in particular—a detailed, forensic policing. It is essentially a criminal law enforcement exercise and, of necessity, you have to look at giving your law enforcement officers appropriate powers in dealing with that. It is not only appropriate but absolutely essential that the appropriate balance is struck.</para>
<para>It is frequently said that, if we do not have that appropriate balance, we are giving a victory to terrorists in terms of our undermining the safeguards and systems that we so cherish and that have been developed over 800 years. It is often said that terrorists can certainly kill and maim but only by our response to terrorism can we undermine those institutions of government, democracy and freedom that we all treasure so dearly. So it is vitally important that our response is balanced.</para>
<para>In that context, introducing laws of this nature—as the previous speaker said, in what I thought was a very sound and worthwhile contribution—overturns principles of justice under our common law and criminal code system where there is a presumption of innocence—that is, you do not have your personal freedom limited or restricted; you have a right to be left alone unless, by your actions, you infringe the law of the land. This legislation will apply at an earlier point than a point where it is determined that someone has committed a crime.</para>
<para>It is significant, and it is appropriate and necessary that safeguards are in place for that to occur. The opposition regrettably accept the necessity for laws of this nature in order to have appropriate safeguards, but in a balanced and sensible way we call on the government to look at the recommendations of the Senate committee, to which I have referred. Experience has shown that a local terrorist event may have subterranean roots that cross international borders, which means that to get to the bottom of that terrorist event it will be necessary to liaise with, and obtain the cooperation of, not only state and federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies but also the equivalent agencies overseas. That, of course, takes time.</para>
<para>It is also important to realise that, as with the London bombings, the immediate bombing may be only part of the story; there may be other actions planned by the terrorists which make it essential to find out who were the perpetrators of the bombing, with a view to preventing further attacks. In that context it would be foolhardy to ignore the advice of law enforcement authorities, including British law enforcement authorities, which have spoken of the need for these powers, particularly the detention orders and the control orders. Clearly, when you are dealing with a suicide bomber there is a need to undertake very time consuming forensic examination of not only the explosive device but also, obviously and distastefully, human tissue, with a view to identifying the bomber and thereby having a base upon which to track down any accomplices. I think the Attorney-General has said previously that it may be necessary to review thousands of hours of video footage, as was the case with the London bombings. All these tests—the forensic testing, the viewing of video footage and other inquiries—obviously take time, but time is of the essence in getting to the bottom of who the perpetrators were to prevent further events occurring. In that context control orders for people who are involved in terrorist activities, or there is a reasonable basis on which to suspect them, is justified but, again, only with appropriate safeguards.</para>
<para>When dealing with terrorists who in many cases are so fanatical that they are prepared to sacrifice their own lives for their perceived cause, it is important to realise that they are not amenable to the constraints of the normal criminal justice system. The constraints that would normally apply to a criminal who is released on bail pending a final hearing may not be, and probably would not be, a disincentive to someone intent on taking their own life. Hence, from the point of view of community safety, it may be necessary to restrain that person. Just as it is important that those advocating the need for these laws do not overstate their case and do not have what the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee have referred to on occasions as legislative overreach, it is equally important that those who oppose laws of this nature, and I can understand their concern, do not bury their heads in the sands of those who are providing the advice. Not that we should legislate in this area on the basis of opinion polls but I think some 70 per cent of Australians saw a need for tougher laws when it came to security, particularly laws that may be necessary to prevent a ticking-bomb situation from occurring. Someone who advises that 70 per cent of Australians, in the light of the expert advice, that laws are not necessary is deluding himself. It is very easy at the pointy end of an aircraft, where we have the privilege of flying at taxpayer expense, to liaise with the intelligentsia and the intellectual elite, but it is a much different story if you are catching a peak-hour train to work every morning or your child is on a train to school every morning which could very easily be the target of a terrorist event. So there needs to be balance and perspective in the equation.</para>
<para>Labor’s approach to antiterrorist legislation over the years since September 11 can be summarised in a line: it is to ensure appropriate judicial oversight of otherwise unrestrained executive action. That has been our goal and that is why we have amended legislation to bring in that judicial oversight of otherwise unrestrained executive action. We have all seen what can happen when there is opportunity for unrestrained action. We saw that in respect of a recent report on the conduct of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. The current Attorney-General was the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs when a lot of those events occurred. I am not necessarily damning the current Attorney-General, but we do not want these sorts of coercive powers of detention to deprive people of liberties exercised by one person, the Attorney-General—or anyone else for that matter—without appropriate oversight and appropriate safeguards and procedural fairness. Again, we call on the Attorney-General to have regard to the very sound recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee.</para>
<para>We note that the legislation has gone through a number of drafts and we are probably up to about version 64, so it is a much better set of laws than that originally created following the first Council of Australian Governments meeting on this issue. Nonetheless, there is room for improvement and we call on the government to address that. But we say that no-one should be deluded that laws in themselves, written in ink on white paper, are going to protect us from terrorism.</para>
<para>I note that part of the package grants greater powers in regard to tracking those who finance terrorism. In that context, this parliament has already passed laws that give the government the power to track the assets of terrorist organisations. My research indicates that in the order of $2,700 has been frozen. Those were funds relating to, I think, a Sikh youth organisation which had been shown to have had terrorist connections. There was another organisation that had its assets frozen. I think it was called the Shining Path organisation, which proved to be a record store in Melbourne, and those assets were quickly unfrozen. My point is this: those quite severe powers of freezing assets are there, but they have not been acted on by the government. You can have all the powers in the world, but if they are not acted upon with determination and proper resourcing of our agencies then they are all but meaningless.</para>
<para>In that context a point I wanted to make in this debate was that clearly, under this legislation, the Australian Federal Police in particular will be given extensive powers and an extensive role in the fight against terrorism. Indeed, in June this year, in addressing the Australian Federal Police at their training village in Canberra, the Prime Minister said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... the Federal Police has had demands placed on it, which go beyond the demands I think, that have been placed on an organisation in terms of change than any that I’ve seen at a federal level.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In fact, since September 11, over 600 Australian Federal Police employees have been diverted to counter-terrorism and related functions of a national security aspect. This includes approximately 400 to the International Deployment Group, about 66 to the counter-terrorism teams, approximately 15 to offshore counter-terrorism teams and at least 25 to the counter-terrorism intelligence portfolio and other intelligence functions. But it has put an enormous pressure on the overall activities of the Australian Federal Police force. We still expect them to undertake control activities; indeed we still expect them to undertake the policing function of the Australian Capital Territory. But these additional responsibilities have not been associated with any significant increase in the number of police officers. Indeed the staffing level of the Australian Federal Police force is roughly equivalent to what it was 20 years ago.</para>
<para>It is unacceptable that the government still has not appreciated the significance of the Australian Federal Police in the fight against terrorism. We have seen the tremendous work that they have undertaken in the Solomon Islands restoring law and order to that country to prevent a situation where the country otherwise most certainly would have become a failed state and a potential haven for terrorism. But the government has not undertaken anything akin to the planning that we have seen in the defence forces—for instance, the defence white paper on the development of the defence capability plan—for the Australian Federal Police. There has been a complete absence of analysis of the counter-terrorism value of resources spent on the Australian Federal Police. We believe that is an issue that needs to be addressed.</para>
<para>There are also a number of other areas where the government must introduce practical measures in the fight against terrorism, and they are set out in the second reading amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. For my own part, there is a particular concern that I have as a result of some experiences as shadow minister in the security portfolios, and that is with regard to rail security. We have seen measures, albeit we have criticised a lack of adequate measures with regard to airport security. I think our concerns have been borne out in a recent report by Sir John Wheeler. We have seen some measures relating to port security, although not enough, we believe, particularly as the government is still encouraging foreign seafarers around our shores rather than having Australian eyes and ears around our coastline.</para>
<para>But with respect to rail security there has been, at all levels of government, a disgraceful lack of attention. It is, quite frankly, at all levels of government, not good enough. By way of example, if the government had spent the money it has spent on the industrial relations advertising campaign, we would have seen the equivalent—at a cost of $90,000 per dog team and handler—of around 600 additional teams being used on our railway systems. These are practical measures on which the government has to show national leadership. It is not sufficient to say that it is tough on terrorism if it does not address these practical measures. The opposition is calling on the Australian people to focus on these measures in terms of requiring the Australian government to act on them, and not to be misled into thinking that legislation in itself is going to be a safeguard. It requires resourcing; it requires a deliberation and a determination to address these practical measures.</para>

<para>—Given the two attacks in Bali, the attacks in the United States of America, London and Madrid and the aborted plots against Australian interests in Singapore and Australia, it would be highly irresponsible for the Australian government to ignore the risk of a serious attempt by terrorists to attack Australians on home territory. The aim of terror attacks is to invoke general panic. That is exactly what terrorists wish to do. Their hatred of our system of government knows no bounds. These are not random acts but deliberate, premeditated criminal acts. It is sobering to reflect on the almost 100 Australians killed in the two attacks in Bali, not to mention those injured, who will carry the reminder of these cowardly attacks for the rest of their lives.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The <inline ref="R2469">Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline> seeks to amend the Criminal Code Act 1995 to widen its scope and give the Australian Federal Police and other government agencies unprecedented powers. The need for such a bill gives no comfort to any Australian, accustomed as we are to living in an environment that is tolerant and multicultural and, comparatively speaking, has few manifestations of real poverty. Like many of my constituents, though, I feel uneasy about the passage of such a bill, but I understand the necessity for the government’s endeavours to balance the safety and security of citizens against some restrictions on our accustomed freedoms. Nevertheless, such a worrying time requires cool heads and a commitment to use only such laws as are absolutely necessary to protect human lives and critical infrastructure.</para>
<para>The new legislation requires us to take particular care in how we deal with issues concerning children and minors. I have sought reassurance from the Attorney-General that, in the case of raids on homes of suspects, protocols will be observed to protect innocent children. I was pleased to see something about this—although I only managed to get this off the web just before coming into the chamber—in the recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which inquired into the bill. Recommendation 3 sets out some changes with regard to minors and how we treat minors when they are arrested. I am pleased to see those changes.</para>
<para>Some of the concerns expressed by the public relate to control orders and preventative detention, restrictions on access to family and legal representation, and revised sedition offences. I acknowledge the work that has been done by the backbench committee in an endeavour to address these issues and to ensure that there is adequate oversight of those agencies with the responsibility to administer the new law. In addition, I again welcome the recommendations of the Senate inquiry, particularly recommendation 27 on sedition. That recommendation is to abolish that section, and a further recommendation is that there be, I think, a Law Council inquiry into that particular provision.</para>
<para>The one thing we should not do in dealing with new threats is to allow any retreat from strict adherence to democratic principles, including—and in particular—the rule of law and respect for individual members of our community. Of course, black-letter law will not of itself prevent terrorist attacks on our own soil for, as our security agencies have foreshadowed, it is the quality of intelligence that will allow legislation to be effective in protecting Australians against terrorist attacks. The combination of intelligence and legal mechanisms was successful, I believe, in preventing an attack on the Australian Embassy in Singapore.</para>
<para>In seeking to defend our liberties, we are discharging a sacred responsibility to rein in those people whose notions of justice reside only in unrestrained violence and destruction. To suggest, as some have, that this bill is a political stunt is to deny the facts. The 2004-05 ASIO report assessing the risk to domestic interests of a terrorism attack makes sobering reading. We are fortunate to live in a strong democratic polity with checks and balances that include a high level of public scrutiny and accountability. As in the past, if there were to be abuses of this legislation it would soon create a public outcry for legislative change.</para>
<para>To defend is to erect barricades. That is what our system of laws and statutes is for, yet those laws and statutes are not immutable. We must be prepared to raise the barricades or lower them as circumstances demand, accepting always that they should never be higher than absolutely necessary. To change the metaphor, democracy is a rich banquet and to remove a morsel and nothing more from the table on sound advice from the kitchen should not be cause for alarm. Certainly, it is peevish, not to say ridiculous, for those opposing to cry havoc as if the tablecloth had been stolen as well as all the silver. It is all too convenient to hurl political slogans and avoid responsibility for tough decisions. In such uncertain times this legislation is necessary. That is not to gainsay that there may yet be need for revision and changes. The fact is that we are part of an open and accountable system, including an active fourth estate that will ensure the public interest is ultimately served. That liberty is not just an individual principle but one which embraces the whole of society and its security was amply expressed by John Stuart Mill in his famous essay, ‘On Liberty’. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The principle is that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty or action of any of their number is self-protection. That is the only purpose for which power can be rightly exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">If these are thoughtful times for a coalition government, one can well understand—though hardly sympathise—that they are agonising times for a Labor opposition. The sunny uplands of peace, as apprehended by that great democrat, Churchill, are the golden place which we yearn to inhabit—the place where saints and visionaries, eccentrics and even crackpots may preach unmolested on any street corner. But where society lives in ever-present peril, where buildings, bridges and harbours require minute by minute protection, where embassies and Australian tourists are under daily threat and where Australians are wantonly slaughtered, we need to make no apology for raising the barricades. That is precisely what this bill does: it raises the barricades at a time when they need to be raised to protect Australian citizens and Australian interests on Australian soil.</para>
<para>This legislation has not been entered into lightly. There have been, as my colleague the member for Barton said, a number of gyrations of this legislation—something in excess of 60 drafts. This has been done in consultation with appropriate state and territory ministers and premiers. That is the correct way to proceed in a matter that, as I said, gives such unprecedented powers to our agencies. It has now been before a Senate committee. That Senate committee, I believe from the quick reading that I have made of its recommendations, has listened to the views of a number of people and has made some very sensible recommendations. I believe applying a five-year sunset clause—shortening it from the proposed 10 years—is sensible with a review. Sometimes we have to erect barriers by way of legislation, but our laws are not immutable and we need to constantly look at the appropriateness of the laws we pass in this place and make the necessary changes. I think calling for a review is an excellent recommendation.</para>
<para>One of the key issues of contention has concerned the proposed changes to sedition laws, and the committee’s report makes some strong recommendations with regard to that—namely, that this clause be struck from the legislation. In the event that the government is not prepared to strike that from the legislation, the report—if I read this correctly in the short time I had it—recommends a number of changes be made. So in essence I support this bill. I think it is the action of a responsible government. I support it but hope that the government will take into account the sensible recommendations made by the Senate committee.</para>

<para>—The whole process of bringing the <inline ref="R2469">Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline> into the House is an example of bad law making. The bill allows terrorism to violate our hard-won and fragile freedoms and allows covert government action at the expense of open and independent review of the truth. The bill seriously invades privacy through control orders, preventative detention, surveillance, warrant-free information demands and compulsory reporting of all financial transactions—notwithstanding the recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which I have had about as much time as everybody else, about an hour, to have any sort of a look at.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The bill as it stands—and that is the important thing; we are debating it as it stands—undermines the right to liberty and the rule of law. It abandons notions of justice and procedural fairness that are so essential to any open and free society. It subverts the Australian Constitution’s most fundamental purpose of ensuring separation of powers. It hides government actions relating to human rights from the public gaze and buries accountability. This is one of two significant human rights bills now before the parliament, IR being the other, and the contempt the government has shown for due parliamentary process and good law making astounds me—I wrote in my notes ‘astounds me’ but perhaps I am not that surprised.</para>
<para>Why were these laws so critical that they were going to be rammed through the parliament within a day? Only Jon Stanhope’s placing of the bill on the net triggered any semblance of proper process. Why did debate start without the benefit of a completed <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline>, which was not available until a week after the last sitting—something that was hardly surprising given the complexity of the legislation? Why did members make contributions to the debate several weeks ago when they had not considered the findings of the rushed Senate inquiry first? These findings were only tabled this afternoon, and incidentally they pick up on some but not all of the concerns I outline here. Why was this legislation drafted before the completion of the legislative review of our existing antiterror laws in the new year?</para>
<para>It is a disgrace that those who would question this legislation should be labelled as less than solid on national security, given the process by which this has been delivered to the people’s house. No parliamentary representative should surrender scrutiny of and debate on any legislation, particularly this legislation, to a blind trust in executive government—especially a government that has already politicised and abused the operation of the armed forces, the police and ASIO in the tragedy of SIEVX, the shame of <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> and the obscene ‘children overboard’ claims. This is a government that already holds innocent people in detention centres for the crime of seeking safety and refuge from other repressive regimes and indeed deprives the liberty of others for years at a time due to departmental mistakes. It is a government that deports a non-violent peace activist as a threat to national security and goes to war on the basis of spurious and false intelligence.</para>
<para>Might I remind the House of the thorough scrutiny of and debate on similar legislation in the British House of Commons. Britain is a country well versed in terrorism and its consequences, yet it is prepared to have lengthy debate and scrutiny and see all sides of that parliament expressing their opinion and their vote with absolute freedom. Of course we need laws to protect Australia from terrorism, and Australia already has some 27 pieces of antiterrorism legislation, with existing ASIO legislation already deemed to be amongst the most comprehensive in the world. There has been no demonstrated need or any thoughtful argument put forward to say why these provisions in this bill are needed or why existing laws are insufficient, save for unsubstantiated assertions by the Attorney-General. Let me quote from Hugh White in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 10 November:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">If we keep seeing each new attack—and each claim of a planned attack—as a new threat requiring a new response, we will never regain our equilibrium in the face of a threat which—for the time being, at least—we must live with.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">These sorts of laws would not have stopped the UK bombings, with the perpetrators well under the radar of security and police forces, and the recent operation and arrests in Australia were carried out under existing laws. How do these laws contribute to people’s safety and the protection of their freedoms—freedoms we have fought legitimate wars to defend? I say ‘legitimate’ because I am firmly convinced the terror threat we and our Anglo allies face is largely due to our involvement in an illegitimate war in Iraq.</para>
<para>I well appreciate the need for laws to protect Australia from terrorist attack but, without checks and balances under the law and without express referral to human rights, these laws contain provisions that in other times and places have allowed very grave transgressions indeed. This bill criminalises conduct and expressions that, while perhaps being distasteful or unacceptable, need not be directed at anyone in particular or contain any intention to actually cause violence. Under schedule 1 of the bill, an organisation that ‘indirectly counsels’, ‘provides instruction on’ or ‘directly praises the doing of a terrorist act’ is advocating the doing of an act. Such an organisation or group may be proscribed as a terrorist organisation, whether or not an act has occurred or will occur. This is even if the organisation has no other involvement in terrorism, if the person who did the praising did not intend to cause any terrorism and if there is no connection to any actual offence.</para>
<para>Closely related to this sweeping terrorism offence are the obnoxious provisions of schedule 7, under the appropriately archaic heading of ‘Treason and sedition’. You can be imprisoned for seven years if you urge another person to assist by any means whatever an organisation or country either at war or engaged in hostilities with the Commonwealth, whether war has been declared or not. While this does not include assistance of a humanitarian nature, the question must be asked: are we also now going to be selective about what constitutes an insurgency or a justified civil war or whether players in it are terrorists or freedom fighters? Do we judge Chechnya by the same values as we did East Timor? The selectivity of some Western nations around such issues is the reason for the resentment leading, at the extremes, to murderous hatred of much Western foreign policy.</para>
<para>The defences for good faith are largely political in nature and do not specifically protect statements made in good faith for academic, artistic, scientific, religious, journalistic or public interest purposes. The most important measures of a truly free society include its tolerance of free speech. Truly free societies should allow opinions to be aired and judged by the court of public opinion. We legislate to restrict free speech at the risk of sliding towards an Orwellian world of newspeak. The more we restrict freedom of speech, the more we run the risk that offensive or objectionable opinion will be driven underground where it cannot be aired and answered and in fact may be magnified and radicalised. I will support any moves to excise sedition provisions from this bill.</para>
<para>Schedule 4 allows a federal Family Court or federal Magistrates Court to authorise the police to restrict a person’s freedom in virtually any way possible based on the balance of probabilities that it would substantially ‘assist in preventing a terrorist attack’ or that ‘the person has provided training to, or received training from, a listed terrorist organisation’. The organisation need not have been illegal at the time and the training need not be for violent or illegal purposes, so a court may authorise where the person must be and when, to whom the person may speak or with whom the person may associate, or order that person to wear a tracking device for up to a year and, conceivably, on a rolling basis for up to 10 years—all of this without charge and without judicial oversight. This is done on the advice of the police without the need for specific evidence, without a full and fair trial or finding of guilt of any crime. There is no guarantee that the statement of facts provided when seeking consent from the Attorney-General will include any intelligence on which the order may be based or that any such intelligence would be passed on to the court, let alone be tested as evidence. While the subject may apply to the court to revoke the order at any time after the order has been served, the fact that these orders do not have to relate directly to an intent or act of a particular person renders this so-called judicial review somewhat spurious.</para>
<para>Here we have punitive control orders that may include conditions as onerous as those applied to people who have been tried or convicted of a crime, based on speculation of future conduct or based on actions that may have been legal at the time. Not only this but these orders are brought because there is not the evidence to allow the charging of a criminal offence, nor is there any requirement that charges would follow. Where is justice and due process in this? In my research I have not found a shred of cogent argument about how these provisions could ‘substantially assist in preventing a terrorist attack’, and this leaves me deeply concerned about these provisions.</para>
<para>Under preventative detention orders we again have a judge or member of the AAT acting in their ‘personal capacity’ authorising a person as young as 16 to be imprisoned for 48 hours and then for up to two weeks under state law without being charged—let alone being found guilty—of any crime. This imprisonment may be in a jail or remand centre with people convicted of a crime, presumably under maximum security and/or in solitary confinement. The grounds for authorising this preventative detention order are serious. There must be belief the person ‘will engage in’ or ‘has done an act in preparation for ... a terrorist act’ or ‘possesses a thing ... connected with the preparation for, or the engagement of a person in, a terrorist act’. That act must be ‘imminent’ and expected to occur within 14 days. Alternatively the detention may be necessary to preserve evidence of ‘a terrorist act [that] has occurred in the last 28 days’.</para>
<para>While the facts and other grounds for detention must be considered by the issuing authority, a judge looking at such an application has absolutely no way of testing the accuracy of those grounds, and any decision made to detain someone will be made on probabilities and possibilities. It is the basis of our legal system to be protected from arbitrary imprisonment by either the judiciary or the executive—</para>

<para>—but it pushes the bounds further, as the member for Kennedy so rightly points out. Detention is carried out in secret. There is no true answerability for those unjustly detained. The person detained or their lawyer is only given information about the fact of the preventative detention order; they are not told the reasons that they are in custody—in fact, they are not even aware of the initial detention order until they have been picked up. There is not even a requirement for charges to follow such detention.</para>

<para>We have the absurd idea that the person can contact one family member or an employer or business partner for the sole purpose of telling them they are safe but not contactable for the time being. However, if aged between 16 and 18 or ‘incapable of managing their affairs’, they may contact both parents and may be visited by another person for a minimum of two hours a day. They may contact a lawyer. But if a prohibited contact order applies to any of these people they may not contact them. However, they are not told if a prohibited contact order exists.</para>
<para>If any of these people discloses the detention order to another: five years jail. If a third person, such as a journalist, discloses the order: five years jail. They or their representative may make representations to overseeing senior AFP members but only about the exercise of that power and their actual treatment, not about the validity of the detention in the first place. They may complain to the Commonwealth Ombudsman about the order itself or of treatment by the AFP, but after the whole thing is over. Of course, if a court cannot access the intelligence behind the orders and detention, they are hamstrung in determining whether, on the balance of probabilities, such an action has substantially assisted in the policing work.</para>
<para>Further, the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act is explicitly excluded, which means the Attorney-General is not answerable for giving permission for this whole process to begin, and it removes a person’s entitlement to receive any statement of the reasons for the decision to detain them. Without the protection of what is accepted to be full judicial oversight, or the ability to test accusations in a fair and independent court of law before punishment is meted out, these laws have serious potential to dismantle our only protection from arbitrary punishment or detention—from abuse of human rights. The sad and, I acknowledge, understandable fact is that all this seems to be acceptable to the majority of a frightened electorate.</para>
<para>Despite all this there is no mention of this parliament reviewing any provisions in the bill. The bill records that COAG—that de facto governmental process which has largely usurped parliamentary scrutiny—has agreed to review some of the provisions after five years. COAG then prepares a report and, if a copy of the report is given to the Attorney-General, it must be tabled within 15 sitting days. There is no mention in the bill of any review of the other amendments, including the unacceptable schedule 7, Treason and sedition. There should be a full review of this bill by this parliament three years after it becomes law, as is the case with the ASIO legislation.</para>
<para>Further, the so-called sunset provisions do not repeal this legislation. They determine that control, preventative detention or prohibited contact orders cease to be in force 10 years after those provisions become law and that any of those orders cannot be applied for or made after that time. There is no sunset clause relating to schedule 7, Treason and sedition. This means in 10 years those sleeping powers will remain on statute where any future government can simply repeal the three sunset provisions to bring them back into operation. There should at least be an automatic repealing of the bill, properly amended, under a true sunset clause in five years so any continuation of these provisions are first evaluated, debated and refined.</para>
<para>The war on terror is a catch-all phrase to rebadge a determination free countries have had, since their freedom was established or won, to root out criminals who would seek to cause death, injury or mayhem. We should never allow it to become an excuse for an attack on the individual’s right to personal liberty in peacetime. Without an express referral to the protection of individual rights under international law we risk dismantling our framework of justice that protects us from the arbitrary actions of the executive. As many have asked, do we ramp up these laws time and time again, thus eroding the very freedoms we hold up as essential virtues of our way of life?</para>
<para>In the last minute or so I want to comment on the recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee—and I pay tribute to Senator Payne and her colleagues for the work they have done in a very, very short time with something like 300 submissions. The very fact that there are 52 suggested amendments to this bill suggests to me the legislation has been sorely ill prepared and demands substantial amendment, as this document illustrates. The recommendations surround detention orders, the reporting process, the review process, the five-year sunset recommendation and the sedition laws. I am pleased to see a more substantial role recommended for HREOC and the Ombudsman. I note recommendation 10:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that the Bill be amended to require the Minister—in consultation with HREOC, the Ombudsman and the Inspector-General for Intelligence and Security—to develop a Protocol governing the minimum conditions of detention and standards of treatment applicable to any person who is the subject of a preventative detention order.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The recommendations are on the right track. They certainly need to be examined far more closely than we in this place have had an opportunity to. The fact that this legislation was earmarked for a one-day debate and to be rammed through parliament in no time at all is an absolute indictment of the government. If that was going to be its course of action, it could then have been fairly accused of utilising that urgency to ramp up concern in the community to an unwarranted degree.</para>
<para>I leave it on this note: why do we now have this process that has extended it? I would suggest only because the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory jumped rank on his colleagues in COAG and put the draft bill on the web for all to see. And, after all, if all of us are to be impacted by this legislation, it was incumbent on any government to make sure that the public knew exactly what those draft provisions were, not to pretend that it was already an outdated version and not to pay any attention to it and that Mr Stanhope had somehow been duped. I know he has been ignored ever since he did it by the Prime Minister. Why do we not have the proper scrutiny? Why do we not have a proper debate and a proper inquiry into legislation that is probably the most monumental, perhaps since wartime, to hit this parliament? The government should, as a basic move, look seriously at these 52 recommendations. I cannot support the bill at this point until such attention is paid to those recommendations and the concerns I have outlined.</para>

<para>—I rise this evening to speak in support of the <inline ref="R2469">Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline>. This bill will strengthen Australia’s counter-terrorism laws and the capacity of Australian government security agencies to respond to any terror threat. The world we live in is a changed world. Much has happened since September 11, 2001 that has seen governments examine current legislation and protective measures and evaluate them in today’s environment. This is exactly what this legislation is all about. It is about adapting our security measures to meet the needs of this changing environment and ensuring that as a government we are there to protect Australian citizens to the best of our ability and resources.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The main features of this bill are: amendments to the existing offences in the Criminal Code to clarify that it is not necessary to identify a particular terrorist act, an extension of the definition of a terrorist organisation to cover organisations that advocate terrorism, a new regime to allow for control orders that will allow for the overt close monitoring of terrorist suspects who pose a risk to the community, a new police preventative detention regime that will allow detention of a person without charge where it is reasonably necessary to prevent a terrorist act or to preserve evidence of such an act, updated sedition offences to cover those who urge violence against Australia and its people, and strengthened offences of financing of terrorism by better coverage of the collection of funds for terrorist activity. There is also a new regime of stop, question, search and seize powers that will be exercisable at airports and other Commonwealth places to prevent or respond to terrorism. We also have amendments to authorise access to airline passenger information for law enforcement and intelligence agencies and to create a legal basis for the use of video surveillance at Australia’s major airports and on aircraft.</para>
<para>Many issues about this legislation have been raised right across the spectrum of Australian society, including in my electorate of Riverina. But I can assure the House, as I have assured people in the Riverina, that every concern and every conceivable problem that I have heard raised, whether it has been by the media or by my constituents or people outside my constituency who have contacted me, has been raised in the committee that I was involved with that looked at this legislation. I can assure the House that every single concern has been raised, discussed and addressed by members of the Attorney-General, justice and customs committee. It is one of the very few times that I have seen the committee process actually act to respect all aspects and points of view. I congratulate the chairman and all members of the committee for enabling every single person, no matter how small their concern was and no matter how uninformed their concern was, to speak. I congratulate the chairman for accommodating the many members who had all those questions and issues that were coming from their electorates. It was one of those committees that worked in the most appropriate way. Quite typically, it needed to because this is a major issue for the Australian people.</para>
<para>This legislation will not impinge upon civil liberties. The legislation has been placed under a great deal of scrutiny. Indeed, across Australia there could be no more civil libertarian members than the members of this committee who were given the task of reviewing this legislation. And review it they did, with many changes being made to enhance this bill to make this a better piece of legislation. The debate within the committee included the concern that Australians will lose some freedoms. It is my view, after the extensive consultation, the extensive debate and the thorough examination by the committee of the issues that were raised by committee members and others during this consultative phase, that I would much rather be taking criticism now for the legislation that we currently see before us than taking criticism later should there be a loss of any precious Australian life in a terrorist attack simply because we as a government were not able to or were not in a position to act on information that was provided to us and our law enforcement agencies.</para>
<para>The sedition laws are designed to make it illegal to urge or encourage a terrorist act. It is not about restricting public speech. It is not about restricting criticism of the government. I have heard countless representations about civil liberties and I know, as I said before, that there has not been one thing raised with me that was not raised within that committee room and addressed. The one thing that I give thanks for is that there was the capacity and intellectual aptitude within that committee to be able to address the concerns and to ensure that we left no stone unturned. The sedition laws are not about restricting public speech or restricting criticism of governments. Since the beginning of time, governments of all persuasions, members of those governments and members of oppositions have come under scrutiny from the community and people have been able to openly discuss issues concerning government members, prime ministers and ministers. You have only to look at such things as <inline font-style="italic">How Green Was My Cactus</inline>, which regularly sends up the government and other areas. This has been allowed to take place only in Australia. This piece of legislation has nothing to do with restricting freedom of speech or criticism.</para>

<para>—However, there is an intention to use every justifiable means to protect Australians, and nobody should criticise the government for wanting to put in place the best possible legislation to ensure the best possible protection for all Australians and to prevent people from flouting the laws. Just days after the Bali bombing of October 2002, I rose in this House to pay tribute to three young men from the Riverina who lost their lives in that terrible attack. The days, weeks and months following the attack were a tragic time as I attempted—without any understanding of how those parents felt, might I add—to assist and provide comfort where I could to the families of these young men. The pain for these families continues each and every day, and every day of court trials and media publicity around the event brings pain. I recall one particularly dear family in my life who lost their son; the pain has to be intolerable. I do not ever want to be in a position where I am standing in this House reading another eulogy or calling out the name of another person whose life has been taken by a terrorist attack if I was responsible for not having put in place legislation whereby somebody could have been questioned or apprehended and a catastrophic incident prevented.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>During a recent parliamentary delegation to Singapore, members of the group representing the Australian parliament met with some of the Australian survivors of the most recent terrorist attack in Bali. These things bring about a clear recognition of the need to strengthen our laws to ensure that we can bring people swiftly to justice should any attack occur on Australian soil. These events have had an impact on me personally and I know they have had an impact on many members of parliament. They have also had an impact on my community in the Riverina as well as on all Australians. I hope that we do not experience these events again, most particularly not on Australian soil.</para>
<para>I would like to look at the positive points of the legislation. I recognise that, in order to keep Australians as safe as possible, governments have to take leadership and leave no stone unturned. This government has responded at great length to the changing environment in which we now live. It has been changed forever since the events of September 2001 and October 2002, when the unfortunate losses caused us to realise that we were not immune from terrorism. This government acknowledges that it is important that the protection of the community from terrorism must be balanced against the rights of the individual. Again, I assert that great care has been taken to ensure that this balance has been reached. The legislation has been developed in line with Australia’s international human rights obligations as well as the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. The importance of national security has been considered together with the protection of human rights.</para>
<para>A number of safeguards have been put in place under this new legislation, including preventative detention. I am comfortable with preventative detention and I believe there will be no abuses of the legislation. An extension of detention beyond 24 hours must be approved by the courts. Something lacking in the explanation of these measures to the public is that you cannot just go and detain people indefinitely. You have to get the approval of the courts, which examine all the fundamental human rights of the person whom the agencies are looking to detain. A person cannot be questioned except to establish identification. Review and investigation by the Ombudsman is also available, as is the right to contact a lawyer or family member. The Attorney-General must report to the parliament annually on all aspects of preventative detention. COAG has also implemented review measures on this legislation, including a sunset provision of 10 years and a review by COAG after five years.</para>
<para>One issue that has been put to me is that a new provision allows police to arrest suspects. The new provision really only draws on powers already available to state and territory police officers in arresting a person. State and territory police officers are able to use arrest powers under their own legislation when assisting in bringing a person into custody under a Commonwealth preventative detention order. These powers are already in existence. There is no breach of any person’s rights; the powers already exist, and so they should. I support this legislation wholeheartedly. As I have indicated, I would much prefer to take criticism from uninformed areas which were not privy to the debate and the pulling apart and putting back together of this legislation time and time again and were not privy to the discussions within the committee room that gave attention to absolutely everything that has been raised by my constituency or any other person.</para>
<para>I am very proud of the chairman and particular members of that committee, and I would like to pay particular tribute to some members who made it their business to ensure that every person’s individual rights are protected and that there will be absolutely no diminishing of anybody’s rights by putting in place this legislation. I repeat: there could be no greater civil libertarians than many of the people who were involved in approving this legislation in the long term, so I have no reservations about supporting this legislation. I have no pressure on me to support this legislation. I voluntarily stand in this chamber and wholeheartedly support the protection of the Australian people in the greatest form that we can possibly have and I support the powers that it will provide to our security enforcement agencies to assist in protecting Australian lives on Australian soil. I commend this bill to the House.</para>

<para>—We have before us the <inline ref="R2469">Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline>, legislation which is profound in its impact and which has been the subject of what can only be seen as one of the most substantial reports requiring the attention of this House. Yet the members speaking on the government’s side seem determined to place their heads in the sand and to say: ‘All is well. No attention needs to be given to the unanimous report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which has made more than 50 recommendations, including the deletion of all of the provisions relating to sedition.’ I find this an extraordinary state of affairs in this House.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We need to reflect on some of the very characteristics that make our democracy robust. The previous speaker, the member for Riverina, said that only in Australia was it possible to publish satirical programs such as <inline font-style="italic">How green was my cactus</inline>. That is simply not true. There are many democratic countries where satirical content is able to be published. But we should not have an Australian exceptionalism that says that descent into intolerance and authoritarian government is simply not possible here. We have seen many instances where, under pressure, robust democratic states have tilted towards authoritarianism, and we cannot be as blithely confident in the self-correcting mechanisms that the government seems to assume will apply.</para>
<para>Let us take a couple of examples. In the United States post World War II, out of concern for the global threat of communism, we saw the United States plunge into a period of great intolerance under the McCarthy chairmanship of the House Un-American Activities Committee, driving out of the cinema industry and many other professional occupations any person who refused to testify against those accused of participating in associations which might have some relationship with the Communist Party of America. More recently, after the participation of the United States in the war in Iraq, we have seen debate in the US Senate where the President is resisting congressional pressure to prohibit the use of torture against those held in custody by that country.</para>
<para>You might say that the member for Denison is making critical comments about a great and democratic friend of Australia, but let us look at our own record, because our own record is not impeccable. Our own record, for example, includes a period where the government, under the administration of Prime Minister Menzies, proposed the banning of the Australian Communist Party. I would like to say that, at the time, parliamentarians on the Labor side of politics resisted that stoutly and objected to its passage. But in truth, under the kind of campaign of fear and hysteria that was then prevalent, the legislation passed not only the House of Representatives but the Senate, where the Labor Party then had a majority. It was only due to the extraordinary campaign of the then Leader of the Opposition, the great—and, sadly, towards the end, mad—Bert Evatt, against the warning of much of his own party, that we were saved from the kind of McCarthyist purges that happened in the United States. By a very narrow majority, a plurality of Australians rejected the proposal at a referendum.</para>
<para>We saw ourselves tip into circumstances in the lead-up to the Iraq war where the intelligence agencies were placed in a position where there was plainly an abuse of those sources, and that has been the subject of separate investigations by this parliament. We are not in a situation where we can simply say, ‘We have robust institutional circumstances where, whatever we do, we will somehow not affect the rights and interests of citizens living in this country.’</para>
<para>One of the things I am very pleased to see in the Senate committee report is the first recommendation. The first recommendation calls upon the government to continue informing the Muslim community about the circumstances that give rise to the necessity to take some measures to increase security and to change some laws with respect to potential terrorism. I think that is very important, because the real danger to the Australian fabric is not so much the random act of persons motivated by ill will and hatred which can be the subject of police action and the subject of security services’ attention—the monitoring of phones and the like. Rather, the real danger is that some sectors of the Australian community will become disaffected and that substantial numbers of persons will start to feel alienated from the mainstream of the Australian community. That is the real danger for us and it is the real danger globally: that because of our own fear we will create a rejection of ‘the other’ and that the other in turn will see themselves as estranged from us and respond with indifference to our common interests. That is the kind of circumstance that we very much have to guard against.</para>
<para>Let me turn to some of the specific considerations that arise in this legislation. Taking the view of Australia that previous speakers have referred to, I never thought I would be debating the introduction of detention without trial. As I grew up, in Australia, I never thought that that would be possible. I never thought that some of the measures we are proposing to introduce would come forward as a response to the kinds of concerns we have had addressed. But we do have those proposals before us. We have proposals to permit detention without trial. We have proposals that will facilitate a whole range of additional law enforcement measures directed against those who are suspected of a crime. I use the word ‘crime’ advisedly because, like many members, I am quite concerned about the language of ‘a war on terror’. I find it a very damaging concept, because it presupposes that one can have a victory in relation to a specific and limited set of circumstances.</para>
<para>For hundreds of years—perhaps thousands of years—terrorism regrettably has been the recourse of people who do not accept the legitimacy of the state. No matter what legal framework we put in place, there will be those who, ill-advised, will resort to terrorism. The question is: what methodology do we use to deal with it? The methodology of a state that is concerned about the welfare of its citizens overall balances three things: (1) it wants to make certain that the laws are robust and strong; (2) it wants to make sure that the enforcement mechanisms are effective; and, (3), it wants to make certain there are practical measures that restrain people from being able to damage the society in which they live.</para>
<para>The first of those things, the laws, have to operate against a framework of diminishing returns. I do not think it is plausible to say that if we did permit torture there might not be an example, at the extreme of the debate, where the use of torture might in some circumstances produce material which could hypothetically improve our capacity to anticipate a terrorist event. Does that mean we should utilise torture? Of course not. The United States congress is still debating that very subject. Fortunately, this parliament has not reached that point. But I make the point that there is an ever-increasing law of diminishing returns. As we continually push out the extremity of the legal framework that we are willing to utilise—that is, preventive detention, searching people and seizing documents without a warrant and all the sorts of things we are now going to facilitate in this legislation—we have a diminishing return in terms of law enforcement capacity. On the other hand, we have a very significant impact on the character and nature of society. We should be aware of the fragility of our democratic society; we should be aware of the balances that make it up.</para>
<para>In some ways there is an interesting parallel between the debate on terrorism and the debate on one of the other great issues of our time—climate change. The two things do not instantly seem to fit together well but, on the issue of climate change, it is our unwillingness to look long term into the future that is our fatal flaw. We know that our contribution of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere is creating a circumstance of global warming, but the immediate cost each day is not of the kind that we anticipate when terrorism arises; we do not see 150 people bombed on a beach in Bali. But the ultimate consequence of climate change for our society, and for the lives of future Australians, is immeasurably greater—the health impacts, the societal impacts, the dislocation, the economic costs and the deaths that will result from failing to attend to climate change as a real threat that we have to face dwarf the consequences we potentially face from those who would seek to destroy us from without. It is our lack of capacity to anticipate forward in the long term that threatens us.</para>
<para>When we turn to terrorism, it is our lack of capacity to anticipate forward that is our greatest threat. It is not Muslim extremists being provoked into anti-Western rage that are our greatest threat—though certainly they must be dealt with by good and effective law enforcement and by the protection of our infrastructure and the like—but reacting wrongly to the pressure that that places upon us in our society. Of course, the macroexample that we have before us is the intervention in Iraq. When the twin towers were bombed, the world was sympathetic to the United States. I remember being glued to my television set that night, and I do not think anybody in this chamber—certainly no-one I have ever spoken to—ever anticipated that there would be any objection to the United States taking policing action against those responsible. And, to the extent that the then government of Afghanistan provided protection to those persons, I think this House was almost unanimously of a view that it would support a policing action to try and deal with those who had inflicted that damage. But from that base, sadly, the engagement changed its character, resulting in a political decision, justified fraudulently on the basis of weapons of mass destruction, to invade Iraq. And, just as Australia would resent and resist any invasion, whether well-motivated or otherwise, so too we have seen the tragic consequences of that invasion—the increasing polarisation of the internal communities in Iraq, civil dissent and the strengthening of those who urge jihad against the West.</para>
<para>On a micro level, our capacity to look forward is also at risk. This government prides itself on taking a strong position on national security. But sometimes its short-sightedness is so stupendous that I find myself puzzled. Take, for example, the circumstance of the government at the time the present Attorney-General was Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. During that period he presided over the ruthless approach that this government took towards those seeking refugee status in this country. Part of what he negotiated was an MOU with Iran to receive into Australia 500 hand-picked Iranian students in exchange for those seeking refuge in this country. If you reflect on those circumstances and look at who were being selected, you will see that Australia was willing to accept 500 persons selected by one of the most extreme regimes of the Middle East so that that regime would take back persons who had sought refuge from that very regime. That is an extraordinary piece of decision making. So we have these ironies that bedevil us.</para>
<para>The one position I want to reinforce in this debate is that these issues are too big to be left simply to the wisdom of the members of the government committee that discusses it privately amongst themselves, the security agencies or the ministers. The report of the Senate committee shows the wisdom of exposing this to a wider public audience and allowing significant input. There is a real danger in governments making decisions based on input from law enforcement or security agencies—particularly, security agencies.</para>
<para>I have the benefit of sitting on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD and I have noted the tension that is manifested in that committee. Some of the tension will be obvious in the report of the review of the questioning and detention powers, which will be tabled before the House rises for Christmas. That report will be very worthy of members’ attention and interest, and I commend it for their reading, just as I commend the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee.</para>
<para>There is a real danger, which was well highlighted in the publication of the Parliamentary Library<inline font-style="italic">Scrutiny or Secrecy</inline>, which was produced as a monograph by Dr Kate Burton, the 2004 Australian Parliamentary Fellow. The real danger is that we too readily accept that parliamentarians have to step back from making practical decisions on these issues and defer to those who perhaps have some kind of secret information that is not shared by us. I am very cautious about that approach.</para>
<para>I became very aware of the nature of intelligence when I was minister. I have enormous regard for those who serve in intelligence roles, but essentially they belong to a closed community. They are not able to identify themselves, to speak and to communicate broadly with the larger Australian community. Inevitably they start to see themselves as bastions of some sets of information that are not available to everybody else and start to trust their own private judgments better than those of the larger community. We have to have robust parliamentary oversight of these processes because of their very nature. We see it time and time again—not in this country particularly but in every country where those agencies exist. I am not suggesting any malice. I am just noting a necessary tension that exists in the relationship.</para>
<para>But, having noted that tension in the relationship, we have to make certain that when we do pass new laws we do not go too far in conceding rights that we take for granted, that we do not diminish the interests that individuals have worked for so long to establish in this country and that we do not forget that laws alone are not a solution. Social stability is built upon a capacity of people to find common ways of living together—and that is not just within Australia but in the global community—and if we are going to work effectively in this area we have to couple effective policing and good laws with a highly developed sense of respect for those who make up the diversity of our community.</para>
<para>I come to the final point of this address and commend to this House particularly recommendation 7. One of the problems of this legislation is that, if you are detained or dealt with under a protective custody or control order, you are not told what the charge is against you and the matters to be addressed. This recommendation addresses that particular point. It should be incorporated by way of amendment. There are many other amendments to be moved. I commend to the House their consideration. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

As leaders in our community, we have a responsibility to protect and defend the key institutions and values that we hold dear.

<para class="block">I think that sums it up perfectly for me. I want Australians, and especially Territorians, to be eternally vigilant and to constantly be aware of any threat to our way of life. We must be vigilant. If that means accepting some restrictions on what we do and the introduction of legal measures designed to ensure that those protecting us have the power to act in a responsible and informed way, then that is the price we have to pay.</para>

I have in the past—and I do so again today—paid tribute to the men and women who, along with the families of those who were injured or killed and who have had to endure so much pain and loss, gave so much of themselves to help and care for the victims of the attacks. Territorians have experienced first-hand the devastation, the wounds and the carnage of these attacks on Australian families. We have struggled, and we continue to struggle, to understand why someone would do this.</para>
<para>In the Top End of the Northern Territory, we have many different cultural groups who have a very proud history in the development of our community. Contrary to what is often promoted in the southern media, we are a tolerant and understanding people who take pride in the make-up of our society. We do not have ethnic ghettos. Soccer matches are not marred by ethnic brawls. We do not have whole suburbs of one ethnic or cultural group that go to war with other ethnic groups, as occurs in places like Sydney or Melbourne.</para>
<para>In the Territory, we get on with one another. People of different ethnic origins are scattered throughout the community. In the street where I live—a very small street—there are probably a dozen families from different cultural and ethnic origins. Where I come from, we all mix together because we have to—we do not have a choice—and we get on well with each other. However, just because our community has this special trait does not mean that we can take it for granted. We must be constantly aware of, and on guard against, any threats to our very cosmopolitan community.</para>
<para>I want to comment on some of the language being used in response to both the introduction of the <inline ref="R2469">Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline> and the terror raids that took place a couple of weeks ago in New South Wales and Victoria. I think everybody—in particular, public figures and journalists—has a responsibility to use their words carefully. I believe beyond a shadow of a doubt in the right of every person to free speech. Free speech is an important right for all Australians. While there have been calls for Australia to introduce a bill of rights, I do not think we need one. Our rights are well understood by all and there are enough social mechanisms to make sure that they are protected and policed.</para>
<para>However, I also argue that with every right comes a responsibility. While rights give us certain powers and status, they also give us certain responsibilities, and one of the responsibilities that we have in times like this is to make sure that we use our words responsibly. All due care and attention should be given by those speaking and reporting in the public domain to the effect that their words might have on someone else. I believe in our justice system and I am aware that much of the public discussion surrounding the arrests in Sydney and Melbourne has the potential to harm the process of justice. Every person is entitled to a fair trial, and we must keep this sacrosanct.</para>
<para>Our right to free speech and the responsibilities that flow from it must apply to every person. That is why I believe the comments by some in the Muslim community who say that they will be targeted by rednecks are wrong. I will mention some of the public comments that do not fit well with me. The director of Forum on Australia’s Islamic Relations, Kuranda Seyit, was quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> on Thursday, 10 November as saying that the raids were the Muslim community’s ‘worst nightmares come true’. The article continues:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">“They (the raids) are creating the impression that there are Muslim baddies crawling all over the place,” Mr Seyit said. “We work to create a positive climate (between Muslims) and the non-Muslim community, but that’s been put back seriously in the last couple of days.”</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I have to say to Mr Seyit that this is not our worst nightmare come true. Our worst nightmare come true would have been if those people had not been caught and the attacks had occurred, as was alleged to have been their desire.</para>
<para>That takes me back a few years to when the Northern Territory government introduced a mandatory sentencing regime. There were all sorts of outcries that that regime was racist in its intent. People said that, because the jails were full of Aboriginal people, the mandatory sentencing laws targeted Aboriginal people. It was clearly not the case. Those laws targeted people who committed property crimes. If you were committing a property crime at the time, you were deemed to come under the mandatory sentencing regime. The laws have been dropped by the current Northern Territory government because they were deemed to be harsh, not because they were deemed to be racist.</para>
<para>Another article that I read says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... sheik Abdul Nacer Benbrika told the ABC two months ago: “I am telling you that my religion doesn’t tolerate other religion. It doesn’t tolerate. The only one law which needs to spread, it can be here or anywhere else, has to be Islam.”</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">They are scary words. If that is the case, we should all be classed as rednecks. I will not back away from saying to Sheik Abdul Nacer Benbrika: you should not be encouraging any act that is not in the interests of Australia. Australians who follow Islam must adhere to and acknowledge the predominant social norms and customs of Australia. We are a pluralist society but we must preserve our Australian way of life. That is what the antiterrorism legislation aims to protect.</para>
<para>The other point that I want to make today is about the sedition elements of the legislation. I am not totally convinced that we need to pursue a strict approach when it comes to sedition. We must be free to engage in critical comment but, as I said before, it must take note of our responsibilities. As many people know, I have a reputation for being a bit of a straight talker, a reputation that I think most politicians would aim for. My constituents do not want me to hide my opinions under a bushel. They want me to stand up and shout out for their interests and, if that means criticising something or someone, I am all for it. That is the essence of my concerns: I do not want any limitation placed on my ability to stand up and say what the people I represent believe in. I do not want any limitations on what I can and cannot say as to what is in my best interests and the interests of my constituents, Territorians and all Australians.</para>
<para>I support the bill and I understand that it will play a role in safeguarding our society. We must always be aware of threats to our Australian way of life, both externally and internally. In times of threat and intimidation from those who do not agree with our decisions or actions, we must move to introduce legal measures that will enable our law enforcement officials to act decisively and in anticipation. It is no good after the fact if we, as leaders of the community, sit around thinking that we should have done something to prevent a terrorist act. For that reason, I urge all members to support this very critical legislation.</para>

<para>—I guess in some ways the quote that should head up the <inline ref="R2469">Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline> is the one that is incorporated in the explanatory memorandum: ‘I am safe but unable to be contacted for the time being.’ That is a pretty chilling suggestion of the way in which people should say that they have been detained. I want to make a number of criticisms of the proposed antiterrorism laws. Firstly, they fail to conform with the key values of a liberal democracy. This is the most fundamental criticism. Secondly, they deliberately breach the Constitution by pushing some of these conditions onto the states. Furthermore, they offer no or poor justification that the proposals are actually needed or will be an effective means of preventing ideologically or politically motivated violence. Being tough is not good enough; they should be effective. The proposed laws remove fundamental rights and in so doing they play to the terrorists’ script. Indeed they are removing rights that it is claimed we are defending from terrorist attack. The bill also lacks clarity and precision, especially in the sedition provisions.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There has been inadequate public discussion. If it had not been for Jon Stanhope, the discussion would have been even more severely limited. While some pretty crude opinion polling suggests that many Australians are responsive to calls for these proposed antiterrorism laws, it is fair to say that they have not heard the arguments. There has been a conspicuous lack of information about the nature and extent of the terrorist threat, and they cannot sensibly judge whether these laws are justified. Indeed it is difficult enough for members of parliament, despite the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee inquiry report coming down today.</para>
<para>I will also indicate the key provisions of the legislation which are of concern to me, and I know to a great many others, and the dangers associated if the bill is implemented in its current form. The fundamental test is, of course, whether these laws are necessary, particularly given the threat they pose to the civil and political rights of Australian citizens. The key values of a liberal democracy are challenged in this, so we have to hear an argument for why they should be set aside. For example, we need a full explanation of why existing laws are not adequate, what the new powers are for and why they are needed. We have not had that argument either from the Attorney-General in his eight-minute second reading speech or from anyone else. Are they proportionate to the threat that we face?</para>
<para>As argued by the lawyers from the Gilbert and Tobin Centre of Public Law, relative to measures adopted in the United States and Britain, these laws are more extensive and invasive, despite the lower risk of a terrorist attack in Australia. There is no argument from anyone that I have heard that Australia faces an actual or imminent emergency ‘threatening the life of the nation’, as required under international law if we were to adopt these extreme measures. To suspend basic rights such as freedom from arbitrary detention there must be an actual or imminent emergency which threatens the whole population. We have signed up to these conventions and that is what we say we will do. There is no threat to the population, the existence of the state or the functioning of state institutions as required under international law, nor has Australia sought to notify the United Nations, as required under the relevant convention. What is more, the alert level has been set at medium since 2001, meaning, as it says, a terrorist attack in Australia ‘could occur’. It has never been set at high or extreme.</para>
<para>The United Nations has been very clear that states must ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism complies with all their obligations under international law and should adopt such measures in accordance with international law, particularly international human rights, refugee and humanitarian laws. If we are to adopt laws of this kind we in this parliament need to make the case that the laws are necessary because no other laws are capable of dealing with those planning, assisting or inciting terrorist acts. I do not believe the government has done that either. They are already criminal offences. If police have evidence that someone is planning or assisting a terrorist act, they should arrest them, charge them and detain them, until trial if necessary. It is not clear that the existing laws are insufficient to address the terrorist threat and we know, because this parliament passed the laws, that ASIO already has powers to question and detain people suspected of having information related to a terrorism offence. Parliament gave ASIO extensive powers to question and detain people for up to seven days. The Australian Federal Police may hold suspects for an extended period of 24 hours. ASIO has also been given a massive increase in resources and expanded powers of surveillance and evidence gathering.</para>
<para>New terrorist offences have been created in law, and wider powers to ban terrorist organisations and prevent terrorist financing have been conferred over recent years. Despite the breadth of these powers, Australia has seldom made use of them. As far as I know, only 10 people were questioned in 2004-05 and none detained by ASIO. Before the recent arrests, there were very few arrests for terrorism or terrorism related offences. Indeed the arrests three weeks ago indicate that existing provisions do allow for those people who are planning terrorist acts to be charged under existing legislation, to be charged and detained while respecting the normal safeguards, including the presumption of innocence, although I must say that some sections of the press and some premiers have set that aside.</para>
<para>Indeed the former ASIO chief, Mr Richardson, said clearly after the last round of amendments that the powers were sufficient. And so too did AFP Commissioner, Mick Keelty, in response to Kerry O’Brien’s question on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline> about the raids that I mentioned, when Kerry O’Brien asked:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Does it demonstrate that current powers are adequate?</para>
<para class="block">MICK KEELTY: Well, I think they are ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">If there are gaps, why not cover them by creating offences in the Criminal Code, if it is demonstrated that the code is inadequate?</para>
<para>We are told that the London bombings and the evidence of home-grown terrorist acts were justifications for this legislation but I do not think they are compelling arguments. We knew we had home-grown terrorists: there is one in jail in Perth and the perpetrators were not known in London. Indeed, despite the legislation there, such laws did not help and would not have helped. The United Kingdom, as we know, was trying to introduce similar laws but they were being subjected to close scrutiny and tests against the Human Rights Act, something that we do not have in this country—we do not have those protections. I think it is worth asking the question: what will these laws achieve that concerted surveillance could not? It is possible that the focus on new laws may deflect attention from practical counter-terrorist measures and resources as well. The laws are no substitute for properly enforcing the existing law and they might hamper the efforts to address the structural causes of some terrorist violence by alienating big sections of the Islamic community.</para>
<para>So we have a serious lack of justification on the question of how these measures deal more effectively with the threat of ideologically and politically motivated crime. As I suggested, they may in fact be counterproductive, being directed disproportionately at the Muslim community. They risk alienating the community whose cooperation is needed. They will expose more people to intrusive policing powers and that will mean increased insecurity for some sections of the community. As a recent <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> editorial concluded:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Government ... has not spelt out clear deficiencies in current laws nor demonstrated a compelling practical need for a secret and draconian counter-terrorism regime.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The federal government—and the state governments, for that matter—have failed to provide adequate justification of how these measures, with their severe curtailment of rights and freedoms, are proportionate to the threat. I think it is probable that many Australians will not care if the government succeeds in creating illusions of security and prosperity with these laws. Amanda Vanstone’s comments in this respect are illustrative: it is not about actually making change, it is about making people feel better—do something, anything will do.</para>
<para>My second major set of objections is that the measures represent a very serious departure from the key principles of liberal democracy. They overturn fundamental values and hard-won rights, rights that have been fought for over centuries: the right to liberty, freedom of speech and freedom of association. There are various measures in the bill that offend these values and others, including the separation of powers and due process, for instance. The control orders are effective house arrest. Preventive detention is detention without trial by any measure or without the legal testing of the evidence. Sedition, the invasion of privacy, the denial of access to preferred legal counsel and the overturning of the presumption of innocence—these are big shifts in our legal system.</para>
<para>I think we need to say right at the outset that detention is the most invasive restriction on the individual liberty and security of the person. At base, these laws overturn the right to individual liberty. It is one of most cherished doctrines in common law and we are being asked to set it aside because it will no longer be necessary to prove the commission of an offence before detaining someone. In any system, such deprivation of liberty should be a last resort, after all feasible alternatives have been found wanting. That is not just required under international law; it is a long-standing provision of our common law heritage, dating back to the Magna Carta, and the rule of law in this country. As Lord Hope of Craighead said in a recent House of Lords decision overturning indefinite detention in the United Kingdom:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It is impossible ever to overstate the importance of the right to liberty in a democracy.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That means for everybody, not just for the select few. The government has been urged by the Law Council of Australia, for that reason, to abandon the proposals to introduce preventative detention orders and control orders. They say, and I agree, that the rights of Australians to liberty, freedom of speech, movement and association should be inalienable, protected by parliaments—not reduced by them. It is important, in this House too, to remind ourselves that a nation is judged:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... not by the way it treats the majority of its citizens but by what it does to its minorities, its criminals, its troublemakers and its misfits.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It is a basic right, and one I cherish, that only a court may detain someone and then only persons charged with a crime. That is being overturned by this legislation. The police function is then limited to bringing people to court expeditiously. It is a long-standing principle underpinning our legal system. It is also included in the obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which we are a signatory. The prohibition on arbitrary or unlawful arrest or detention is article 9 of that covenant and, for these reasons, the Law Council and others recommend that the government abandon preventative detention and control orders. I am very worried that this legislation confers unprecedented powers on police and security organisations. The breadth of the proposals to date is extraordinary and so is the potential for innocents to get caught up in the net. It requires us to trust police security agents who have in the past shown they are capable of corruption, political partisanship and just plain incompetence. Why should we trust them to act without scrutiny? We have never done it before.</para>
<para>The other thing about these laws is that they are based on intelligence, not evidence, with all the weaknesses that entails. There is no reason to expect that serious mistakes will not be made; indeed, the chances of errors and abuse are greater than normal because the police will be acting on vague information that would not justify a charge and that will not be tested in the normal way. As we know, momentous consequences can flow from errors of intelligence and unfettered administrative licence. We only need to look at the war in Iraq, the experiences of Cornelia Rau and Vivian Solon and many other examples. A public servant contacted me recently and said, ‘As a public servant who has worked in both Defence and Immigration, I am only too conscious of the way that lack of transparency and strong statutory powers can result in abuses of power and the undermining of human rights, irrespective of the original sound intentions of everyone involved.’ These laws too, as I mentioned earlier, overturn the presumption of innocence, which is a very fundamental shift. Normally, individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law upon adequate proof which is properly tested.</para>
<para>Under current law, individuals are presumed innocent and are generally free from coercive powers, except arrest powers in relation to persons suspected on reasonable grounds of committing a crime, who must be brought before a judicial officer after a short period of detention. That is the way things are today. As President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, John von Doussa, said, ‘The key characteristics of a police state are that the police exercise powers on behalf of the executive and these powers are not subject to independent judicial review, including a review of the factual basis on which the powers are exercised.’ These proposed laws substantially alter the relationship in this respect between citizens and the state. They inevitably mean a more controlled and compliant population and they marginalise political dissent.</para>
<para>I have also mentioned that these laws represent a deliberate attempt to bypass the Constitution. The states are being used to circumvent the constitutional limitations on detention without trial of 48 hours. Instead, people will be held for up to two weeks. The proposed use of judicial oversight—and there is some—may still contravene constitutional separation of powers and compromise the independent role of the judiciary. That was certainly the opinion of many lawyers who appeared before the Senate committee. In doing so, the judiciary will be brought into disrepute, even using retired judges selected by the minister—a political tick off. There is advice that the involvement of the Federal Court, the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Service as issuing courts may indeed be constitutionally invalid. As has been said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… the involuntary detention of a citizen in custody by the State is permissible only as a consequential step in the adjudication of criminal guilt of that citizen for past acts.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It is not about something that it is feared they might do on the basis of intelligence rather than on evidence. Of course the secrecy provisions of these laws are anathema. The secrecy that surrounds the process, in my view, is the antithesis of justice as we know it in our community, an essential aspect being that it is public and accountable. These laws effectively protect officials from scrutiny. There is no real transparency. There is the possibility of mistaken identity and faulty intelligence, which will not be easily corrected. People can effectively disappear and it can happen to anyone. Police will be able to detain without charge on their own initiative and that is truly revolutionary in the worst possible sense.</para>
<para>As we have heard from other speakers, the sedition sections pose a particular risk for artists and activists critical of government or of those reporting their statements. I am sure it is for that reason that senators recommended abandoning this section. Why not use the ordinary provisions of the Criminal Code if there is incitement to commit an offence?</para>
<para>Despite assurances at the COAG meeting, the bill makes no reference to the principle that restrictions on rights should be read in accordance with Australia’s obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights—the premiers were actually dudded on this point—let alone the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and other human rights treaties about which they were also given assurances.</para>
<para>I guess all of these things highlight the fact that we have no effective human rights framework in this country, certainly nothing that allows us to judge the new antiterrorism legislation. I think it is also worth saying that we are now almost alone in the developed world and Western democracies in having no bill of rights. There is no check upon extreme legislation such as this. We are not party to any binding international instruments such as the European Convention on Human Rights and its five protocols, which enable European citizens to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights if domestic legislation or law is thought to be in breach of that convention. The comparison of our legislation with the British legislation, which the government and some speakers have made, overlooks the fact that their system contains more human rights safeguards than ours. As David Neal, recently writing in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, said:</para>
<quote>
<para>The English Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 adopts just that model for control orders. The police apply for a control order at a preliminary hearing in the absence of the person in question. If a control order is made, there must be a full hearing within seven days.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is somewhat similar to our own circumstances. The article goes on:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Before the full hearing, the police must place all relevant evidence before the court—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">that is a grave difference from our system—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">subject to security—they must provide the controlled person with a copy of that evidence.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Again, even the Senate has not gone that far in its recommendations. The article further states:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The controlled person must also provide his or her evidence and then the full hearing takes place.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In other words, it is tested as evidence. The article continues:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">If the court confirms the order, there is a right of appeal on the basis of legal error.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">As David Neal points out, ‘The Anti-Terrorism Bill 2005 contains nothing of the sort.’ So we simply cannot make comparisons with the UK legislation because it is not similar. He asks: ‘Why is a full hearing possible in the United Kingdom—with all the threats it faces—but not in Australia?’ Because this is quick and dirty legislation and it is not really designed to improve our safety.</para>
<para>The other thing that I want to refer to in the brief time I have remaining is the lack of checks and balances and parliamentary oversight. The so-called protections are very weak. A 10-year sunset clause is far too long. The judicial review is welcome but incomplete. The judge or magistrate has no comprehensive way of testing what is claimed by authorities. Indeed, it creates a false impression of due process and it is open to abuse for political purposes. It is of concern to me that a politician—the Attorney-General—will have a role in deciding whether certain orders or prosecutions proceed. This minister has form! That is why, in the criminal system, the Office of the DPP was created: to rule out political influence or interference and to ensure the separation of powers.</para>
<para>I think these laws require substantial amendment. It is easy to accuse the critics of exaggerating, but it overlooks history and human nature. This is the government that brought us children overboard, the Solon and Rau scandals and many others like them. As the editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> put it, ‘Few will have confidence in the good sense or love of liberty, for instance, of the Attorney-General on his record.’ There is no doubt that the government has been obscenely keen to make political capital out of the terrorist threat, and we might ask how the media managed to be present at so many of the raids. It is very disturbing, as is this legislation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I support the <inline ref="R2469">Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline>. As proven by the September 11 attacks, distance is no longer a safety barrier for Australia. No-one would ever have thought a terrorist group based in Afghanistan would be able to attack the heart of America. Terrorists have built bridges where previously distance and time had prevented them. Now, our greatest concern is no longer an attacker sent from abroad, but the home-grown terrorists who are prepared to kill fellow Australians to pursue a so-called cause which they believe is God’s will. How dare terrorists use the term ‘God’s will’ to justify their actions of killing Australians on holiday in Bali, not once but twice, killing in total 92.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Was it God’s will for a suicide bomber to kill Maria Kumalawati outside the Australian Embassy in Indonesia and leave her little daughter Manny seriously injured and to grow up without a mother? Manny would not even know the term ‘terrorism’ or the cause terrorists pursue. Was it God’s will for Australian Sam Ly to be killed as he travelled to work on a No. 30 bus in London on 7 July 2005? No god from any religion would support these murders. This is terrorism; this is not God’s will. Internationally, on a yearly basis since 2001, Australians have been the victims of terrorist attacks. What were the crimes of these Australians in the eyes of the terrorists? Travelling to work. A mother with her daughter, party goers and holiday-makers—these are the terrorists’ targets abroad. They were all Australians, all innocent and all victims. Australians must learn from these attacks. No-one is spared and no activity is safe.</para>
<para>In order to best protect citizens we must have strong legislation which will assist police in preventing and detecting terrorist activities. The Howard government’s priority is to protect Australian citizens from a terrorist attack. The antiterrorism bill is designed to protect Australians by giving law enforcement agencies the necessary legislative tools—nothing more and nothing less. There are critics of this bill. We have heard many comments from individuals, organisations, media outlets and members of the Labor Party—including in speeches prior to mine—claiming that these provisions are unwarranted and will impinge on our civil liberties. However, it is the terrorists who have impinged on our civil liberties. As the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, said, some people have more concerns about the rights of terrorists than the protection of their fellow citizens.</para>
<para>I will now talk about a couple of aspects of this bill. First, I will talk about control orders. Why do we need control orders? Police simply do not have the resources to track terror suspects on a 24-hour basis. I go back to my days with the Victoria Police in the organised crime squad, where surveillance was regularly used to provide police with vital information and many times offenders were apprehended committing crimes. To watch a target for 24 hours would require at least 20 police, from surveillance crews to investigators and arrest teams. Police do not have the resources to keep the number of Australian terror suspects under check. The control orders are designed to prevent and deter potential terrorists from committing acts of terrorism. These control orders may also include the use of tracking devices to monitor their movements. The Attorney-General must approve the order, followed by a court ruling. This two-step approval process provides a safeguard for these control orders to be protected from abuse.</para>
<para>The sedition aspect of the bill aims to modernise the current sedition offences, which cover incitement by urging a group to use violence against others to threaten the peace. The government has no intention of targeting comedians and cartoonists or attacking free speech. The intention of this law is to protect Australian troops abroad and prevent extremists from converting people with impressionable minds into potential terrorists.</para>
<para>The great concern I have relates to how radical outspoken Islamic leaders strongly endorse the use of suicide bombers, praise the September 11 attacks, hail Osama bin Laden and regard Australian troops such as those in Iraq as a fair target. In recent times on Channel 9’s <inline font-style="italic">60 Minutes</inline> program we had Sheikh Yasin preaching to 100 young followers, calling for the deaths of homosexuals and for Muslims not to associate with non-Muslims. Then on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 3 November this year we had an article by Richard Kerbaj. He spent four weeks attending radical mosques, where Sheikh Mohammed Omran from Melbourne and Sheikh Abdul Salam Mohammed Zoud from Sydney openly urged insurgents to wage war against Australian soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. The extremist leaders are not directly inciting followers to go out and become suicide bombers or commit terrorist attacks in Australia, but they are planting the seeds. A combination of statements to an impressionable mind can lead to a follower taking the next step from listening to acting.</para>
<para>The extremist leader, by saying Osama bin Laden is good, is saying terrorism is good, and by saying the September 11 attacks were justified they are saying the hijacking of planes and the killing of thousands of innocent people are justified. In praising the jihad, the preacher is supporting a holy war against Westerners, whom they regard as infidels. Australians are also regarded by extremists as infidels, and suicide bombings in a jihad can be justified. Therefore, a jihad against Australia with suicide bombers is justified. This is a very direct message into the minds of followers, supporting and encouraging terrorism. If the Australian public does not believe this method of conversion works, just have a look at all the terrorist attacks in Indonesia, where those involved have strong connections to extremist leaders. Abu Bakar Bashir gives the perfect example of how to influence young people to become suicide bombers.</para>
<para>Under proposed section 80.2(5) of this bill there is a provision for police to charge extremist leaders who urge violence within the community. However, in saying that, I do support a review of this proposed section of the bill as, from my understanding, there is no avenue for investigators to charge an extremist leader who may be preaching his words of terrorism to an individual not in a group situation. I also believe the legislation must be more user friendly for investigators to lay charges and for the public to understand the intent of the legislation.</para>
<para>I therefore believe that the future of our sedition laws should be in line with the incitement laws in the UK antiterrorism legislation, where great efforts have been made to ensure not only that the public can understand the intention of the legislation but also that investigators can more easily determine the best manner in which to lay charges and mount a successful prosecution. The Attorney-General is considering reviewing the incitement section of the legislation and I fully support this review.</para>
<para>I do not support the outright scrapping of this section of the bill, as per recommendation 27 of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee inquiry report released today, unless there is a direct replacement similar to the UK encouragement of terrorism legislation. In the sedition powers as they stand in this bill, investigators could prosecute extremist leaders who encourage insurgent attacks against Australian soldiers in Iraq. Also, at home, investigators would have some legislative power to charge outspoken extremists preaching terrorism, even though I agree this would be difficult the way the legislation currently stands.</para>
<para>In order to warrant preventative detention, there must be a reasonable basis to believe that it would prevent a terrorist attack or preserve evidence pertaining to an attack. The time for detention is no more than 14 days. Any detention order is subject to judicial review and could be subject to an investigation by the Commonwealth Ombudsman, so providing additional safeguards. However, I am concerned that this section of the bill has a restriction that it can only be used within 28 days of a terrorist attack.</para>
<para>I also have grave concerns about the lack of interview time. On 6 September 2005 I made a speech in the House concerning the lack of time for investigators when interviewing terrorist suspects. I am greatly concerned there is no provision to interview a terrorist suspect whilst in preventative detention. To be interviewed, the suspect must be released and re-arrested under part 1C of the Crimes Act, where investigators will only have 48 hours of interview time. After the London bombings, British authorities determined that 14 days to interview terrorist suspects was insufficient and increased the interview and detention period to 28 days.</para>
<para>What does this mean for preventative detention in Australia? Once a person is detained, they can be placed in custody for 14 days, but not one question can be asked of them—not even by ASIO. No information which is obtained by investigators can be put to the suspect. No calls the suspect may have made, no emails he has sent, no personal contacts and no admissions can even be used in court. As detailed by the British authorities, a terrorist attack is a most complex police investigation where often we have multiple offenders and multiple attacks, and where interpreters and international inquiries are required. I therefore support the review of this legislation which has been agreed to by the Attorney-General, and I strongly endorse that this component be changed so that in the future law enforcement agencies have an avenue to interview suspects whilst in custody. However, in saying that, overall and in conclusion, this government has a very strong record in countering terrorism and will continue to do a great job.</para>

<para>—In our fight against terrorists and terrorism, we must be very clear about what we are fighting for. Our freedom and our values are threatened by terrorism. In responding to such a threat, we must ensure we do not overreact and in so doing threaten those values ourselves. Our response must be strong, effective and consistent with our democratic values and freedoms. Labor recognises the need to equip ourselves not only with the operational capacity to fight terrorism but with the legislative capacity to suppress terrorism within our own borders. We must be vigilant in taking measures to protect the community from terrorist threats; we must be equally vigilant in protecting civil liberties and democratic freedoms. These principles cannot be traded off against each other. We cannot protect our freedom by sacrificing that freedom.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Given the Howard government has form when it comes to playing politics with national security, Labor must also be vigilant to protect the community from the manipulation and excesses of John Howard and Philip Ruddock. The simple fact is: Australians have been grossly deceived many times by the Howard government over our national security. ‘Children overboard’, going to war against Iraq—allegedly to find weapons of mass destruction—and the culture of deception in DIMIA have all undermined Australians’ trust in their government. In 2001 Australians were told by the Howard government that asylum seekers represented a threat to national security. We were told by Peter Reith on 13 September 2001 that there was:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... a pipeline for terrorists to come in and use your country as a staging post for terrorist activities.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">We were told that these people were illegals who would never set foot on Australian soil, and the Pacific solution was established at the cost of $220 million, or $500,000 for every man, woman and child picked up by the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline>. To underline the allegedly inhumanity of these asylum seekers, we were told that they had thrown their kids overboard.</para>
<para>The imagery was stark. For every parent, the concept that a person could drown their own child to gain personal advantage was chilling. We now know that, within a short time, senior government ministers knew that this was not true. They knew that defence personnel had been misused, that photographs had been manipulated and that electoral advantage had been put before common decency. And who were these people? Most of them were found to be legitimate asylum seekers fleeing the regime of the Taliban in Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. Specifically, 424 of the 433 asylum seekers picked up by the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> were Afghans fleeing the Taliban.</para>
<para>Having vilified the opponents of Saddam and the Taliban, the Howard government then determined to go to war against the very regimes the asylum seekers had fled. They saw no irony in this. And what was the justification for war? In his televised address to the nation on 20 March 2003, Prime Minister Howard said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We are determined to join other countries to deprive Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction, its chemical and biological weapons, which even in minute quantities are capable of causing death and destruction on a mammoth scale.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">They were the words of Prime Minister Howard but, only a year later, with no weapons of mass destruction found and this justification for war lying in tatters, Mr Howard and his colleagues reinterpreted history and emphasised regime change as the justification for the war. This contradicted the Prime Minister’s address to the National Press Club on 13 March 2003 which ruled out regime change as the reason for the war in Iraq.</para>
<para>The fact is that the Australian people were told we declared war on Iraq in order to deprive Saddam Hussein of his arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. Those weapons did not exist. We went to war on a lie. The Howard government made fraudulent claims about the existence of WMD and used doctored intelligence reports as the basis of those claims. At a time when careful judgment and leadership were critical, the Howard government was playing politics. The simple fact is that Australians are at greater risk today because Australia’s involvement in the Iraq war has made our country less safe. Later, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence and senior Defence officials seriously misled the Australian parliament and people about what the government knew and when they knew about the abuse of prisoners in Iraq.</para>
<para>This is a government that has wrongly detained at least 220 people in flagrant breach of our immigration laws and has illegally deported an Australian citizen who it assumed was an illegal sex worker. The culture in DIMIA was developed when the present Attorney-General was its minister, and that culture has produced a litany of abuse and mismanagement, leaving a trail of human misery. This is a government with form and a terrible legacy of playing politics with national security. Given this record, it is understandable that people are suspicious of the government’s new antiterrorism legislation. I also believe that the threat of terrorism is too serious to play politics with. Many people I have deep respect for are completely opposed to all of these measures.</para>
<para>The first position which must be established is this: is there a real threat to our security from terrorism? The answer to that is yes. That is an important distinction from the other security issue of asylum seekers and the Iraq war which were based upon promoting fear on the basis of lies and distortions. There has been a rise in adherents to a fundamentalist and extreme ideology which is fascist, misogynist and militant in its strategy. Whilst an academic analysis of the causes of this rise of extremism is of interest, it does not abdicate the responsibility that governments have to protect their citizens; nor does it console the families of victims of this extremism. The extremists do not act in accord with any faith, as evidenced by the fact that most of the victims of terror have been Muslim.</para>
<para>I have a view that it is reasonable to be cautious on these issues, for if you are wrong and someone you love is travelling on the Sydney train line that is targeted you do not want to regret not taking any measure that could have prevented that attack. The question is therefore not whether the legislation should be carried for the changed circumstances but what is effective in achieving the objectives necessitated by these changed circumstances. Individual liberties must be balanced by having regard to the collective interest.</para>
<para>Back in 2002 and 2003, when the parliament first considered the antiterrorism legislation and the ASIO bill, Labor amended the legislation to get the balance right. Let us not forget that the ASIO bill, as introduced on 21 March 2002, would have allowed children as young as 10 years old to be detained without their parents’ knowledge, without any representation, and to be strip searched and held indefinitely. So extreme was the draft that the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD unanimously recommended 15 substantive changes. The Prime Minister declared Labor’s amendments made the bill unworkable, but eventually it was amended and carried. The Director-General of ASIO, Dennis Richardson, stated to a parliamentary committee on 19 March this year:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I would note that … it has worked very smoothly so far. To be frank, there was a concern … the legislation would be unduly complex and difficult to administer. The legislation that was initially introduced into the parliament with our support and advice was much simpler and was, of course, tougher. We debated among ourselves whether the compromises … would make it unduly complex. Our concerns were misplaced. We were wrong in worrying about it … the balance … has so far been very workable …</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Only laws which properly balance being tough on the terrorists while at the same time protect our democratic freedoms are good laws. They are only strong and effective laws if they get that balance right. It is critical the new laws make our community safer, and it is equally important the community feels our hard-won democratic freedoms are not compromised.</para>
<para>I respect the ultimate sacrifice of so many Australians in the fight to defend freedom, and I believe we honour their sacrifice with our vigilance and defence of freedom and of Australian values. Migrants to Australia since the Second World War fled dictatorships in their personal search for freedom and a safe place to bring up their families. Many of those migrants came to the part of Sydney I represent. Whether from war-torn Europe, Asia or Africa, those families have an acute sense of freedom because they often felt the harshness of brutal, undemocratic dictatorships first-hand. So it is absolutely essential in our defence of freedom that we do not give an inch to the terrorists, and it is essential that we defend the pillars of freedom in Australia that so many have sacrificed their lives to defend.</para>
<para>At the state and federal level Labor has pushed the Howard government for better safeguards in the antiterror laws. Labor supported the COAG decision for nationally consistent counter-terrorism laws. We supported it because for four years we have been calling for such an approach. We need strong, balanced laws. However, when the ACT Chief Minister, Jon Stanhope, posted the draft legislation on his web site it was glaringly obvious close scrutiny was required. The Attorney-General, in his highly cynical, arrogant way, criticised Jon Stanhope for releasing the draft legislation but then later claimed Jon Stanhope’s actions had helped community consultation about the bill. I pay tribute to Jon Stanhope’s action. We should be used to such cynicism, however, from the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General is the high priest of cynicism and does not even blush when wearing his Amnesty International badge.</para>
<para>It was only under Labor pressure that the government caved in, giving the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee until today to report back. Thankfully, the legislation we see here today is very different from the draft posted on the web site of the ACT Chief Minister almost a month ago. Its evolution reflects Labor’s determination to get the balance right, to demand the time to carefully scrutinise the bill and to suggest changes.</para>
<para>And so in the legislation before us, <inline ref="R2469">Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline>, we have achieved the abandonment of the shoot-to-kill provisions and a much improved judicial scrutiny of control orders. At the confirmation hearing for such an order the subject will have access to a summary of the reasons for the order and will be able to make arguments about why it should not apply. Now the judge has to specifically balance the need to protect the public against the potential loss of liberty for the subject of the warrant. The redrafted bill now has clearer rights of review in preventative detention, which include the right to receive a summary of the reasons for detention and a clear requirement that the issuing authority must re-examine the police case. There is also the right to judicial review of the lawfulness of the preventative detention order and a right to a merits review with possible compensation after the detention. And, importantly, there is now a legislated independent review after five years.</para>
<para>The Labor premiers and chief ministers have forced the Howard government to dramatically alter its plans in the key areas of control orders and preventative detention orders. The Labor premiers’ success in having these powers totally rewritten must be acknowledged. Judicial oversight of these matters was a threshold issue that federal Labor set out prior to the COAG meeting. This legislation would be unacceptable without those changes. The amendment moved in this House by Labor leader Kim Beazley includes measures to further strengthen the review and accountability mechanisms. For example, Labor’s amendment to the bill calls for the creation of a federal public interest monitor to provide that protection for all Australians. Labor’s amendment also calls for the creation of a police integrity commission to oversee the Australian Federal Police. This is particularly important given their greater powers. We also need to change the sunset clause. Ten years is not a real sunset clause; it is a political lifetime. Labor’s amendment reduces that to five years, with an independent review after 2½ years. This parliament imposed a three-year sunset clause on the 2002 antiterrorism laws, together with an independent review. The United Kingdom’s 2005 antiterror laws are subject to a one-year review. These are all important measures in getting the balance right, and the government should support Labor’s amendment.</para>
<para>The government has clearly not got the balance right when it comes to sedition. I consider the offence of sedition to be absurd. It is a nasty add-on by a nasty, cynical government. In Australia there has always been a big difference between comedy and crime. We have always been big enough to accept that having a laugh at the expense of a politician was a national sport, not a threat to national security. Unfortunately, the Howard government wants to change all that with the proposed new sedition laws. The government’s proposed laws define ‘seditous intent’ as an intention ‘to bring the Sovereign into hatred or contempt’ or to urge ‘disaffection’ against the Constitution, the government of the Commonwealth or either house of parliament. Given the current crop of government ministers, you can see why comedians are worried!</para>
<para>The offence of sedition is a serious impingement on free speech, and it has been rightly relegated to the dustbin of history. I understand that the last prosecution for sedition was in 1960 when Brian Cooper, an officer of the Department of Native Affairs, was prosecuted for urging ‘the natives’ of Papua New Guinea to demand independence from Australia. Now the Howard government wants us to ignore the lessons of history and resurrect these dangerous laws. Sedition laws only exist in Zimbabwe, North Korea, Malaysia, Syria, China, Cuba and Singapore—hardly a model for Australia. Little wonder that artists, musicians and comedians have expressed their concern about the proposed new sedition offence. The fact is that under this law no genuine commentator or religious or ethnic group leader wishing to participate in legitimate debate on the topic of terrorism could be certain that his or her conduct would necessarily fall outside the ambit of the offences in this bill.</para>
<para>There is no doubt that the proposed new sedition offence raises fundamental issues of freedom of speech. It may well criminalise support for independence movements such as the African National Congress. These laws could criminalise much of the political activity which parliamentarians engage in. I certainly have no intention of being silenced on political issues as a result of these laws: I will continue to be outspoken on issues of environmental sustainability, I will continue to be outspoken on social justice and I will continue to be outspoken in opposition to Australia’s involvement in the Iraq war. The sedition offence is absurd, and the notion that I could be jailed for doing my job is absurd. The Attorney-General admitted the sedition laws in this bill are faulty by announcing a review of them in the same speech in which he introduced them. In question time, the Attorney-General could not even explain to parliament how these sedition laws will work. He claimed that he could not discuss them because they are still being negotiated with the states—yet the sedition laws are solely a federal government initiative. The sedition laws are not an integral part of the antiterror laws. It is absurd to ask the parliament to vote on laws that are known to be deficient and will immediately be subjected to a review launched by the very person who introduced them. The proper course is for the parliament to accept Labor’s amendment, delete the sedition provisions altogether from the bill, have the review and then introduce decent laws that say clearly and unequivocally what the parliament wants them to.</para>
<para>During this speech I want to take the opportunity to appeal for tolerance of and support for our multicultural society. There is no doubt that the occurrences of racist attacks against members of the Islamic community have increased in recent years. The ideology of al-Qaeda contradicts Islam, just as the actions of fundamentalist Christian Eric Robert Rudolph, whose most notorious bombing was during the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, contradict Christianity and just as the act of Jewish extremist Yigal Amir, who assassinated Yitzhak Rabin, contradicts Judaism. The media must resist sensationalising these issues. Piers Akerman stated in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily</inline> <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph</inline> that the ‘problem for Muslims is not the handful of unfortunate attacks by half-baked rednecks’ but the support they have received from politicians ‘such as Anthony Albanese’ which has prevented Muslims from ‘integrating fully into the community’ and has ‘ensured their ongoing isolation’. I rang Mr Akerman and invited him to my electorate of Grayndler to see how multiculturalism works in promoting respect, tolerance and harmony.</para>
<para>Just last Wednesday I attended Marrickville High School’s Multicultural Day. Students performed dance and music from their cultural background, there were 15 magnificent food stalls and parents and community members made the day a major event. For just a dollar you could have a falafel from Lebanon, pig from a hungi from Tonga, satay from Indonesia, souvlaki from Greece, prawn rolls from Vietnam or other delights. The highlight had to be the Japanese school group sharing a traditional dance with Indigenous youth.</para>
<para>Yes, I am proud to be a supporter of the Islamic community, as I am proud to be a supporter of the various Christian denominations, as I am proud to be a supporter of the Hindu community and as I am proud to be a supporter of the Jewish community. The suggestion that this makes me a bigger problem than the racist rednecks who attack Muslims is extraordinary and offensive. Attacks based on race or religion should not be easily dismissed. Two weeks ago, Mr Harry Walia, a Sikh travelling to work, was attacked on Tempe station. He was verbally abused as ‘Osama’, jostled and had his turban removed and thrown away. I have spoken to Mr Walia, who was very shaken by these events. The <inline font-style="italic">Daily</inline> <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph</inline> was responsible in its reporting of this event.</para>
<para>Tolerance must be cherished. It is the terrorists who are defined by their lack of tolerance. We must oppose intolerance in all its forms. Labor will not allow terrorism to undermine or destroy our society or the principles upon which it is built and which so many have fought for and died to protect. Labor will act in the national interest, as we always have, to place the safety and wellbeing of Australians first. We will be pursuing our amendments here and in the Senate.</para>
<para>There is a difference between the situation now and what Labor were able to achieve in 2002 and 2003. Now the government has a majority in both houses of parliament. That requires a change in Labor’s strategy, but we are fighting for these amendments to be carried. We fought for the Senate committee, and I am pleased that at least some of that has been recognised. I would urge the government, particularly its senators, to look closely at Labor’s amendments and concerns and to vote for the amendments. If in the end the government rejects these amendments, we will go to the Australian people committed to making these amendments part of an initiative of a Beazley Labor government.</para>

<para>—I rise to support the counter-terrorism legislative reforms. The first point that needs to be made is that, of course, the history of terrorism is a long one. People tend to think of it as a relatively new phenomenon, but in fact it has gone on not only for centuries but for millennia. I am reminded of a trip that I made to Israel to see the situation there. I visited the fortification of Masada at the Dead Sea, where the Maccabees held off the Romans, and recalled that at the time the Maccabees were effectively a terrorist organisation in Israel. I stated in my first speech that the issue of terrorism is real in the Australian context. Some were not too convinced about this, feeling that the threat we face was predominantly offshore and would never strike here. With the arrests that recently occurred, I have to say I feel somewhat vindicated.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Disaffected people are now using terrorism more as a means of achieving their aims. This has been increasing over recent decades as nation-states have become more powerful. You have these disaffected people who no longer have the military power or wherewithal to take on full-blown nation-states, so they resort to terrorist attack. We have seen a fair bit of terrorism in the last three or four decades. One needs only to think of the IRA, the Red Brigades, the Baader-Meinhof gang, the PLO and many others. As I stated, terrorism is not new; it has been around for a long time. There is something that is new, however, and that is the reach that terrorism now has. For the first time in history, terrorism is global. We have seen strikes in all sorts of places around the world. People are now coming to the realisation that terrorism is real.</para>
<para>If the <inline ref="R2469">Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline> had been presented 10 years ago and I was in parliament then, I would not have supported it, as I would have thought it was too extreme at the time to suit the circumstances. However, the line between social liberties and security is an ever-moving one; it does not remain stationary. It has to be said that the line has very definitely shifted towards the security side of the equation. Worldwide events have necessitated this. This is not a bill that the government particularly likes to introduce; it is necessary in order to maintain the security and safety of the Australian people.</para>
<para>There have been some pretty extreme views on this bill. For instance, JM Coetzee claimed that with the bill we are halfway towards the apartheid regime. As someone who lived under apartheid, I have to say that is absolutely extreme. We are nowhere near the situation of apartheid in South Africa. That is certainly not the type of society that I would support. I love this country—I love the freedoms that we have. And I love the securities that have been put in place without imposing too much on our freedoms. However, we can see the necessity of these measures with the recent arrests of suspected terrorists in Melbourne and Sydney. This is a pretty scary thought in Australia. Australia has prided itself on its understanding and acceptance of people from all walks of life. After all, Australia did accept me as a citizen and I have the great honour of now serving in this nation’s parliament. There are not too many countries in the world where first-generation migrants would have this opportunity. However, we have to safeguard our people, even when for a short period we must move the line between security and freedom somewhat towards the security side of the equation.</para>
<para>The member for Jagajaga and the member for Grayndler stated that our involvement in Iraq has made us more of a terrorist target. Quite frankly, this is not true. The member for Grayndler went further when he stated that we went into Iraq based on lies around the issue of weapons of mass destruction. The point is that no-one at the time thought that weapons of mass destruction did not exist in Iraq or that Saddam Hussein was not embarking on a weapons program. This was a nation where the leader, Saddam Hussein, was bucking the United Nations weapons inspectors. A normal suspicion to have would be: why is a person bucking the system and preventing weapons inspectors from going there? The reality is that every single country in the world, including those that opposed the invasion of Iraq, such as Russia, France, Germany and so on, believed at the time that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.</para>
<para>As far as the issue of Iraqi involvement making us more of a target goes, I point out that the first Bali attack, for instance, occurred prior to the Iraqi war. I also point out that in Spain, for example, there were the Madrid bombings in railway stations that ended up with a change of government and the Spanish troops being pulled out of Iraq. Any normal person would think that, if the objective of the terrorism was to remove troops from Iraq, as far as Spain was concerned it is mission accomplished. There was another terrorist attack on the above-ground railway, thwarted by the Spanish authorities, subsequent to the Spanish pull-out from Iraq. There are many other places where there has been no involvement in Iraq and yet there have been terrorist attacks. For instance, in Russia, there was the situation with Beslan and Chechnya. There was also the situation in Turkey and many other places.</para>
<para>The member for Grayndler paid tribute to Chief Minister Stanhope for posting the bill on the net. The real irony with the situation was that Stanhope was asked whether he would be prepared to post all of his ACT bills on the net and of course he said, ‘No, I wouldn’t.’ Why not, if it is an issue of public scrutiny of bills prior to them being voted on?</para>
<para>The fact is that in many ways Iraq is now a focus of the terrorist effort. Effort that would be expended in other areas of the world is now being focused on Iraq. It must be noted that by far the majority of terrorist attacks in Iraq are conducted by Syrians, Saudis and Iranians, not by Iraqis.</para>
<para>When I went to Israel I was somewhat disturbed by some of the views that some Palestinians put forward, and I am concerned about the peace process in Israel. I wonder how serious they are about the peace process. The issue that concerns me is that they were not able to describe their log of claims or what they wanted from Israel in a very clear fashion. It makes me wonder if in fact among the leadership—and I am not talking about the people of Palestine here, because the people of Palestine clearly would want peace—they see that it is actually preferable having the status quo, whereby they can blame Israel for any problems that they have within their own government.</para>
<para>The member for Grayndler said that the issue of sedition is a nasty add-on. It is rather interesting that he mentioned some of the issues that people can go to jail for with sedition. He was saying that this is a nasty bill to be putting up because it means that people who excite disaffection against the government and the Constitution could go to jail or that people who bring the sovereign into hatred or contempt could go to jail. The fact is that this is already in the legislation: it is in the Crimes Act. As the member for Grayndler pointed out, no-one has been charged with sedition for a period of 45 years. If we are talking about people’s freedom to express themselves, consider racial vilification laws. These are accepted. People are put in jail for saying racist things and I think the majority of people in the House would probably say, ‘Yes, that is a good thing to do.’ However, the sedition laws are in effect about doing exactly the same thing—except that in the case of sedition laws the offence can actually lead to death. There are a whole lot of other issues that I could clearly discuss here but I can see that my time has run out. So, with that, I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>—When we consider legislation of the scope of the <inline ref="R2469">Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline>, we ought as a parliament first remind ourselves of the inherent features of our democratic system, noting its great strengths and capacities. Any major changes to this system that are proposed by a government need to take into account whether in the first instance the proposed laws will weaken or strengthen our democratic practice. This means inquiring into whether the laws will damage the foundations of a system built, as ours is, on a number of complementary planks which include the separation of powers, the rule of law, parliamentary representation and the implied and explicit rights of the people in the democracy.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The corollary of this inquiry is that the parliament has a responsibility to ensure that it accedes to laws which protect the lives of its citizens. In the context of the time in which we live, the government clearly has an obligation to protect the lives of Australians against acts of terrorism, and that is universally accepted in this House. The question, though, is whether laws aimed at protecting lives are drafted in such a way as to lessen rights and, if this is so, whether the case has been made that such a lessening or weakening of the democratic system is justified in the circumstances. As the shadow Attorney-General said recently, terrorism is not an excuse to abandon the established norms of criminal law. Additionally, we need to ask: are laws of the magnitude of the <inline ref="R2469">Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline> being proposed in good faith?</para>
<para>To answer those questions we need to consider both the circumstances of their introduction and their content, and we need to scrutinise the arguments advanced by those proposing the changes. As it turns out, the circumstances surrounding these proposals are those that have obtained for some period of time, and the threat level to Australia from terrorism has not formally increased. Up to the time of the announcement of the proposed laws, neither had there been a specific call by relevant agencies for more powers. The member for Grayndler referred to this very point in the House recently. Indeed, to the question, ‘Do you need more powers?’ put less than 12 months ago, I think, to the then Director-General of ASIO, Mr Dennis Richardson, the answer was no.</para>
<para>The bill already passed by this parliament—the <inline ref="R2464">Anti-Terrorism Bill 2005</inline>—and various provisions contained in federal and state legislation provide wide powers for police and intelligence services—and police were able to use these powers in the recent arrest of alleged terrorists in Sydney and Melbourne. In any event, it would be reasonable to assume that the call for any additional powers would be accompanied by, firstly, a detailed outline of why such powers were needed and, secondly, by the granting of sufficient opportunity for the parliament and the community to scrutinise the proposals before they came into the House for debate and for vote. In the legislation we are now debating, neither of these requirements has been met. In fact, the latter requirement was not offered. Indeed, the first requirement—some convincing justification for the laws as drafted—is still missing; and it is only due to the release by ACT Chief Minister Jon Stanhope of an early draft of the bill that the second requirement—community and parliamentary overview—has been partially met. This House and the people of Australia owe Mr Stanhope a great debt of gratitude for his role. He provided the necessary transparency—and, in fact, he provided some of the substance of the laws—so that the people to whom the laws would apply would have the opportunity to consider them.</para>
<para>This is not about legal intention—as has sometimes been discussed by legal authorities making submissions to the Senate committee and in other places—but political intention. The very basis of the laws as initially proposed—as the Chief Minister’s press release on the guarantees given by the Prime Minister stated—was, amongst other things, that they be based on clear evidence that they were needed, that the desired effect could not be achieved in a less onerous way, that they be effective against terrorism, that they comply with Australia’s obligations under international law, that they involve rigorous safeguards, that they conform to the principle of proportionality, that they contain sunset clauses and that they be subject to judicial review.</para>
<para>Yet the initial draft legislation was something altogether different; it was a different beast from the legislation agreed to by the Chief Minister, the premiers and the Prime Minister. Firstly, there was a substantial reduction of the existing and longstanding legal rights which are a hallmark of our democratic system. These rights were embedded in the legal principle of habeas corpus as it flowed through the history and legal development of the Judeo-Christian era and certainly into our own common law. I refer, of course, to the presumption of innocence, the right to know the charges that have been brought against you and have them heard as soon as possible in a duly constituted court, the right to privilege contact with a lawyer and the presumption that the onus of proof stands with those making the charges. These are rights that underpin Australia’s legal and political system—one underpins the other. Secondly, the laws in their initial draft form did not conform to the principle of proportionality nor to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Australia is a signatory—and, even in their proposed amended state, I do not believe they conform to the latter view. Thirdly, the judicial review turned out to be a review by retired judges. Fourthly, a greatly expanded and notorious offence which had fallen into disuse—namely, sedition—was reinvigorated and included. Finally, there was to be a brutal curtailment of the opportunity for examination and understanding of the laws by all of us.</para>
<para>It is impossible to escape the conclusion that this bill is as much about politics as it is about policy. As one commentator remarked recently, in the absence of compelling reasons from the Prime Minister, the challenge by former High Court Chief Justice Sir Gerard Brennan that ‘laws impairing rights and freedoms cannot be justified unless they are shown to be needed to target an identifiable, present danger to the community’ remains unmet. The charge that this is about atmospherics and not serious policy-making on the part of the government is impossible for the Prime Minister and Attorney-General to avoid.</para>
<para>Let us turn to context for a moment—and who can forget the following morsels from this period? There was the Prime Minister’s threat to exclude the ACT Chief Minister from the COAG deliberations—as it happens, for a period of time this threat was carried out. We had the floating of shoot-to-kill provisions, an intention to limit the Senate committee process to 24 hours—preposterous, scandalous and cheap suggestions made by this government on legislation which goes to the very heart of the kind of country we live in. These are just a few of a series of unwarranted and plainly antidemocratic actions and statements by this government and, regrettably, they are typical of the way the debate went in its early period. It was about managing the issue. This raises serious questions about the fitness of the government—and, in particular, the Attorney-General—for office.</para>
<para>I now turn to the sedition provisions—one of the features of the proposed laws that has caused great concern especially for the artistic community around Australia but also for publishers and the public as well. Until October 2005, sedition laws were dead-letter laws in Australia; they were unused, virtually unknown and without legal credibility of any kind. Sedition laws are on the statute books in countries such as Zimbabwe, Cuba, North Korea, and Singapore but they are on the way out in most democracies—except, it seems, Australia. With their vague and ultimately political nature, sedition laws have no place in our country. In the first place, the sedition laws, as drafted, extended far wider than the violent terrorist acts they were presumably meant to deal with. Numerous legal organisations and senior practitioners, including Peter Gray, senior counsel from the Sydney bar, who provided an opinion to me— <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>—Two weeks ago, 200,000 Victorians rallied in the streets of Melbourne against the government’s planned changes to industrial relations laws. I was proud to march shoulder to shoulder with those Victorians. The government’s IR plans will have a fundamental effect upon the lives of all Australians, not just those in the work force. For workers, the changes to working conditions will remove their rights, protections and bargaining power. There will be no more protection against unfair dismissal, no more Industrial Relations Commission setting minimum wages and no more no disadvantage test to ensure that no employee is worse off when the boss offers them an individual agreement.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The mood when people were going by public transport to that rally was one of great resolve and determination. This was not a carnival that people were going to; this was serious business. Those who think that people were ordered to go there completely underestimate the situation. For them and for me, this was a decision of the heart and the head. As somebody who has lived in the industrial northern suburbs of Melbourne and has seen the conditions that workers have achieved for themselves, the heart and the emotion were important, but my head declares that this legislation is just wrong. The actions of the government and the piece of legislation that has passed through this chamber to the Senate are wrong.</para>
<para>At the end of the day, the Prime Minister will not guarantee that no worker will be worse off, because he cannot. What we can be sure of is that, given the nature of the work force in an electorate like Scullin, there will be a much higher rate of workers worse off there than in other places. Interestingly, the annual salary review of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>, published earlier this month, found that the chief executives of Australia’s 300 biggest share-market listed companies received an average pay increase of 16 per cent in 2005. It is an interesting level playing field that these people have!</para>
<para>Of course, in this great shareholder democracy that the government tells us we are developing, these chief executives are to be challenged at the annual general meetings! I think not. This is the problem with this government: they do not understand the basis of a truly level playing field. The average total pay packet for a CEO in one of those top 300 companies is $1.9 million or $36,538 per week. The majority of families in Scullin live on an income of $34,235 a year. Where is the fairness? Daily, the workers of Scullin confront the challenges of globalisation threatening their jobs, the uncertainties brought about by casualisation and the shift to self-employed contracting. Self-employed contracting is represented not by small businesses but by people taking over all the risk and buying themselves a job. They will be greatly affected by the IR changes proposed by this government.</para>
<para>As you know, I was disappointed by the way the government treated the parliamentary processes in curtailing parliamentary debate on the legislation. As you know, I was just pipped by the limited one-hour consideration in detail debate. There were concerns. The member for Corangamite claimed that there had been no concerns; I hope that he has now read the Senate committee report. But there are other concerns that need to be debated. That is why the parliamentary processes should have continued.</para>
<para>A few instances of particular concern include the revelation that workers will require a medical certificate every time they take sick leave—even for a single day. Page 117 of the bill indicates that this is the case. Surely even a mean-spirited group such as the Howard government could not be this extreme. The law gives employers unprecedented new powers to hire and fire at will. It is even possible, under these new laws, for an existing employee to be sacked for so-called ‘operational reasons’, with no ability to claim unfair dismissal—only to be replaced by a new, cheaper employee employed on an individual contract that contains just five minimum conditions.</para>
<para>A worker employed under an enterprise bargaining agreement can be given 90 days notice by the employer of their intention to terminate this employment agreement. Their employment conditions will revert to the five minimum conditions. The legislation will ban unions from workplaces with individual contracts, even when all the employees are union members. As well as understanding that this is an attack on Australian unions, Australian workers understand that, whether they are unionists or nonunionists, their employment rights and conditions are well and truly under attack. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Within the federal electorate of Hasluck there is a truly remarkable arts facility, described by the Governor of Western Australia, His Excellency Lieutenant General John Sanderson, as the operatic equivalent of the Australian Institute of Sport. Established in 2002, the Midland based Australian Opera Studio has a growing international reputation for producing world-class opera singers.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Already two Western Australians from the first class of graduates—Emma Pearson and Brett Carter—have been recruited to the Wiesbaden Opera Company in Germany. Other successful graduates include Anita Watson from New South Wales, who has won a full-time contract with the Cologne Opera House, and David Thelander from South Australia, who from 2006 will be performing with the Frankfurt Opera. Indeed, five of the six graduates have secured employment with world renowned opera companies.</para>
<para>The Australian Opera Studio is a fantastic asset for Western Australia and for Australia as a whole. The operatic training system developed by the Australian Opera Studio has attracted the attention of opera companies both at home and abroad. Indeed, the British government is funding a new opera studio for the Millennium Centre in Cardiff that is based on the Australian Opera Studio model and the program developed by the Australian Opera Studio’s director.</para>
<para>The Australian Opera Studio contributes around $1.3 million annually to the Midland economy but remarkably receives no federal or state funding. Instead, the Opera Studio relies on private sponsors and on the generosity of an overseas benefactor to provide the two years of intensive training for each of its students at a cost to the Opera Studio of $125,000 per student per year. That operatic education covers voice training, physical fitness, acting skills, fashion and deportment, make-up and personal grooming, as well as stage fighting with knives, swords and fists. It is a rigorous program, offered only to the very best of the candidates who audition for the six places available each year.</para>
<para>This means that the Opera Studio struggles to find the money to stage the full range of performances needed to ‘round-off’ the operatic education of its students. The Opera Studio’s founder and director, Mr Gregory Yurisich—who was one of the world’s leading baritones for more than a decade and, indeed, was described by Placido Domingo as his favourite baritone—estimates that staging a performance at His Majesty’s Theatre in Perth costs the Australian Opera Studio in excess of $250,000, and that is after taking into account revenue from ticket sales. Even a small-scale performance at an outdoor event can cost in excess of $70,000.</para>
<para>To secure the long-term future of the Australian Opera Studio in Midland and Australia, the studio needs support from the state and federal governments. To operate to its full potential and deliver the training program originally envisaged for it, the Australian Opera Studio is seeking funding from the two tiers of government.</para>
<para>I am pleased to say that in recent weeks, since taking up the baton for the Australian Opera Studio, it has received a great letter from Senator the Hon. Rod Kemp, Minister for Arts and Sport, acknowledging the work of the studio and presenting suggestions for future funding arrangements. Recent visits by the government members committee for small business, tourism, sport and the arts, the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education and, most recently, the Treasurer have also been very welcome. Indeed, the performances put on by the students at the Australian Opera Studio for the visitors were stupendous and scaled the heights of excellence. The Australian Opera Studio concept and program can be delivered as easily in Singapore, Spain or Germany as it can in Australia. In these countries, support from government would be forthcoming.</para>
<para>Students at the Australian Opera Studio do not pay fees, but they are responsible for their living expenses and must support themselves during their two-year course. One of the attractions of locating the Opera Studio in Midland, within my own electorate of Hasluck, is its great affordability. It was the reason why Perth was selected as the location for the Opera Studio. It is also the reason why Australia can boast a world-class arts-training institution that is admired in Europe, North America and South-East Asia. Indeed, by special request the Australian Opera Studio has recently taken on two students from China, where opera has become a national passion. I ask the House to recognise and support the Australian Opera Studio.</para>

<para>—As members of parliament, we meet thousands of people every year and hear many real life stories—some sad, some happy and some full of hope. We try to assist people in whatever way we can. I suppose as members of parliament we become accustomed to hearing about and dealing with terrible situations, but every now and then a person tells a story that stands out to such a degree that you find yourself saying that there must be something that can be done to change this situation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>One such situation is that faced by many thousands of Australian families who care for their disabled children. On 24 September 2002 I raised the plight of such a group—families living on the Central Coast of New South Wales who spend each and every day fighting for their children: fighting for their lives, fighting for services, fighting for aid and fighting for respite. I was overwhelmed by the dedication of these parents and the extreme adversity that they had to face each day. The love and care that they gave to their children was phenomenal and the hurdles that they had to overcome every day were beyond imagination. They were doing the work of registered nurses, resuscitating their children on a regular basis. Their situation truly moved me. I was overwhelmed by the fact that these families did not have the resources they needed to do the job that we were asking them to do. At that time I made a plea on their behalf to parliament, and I would like to do that once again.</para>
<para>Last Thursday I visited Karen Pavitt at Chain Valley Bay. She was again pleading for help so that she could continue looking after her daughter Tori. Tori is a bright, captivating young five-year old who will be commencing school next year, but unfortunately for Tori she is extremely disabled. She suffers from spinal muscular atrophy. It is a genetic condition and results in severe neuromuscular weakness, with progressive deterioration in motor function during the early years of life. She is unable to sit independently. She is unable to stand. She has extremely limited use of her arms and legs. She has severe scoliosis and is susceptible to recurrent chest infections. She has multiple hospital admissions each year and relies on a ventilator to keep her breathing when she is asleep, as well as at other times. She has problems with her swallowing muscles and has to be fed via a gastrostomy tube. She is totally dependent on her parents for care 24 hours a day. Her mother needs to suction Tori’s airways to keep them clear every two to three hours when she is unwell.</para>
<para>Each and every night Karen looks after Tori. She told me that she has about three hours sleep a night. Tori is incontinent and must have constant nursing care. Her parents have developed a high level of nursing skill. They look after and care for Tori and keep her going. They rely on respite for a little break. Karen gets four hours of respite per week, and that has been a lifesaver for her. In the four hours of respite that she is given, she does the shopping and pays the bills. That is all she can do.</para>
<para>HACC have introduced new guidelines that are making it harder for Karen to access respite. She has to compete against frail aged people for respite. She receives four hours from Centacare and LifeLinks on the Central Coast, but she is constantly told that there is not enough money left. Next year Tori will go to school. She will be there for 1½ hours a day, but she will have to be accompanied by a nurse and her mother will have to be at her beck and call at all times to bring in the oxygen and the respirator. I feel that as a parliament we are abrogating our responsibility if we do not do something for these families. They need more respite. We must act now to ensure that they get the respite they need. It is an enormous problem that can no longer be ignored. These families are saving governments at all levels— <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I have spoken in the parliament previously about asking the Singapore government to reconsider its position on granting clemency for Mr Nguyen Tuong Van, the young Vietnamese Australian who is due to be executed this Friday. The imminent death of this young man is a tragedy of immense proportions and it will bring terrible anguish and suffering to his family and friends. Most regrettably it now appears that, despite strong and repeated representations by the Governor-General, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and a host of members from both sides of this parliament, Mr Nguyen’s sentence will be carried out as planned on Friday, 2 December.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Like many Australians across the country and, I know, many residents in my electorate of Ryan, I am hoping against hope that a miracle will happen and this man’s life can be spared. However, for all of this country’s moral opposition to capital punishment, the fact of the matter is that capital punishment is something which many other countries still have on their statute books. It is unfortunate that no clear international consensus on the death penalty exists. While there is a move to reject the death penalty, more than 40 countries have abolished it since 1990, 75 countries still maintain it, including the world’s largest economy, the US, and the world’s most populous nation, China.</para>
<para>In the case of the US, 38 of the 50 states still have capital punishment on their statute books. Therefore, we must respect equally the fact that Singapore has capital punishment on its statute books. Singapore is a member of the Commonwealth and of the United Nations. It is a modem island nation with a prosperous economy and a dynamic population full of skill and talent. It is a sovereign nation with its own laws and its own way of doing things. We do not have to like the way that this country, or for that matter any other country, goes about its business. But the people of Australia must acknowledge and respect the fact that we are dealing with another country and another government.</para>
<para>I can understand some Australians in the community at large making emotional and spontaneous remarks. But this should not be the position of members or senators of the Australian parliament. Australians elected to the federal parliament do not have the luxury of grandstanding about the bilateral relationship or about imposing trade sanctions and cutting off defence ties. Some of the comments I have heard made by members and senators of the federal parliament are remarkable in their ignorance, recklessness, irresponsibility and effrontery to a very close neighbour in the region. Some of the intense and personal criticism of the Prime Minister is completely unwarranted. The Prime Minister of this country does not have the luxury, as others do, of behaving recklessly or irresponsibly.</para>
<para>Therefore I want to make it very clear in the parliament today and to the people whom I represent that I totally reject some of the remarks made by colleagues in the national parliament of this country. For instance, let me take the comments of Senator Bob Brown, from the Greens, who has issued a statement calling on Australia to suspend the stationing of Singapore’s military forces in Australia. This sort of call is highly irresponsible and reckless. This is not how a nation conducts its ties with regional neighbours and friends. I understand that there have also been calls from high-profile Australians such as Sharan Burrow, the president of the ACTU, to threaten that a trade embargo be carried out by the union movement if Singapore will not grant clemency. This is equally ill advised and naive. Such a call is reckless and only highlights this country’s immaturity in dealing with a significant country in South-East Asia.</para>
<para>Singapore is Australia’s largest trade partner in the ASEAN group, and our eighth largest trading partner overall. The Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement, negotiated by the Howard government and in force since July 2003, has led to an even closer economic and business relationship with that country. In 2004-05 Australian merchandise exports to Singapore were in excess of $3.3 billion, making it our 11th largest export market; our imports from Singapore were valued at some $7.3 billion, making them our fifth largest source for imports. Singapore’s investment in Australia is also substantial. Moves by the ACTU president to commence a trade embargo against Singapore will hurt more than Singapore; it will hurt our people. It will be the tens of thousands of union members whom Sharan Burrow speaks on behalf of who will suffer. This is the sort of reckless and provocative statement that has no place in a strong and vibrant relationship between two mature and close regional allies.</para>
<para>It would be a terrible position to try to link our overall bilateral relationship with this tragedy. Our relationships in trade and defence and our economic ties and cooperation in APEC, together with our common stance against the war on terror, should stand on their own and never be brought into this equation. Nothing is served or achieved by members of the federal parliament or other Australians who enjoy a high profile in the community acting like cowboys, calling for a coupling of trade and defence issues with the matter of one Australian citizen facing the death penalty. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I rise tonight in the adjournment debate to talk about the current auction of a flag made by Australian World War II prisoners of war in the Changi prison camp. The flag is currently for sale on eBay and has a price tag of $20,000. As yet there are no bids for the flag and the auction is set to conclude in five days time, at 11.17 pm on Saturday, 3 December 2005. The description provided on eBay states:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">It is made from fabric, probably pilfered or scrounged from whatever bits could be found. The white stars appear to be made from bandage. Of course it is all hand sewn.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">According to the webpage: ‘At the immediate end of the war the Japanese flag was lowered and this flag was the first to be flown at the Changi POW camp—that is, until Corporal Jim M. Kelly climbed the flagpole and souvenired it.’ Mr Kelly bought the flag back to Australia and was in possession of it until, sadly, he passed away in 1984. Mr Kelly’s relatives placed the flag over his casket during his funeral ceremony. As we mark and commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II this year, it is important that we remember the sacrifices made by men and women like Mr Kelly and by the more than 22,000 Australians who became prisoners of war of the Japanese in South-East Asia during World War II.</para>
<para>Of the POW’s captured and held by the Japanese in World War II a majority of about 21,000 came from the Army, 354 came from the Royal Australian Navy and 373 from the Royal Australian Air Force. The Army prisoners were largely from the 8th Division, captured at the fall of Singapore. Australian troops were also captured on Java, Timor, Ambon and New Britain. Prisoners of war were formed into work parties to provide forced labour for the Japanese army. Throughout the war Changi, in Singapore, was the main camp from which working parties were sent to other destinations, such as the infamous Burma-Thailand railway, and through which prisoners of war captured in other areas were staged. Most of the Australians captured in Singapore were moved into Changi on 17 February 1942. They occupied Selarang Barracks, which remained the AIF Camp at Changi until June 1944. For many, Selarang was just a transit stop before working parties were dispatched to other camps in Singapore and Malaya.</para>
<para>Prisoners were used on heavy labouring works in and around the Asia-Pacific region. Tasks included rail and road building, freight moving, mine removal and work in chemical factories. These troops suffered from diseases such as beriberi, malaria and dysentery, as well as malnutrition and physical exhaustion. In May 1944, all the allied prisoners in Changi, now including 5,000 Australians, were concentrated in the immediate environs of Changi jail, which up until this time had been used to detain civilian internees. In this area 11,700 prisoners were crammed into less than a quarter of a square kilometre, and this period underlies Changi’s place in popular memory. Rations were cut, camp life was increasingly restricted, and in July the authority of allied senior officers over their troops was revoked. Changi was liberated by troops of the 5th Indian Division on 5 September and within a week troops were being repatriated. Of the 22,376 Australian prisoners of war captured by the Japanese, some 8,031 died while in captivity.</para>
<para>For the Australian POWs, the making of such flags was a symbol of defiance, pride and obvious loyalty to their country and they took great risks in making them and hiding them from the Japanese guards. This flag, and other flags like it, helped to offer hope to those World War II veterans in what must have been some of their darkest hours. Today the flag helps to remind all Australians of the displays of courage and perseverance our veterans showed in the face of overwhelming oppression and hardship. This is not just a simple flag but a symbol of some of the best values and ideals of our World War II veterans and POWs. It is a physical and tangible symbol of the sacrifices made by the men and women who fought and died to protect our country. It is because this flag is so unique and has such important significance in our national wartime history that we must ensure it remains in Australia and in Australian hands. This flag is an important national symbol and we must ensure that it is given the due respect it deserves.</para>
<para>The reasons outlined above highlight the need for this government and the minister to give immediate, mature and serious consideration to the future of this flag. Time is not on our side, however, and any such considerations need to be made with haste. The auction of this flag will close in five days time and is open to buyers from around the world. There is currently no guarantee that potential buyers will come from Australia or that the flag will not be taken from our shores, never to be seen in Australia again. If this is allowed to happen, we will all lose an important and valuable part of our national wartime heritage. I would like to conclude tonight by quoting a story on part of the flag’s history from the seller’s eBay web page. The seller states:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In one of the newspaper clippings there is a story from another POW present at the time this flag was first raised (replacing the Japanese flag) that an English soldier standing in the crowd of POWs remarked that “you Australians don’t know how to make a Union Jack”. Technically the union jack part of the flag is incorrect, but I am sure that every Aussie there was very proud and overjoyed at the sight of it.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">There is no doubt that this is an important national icon. It is something that should be kept in Australia and in Australian hands. I urge the government to look at what action they can take to ensure that that is what does occur. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I rise to acknowledge a particular school community in the Bonner electorate that I feel deserves both congratulations and support—that is, Murarrie State School. In May this year I had the great pleasure of contacting the principal, Tina Gruss, to advise of the school’s successful application under the government’s Enterprise Learning for the 21st Century initiative. The program seeks to fund innovative and creative new projects that will develop enterprising young Australians. Murarrie’s Eco Kids Enterprise Venture project seeks to do just that. The project was one of 29 selected from across Australia to be funded and this has certainly been a great achievement in itself. Awarded $6,853 from this government, the Eco Kids Enterprise Venture project has been wholeheartedly embraced by the students.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The school has united and is currently working towards achieving their vision of a BMX track and bike workshop for the school. A vision team has emerged and students are participating in one hour a week lessons on how to develop a vision concept. Through this, students are gaining increased knowledge of business protocols, workplace health and safety issues, marketing, designing and budgeting. The school has even now presented its proposals to the local authorities and government representatives for assistance in implementing the vision. The entire school community is behind this project and it is wonderful to see them working towards this common goal. The students have developed a vision and now they have set about trying to make it happen and this is exactly the kind of skill that we should be trying to teach our children.</para>
<para>The project has my full support, as does the principal, Ms Tina Gruss, who has worked tirelessly to unite the Murarrie community and improve the school’s image. Just recently I was able to donate the first BMX bike to the school and I plan to continue working with the students and staff to muster support from the local community for this project. Through a cooperative effort, the students’ proposed plans for a BMX track will become a reality and they will be able to experience the joy and reward of achieving a dream that they have worked hard to develop, sell and then finally implement. As a former small businessman, I am encouraged by this government’s commitment to fostering an enterprising spirit among our young Australians who will ultimately be our future leaders and business men and women. Through my involvement with Murarrie State School I have been able to witness the grassroots effect of initiatives such as Enterprise Learning for the 21st Century and I can say with confidence that these programs deliver results and encourage real business skills.</para>
<para>This evening I would also like to take the opportunity to congratulate the seven Bayside national servicemen who appeared in the local newspaper, the <inline font-style="italic">Wynnum Herald</inline>. These men are members of the Bayside branch of servicemen and were recent recipients of Australian national service medals. Ray Newell, Mick Richardson, Nev Kruger, Maurie Friend, Ray Morgan, Ken Martin and Bob Connolly were all called up for training in the first national service scheme between 1951 and 1959. Their dedication and service to this country is to be commended and it has been a great experience to share in the fellowship that these men have formed as members of the Bayside branch. Serviceman and local constituent, Allan Callaghan, has proved a strong link between my office and the Bayside branch of which he is also a member. Mr Callaghan has worked hard to unite the organisation and keep the men regularly updated and I feel that he deserves special mention and acknowledgment for his efforts. The men are doing a wonderful job in the local community and they have my continued support and encouragement.</para>
