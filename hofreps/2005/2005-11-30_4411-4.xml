<para>âLabor opposes the <inline ref="R2461">Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline> because Australia needs real welfare reform. After nine long years of talking about welfare reform, all we have here today is the Howard government legislating to import the worst of the American social security system. All the Howard government is doing today is creating a new army of working poor, vulnerable Australians who have no choices and very few chances to share in our nationâs wealth. This is the Americanisation of our social security system. It is not welfare reform. It is a fraud on the most vulnerable in our society.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The extraordinary arrogance of the Howard government is demonstrated by their brazen decision to call this fraud âwelfare to workâ. All this bill will do is dump people from one welfare payment to a lower welfare payment. This is not the Australian way. Australians look out for each other when they are down on their luck. We give people a hand so that they can get back on their feet. That will not happen any more in Australia, as a result of these changes.</para>
<para>There are a number of measures in the bill, and I want to go through the main ones. First of all, the bill will abolish the parenting payment for sole parents with the youngest child aged eight or more and for partnered parents with the youngest child aged six or more. The current cut-off age is 16. Existing recipients of the payment at 1 July 2006 will stay on parenting payment unless their relationship status changes or they leave the pension for 12 weeks or more.</para>
<para>Secondly, this bill abolishes the disability support pension for people with a partial capacityâthat is, people who could work 15 hours or more. Currently it is 30 hours. The new rule will be for people who can work 15 hours a week or more at award wages or who could be expected to be able to work at that level within two years, with or without rehabilitation, training or education. Existing recipients at 11 May 2005 remain qualified. Arrangements granted between 11 May 2005 and 30 June 2006 will be reviewed.</para>
<para>Thirdly, the bill modifies Newstart so that people affected by these changes can be required to seek and accept work of 15 hours or more or undertake other activities as directed by Centrelink, such as an approved program of work, Work for the Dole or any other activity. The bill also applies a Newstart style activity test to parenting payments for sole parents with the youngest child aged six or seven and to existing recipients staying on at 1 July 2006 with a child aged six or over.</para>
<para>The bill removes a number of safeguards from the Newstart legislation and replaces them with greater discretion for Centrelink in determining the obligations of recipients of this new benefit. It weakens what is called the suitable work requirement. The definition of unsuitable work currently includes work below award wages. That is changed in this bill to âbelow the minimum terms and conditions for the work under the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standardâ. I will have more to say about that later.</para>
<para>The bill changes the breaching or penalty rules to provide, amongst other things, an eight-week non-payment period for failing the activity test or the activity agreement three times in 12 months, leaving a job voluntarily, being dismissed from a job for misconduct, failing to take up a suitable job offer, and failing to participate in an approved program of work. Finally, the bill increases the obligations of mature age unemployed people and the very long-term unemployed on Newstart.</para>
<para>In effect, what we see in this bill is the Howard government just repeating a mantra. It is the Howard government in a public policy rain dance. It cannot just say that it is moving people from welfare to work. It cannot just repeat its mantra over and over again. It cannot just do a rain dance and expect employment opportunities to shower down on people. It certainly cannot expect peopleâs job opportunities to improve when it is doing only one thingâand that is cutting peopleâs income support. Australia cannot have a government plagiarising Americaâs social failures. Australia needs real welfare reform. Nobody benefits from unemployment. Everyone benefits when more people are brought in to participate in the social and economic mainstream. Labor does believe that people who can work should work, but for those who cannot work we should provide care and respect. That certainly is not what is demonstrated in this legislation.</para>
<para>What Labor wants is real welfare reform that tackles the reasons why people are not working and delivers practical solutions. We support welfare reform that goes far beyond moving people from one welfare queue to anotherâthe dole. That is what this bill will do. It will move people from one welfare queue to the dole. Real welfare reform would give people the chance to get the skills an employer needs and then get a job. Real welfare reform would make sure people get a fair reward for effort. When someone gets paid for working, their pay should not be eaten up by tax and the loss of welfare payments. Real welfare reform should encourage employers to give people with a disability the opportunity to demonstrate their ability.</para>
<para>Real welfare reform understands that being a parent is an important job in itself and that work makes families more secure. Real welfare reform helps parents find the balance between supporting their family and raising their kids. Real welfare reform involves all of these commitments, alongside fair and reasonable requirements for job seekers. But instead of real welfare reform, these welfare changes will just shuffle people from one Centrelink database to another. These changes will cut income support for the most vulnerable Australians and reduce the rewards from work. That is the real result of the legislation we are debating today. This legislation will cut income support to vulnerable Australians and reduce the rewards from work.</para>
<para>The government consistently ignores the impact of putting people on lower welfare payments. There is the immediate loss of money, but it also has a disastrous effect on peopleâs ability to work their way out of poverty. Let us look at what this will mean for money in peopleâs pockets. There is going to be a cut to the money going into peopleâs household budgets. There will be a cut of around $20 a week for single parent families. That is what this legislation will do. I see the member for Pearce in hereâI know she cares a lot about these issues. I hope she will support Labor on this issue. The bill will cut single parent family budgets by $20 a week. For people on a disability it will cut the money going into their pockets by about $40 a week. So I say to the member for Pearce: the essence of this bill is that it will cut money going into peopleâs pockets. Vulnerable Australians are going to lose between $20 and $40 a week. These are people who already have very little to live on.</para>
<para>From 1 July next year, many people who would have received the disability support pension or the single parenting payment will instead be dumped on to Newstartâwhat most people know as the dole. By 2008-09, according to the governmentâs own figures, 60,000 people with a disability who would have received the DSP will instead be on the doleâ60,000 people will have their money cut by around $40 a week because of this bill. The same goes for single parentsâ77,000 single parents trying to bring up children will be at least $20 a week worse off because of this bill. What does this government do? It throws them on the dole and cuts the money they receive to help look after their children.</para>
<para>This bill will have other disastrous effects, summed up as follows. The bill will see people on a new payment that has a lower tax-free area, higher withdrawal rates, harsher tax treatment than both the disability pension and the single parenting payment. This means in plain and ordinary language that when this government dumps these people on the dole, they will get to keep less of every dollar they earn. What sort of welfare reform is it that says to people, âWeâll cut your payment and, when you get a job, you will keep less of what you are earning than you can keep nowâ?</para>

<para>âIt is a disgrace. The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling recently undertook research on these changes. I know the member for Pearce has seen this research and I hope as a result of this research she will continue to fight against this legislation within her party room to make more changes to these bills because they are so harsh.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>There is research that has been done, which the government has not been able to refute. I think it is incredibly important that people note the actual results that this legislation will have on peopleâs capacity to take home a decent wage when they do get work. If a sole parent with one child does the right thing and works 15 hours a week, they will get to keep only $81 of their earnings, while John Howard and this government will claw back the other $114 in tax and the loss of social security payments. They will only be able to keep $81; $114 will go back to the government in tax and the loss of social security payments. That makes such a parentâand this is the critical thingâ$91 a week worse off by moving into work under these changes than if they moved into work under the current arrangements. The Howard government is effectively asking sole parents to work for a return of $3.88 an hour. For their 15 hours a week they are only $58 ahead of someone not working. That is before they pay, of course, for the costs of workâthe travel, the clothing and the care for their children.</para>
<para>The Senate inquiry heard a case study of how these changes would punish people for working more. I just want to go through this example. Sally and Claire are in identical situations. They share a house and both have seven-year-old daughters. They receive parenting payment single and work 15 hours a week in a minimum wage job at the local child-care centre, earning $200 a week in private income, with a total income of $390 a week from parenting payment single and work. In July 2006, Claire picks up additional hours at the child-care centre and as a result of the additional income her parenting payment single is cancelled. In November 2006 the child-care centre downsizes and Claireâs hours are reduced back to 15 hours a week. Under this proposed legislation, the parenting payment will be abolished for new applicants whose children are over eight from 1 July next year and the lower Newstart allowance payment rate and harsher income test will apply. As a result Claire will only receive $322 a week. That is $68 a week less than Sally.</para>
<para>So we have two sole parents in identical situations. They will receive different amounts of financial support to look after identical families. One will receive around 16 per cent less income than before the changes because she had accepted additional work which only lasted five monthsâthat is, more than the 12-week gap before the payment is cancelled. She has done the right thing: she has gone out and accepted more work. The place she is working in then downsizes. Her punishment as the result of this governmentâs action is that she will be worse off and her children will be worse off.</para>
<para>For people with a disability the situation is even worse because the disability support pension is not taxable but the dole is. That is what this government is doing: taking them off a more generous payment, putting them on the dole and then taxing them for it. According to NATSEM, if a person with a disability works 15 hours a week at the minimum wage they will only keep 25c of every dollar they earn. The Howard government will take back the other 75c. That makes such a person $122 a week worse off by moving into work under these changes than if they moved into work under current arrangements.</para>
<para>That is what welfare reform actually means for this government. You are better off going to work at the moment than you will be under the new arrangements. The tax the government is going to take will be higher and the claw-back of social security will also be higher. The Howard government is effectively asking people with a disability to work for a return of $2.27 an hour. That is, once again, before the costs of work are taken into account. People could very easily end up paying to work under these changes. That is the reality of what these changes mean. What greater symbol of incompetence could there be than promising welfare reform but delivering a policy that makes work less desirable than welfare?</para>
<para>This government has failed to provide a scrap of evidence that moving people onto the dole will help them get a job. There has been no modelling and there have been no studies or relevant international comparisons. There has been nothing; just a return to the mantra and a repetition of its point over and over again. Of course the government does not like these criticismsâit gets very annoyedâbut the best defence it offers is that existing recipients of the disability support pension and the single parenting payment will not lose their pensions. That is the only defence we have had, but all that shows is that this government knows it is doing the wrong thing and is too scared to do something so bad to the existing 400,000 single parenting payment recipients and 700,000 disability pensioners. The government knows it could not get away with hitting them with these sorts of cuts to their benefits. It is not going to do anything for these people. It is not going to give them a chance to get a job; it is not going to give them a helping hand to get work. It knows that it would be too politically dangerous to cut their benefits, so what it is going to do is just cut the benefits of the people who are going to come on to the payment from next year.</para>
<para>There are so many flaws with these changes, but the most fundamental flaw is their extraordinary incompetence. All they do is dump more people onto the dole. That is the essence of this legislation. We have seen far too little spelt out in this legislation about the new requirements for job seekers. Our concern is that as a result there will be very little protection for these new job seekers who are being thrown onto the dole. The government has promised a few sweeteners, but unfortunately we have not seen any of these in legislation. We have been assured by this government that they will appear in guidelines.</para>
<para>One of the sweetenersâand I know that the member for Sydney will talk about this, because it is something she has pursuedâwas the guarantee by the Prime Minister that a sole parent would not have to take a job that resulted in a low or negative gain from work once child care has been taken into account. We have been told that the detail of that will be in the guidelines. We hope it will, but the fact is that nobody has been able to explain what is meant by âlow gainâ, so it does not inspire very much confidence. There is just far too much evidence that you cannot trust this government when it says it will do things, particularly for the very vulnerable in our society. All that the legislation we are debating today says is that the departmental secretary will decide who has to do what to get income support.</para>
<para>Something that will take food off the tables of too many Australians is the new compliance regime. There should always be a reasonable approach to compliance. It should be an approach that encourages participation and maintains the integrity of the welfare system, but the Howard governmentâs breaching regimeâthe new penalty regimeâwill push too many vulnerable people over the edge. Stopping income support payments for two months to single parent families and people with a disabilityâfor two months they could be left without any payments and without any job whatsoever!âwill not help them. It will mean that they will not have the capacity to put food on the table for their children, let alone pay the rent.</para>
<para>As an admission of this policy failure, the government have promised that they will meet the essential bills for people. Centrelink will hand out food vouchers because the government know that families will be left with no means of support whatsoever when they ram this legislation through. No guarantee has been given that children will be unaffectedâthat they will be able to get the books they need and be able to go on school excursions like other children and keep participating in sport. There has been no commitment that children will be looked after in these ways.</para>
<para>This penalty provides for two months without any payment or any capacity for support. This legislation could result in single parents with children being left without any means of support for two monthsâall because they will not accept a job that pays below award rates. That is where we are seeing the coming together of this legislation with the Howard governmentâs extreme industrial relations changes. The two pieces of legislation collide in a very brutal way, forcing some Australians, especially those who are being thrown onto the dole, to accept very low wage jobs. The test of suitable work that a Newstart recipient has to accept has changed.</para>
<para>We know that the industrial relations changes that the government is also forcing through the Senate will see a loss of award conditions, including penalty rates, overtime and leave loadings. All of these things are about to go. All of these protections that have taken 100 years to be built up in Australia are about to go. It is not just the Labor Party that thinks that this is outrageous. We have also heard the Brotherhood of St Laurence and Anglicare, for example, arguing against moving people into working povertyâbecause that will be the result of the brutal coming together of these two pieces of legislation: the industrial relations changes and the welfare changes. The Brotherhood of St Laurence and Anglicare have called on the government to âprotect the unemployed from being coerced into accepting jobs, stripped of entitlements that the more advantaged enjoyâ. But of course the reality of this legislation shows that the government has ignored the calls from the churches, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and Anglicareâthe people out there caring for people who find themselves unemployed and unable to find work.</para>
<para>Employers will know that no matter how bad the job offer, the person has to take it or lose income support. That is the reality of the legislation we are debating today. If they do not take the job, no matter how bad the pay, they are going to lose unemployment benefits and be told that for two months they will just have to manage on their own somehow. Somehow the food has to come from goodness knows whereâthis government does not seem to care!</para>
<para>This debate is not about whether a person should have to accept a reasonable job offer. These jobs that will come about because of the industrial relations changes will offer lower wages, worse conditions and no protection from exploitation. We know that the Prime Minister has a favourite job seeker, Billy. Imagine if Billy was a single dad and he was offered an Australian workplace agreement which explicitly removed award conditions for public holidays, rest breaks, bonuses, annual leave loadings, allowances, penalty rates and shift and overtime allowances. All of those things are the reality of what is about to happen in the Australian workplace because of the Howard governmentâs industrial relations changes. Billy, more than likely, will be told by Centrelink, âYou have to take a job.â He will have to take a job, even if all of those things have been taken awayâthe shift penalties, the overtime loadings and all the other allowances, including the annual leave loadings, the breaks and the bonuses. All of those things could be taken away from him, and Centrelink will say to that single dad, âYou have to take that job and if you do not take that job your benefits will be cut and your children will be left without any visible means of support.â</para>
<para>The penalty of two months without payment also applies to someone who is, to quote the legislation, âdismissed for misconductâ. But in the future the ability of Australian workers to dispute a false allegation of misconduct will also be severely restricted by the Howard governmentâs attack on unfair dismissal rights. A worker could be dismissed on a false allegation of misconduct and not be able to dispute itâonce again, they would face an automatic two-month penalty. Of course, that two-month penalty would mean no money coming into that household.</para>
<para>These new rules take us down the American path, where so many single parent families and people with disabilities rely on soup kitchens and charity to get by. As St Vincent de Paul already tells us, 70 per cent of its home visits to Australians in desperate need are to single parent families and people with disabilities. That is what St Vincent de Paul says is happening now. How much worse is it going to be once this government forces this legislation through?</para>
<para>I cannot let slide the failure to help prepare for work people who are going to be forced onto the dole. This legislation just does not provide the opportunity for these people to get the sort of support they need to get them ready for work. What they need is help to get a job, but of course that is not going to happen as a result of this legislation. What we are seeing here is the government taking people off the single parent pension and off the disability support pension, putting them on the dole and saying, âYou wonât be able to get access to the pensioner education supplement.â This is a little bit of extra money that helps cover the costs for people to undertake training that might help them get a job. The government is taking the pensioner education supplement away from these people who it is throwing onto the dole.</para>
<para>This is despite the fact that the Australian Council of Social Service tells us that 60 per cent of jobless single parents have year 10 schooling or less. But what is this government doing in this legislation? Taking the pensioner education supplement away from them. It defies belief that people on the other side are going to vote for this legislation. We know that there are already serious concerns about the way in which preparatory certificate I or certificate II courses help people into work. There is already a lot of evidence that those courses are not doing enough to get people into the jobs that are available, but I tell you what: taking away the little bit of support that is currently there through the pensioner education supplement is just extraordinary.</para>
<para>We in Australia all know that the American model of social security is a failure. We should be trying very hard to avoid it, but what we have here in this legislation is the exact opposite. This government is going down the American path to social failure, where violence has replaced justice, where communities have become gangs and neighbours are enemies. That is the result of these sorts of social security changes. This is what happens when you tear at the social fabric, when you assign moral failure to the vulnerable. That is the reality of this legislation. It is what happens when people are forced to fight each other for the basic necessities of life. We know that in the United States of America the social security system offers virtually no financial security for the jobless. That is what is happening here in this legislation. That is what this government is going to do. We all saw on our television screens after Hurricane Katrina that the people who died were the poor, the sick, the elderly and the homeless. That is what happens when you tear at the fabric of society, and that is why Labor will so fiercely oppose this legislation. I move:</para>

<para>âThe intent of the <inline ref="R2461">Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline> and cognate bill is without question supportable. A place in the paid work force has the potential to provide an income stream that leads to financial independence. Other benefits flow from being employed and financially independent. Being engaged in the work force is for most people a source of social contact and ensures engagement with the community. The governmentâs efforts to build a strong economy and to provide jobs, education and training opportunities have had a positive effect on the lives of many Australians. We are now in a situation where many jobs cannot be filled, yet we still have 2.6 million people of working age on some form of income support. According to <inline font-style="italic">Workforce tomorrow:</inline> <inline font-style="italic">adapting to a more diverse Australian labour market</inline>, by the Centre for Policy Studies, Monash University, Australia faces an estimated potential work force shortfall over the next five years of 195,000 workers. It is also evident that the best way out of the poverty trap is to have access to a job in the paid work force. But these propositions are not in dispute, and the additional support to assist people into work is very welcome. I commend the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and those who have worked on that aspect of this policy.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>However, I would like to highlight a few problems. The Smith Familyâs 2001 report, by Ann Harding of the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, found that only three per cent of households with a wage earner were in poverty, compared to 31 per cent of those relying on welfare. In Australia today there are 700,000 children growing up in a household where no adult of working age has a job. Two-thirds of these households are headed up by single parents. A recent book published by Professor Stanley et al, <inline font-style="italic">Children of the Lucky Country?</inline> <inline font-style="italic">How Australian Society has Turned its Back on Children and Why Children Matter</inline>, states:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Of all cases of abuse and neglect in Western Australia and Queensland in 2001-2002, 40 per cent occurred in single parent families headed up by mothers.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It further elaborates that there are a large number of factors that put children at risk of abuse and neglect, but many of the risk factors occur more frequently in those families who are the most disadvantaged, including those with low education, social isolation, low income, poor housing, poor neighbourhoods and a lack of community resources, amongst other things. This concerns me deeply because, although the central feature of this Welfare to Work policy is about helping people access employment, reducing reliance on welfare and supplying the labour market with an additional pool of workers, one question remains unanswered: why are we including in this policy disincentives to work and cuts in income support which can only drive some of the more vulnerable people and families in our community deeper into poverty?</para>
<para>Let us take the case study outlined by Catholic Welfare Australia which clearly illustrates the lack of incentive for people to move from welfare to work under aspects of this policy. Let us take a single parent with one child and call her Jenny. Under the current system, if Jenny takes up work of 15 hours a week at $13.30 an hour and is a recipient of a parenting payment single, her disposable income will increase by $146. If she takes up the same work for the same wage under the proposed systemâthis systemâand is a Newstart recipient, her disposable income will increase by only $83. She earns less, not more. That question has not been answered.</para>
<para>The argument that there need to be incentives and disincentives in the policy so as to encourage people back to work is accepted. However, there is already one major incentive for people to comply with the new system: that is, they will lose their entire income support for a period of eight weeks if they fail to comply. That is a very large disincentive, particularly for a family with children. It is therefore difficult to understand why we would want to shift people onto Newstart and a lower base support payment, plus all the additional losses that come from the stacking effect produced by shifting people assessed as being capable of 15 to 30 hours of work a week onto Newstart.</para>
<para>It has been argued that shifting people onto Newstart is equitable because unemployed people will then all be on the same payment. Newstart was never intended as medium- to long-term income support for unemployed people with a disability and/or parents with the sole responsibility for raising children. The impact of the changes produces some extremely adverse results for some of the most vulnerable groups in our community. These groups include those with a disability and sole parents. The first group includes people with a variety of disabilities who, although they are technically capable of workâand most want to workâare too often faced with difficult or insurmountable systemic problems that prevent them from finding part-time, let alone full-time, jobs.</para>
<para>The most vulnerable of these groups, in my opinion, are people with a mental disability or mental impairment. Over 36 per cent of those currently claiming the disability support pension have psychiatric problems and intellectual and learning disabilities. There has been a great deal of public discussion about the plight of people with mental disorders in our community which has highlighted the failure of all governments to adequately support people in our community with a mental illness or mental impairment. Many of these people are living on the street or in squats. Many are to be found in jails around the country. Most go without appropriate treatment or community support.</para>
<para>Further, a recent study by Professor Vaughan Carr into mental illness and employment surveyed businesses and found that around 77 per cent of employers were reluctant to employ people with a mental disorder. We are also informed of similar disadvantages experienced by people who have epileptic seizures. The government has attempted to provide incentives to employers to employ people with a disability, and that is commendable. As part of this policyâpart of the policy that I can supportâthe government has established an employer roundtable to advise it on ways to increase the work force participation of people with a disability. In part, this roundtable, though, has been established because, despite generous government funding and incentives in the past, the take-up rate of assistance by business has been extremely disappointing.</para>
<para>Under this legislation many people with episodic illnesses will be placed onto the lower Newstart payment while they look for work, prepare for work or work 15 to 30 hours a week, and failure to comply may result in the withdrawal of income support for eight weeks. This legislation will add to the considerable hardship already faced by many people with a disability. The legislation offers reduced income support to people with a disability and individuals with the sole responsibility for rearing children. When these individuals do find a job they will be able to earn half of what they could under the current arrangements before the taper begins to diminish the income support. That is, they can currently earn $64 a week before they begin to lose their government income support at a rate of 40c in the dollar. Under the new proposal, under this legislation, an individual can earn less than half of that, or $31 per week, before the taper cuts in and they lose 50c in the dollar of income support. Once an individual has earnings of over $125 per week the taper clawback is 60c in the dollar.</para>
<para>These figures and others that are quoted in this paper today are the result of the work of Professor Ann Harding et al from the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling in a report prepared for the National Foundation for Australian Women. I want people to understand that the National Foundation for Australian Women represents more than 60 national womenâs organisations representing some three million women from all walks of life. They had this report commissioned from their own fundingâthey raised their own moneyâbecause they were concerned about the impact of aspects of this legislation on the lives of women in particular around this country and their children.</para>
<para>Take the example of Jason, who currently earns $150 a week in the present system and is on a disability support pension. His disposable income, with income support, is currently $369 a week but under the new system his friend Donna, earning the same private income plus the support income, will have a disposable income of $91 per week less than Jason due to the shift to Newstart. Jasonâs effective marginal rate of tax under the current system is 55c in the dollar while Donnaâs, under the new system, is 75c in the dollar. The combined effect of moving people onto Newstart is that they will pay effective marginal rates of tax of between 65 and 75c in the dollar when they achieve relatively modest earnings. This is, in part, due to the less favourable tax offset under the new arrangements. This needs to be considered in the light of a typical two-parent family with an income of $125,000 per annum who would typically pay an effective marginal rate of tax of about 48.5c in the dollar for this next tax year, 2006-07.</para>
<para>There are further layering or stacking effects as a result of moving to Newstart that impair the disposable income of both categories of recipients. Depending on the level of earned income, those include the possible loss of housing rent rebates of 25c for each dollar earned, the loss of the pensioner education supplement of $31.20 per week and a lower threshold before people lose access to the health care card and the pensioner concession card, with a whole lot of flow-on ramifications from that.</para>
<para>The overall effect is reduced income support for people with a disability and for sole parents while they are looking for work, preparing for work or working the 15 or 20 hours per week. In fact, Catholic Welfareâs paper makes the point that, under this legislation, a sole parent with one child will lose 43 per cent of their net disposable income and a single person with a disability will lose 40 per cent of their net disposable income. The overall effect is reduced income.</para>
<para>In the sole parent group, women are disproportionately affected as 83 per cent of sole parents are women. My major concern in relation to this group is the dependent children. It is already well documented that some of the poorest, most disadvantaged people in our community are sole parent families. The task of raising children in these circumstances is often exacerbated by affordable accommodation being available only in outlying neighbourhoods or country towns and the concomitant loss of support by other significant adults. Sole parents are often both time and income poor. Many sole parents want to work, but the reality is that, even if they get part-time work, under this new legislation they will be exposed to similar disadvantages as outlined above for people with a disabilityâthat is, the combined impact of the lower threshold of earned income before the taper claws back 50 to 60 per cent of that earned income and the increased taper rates under Newstart. Then there is the higher effective marginal rate of tax and the loss of other benefits available under the parenting payment and the disability support payment.</para>
<para>Unlike the disability support payment and the parenting payment, Newstart allowances are indexed to CPI instead of male average weekly earnings. So, by 2009-10, NATSEM estimate that a further erosion of income support will amount to around a $22 per week additional cut in income, with the gap between pension and Newstart allowance continuing to grow apace.</para>
<para>Additional concerns include restrictions under Newstart for those who wish to undertake full-time education and training while receiving income support as provided for now. This will seriously limit the option for many talented and capable people, especially women, whom, as I have said, represent 83 per cent of sole parent carers, to improve their income potential and job satisfaction. These people may well be able to totally support their dependent children, provide for their own retirement and make a greater contribution to the workplace, if they were given the opportunity of two to three years of full-time education and training.</para>
<para>Take the case of Maria, who presented herself in this place as an example. She has seven children. Her husband left when the last child was born. She has taken herself off to university and is six months off getting a teaching degree. She can then fully support her children and superannuate herself for her retirement. Mutual obligation in any welfare program is not unreasonable, and the additional assistance the government is offering to help people prepare for work and get access to paid employment are exceptionally good aspects of this policy, and they are totally supportable.</para>
<para>Since the policy was first announced, a number of exemptions have been provided for sole parents with children, and some parents with children who have a disability will now qualify for the carer pension. I especially welcome the government changes in that regard. In general, I do not have a particular concern about requiring parents to participate in the work force when their youngest child turns eight or even six or four, or about the mutual obligation placed on welfare recipients in general. However, I am deeply concerned about the cut in income support. As I said, Catholic Welfare have indicated a 43 per cent reduction in net disposable income for a sole parent with one child and a 40 per cent cut for a single person with a disability. I am deeply concerned about the effects this change might have on children. I am very concerned about the systemic problems, which were outlined very clearly in the McClure report, that are preventing people from accessing jobs. I do not see any indication that the majority of these systemic problems are being addressed.</para>
<para>I am concerned about the lack of mental health services because, in a full employment environment, many people who cannot get jobs currently do have significant mental health problems, and there is a lack of services available to these people to support them. I am concerned about the lack of housing affordability, which often drives sole parent families and people with a disability out into the outer suburbs and rural areas where, again, there is a lack of support services available to them. And I am concerned generally about a lack of support services, particularly care services, for people who have a physical disability and who need assistance to become ready in the morning for a job.</para>
<para>I represent an electorate that is suburban, regional and rural based, and I understand the difficulties of many families and those with a disability when it comes to the links between transport, job opportunity and affordable housing. This policy would have been improved if the mutual obligation test were applied without removing access to sole parent payment and the disability support paymentâthat is, not moving people onto Newstart but applying the mutual obligation. I have no problem with that. I have no problem with assessing people as being capable of contributing to the work force and earning an income in the paid work force. I have no trouble with that at all. I do not understand why this policy has been damaged, in my view, by moving these categories of people onto Newstart.</para>
<para>The minister recently highlighted the governmentâs success in getting more welfare recipients into the workplaceâprior to this legislationâas a result of greater support and incentives to employers. Undoubtedly, with further attention to some of the systemic problems, as outlined in McClure, that keep people from the workplace and with the package of programs under this new legislation, the aim of getting people from welfare into work could have been achieved without cutting income support.</para>
<para>In my view, we have lost a golden opportunity to reform welfare in a meaningful way and put in place a package of measures that would strongly support not just the incentives for employers but true and real incentives for employees with additional caring responsibilities and disabilities to be supported in their efforts to access the workplace. I find this cut in income support really very disturbing on the eve of the delivery of tax cuts for families earning more than $1,200 a week. We will all be the poorer if this legislation goes through. In my view, that part of the legislation which cuts income support and imposes disincentives and high effective or marginal rates of tax on some of the most vulnerable groups in our community does not deserve the support of this parliament. As I said, we have missed a golden opportunity.</para>
<para>I am disappointed by the short time the government has allowed for the Senate inquiry into this Welfare to Work policy. It has such wide and deep ramifications that it deserved a very thorough examination. I am disappointed that the recommendations of the Senate inquiry have not gone far enough. The few recommendations that have been madeâI think there are sixâare reasonably sensible and I hope that, at the very least, the ministers involved will encourage a thorough review to be conducted within 12 months of the implementation of the legislation so that unintended consequences of this bill can be identified and managed early.</para>

<para>âThe governmentâs Welfare to Work proposals are extreme, and the member for Pearce has very eloquently pointed out a number of the problems in the legislation. The <inline ref="R2461">Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline> is all about punishment and not about reform. It is all stick and no carrot. It is a disgrace that, when the government are looking at a $10 billion to $14 billion budget surplus on the one hand, they are also cutting payments to the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in our community on the other. These changes do nothing but move people from one welfare payment onto a lower welfare payment. For over a decade the welfare sector, political parties, charities and academics have been calling for welfare reform, but this is not reform. The best that the Howard government can come up with are the proposals in this bill which cut pensions for the poorest of all Australians, coerce parents into low-skilled and low-paid work and oblige sole parents to place their children in someone elseâs care.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Currently, sole parents are getting $244 a week. For their youngest childâs eighth birthday a sole parent pensioner will have that pension cut by $29 per week. As a charity worker at the Senate inquiry said of the $29 reduction:</para>
<quote>
<para>It is huge. It always strikes me in the office when we give somebody a $50 food voucher ... they think they have won the lottery.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This blunt sledgehammer the government calls âwelfare reformâ downgrades disabled Australians and sole parents to the dole. It abolishes the sole parent pension, getting rid of a payment which is structured to the needs of families. After 1 July next year, sole parents and disability pensioners who are deemed capable of working for more than 15 hours per week will get Newstart. I am going to concentrate my comments today on sole parents because others will cover in more detail the issues for those receiving the disability pension.</para>
<para>Newstart is a benefit that was specifically designed as short-term income support for individuals who have no significant caring responsibilities, health problems or disability. On Newstart, the government will start clawing back benefits much sooner than currently occurs when a sole parent starts working, and on Newstart the amount out of every dollar the government will claw back is also much higher. For every dollar sole parents earn from working, they will lose up to 75c of their Newstart benefit. Where is the incentive that the government keeps talking about in these changes to welfare? For sole parents Newstart benefits will be reduced sooner after they start work, and then for every dollar they earn John Howard will demand up to 75c backâeven more in some scenarios. That is a disincentive, not an improvement. It is curious, isnât it, that for wealthy Australians an incentive to work means a whopping great tax cut but for the poor an incentive to work means a cut to their pension, the threat of the workhouse and a whopping great stick?</para>
<para>Under this bill, sole parents will be forced to look for a minimum of 15 hours work a week, yet they can be forced to take a job that requires up to 25 hours a week if Centrelink thinks that is more suitable. Meanwhile, until they find this elusive part-time job, sole parents will have to comply with a parenting payment activity agreement. These activity agreements involve constant trips to the Job Network provider, endless writing of job applications, mindless resume writing courses and demoralising interviews for jobs that parents know they are extremely unlikely to get. Worse still, many previously approved activities which satisfy these activity tests have been outlawedâactivities like study, formal education and volunteer work. So, previously, you could do a meaningful tertiary education course or volunteer work to comply with your activity agreement in order to receive benefits. Previously, you could be one of the 41 per cent of Australians who volunteered last year, contributing 836 million hours for the benefit of Australian communities and between $31 and $42 billion to the economy. While volunteering you could also have gained important skills and links with the job market. Well, no more. Previously, you could do a tertiary degree which would have been the best ticket out of poverty for you and your kids. This bill prevents that and even gets rid of the pensioner education supplement.</para>
<para>The bill says that sole parents will not be forced to take jobs when they have no appropriate child care. That was a commitment given to us in the House of Representatives by the Prime Minister when we caught him on the hop. But in this bill there is no such guarantee. The departmental secretary can decide what is appropriate child care for kids of sole parentsâmaybe a male secretary of a government department, earning hundreds of thousands dollars a year. We do not know whether he has ever been the primary carer of his kids, but who could be a better judge of who is an appropriate carer in the governmentâs view? The bill says that work will be unsuitable if a person does not have access to appropriate child care, because the Prime Minister was forced to give that assurance on 2 June. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">If ... the cost of [child] care would result in a very low or negative financial gain from working, the parent will not be required to accept the job.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">There is nothing in this legislation that enforces that commitment. Perhaps it was a non-core promise.</para>
<para>In fact, there are hundreds of details facing the House about the new participation requirements and exemptions for sole parents under the welfare changes, covering everything from a 60-minute travel rule, which provides that sole parents will not have to accept jobs involving more than an hourâs commuting, through to an individualâs right to decline a job where travel costs would end up eating over 10 per cent of the jobâs gross salary. There are no such rules about the proportion of a sole parentâs wage paying for child care and what is too much to pay. There is complete silence on, for instance, whether a sole parent will be allowed to turn down a job where child-care costs would account for more than 10 per cent of the parentâs gross salaryâas they can where travel costs are high. It is likely that child-care costs will account for a lot more than 10 per cent of the gross salary of these people. The truth is the Prime Minister has decided to squib his guarantee that sole parents will not have to accept a job if the child-care costs outweigh the financial gain of taking the job. Guidelines can be changed at the discretion of the secretary. Guidelines can be changed at the ministerâs discretion without reference to parliament. Guidelines are not a guarantee: they do not provide strong enough protection from unreasonable or unconscionable participation requirements such as where the cost of out of school hours care or weekend child care outweighs the wage received.</para>
<para>Think about the compliance framework that exists for Newstart recipients, which will now include sole parents and disability pensioners. The Newstart compliance framework is Kevin Andrewsâ biggest stick. It is notoriously cruel, severe and uncompromising. While the government says this bill amends the current compliance framework, it does nothing to remove the harshness of the stick. Compliance under this bill is simply this: work or starve. On Newstart, if a sole parent commits three activity failures in 12 months without taking rectifying steps his or her pension is automatically cut off for eight weeks. Worse still, if a sole parent commits a âserious activity failureâ his or her pension is immediately cut off for eight weeks. What are these serious activity failures? It can simply be refusing a âsuitableââor what the government calls âsuitableââjob offer. It can be leaving a job voluntarily. It can be three administrative breaches in 12 months. Eight weeks of no paymentâhow does a family with children survive for eight weeks with no money coming into the house?</para>
<para>The government say that these proposals are about moving people from welfare to work. They say they are about incentives to break peopleâs welfare dependency. These are just lies. These proposals are not about skilling up our most vulnerable Australians to give them a ticket out of welfare. These proposals are not about creating a safety net for the vulnerable children growing up in these families. These proposals are not about breaking the welfare nexusâthe cycle of welfare dependency. Many sole parents already work. In fact, sole parents have the highest rates of paid employment of all welfare recipients. Of those who do not already work, many want to, and by the time their children are in high school sole parent mothers have the same work force participation rates as female partnered parents. That is very important: these parents are already moving into the work force and they need the support, the help, to do that, not these sets of punishments.</para>
<para>But 60 per cent of sole parents have only a year 10 education. The jobs they are likely to be applying for will be shelf stackers, bar attendants, cleaners, factory workers and sales assistants. And this government is doing nothing to offer people the opportunity to study to get jobs that are more secure and that will offer them a higher income into the future. All of these jobs are in the casual labour marketâand we know that casual labour is inimical to workers with caring responsibilities. The government is kidding itself if it thinks that sole parents have bargaining power when it comes to negotiating their pay and conditions. The combined effect of the governmentâs industrial relations and welfare changes are horrific for these people. The industrial relations changes give employers the green light to offer jobs with the lowest possible conditions. The welfare changes give employers a group of people forced to accept these jobs or threaten current workers with giving away their jobs with award conditions to others coerced to wait in line to take any offer. People with choiceâreal choiceâwill refuse these jobs but people on welfare will be forced to take them, otherwise they will lose eight weeks of their pension. No payments for eight weeks for refusing an AWA crammed full of below-award conditions! Christopher Hitchens wrote about similar welfare âreformsâ in the United States. He said that they created:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">â¦ a large helot underclass disciplined by fear and scarcity, subject to endless surveillance and used as a weapon against any American worker lucky enough to hold a steady or unionised job.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Under these reforms sole parents will be damned if they do and damned if they donât. If they do not accept a substandard offer, they risk losing eight weeks of their pension; if they do, they will be punished by giving back 70c of every dollar they earn. Not surprisingly, most people will come back on to welfare payments pretty quickly when their jobs do not work out, the casual employment they have runs out or it is no longer convenient for the employer to employ them when the employer downgrades the business over Christmas or the new year. Workers will move back onto welfare at the lower rate.</para>
<para>These changes mean that welfare recipients will be caught in a constant twilight zone of âworkfareâ, as it has been called in the US. In the US, Walmart workers cannot afford to shop at Walmart. A huge proportion of the numbers of people sleeping in homeless shelters every night in the United States are people who are employed but cannot afford to rent. There will be an unbreakable cycle of welfare receipt, unreliable and low-paid work, and increased hours followed by a drop in hours because of business downturn and followed by another spell back on the dole. It is a cycle that is unbreakable because those caught in âworkfareâ have no time or money to get a better education and have a shot at permanent, better paid jobs that in turn can be used to better their childrenâs prospects in life. Remember that under these changes parents will not be able to undertake formal study.</para>
<para>Single parents already have a job. They have a very important job: raising their children. That is the reality of life as a single parent. When your child is sick, there is a concert at school or there are 12 weeks of school holidays, you are the only person there who can look after those kids. If you are not able to care for your children because you are being coerced into low-paid, low-skilled work, then someone else is doing it for you. This is an email I received from Danielle about these changes:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I am a single parent of two, working full time and currently receiving no income support from the government. Next year, when my youngest son starts school I will have to resign from my job because the federal government funding of childcare places has not kept pace with demand. The only service in my area providing after school care is already fully booked for next year. My children and I will live a hand to mouth existence until I can secure a job during school hours, or access childcare.</para>
<para class="block">What will be the future for my children and I, if my new employer forces me into signing away half my holidays? I will have no âwork choicesâ as under Newstart regulations I am forced to take any job I am offered. What is John Howardâs motto, âAll children of single parent families will live in povertyâ?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">With this bill the government is deciding what is best for some familiesâfamilies who happen to need social support for a period to live, many of whom did not choose to be sole parents or to suffer a disability. What the government is saying is that some families deserve choice and some families do not. If you are married to a wealthy partner then, according to the government, you have the right to stay home and care for your kids. What is more, the taxpayer will subsidise you to do soâyou get family tax benefit part B. When John Howard introduced family tax benefit part B, he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Many families choose to have one parent stay at home to look after their children or to work for just a few hours a week. The Coalition supports families who make this choice by providing Family Tax Benefit Part B â¦</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">But not if you are a single parent. Last year, 76 millionaire families received FTB part Bâthat is, 76 multimillionaire families. Last year there were 76 families with an income of over $1 million who received FTB part B. If you are a sole parent on a parenting payment you do not have this choiceâyou have to work and you will be penalised for not taking a suitable job offer, even where that work sees you just $3.88 an hour ahead. The Prime Minister says parenting is an important job. In the past, he has said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">â¦ it is for you to decide what combination of full-time parental care or paid childcare, at what stage in your working life, it is you for you to decide what is best for your children. It is not for the Government to say which is best.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">On another occasion, he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We are not in government to tell people how to arrange their lives, weâre in government to give people the maximum opportunity to exercise the choice about the family and work arrangements that they want. I think we all recognise that there is pressure on families facing the key life choice of when to have children, of how long a parent might stay at home with a young child, when a parent might return to paid work and also to manage the ongoing work/family balance. And the objective of all of our policies in this area has been to provide the maximum opportunities for individual families to make the choices that they want â¦ So our approach is built very much on that key and enduring Liberal principle of freedom of individual choice.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">But not if you are a single parent. The government supports choice for the rich and coercion for the poor. The Labor Party supports equal choice and equal opportunity for all. The government thinks these changes will discourage people from staying on welfare. But who needs discouragement from staying on welfare? Who wants to live in poverty? Most often, people fall into welfare through no fault of their ownâperhaps they marry and the relationship does not work out or the partner dies. Perhaps a young surfer acquires a brain injury after a surfing accident and ends up on a disability pension. Does the government honestly think these people choose this as a lifestyle? There are two main ways single parents get off welfare: they repartner or they find a job. But, as any economist or social researcher will tell you, for sole parents good jobs and good husbands are pretty hard to find. Labor believes that people who can work should work. But there are people who cannot work, and they should not be humiliated, goaded and punished.</para>
<para>Labor supports encouraging people to work. We support raising the tax-free threshold to $10,000 for people earning less than $20,000 so that workers who move from welfare into work can keep some of the hard-earned money they make. There is a notion that a lot of people are living the high life on welfare benefits. The government should remember something my parents taught me as a young person: there, but for the grace of God, go I. I support investing in people, not just in compliance measures. We should be providing training and education and skilling up welfare recipients so that when they leave welfare they do not cycle straight backâso that they are enabled to stay off welfare for good.</para>
<para>I want to mention another piece of legislation that we are dealing with today in the cognate debateâthe <inline ref="R2457">Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work) Bill 2005</inline>, which deals with the rate of child-care benefit families can claim. The bill increases the number of hours for which a family can claim child-care benefit where one or both parents do not satisfy the work/study test. There is an increase of four hours per weekâup from 20 hours to 24 hours. That means a stay-at-home parent or a parent who works less than 15 hours a week can claim up to 24 hours of child-care benefit. It also increases the child-care benefit work/study test applicable to those who wish to claim for the maximum 50 hours of child-care benefit from one hour of work or study per week to 15 hours. Labor supports this bill. The changes are nonsensical, silly and, in many respects, pointless, but they are not a patch on the Welfare to Work legislation, which Labor will be opposing most vigorously. This piece of legislation is unnecessarily complex. It cuts people out of getting the 30 per cent rebate for out-of-pocket expenses. The government has promised to fix up this anomalyâgoodness knows when we will see that. I hope it is worth more than the child-care guarantee that the Prime Minister gave in the other piece of legislation. The welfare to work changes are all about punishing the most vulnerable members of our community and must be opposed most vigorously.</para>

<para>âI am delighted to contribute to this debate in support of the governmentâs important welfare to work reforms embodied in the <inline ref="R2461">Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline>. Australiaâs welfare system is rapidly approaching breaking point. The welfare leviathan is growing so large that the hard-working taxpayer will not be able to cope with the burden. The welfare to work legislation seeks to address a fundamental problem facing the nation: the unsustainability of our national welfare system.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Over the past 40 years the welfare state has grown immensely, and it is fast approaching an unsustainable position. In June 2005, 705,000 working age Australians were on the disability support pension; 630,000 working age Australians were on parenting payments, about 450,000 of whom are single parents; and 500,000 working age Australians were on unemployment benefitâthe Newstart allowance. This level of increase in payments is not sustainable. In 2004-05, spending on the disability support pension exceeded $10 billion. The total welfare budget for 2005-06 is $60 billionâI emphasise that figure: $60 billion. Peter Saunders the Social Research Director at the Centre for Independent Studies, has researched the problems of welfare in Australia. I commend his book published in 2004 entitled <inline font-style="italic">Australiaâs welfare habit: and how to kick it</inline>, in which he noted:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Australiaâs growing addiction to welfare has become cripplingly expensive. Back in the 1960s we could afford what we were spending, for there were 22 people in employment to support every one person of working age living on benefits. Today, this dependency ratio has collapsed to just five to one.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I note that, since the publication of this book last year, the position seems to have become even worse. Official statistics show that today there are only four people in employment to support every one person of working age who is on welfare. The level of welfare dependence has reached the ludicrous position where one in five working age Australians is now reliant on income support funded by the taxpayer. That is almost unbelievable. In todayâs current strong economic conditions who would ever have believed that one in five people you see in the street, one in five working age Australians, are on welfare. In total, 2.6 million people out of 13.7 million people aged between 16 and 64 years are welfare dependant.</para>
<para>This high rate of welfare dependency is despite the relatively low unemployment rate of 5.2 per cent, as at September 2005. Imagine how much worse it would be if we had the high unemployment rates of the 1990s under the Hawke-Keating governments. Over the last four years there has been a remarkable change in the profile of people who are dependant on welfare, with a dramatic increase in the number of people reliant on the disability support pension and on the single parenting payment. In 1980, a small 2.3 per cent of people of working age were on the disability pension. By March 2005 that proportion had doubled to over five per cent, or 705,000 people. The proportion of working age adults who are described as being incapable of work has increased by 117 per cent over the last 25 years. Half of the people going onto disability support each year are recruited from the unemployment rolls, an indictment in itself.</para>
<para>The disability support pension is an attractive option for unemployed people who do not want to find a job. DSP recipients are exempt from any mutual obligation requirements, and we have seen people transfer from unemployment to disability support following the introduction of the governmentâs mutual obligation requirements. In the seven years to June 2004, the number of people on the DSP grew by 26 per cent. There are now more working age Australians on DSP than on the Newstart allowance unemployment benefit. The DSP is growing much more rapidly in Australia than in other OECD countries. People who are on DSP can remain on the pension for life, irrespective of their ability to work. The most common problems reported by DSP claimants are musculoskeletalâthat is, bad backs; and psychological/psychiatric problemsâthat is, feeling stressed and other problems.</para>
<para>Almost a quarter of a million working age Australians claim disability support because of musculoskeletal and connective tissue medical problemsâagain, commonly called âbad backsâ. The bad back is a difficult problem for policymakers to address as the complaint is hard to analyse and to prove or disprove. The medical profession and the chiropractors who deal with this problem on a day-to-day basis have no easy answer or definitive view on the cure. Being a farmer I have had a close association with a crook back for the last 40 years. Personally, I have tried to ensure that my back remains flexible so that I can carry on normal activities. Many of the so-called bad back cases have no trouble going to the beach, playing games with their children and doing a few odd jobs for cash. There seems to be an underground bad back work force out there who receive both the disability pension and cash payments for a number of light-duties type jobs.</para>
<para>It is not unreasonable to ask people who have the capacity to work to do so, even if it is not their normal job. In the 21st century there are alternatives to manual jobs. The computer age is here, and it does not require any great stress on the musculoskeletal system, to use the technical term.</para>
<para>There are over 175,000 working age Australians who are claiming psychological/psychiatric problems, including âfeeling stressedâ. In total, these two categories make up about 60 per cent of people on the disability allowance: 34 per cent in the bad back category and 24 per cent in the psychological/psychiatric category.</para>
<para>I want to move now to the single parenting area of this bill. There are approximately 630,000 people on parenting payments, of whom about 71 per cent are sole parents. The parenting payment single allowance has grown by over 100,000 persons, or 33 per cent, over the last seven years. On the other hand, the parenting payment partnered allowance has fallen by over 60,000 persons. The budget for parenting payment pensions alone has exceeded $6 billion for 2004-05.</para>
<para>I commend to the House the submission by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations to the Senate inquiry into this legislation. It is a high-quality submission. From that submission I note that Australia performs poorly internationally in relation to the number of single parents in employment. Unpublished OECD data shows that, among 23 OECD countries, Australia has the lowest employment rate for sole parents with dependent children. This is a bad outcome for sole parents and their children.</para>
<para>With interest I noted that the governmentâs submission picked up on the situation in Denmark. I recently had the pleasure of travelling to Denmark and Sweden as part of a parliamentary delegation and can report that Denmark and Sweden are facing a real crisis in managing their welfare systems. I understand that the GST in both these countries is in the range of 25 per cent and that the upper levels of income tax are in the range of 60 per cent. However, there is an endemic culture in the Scandinavian countries that welfare is good and that somebody should pay for it. In the longer term this is a recipe for financial disaster and social dislocation. In Denmark, single parents are entitled to only one year of benefits before they are required to look for work. In Switzerland, Austria, Germany, France, Italy and Norway, single parents on benefits are required to look for work when their youngest child turns three. So much for comparisons with this proposition before the parliament!</para>
<para>These are policies in other countries which face a significant sustainability problem with the maintenance of the welfare state. In these countries, steps have been taken to encourage single parents back into employment quickly to reduce the burden on hardworking taxpayers. In Australia, more than half of the people who receive the parenting payment do not earn any private income, and there are 700,000 children growing up in homes where neither parent is in employment. There is a risk in such families that a culture of not working could be created and handed down from one generation to the next. As a nation, a key equity challenge for governments must be to break the chain of intergenerational poverty and job opportunities.</para>
<para>The government is taking steps to address these problemsâto address the unsustainability of the welfare system and to encourage working age persons out of welfare and back into active employment. I am pleased to support the governmentâs reforms in this bill to encourage people who are in receipt of disability support pensions and parenting payments to re-enter the work force. A key principle that underpins these reforms is that Australians who have the capacity to work should do so rather than rely on hardworking Australian taxpayers to pay their bills. The reforms seek to address the unsustainability of our welfare system and encourage greater self-reliance and deliver self-fulfilment.</para>
<para>In the Depression in the 1930s when there was negligible welfare and very serious human problems with affording the bare necessities of life, Australians were very reluctant to take welfare. There was a wonderful self-reliant attitude that they would get through somehow and not rely on Big Brother government for a hand-out. In Australia we are fast losing this self-reliance and independent spirit as creeping socialism and welfarism corrodes the very essence of Australiaâs characteristic battler culture. If you are in a job and you feel good about yourself, you feel good about your family, you feel good about Australia and you know you are making a contribution to your own childrenâs future wellbeing. No amount of welfare will be a substitute for this fundamental human value and philosophical approach to life.</para>
<para>The reforms recognise that a key symptom of poverty for Australians is the absence of paid employment and that, by assisting welfare-dependent Australians to re-enter the work force, we in the Howard government are taking important steps to improve the living standards of our citizens and to lift as many people as possible out of poverty and free from disadvantage.</para>
<para>In terms of the need to address the unsustainability of our welfare system, I just make a few observations about why the government must act. First, it is important to recognise that an equitable welfare system cannot fund itself. For Australia to be able to afford a viable welfare system there needs to be sufficient people in paid employment raising income to afford taxes to pay for the safety net needs of those who cannot provide for themselves. People who can look after themselves should be encouraged to do so. If the welfare system costs the taxpayer too much then we run the risk of not being able to afford suitable welfare for those who legitimately need it. Peter Saunders addressed this problem in his publication âAustraliaâs Welfare Habitâ:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">With so many more people dependent on welfare, there are proportionately far fewer to pay for their upkeep. This trend is clearly unsustainable. The more welfare spending increases, the more those who are still working have to be taxed in order to raise money; but the more tax people have to pay, the less inclined they are to keep working â¦</para>
<para>Welfare thus begets more welfare. We have locked ourselves into a vicious spiral. This cannot go on indefinitely; we are chasing our tails.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Those remarks come from Peter Saunders who is certainly a well-qualified person to make comment on this matter. To address this problem, the government have acted to encourage new entrants to the parenting support system and the disability support system into employment where they have the capacity to work. The notion is not new either internationally or within Australia. Within Australia we have seen a similar approach. We are proposing that those on a disability pension and those injured workers who are under state WorkCover schemes are encouraged back into the work force. In fact, in Victoria there is a requirement for employers to implement procedures for the transition of injured workers back into employment, including changed duties where the injured worker is no longer capable of doing previous work tasks. Australia is not the only country that has to address this problem. The United States, amongst others, have faced such difficulties, and I quote former Democrat President Bill Clinton:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">All Americans, without regard to party, know that our welfare system is broken, that it teaches the wrong values, rewards the wrong choices, hurts those it was meant to help â¦</para>
<para class="block">Real welfare reform requires work, imposes time limits, cracks down on deadbeat parents â¦</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That, again, is a quote from Peter Saundersâs âAustraliaâs Welfare Habitâ. That is the view of the Labor side of politics in the USA and I commend that point of view to those sitting opposite.</para>
<para>Â What is the Labor Partyâs approach in Australia? They will argue that the government should not take steps to address the long-term unsustainabilty of the welfare state, but instead the government should allow the problem to get worse by forcing Australian taxpayers to pay more for the increasing number of people who have the capacity to work but instead move out of employment onto welfare. Peter Saunders has again addressed this problem and recognised that, in the welfare debate, ânothing succeeds like failureâ. He says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">One of the ironies of contemporary Australian debate over poverty and welfare is that the most ardent defenders of the existing welfare system are among the first to argue that it has been grossly ineffective in achieving what it was set up to do â¦</para>
<para class="block">The more we spend, the worse the outcomes appear to become.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Some on the Labor side of Australian politics recognise the reality that the current welfare system is not working. It is not helping those people most disadvantaged who rely on governments to deliver the best policies to assist them. I would like to quote former Labor Leader, Mark Latham, who, in his 2001 paper âMaking welfare workââpublished in his book <inline font-style="italic">The Enabling State</inline>, coedited by respected Labor commentator and author Peter Botsmanâsaid:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Welfare policy â¦ has become a sacred cowâfull of warm rhetoric, good intentions and noble traditions. The only problem is that itâs not getting results.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In the face of the Labor Partyâs opposition, the government is implementing brave reforms. We have introduced important industrial relations reforms to strengthen the economy and increase job opportunities. We have abolished nuisance tariffs on non-competing importsâ</para>

<para>âa bold move, which even the member for Melbourne would agree with. We have established a Future Fund to meet the governmentâs future superannuation liabilitiesâagain, a very bold move by the Treasurer to put away money for a rainy day to meet those ever-increasing liabilities of publicly funded employees. I hope that future Labor governmentsâwhen they eventually come to powerâmight support that move very strongly. The Howard government is introducing these welfare reforms to make the welfare system sustainable.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>It is not easy to introduce these reforms but it is necessary. Again, I note that Peter Saunders has addressed the political problem in Australia leading to the failure of past governments to address the problem of a growing welfare state. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... there has been no serious attempt in Australia to introduce a radical reform of social policy to match earlier radical reforms of economic policy. The number of voters who have a finger in the welfare pie is simply too big to risk alienating them.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I would agree with that and I am sure that the rhetoric coming from the other side would support that view. However, we need to understand that somebody needs to pay for the welfare in the longer run and in the longer run it needs to be sustainable.</para>
<para>The Howard government is taking the bold step to address the problem of an unsustainable welfare system. Through our reforms we will be improving opportunities for the 700,000 Australians on disability pensions by encouraging them to enter the workplaceâas is the case in America and will be the case in Europe as their welfare systems topple over like the Berlin Wall. It is clearly on the public record that the welfare systems of France, Germany and other European nations are unsustainable even in the shorter term as the working age population, the high rates of taxation and the excess benefits paid to the welfare system make it unsustainable. Other nations have found the way forward to assist parents with children to combine family responsibilities with work. Australia should follow their example. I strongly commend the bill to the House for its philosophic content, its long-term consequences and its importance for future generations of Australians.</para>

<para>âI rise to oppose the <inline ref="R2461">Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2457">Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work) Bill 2005</inline> and support the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I have been listening carefully to the member for Corangamite and more closely to the member for Pearce. She made a very valuable contribution to the debate in highlighting the entrenched unfairness of these bills. There is no doubt that there is a disquiet amongst coalition backbenchers and maybe some ministers who realise that the sole objective of this legislation, if enacted, will be to punish the most vulnerable in our society.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It comes at a time when the Treasurer is attempting to explain how he could appoint to the Reserve Bank of Australia a person who found himself in hock to the Australian Taxation Office of up to $150 millionâor at least that was the settlement that he ultimately reached with the ATO because of deficiencies in paying tax. So, when I hear members opposite talk about welfare and the problems with having to pay for welfare, I ask them to consider what role models they promote in society in terms of paying proper tax for income earned. I ask them to consider the juxtaposition between, on the one hand, very vulnerable, in many cases impoverished, families who will suffer as a result of this legislation and, on the other hand, their defence of a multimillionaire who has been on the Reserve Bank of Australiaâs board for some time and his innovative, imaginativeâsome might say âunethicalââattempts to avoid taxation. I ask the members opposite to reflect on that contrast while we debate these bills this morning.</para>
<para>The member for Pearce, a former minister herself, highlighted quite rightly that, whilst it is important to target welfare dependency, while it is reasonable to seek ways to move people from welfare to work and to find methods to enable people to get off welfare, the particular bill before us this morning is all about using a stick without any carrot at all. It is all about punishment. Implicit therefore in the bill is a view that these people deserve to be punished, because if it were not the case that the governmentâs view was that these people on the disability pension were to be punished it would find more positive ways to encourage them to find gainful employment.</para>
<para>I know every member in this place would know of people who are unemployed who want to find work. I am aware, and I know most members are aware, of people with disabilities who are looking for work. It is hard enough for them to deal with the stigma that, unfortunately, on occasion, they have to experience as a result of their disability and at the same time not be able to properly and actively involve themselves in a workplace. Because, as we know, for good or bad, being part of a workplace, for a person in our society, is a very important part of who we are. We know that when people meet for the first time one of the first questions they ask each other is what they do for a living. That is an important element in the nature of our society. For a person to have to say that they are unemployed, for a person with a disability or otherwise to say that they are not gainfully employed, is not an easy thing to do.</para>
<para>Nobody in this House, I am sure, would think that a person who is looking for work should be denied that opportunity. I do not think anyone, certainly on this side of the chamber, would say that we should not be doing everything to provide opportunities for unemployed people, and indeed for people with disabilities who are unemployed, to work and to feel valuable and valued in our society. But it is an interesting contrast between the role model that the government likes to put up in the case of Mr Robert Gerard, who may or may not be ultimately guilty of tax fraud but who certainly has sought to find as many ways as possible not to pay tax by placing money offshore. There is no doubt about that. It is interesting that that is the role model that the government wants to defendâthat the Treasurer would like to defend, that the Prime Minister yesterday in question time defendedâas a commendable appointee to the Reserve Bank board at the exact time that it chooses to introduce into this House legislation that will hurt people with disabilities in this nation.</para>
<para>I ask those members opposite to consider what they are seeking to portray in this chamber during the debate this week. I ask those members opposite who will enter the debate to take a careful look at the considered comments by the member for Pearce in her contribution today. I am also aware that there are not many government membersâand I applaud those that areâwilling to contribute to the debate. I notice the list of speakers to date, in terms of government members, is quite short. There is a limited proportion of government members wanting to be associated with a bill that is going to hurt people with disabilities.</para>
<para>The Prime Minister almost 10 years ago said he wanted to govern for all of us, but it clearly is the case that the government want to look after some people more than others. Having watched the government introduce the industrial relations legislation in the chamber recentlyâenacting legislation that will effectively undermine the capacity for ordinary working people and their families to defend themselves in their workplace just to maintain their current conditions of employmentâand having watched the government justify their attacks on ordinary working families, I should not be surprised to see the next plank of their legislation targeting people even more vulnerable than the workers of Australia: those people who unfortunately are not in a position yet to have work.</para>
<para>That combination of employment law that will undermine the essence of protection for ordinary working people with this proposed legislation will damage the fabric of our society. Let there be no mistake: you evaluate a society and the fairness of a particular society by the way in which it treats its weakestânot the strongest, not the Robert Gerards of the worldâand how it treats the people who are the most vulnerable, the people who have not found themselves in a position of strength. I ask government members to look into their hearts when they consider debating and rationalising the justification for this legislation. Because, if they were honest with themselves or if they actually realised and considered the consequences of the legislation proposed for people with disabilities and sole parents, they would know in their heart of hearts that the effects would be dreadful and horrible to contemplate for many Australians.</para>
<para>In the May budget, the government announced a program of welfare reform which they described as a welfare to work strategy. If only it was genuine welfare reform, designed to assist the most vulnerable from reliance on welfare payments to become financially independent and employed, Labor might support it. However, it is nothing of the kind. As other speakers have said before me, this is a welfare to welfare program, cynically designed to save the government some money and artificially reduce the welfare statistics. It will not assist people to move from welfare to employment; it will instead reduce the incentive for people to work and further entrench poverty in this country, not only for people who are already disadvantaged due to disability but for their families and children.</para>
<para>My electorate of Gorton in Melbourneâs western suburbs already has 11,935 people living in poverty, or 10.8 per cent of the population, according to NATSEM. This is among the worst poverty figures in Australia. These changes can only further sink disadvantaged people in my electorate in the mire of poverty and reliance on meagre welfare for survival. I have seen time and time again but never so clearly as today that this government is about looking after marginals but not the marginalised in our society. There is no doubt, if you were to look at the way in which grants are provided by the Commonwealth, that there are very few that are actually provided to the electorate of Gorton. This is a government obsessed with marginals, not concerned with the marginalised.</para>
<para>The bill enables the government to further squeeze the eligibility for the disability support pension and parenting payments in order to restrict access. The effect is to drive recipients of these payments onto the dole, which is a lower payment with more punishing effective marginal tax rates. These new recipients of Newstart will have a new range of punitive obligations to perform in order to receive their benefit. They will also be subject to a new, very severe compliance regime. We on this side of the House will try not to be surprised when there is a sudden drop in unemployment figures a few months after this regime comes into play, which the government will claim is the result of large numbers of disabled people and parents rushing into jobs.</para>
<para>Of course the reality will be that the drop in figures will be caused by large numbers of already disadvantaged people opting to escape entirely from the welfare system in order to fend for themselves, figuring that the new compliance measures are cruel enough to compromise their dignity and the effective marginal tax rates are so high that taking up paid work makes them worse off. Instead of paying attention to the unemployment figures, members of this House might do better to watch the rates of poverty in their electorates climb even higher. The taxation and withdrawal arrangements applied to Newstart payments are far harsher than those applying to the disability support pension and the parenting payment. A report was completed by NATSEMâthe National Centre for Social and Economic Modellingâan organisation that the Prime Minister himself has described as respected, independent and objective. They have considered the effect of these proposed changes. The NATSEM research paper showed that people with a disability will be working for $2.27 an hour and be up to $122 per week worse off.</para>

<para>âTo respond to the member for Chifley, they will be $2.27 per hour and $122 per week worse off. That is an effective return on 15 hours work at the minimum wage. A sum of $2.27 per hour, of course, cannot even cover the cost of getting to work. Under current Newstart obligations up to 90 minutes travel time to work is still regarded as an appropriate and reasonable work opportunity. Unless they change the rules, that requirement will remain even with the effective return of $2.27 an hour. Of course many people with a disability have a great deal of trouble getting around. Many have to have recourse to taxis in order to travel. So is a 90-minute taxi fare a sensible option to get to work? Subtracting the taxi fareâeven one that is subsidised, as they are for many people with disabilitiesâfrom the $2.27 an hour gives you an indication of what this government believes people with disabilities should be prepared to work for.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Many people with a disability who will be put onto the new dole will be paying 75c in the dollar back to the government. These are people with a disability who are trying to work. These are people who wish to work. So where is the incentive? According to the Minister for Human Services, in March of this year, 5,589 disability support pensioners lived in my electorate. That is 5,589 people who could be paying a 75 per cent marginal tax rate as a direct result of this governmentâs punitive approach to welfare reform.</para>
<para>Another NATSEM report recently looked at the impact on sole parents, and the member for Sydney primarily focused her concerns on the effects of this legislation on sole parents. Sole parents who work 15 hours a week will only keep $81 of their earnings while John Howard and his government will take the other $114. In other words, people will be working for, effectively, $3.88 an hour. My electorate of Gorton has 4,039 people on Centrelinkâs parenting payment single rate. That is over 4,000 people working for less than $4 an hour. Again I ask: how will increasing the financial disincentive to work improve peopleâs capacity to work?</para>
<para>Many people will be substantially worse off under these proposals. We know from the governmentâs own figures that over 260,000 people around the country will be worse off if this legislation is passed. But that figure does not include the children who will be affected, which if taken into account would increase the number many times over. How many people do they say will move into work under the package? Even the government can only boast, as the Treasurer did on budget night, that it would be 190,000. But now the department argues instead that it will be no more than 109,000. In order to get 109,000 people into workâand I think those figures are a little rubbery, to say the leastâthe government will reduce the incomes and budgets of 260,000 Australians and their children. These changes simply dump people from one welfare payment onto a lower welfare payment and further cut the household budgets of vulnerable Australians. They do nothing to tackle the reasons someone might not be working and deliver practical solutions.</para>
<para>The number of welfare recipients in Australia has grown under the Howard governmentâs version of leadership, during a decade in Australiaâs history when we were told we should be celebrating the benefits of economic growth. It seems clear that the benefits of this prosperity have not been shared equally, a development which will only worsen with the passing of the Howard governmentâs workplace relations reforms. These measures decrease rather than increase the incentive to move from welfare to work, to the extent that people may actually end up poorer from work than they would have been on welfare. They destroy financial incentive by increasing the effective marginal tax rates for single parents and people with a disability when they work part time. NATSEM found that people would be paying, as I said earlier, up to 75c of every dollar they earn back to the government. This legislation flies in the face of what we know to be the primary reasons for welfare dependency: a lack of appropriate skills and a lack of assistance in the provision of proper incentive. The legislation cannot replace adequate investment in vocational education and training. There is no comment, throughout all of this, about what the government will do to train people and to provide them with adequate skills.</para>
<para>Real welfare reform involves strong support from government in breaking down barriers to participation, such as skills, work-family balance and employer attitudes, and having fair and reasonable requirements for job seekers. Such measures are completely lacking in the latest round of proposals to punish the unemployed, the disabled and the disadvantaged. Labor calls for practical support for the transition from welfare to work in response to both the economic problems of an ageing population and skills shortages and the social problems arising from welfare dependence and social exclusion. I oppose these bills very strongly and support the second reading amendment. I ask members opposite to consider what will really occur in the event of them voting for this legislation, because it will do a terrible thing to many Australians. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThe choice today is between recognising the abilities and capacities of people or continuing to focus on their disabilities and incapacities. It is a choice between tackling unemployment or accepting joblessness as a cost of modern societyâa choice between the dignity and value that comes from participating in the work force or the despair and poverty that results from long-term welfare dependency. The government has made its choice to pursue the necessary reforms responsibly, mindful that these measures are directed at securing the future prosperity of the nation and providing the opportunity for all Australians to participate in that prosperityâto govern for all of us, as the member for Gorton mentioned.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I support the <inline ref="R2461">Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline> and oppose the second reading amendment put forward by the opposition. The purpose of the bill is to give effect to the legislative measures in the Welfare to Work package announced as part of the 2005-06 budget. The measures in the bill are a significant step towards building a modern and responsive social support system for all people of working age by encouraging and assisting more people to participate in the work force. The three principles that underlie these measures are: people who have the capacity and are available to work should do so, the best form of family income comes from a job rather than welfare and services provided to people who have an obligation to seek work should focus on getting them into work as soon as possible.</para>
<para>The most significant amendments in the legislation involve the following: changing the eligibility criteria and the participation requirements for Newstart allowances, parenting payment and the disability support pension; making the private income taper rates for Newstart more generous and providing greater incentive for people to work and leave the welfare system; improving the suspension and compliance framework to encourage and reward participation in the work force; establishing a comprehensive work capacity assessment; and establishing rapid connect arrangements to link job seekers more quickly to employment services. A range of ancillary benefits will be available to a wider group of job seekersâbenefits such as the mobility allowance, the pension concession card, the employment entry payment, the telephone allowance and the work for the dole supplement. This is pivotal in shaping and preparing the nation for the future.</para>
<para>Our ageing population is one of the most significant challenges facing Australia as we move further into this new century. It demands planning and response now, not laterâand that is what the Howard government has been innovative about and proactive on. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Australiaâs unemployment rate is at a 29-year low of 5.1 per cent. There is now a shortage of workers, not a shortage of jobs. The situation will only accelerate with the ageing of the Australian population. The potential shortfall of Australian workers over the next five years could be as many as 195,000 workers, according to the 2005 report, <inline font-style="italic">Workforce tomorrow</inline>, from the Centre for Policy Studies at Monash University.</para>
<para>Currently Australiaâs participation rate for working age people is 73.6 per cent. Those are the OECD figures for the employment outlook for this year. This is well behind other OECD countries such as Canada, Denmark, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. A number of valuable considerations have been put forward with regard to our shortage of skilled workers. One of the suggestions has been to allow bridging visa E holders currently in the community to have work rights. I raised that in this place on 2 November, and Gerard Henderson wrote about it in Tuesdayâs <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>. But today the governmentâs Welfare to Work package sets in place several measures that will try and address some of the present challenges relating to a shortage of skilled workers. In order to meet the skill and labour shortages that the Australian economy will experience we must ensure that as many Australians of working age are able to participate in the work force as possible, and to their highest level of capacity and availability.</para>
<para>The ageing of the population will result in fewer new entrants into our labour force. If we do nothing to address this issue, we will see a substantial reduction in the growth of the labour force over the next 10 to 15 years. At present the net growth in the Australian work force is 170,000 people each year. Access Economics has estimated that over the decade 2020 to 2030 the work force will grow by just 125,000 people. That averages out to a mere 12,500 people per year. The resultant side effects will lead to an ever-diminishing tax and revenue base for our governments. This will seriously impact on the ability to provide a range of government services, including pensions, working age income support payments and health services.</para>
<para>The best form of welfare is a job. Governments have a responsibility to reduce welfare dependency wherever possible, and this is one of the guiding principles of the Welfare to Work legislation. A job can have a profoundly positive effect on an individualâs life and wellbeing, as well as on the wellbeing of that personâs family and of course society as a whole. The obligation upon people to get up in the morning and prepare to go to a job where they bring their services and skills to the workplace can make a fundamental difference in how people view themselves as being worthy and contributing something to the wider community. But the child or dependant of someone in work can also learn invaluable lessons from that example. Structure and routine are important facets in any childâs early years, and the opportunity to see their parent or guardian providing for the family unit through the fruits of their labour offers invaluable life lessons.</para>
<para>The economic benefits of low unemployment in any community speak for themselves. There are currently 2.6 million working ageâ15- to 64-year-oldâAustralians on income support, of which only 15 per cent are required to actively search for a job. Passive welfare payments, with no obligations, lock people out of participating in Australiaâs prosperity and condemn them to a lifetime of poverty. Despite Australia experiencing a sustained period of strong economic growth, including the creation of more than 1.7 million new jobs, the number of working age Australians receiving the disability support pension and parenting payments has increased significantly.</para>
<para>In the 12 months prior to June 2004, 55 per cent of people transferred to the disability support payment from another payment. In the seven years prior to June 2004 disability support grew by 26 per cent and parenting payment single by 33 per cent. There are now more working age Australians on the disability support pension than there are on the Newstart allowance. As at June 2005, 705,000 working age Australians were receiving the disability support pension, 630,000 working age Australians were receiving parenting payments, 260,000 were aged over 50 and in receipt of income support and 500,000 working age Australians were on the Newstart allowance. This level of increase in payments is not sustainable. In 2004-05 spending on the disability support pension exceeded $10 billion. The total welfare budget for 2005-06 is $60 billionâ$60 thousand million.</para>
<para>The general view in the community and amongst welfare recipients is that continuing income support should be conditional on people making an effort to get off payments and get a job. This view is shared by three-quarters of the community and almost two-thirds of Centrelink customers. Australiaâs welfare system is designed to provide a safety net for those who genuinely need it. It is a generous and well-targeted system by world standards, and for that this nation should take some pride. However, our system was designed at a time when most jobs were full time, most unemployment was for a short time and mothers and married women generally did not work.</para>
<para>I have received several emails from people around the community, mostly using a letter template from ACOSS, regarding these changes. I do not for a moment doubt the sincerity or genuine concern that has motivated these people to email me and my colleagues, but I would like to make a couple of points. Despite their concerns, even ACOSS acknowledges the negative effect of not having a job. ACOSS has released studies that show that people who receive the parenting payment are three times as likely as people with jobs to suffer from depression or anxiety disorders. According to ACOSS, 50 per cent of sole parents suffer from poor mental health. The President of ACOSS, Andrew McCallum, has acknowledged that the best form of welfare is a job.</para>
<para>The governmentâs Welfare to Work reforms will provide sole parents with the support and practical assistance they need to combine work and their family responsibilities. Sole parents will also receive the training, advice and support they need to get ready for work. According to the survey <inline font-style="italic">Customer and community attitudes to working age participation requirements</inline>, conducted by the Social Research Centre, the majority of jobless Centrelink customersâ77 per centâsaid they would prefer to be in paid work. This included 82 per cent of jobless disability support pensioners and 74 per cent of jobless parenting payment single recipients. This report is indicative of the comments I received from people within my electorate. For someone living in Warragul, being able to get in contact with the local Job Network agency or the local Salvation Army Employment Plus office in Warragul and finding work is far more valuable than being permanently on welfare.</para>
<para>I spoke before about the profoundly positive impact simply being employed can have on individuals and their families. I was also referring to measures that need to be taken, such as those provided for in this legislation, to prevent intergenerational unemployment from prevailing. For some young people growing up in a household that has second and third generation unemployment, the impact on self-esteem and the examples inadvertently set can be lifelong. Everyone in Australia who wants work should be able to find it, and the Prime Ministerâs conviction in this ethos is evident in this legislation.</para>
<para>Research conducted in Australia shows that growing up in a welfare dependent household leads to poorer outcomes for young people. There are currently 700,000 children in Australia growing up in households where no adult of working age has a job. Two-thirds of these households are headed by single parents. Young people living with parents on income support are much more likely than average to leave school early, become unemployed or become teenage parents and end up on income support themselves. Young people whose parents work, even in a low-paid job, have the benefit of positive role models in their lives and fare much better. Disadvantaged families where no parent is working are more likely to have mental health disorders, lower rates of immunisation, greater risk of juvenile participation in criminal activity, problems adjusting to schooling and a higher incidence of early exit from schooling.</para>
<para>Labor will oppose the legislation for the sake of opposing it and will provide no alternative policies. Labor is a policy-free zone when it comes to addressing the issue of welfare dependency and increasing work force participationâunless I am about to hear some new ideas put forward by the opposition in the next address. Laborâs core constituency is the socialist left of the welfare lobby, not the welfare recipients themselves. These groups believe that welfare is an absolute entitlement and right and that all income should be indiscriminately redistributed from the rich to the poor. Labor will claim that it supports the notion that it is important to assist unemployed people into work; however, it does not support the movement of people from pensions to unemployment benefits which contain mutual obligation requirements. Labor talks about welfare reform but has never actually produced a policy that directly addresses the issue.</para>
<para>Labor will claim that this legislation, the Welfare to Work reforms, will create a so-called working poor. Such claims are baseless. The primary cause of low income is not a low wage but joblessness. The argument that minimum wage jobs lead to the creation of a low-paid underclass is not supported by the facts. A study undertaken in 2004 by Lloyd, Harding and Payne, from the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling at the University of Canberra,<inline font-style="italic">Australians in poverty in the 21st century</inline>, showed that around 41 per cent of unemployed people were considered to be in relative poverty, along with 17.9 per cent of people not in the labour force and 24.3 per cent of people whose main source of income was government cash benefits. Only two per cent of people whose main source of income was wages and salaries were considered to be in relative poverty. Labor will claim that people moving from a pension payment to Newstart allowance will be financially worse off. Such a claim is not true, because the majority of people on pensions do not earn any private income. The valid comparison to be made is between a person on a pension who does not work and a person on Newstart who undertakes part-time work.</para>
<para>In 1991, when the Labor Party were last in government, they enacted the Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill and the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill which introduced activity agreements as a supposed condition for the receipt of welfare benefits. Brian Howe, the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services at the time, stated in his second reading speech:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In each case, the activity agreement will set out the steps that individuals will have to take to improve their employment prospects. There should be no misunderstanding about this. The activity agreement will be a requirement for payment. If a person is not prepared to enter into, and abide by, an agreement he or she will not be paid Newstart allowance.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In 2005 it is clear that the Labor Party no longer support mutual obligation in return for welfare payments. Or is it that we see the Labor Party in government saying one thing and the Labor Party in opposition saying another?</para>
<para>The Labor senators involved in the Senate Community Affairs References Committee 2004 report <inline font-style="italic">A hand up not a hand out: renewing the fight against poverty</inline> recommended that a poverty summit be held, an adoption of poverty targets and an antipoverty agency as an independent statutory authority be established. A poverty summit would neither solve nor resolve anything. The government already gives careful consideration to the views of welfare groups and other community organisations. A summit would be nothing more than a glorified PR exercise in which the participants would feel good about themselves but little else would be achieved. When Labor talk about setting poverty targets their idea of reducing poverty does not extend beyond giving people more and more welfare payments. An antipoverty agency would be totally inappropriate. The responsibility for developing, implementing and monitoring social policy is not a function that should be delegated to a statutory authority. None of these recommendations would do anything to address the issue of poverty. They are typical of the Labor Party, who are bereft of any real solutions to the very real problem of poverty.</para>
<para>From 1 July 2006 parents who apply for parenting payment single will be no longer eligible for that payment once their youngest child turns eight. They will instead, subject to meeting other eligibility criteria, be eligible for Newstart allowance. From 1 July 2006 parents who apply for parenting payment will be no longer eligible for that payment once their youngest child turns six. They will instead, subject to meeting other eligibility criteria, be eligible for Newstart allowance. Those already receiving parenting payment as at 1 July 2006 will remain on that pension benefit until their youngest child turns 16 years of age, as is the case now.</para>
<para>The Australians Working Together 2001 reforms only required parenting payment recipients to undertake a part-time activity of up to 150 hours over each 26 weeks when their youngest child turns 13 years of age. People who apply for the disability support pension after 1 July 2006 will be assessed against a criteria of whether they can work at least 15 hours per week at full award wages with the receipt of two years or less of assistance. This assessment will be undertaken by the comprehensive work capacity assessment teams. People who are able to work for 15 hours or more per week will be eligible for Newstart allowance. People who are unable to work at least 15 hours or more per week will be eligible for the disability support payment. Those who are eligible for disability support from 11 May 2005 will be subject to future assessments to determine whether they have the capacity to work 15 hours a week.</para>
<para>People currently on disability support can voluntarily seek work and have full access to employment and job search assistance services. A two-year suspension rule will also be applied to disability support pension recipients who enter the work force. This means that a person will be allowed to return to disability support payment at any time during a two-year period regardless of their reason for leaving their employment. Parents in receipt of parenting payment support, PPP or NSA where the youngest child has turned six will be required to work 15 hours per week. Parents may be considered for temporary exemptions from participation requirements depending on their special family circumstances. Parentsâ individual circumstances will be taken into account when determining their participation requirements.</para>
<para>The government recognises that some primary carer parentsâfor example, registered foster carers, registered distance educators, recognised home schoolers or those who have large families or a disabled childâmay be unavailable for work because of the need to focus fully on their caring responsibilities. If a parent has special family circumstances such as these, they will be taken into account when determining their participation requirements under the Welfare to Work changes, and the parent may be eligible for a temporary exemption. It is important in my role as a backbencher in this government that we monitor and continue to review all of this legislation once it has been implemented. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThe <inline ref="R2461">Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline> and <inline ref="R2457">Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work) Bill 2005</inline>, which we are debating in the chamber today, were first flagged in the Treasurerâs budget speech earlier this year. I took a particular interest in what the Treasurer had to say because the changes in moving people from welfare to work would have a significant impact on the people that I represent in this parliament. I have about 10,000 people in the categories of disability support pensioners and sole parents in my electorate and so, naturally, any change in their conditions and entitlements is an issue that I need to follow carefully. I listened carefully to the Treasurerâs speech, and I must say it left me with the impression that the rationale for these so-called reforms was much more about cost savings than a genuine effort to construct a package that would, in a practical and tangible way, assist people to move from welfare to work.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In defence of what now appear to be the most radical changes to the provision of social security since the act was introduced back in 1947, the Treasurer glibly argued that the changes would âalso reduce the obligation on other taxpayers whose taxes pay for the welfare supportâ. You could not help but conclude that the Treasurerâs agenda was really about cost reductions rather than genuine reform, and I think the legislation before us confirms that that is the case. The member for McMillan has just said that income support for these categories of recipients is not sustainable in the long run. Tell that to the 10,000 people in my electorate who well know that the governmentâs projected surplus this year will be in the order of $12 billion to $14 billion.</para>
<para>What the member for McMillan did not address in his contribution was the fundamental crux of this bill and which goes to the heart of the question: how does slashing the entitlements of people eligible for the disability support pension or the sole parent payment help them to find work? That is the central question that, in my judgment, has neither been properly addressed nor answered by the government.</para>
<para>I support the objective of helping people move from welfare to work. I could not think of anything more depressing than facing a lengthy period of time on welfare support alone. Having a job is important. Work is a fundamental building block of social and economic inclusion. The community and the individual benefit when more people are able to participate in the social and economic mainstream. Flowing from this are not only personal and individual benefits but macro benefits as well.</para>
<para>The member for McMillan was right in pointing to the imperatives that face our economy with an ageing population. There is no argument about the need for Australia to increase its labour participation ratesâthat is an important priorityâbut how we go about realising these objectives is really the crux of the problem with the bill before us. I would like the member for McMillan to tell me how it is that merely moving people already on very low income support to an even lower benefit is going to help them achieve paid work. On current entitlements, people who have disabilities in the future and who are able to work for 15 hours or more will be at least $77 a fortnight worse off, and sole parents $44 per fortnight.</para>
<para>At the recent Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry, the department confirmed that, if this bill is passed, by 2008 an estimated 171,000 people will be on lower payments than they would be under current arrangements. What is the governmentâs justification for this action? What is the rationale for moving people to a lesser payment when the legislation is supposedly to assist them moving from welfare to work? Make no mistake about it: the central plank of this legislation is all about income reduction. From July 2006, there will be a reduction in income for many sole parents and people with a disability. People with a disability will face a harsher and more restrictive test when claiming the disability support pension. Those who are assessed as being able to work for 15 hours or more will be entitled only to the Newstart allowanceâthat is, the dole payment. Future applicants for the parenting payment single benefit will be moved onto the lower dole payment when their child turns eight.</para>
<para>Not only does the reduced Newstart allowance cut their income support but, as we also know, the Newstart allowance has a lower âfreeâ area. It is subject to higher withdrawal rates and harsher tax treatment than both the disability support pension and the single parenting payment. The effect of all this will be to place people with a disability and sole parents in a substantially worse financial position than they would be under current arrangements. In addition, they will face far higher effective marginal tax rates, which we all know operate as a disincentive to work.</para>
<para>If the member for McMillan does not accept my argument, I would like to tell him about the findings of NATSEM, a highly authoritative research body, which had a look at the impact of the proposed changes on sole parents. I think it is very revealing. Their modelling showed that, once placed on the lesser Newstart allowance, a sole parent working for 15 hours a week on the minimum wage would keep just $81 of a $195 weekly pay packet. The government would take another $114 by way of changes to the income test and through taxes so that many sole parents would be facing an effective marginal tax rate of between 65 and 75 per cent. NATSEM claim that a sole parent would be $91 a week worse off by moving into work under these proposals than they would be under current arrangements. The government would effectively be asking sole parents to work for $5.40 an hour.</para>
<para>I do not know whether the member for McMillan thinks about this incentive, but I know that many people in the community would be appalled to think that the end result of these changes, combined with the effective marginal tax rates, would have sole parents working for $5.40 an hour. Please tell me what the incentive is for sole parents to move into paid work when they face losing 65c in every dollar they earn? And that is before they pay for transport and other costs and, very importantly, for child-care arrangements if they can find a child-care place.</para>
<para>People with disabilities will be even more drastically affected by this legislation than sole parents. Single disability recipients aged over 20 are expected to receive about $257 a week on average in 2006-07. The Newstart rateâthat is, the new unemployment rateâfor a single person without children will be $46 a week less. A crucial factor affecting disability pensioners will be the amount of private income that they can receive before their income support is reduced. In 2006-07, a single DSP recipient will be able to earn $64 a week without any reduction in their income support, but they will be able to earn only $31 on the unemployment benefit before their support is reduced. For every dollar of income they earn above this threshold, their payment from government will be reduced by 40c whereas on Newstart it will be reduced by 50c to 60c. Again I ask: where are the practical incentives and proposals to assist people move into paid employment?</para>
<para>No evidence has ever been provided, nor did it come forward in the Senate inquiry, that cutting payments will actually increase labour force participation. It is quite extraordinary that this government has taken a decision to reduce the income levels of so many Australians without providing any empirical data or clear rationale that such reductions would, in fact, enhance work force participation. I agree with the member for McMillan: increasing work force participation at a time when our population is ageing is a very key economic imperativeâbut you have gone about it in the wrong way. The government has gone about it in a very punishing, mean-spirited way rather than actually building in the kind of support systems required to assist people to move from welfare to work. Furthermore, I think that there will be more complexity when we create these new categories of recipients, with different levels of payment and different activity requirements. We will in effect create a far more complex and inconsistent social security system.</para>
<para>The evidence presented to the Senate inquiry from a range of welfare agencies and churches was overwhelmingly to the effect that these changes will increase hardship and poverty. I know that the member for McMillan argues that it is a baseless claim to say that poverty levels will increase. I suggest he tell that to the Brotherhood of St Laurence, Anglicare and other agencies that work on a daily basis with people at the lower end of the income scale and people desperately in need of help. In their submissions to the inquiry, both of these agencies said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... reduced payments to sole parents and people with disabilities are unnecessary and counter-productive and will result in increased hardship for groups already facing significant disadvantage. The Bill introduces new activity test requirements for people in these groups but fails to tailor these to individual circumstances and imposes harsh penalties on those who do not meet them.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I repeat: by the departmentâs own estimates, by 2008 there will be 171,000 people on lower payments than they would be under current arrangements.</para>
<para>In concluding my comments on this bill, I want to touch on the very important issue of the interaction of these changes with the very regressive changes contemplated in the governmentâs industrial relations proposals. During the Senate inquiry, St Vincent de Paul and other welfare agencies rightly pointed out that this bill, in combination with the IR legislation, will see an increase in poverty levels and a significant growth in the number of working poorâand, beyond that, of course, not just the working poor as adults but the children in those family groupings. I fear that the impact of income support cuts is going to be felt more intensely in areas like mineâand I dare say in areas like the member for McMillanâsâin regional and rural Australia, where we all know jobs are that much harder to find.</para>
<para>When you look at the age composition of people on the disability support pension in my electorate, you see that the overwhelming majority are mature aged people. Try finding a job in the Illawarra if you are 50 or over. I tell you: it is very hard. When you compound that difficulty with a disabled person looking for work, it is even more problematic. If it were that easy, why is it that under this government the number of disabled people in employment in the government sector has dropped from 5.6 per cent to 3.8 per cent? If it is hard for the government to place people with disabilities in employment, how much harder is it going to be in a competitive labour market? What will be the options for many sole parents I represent who have been out of the work force for lengthy periods, engaged in the important responsibility of child rearing? Regrettably, the provisions of this bill risk placing the most vulnerable in our community in a position where they may be compelled to accept employment with below current award conditions or lose their entitlements.</para>
<para>The interaction of the changes proposed in this bill together with the governmentâs IR changes creates a situation in which an income support recipient is required to accept employment on just the bare, basic minimum conditions. We know those minimum conditions as proposed by the government are devoid of penalty rates, overtime, leave loadings and the rest. If recipients do not accept a job, they stand to lose their payments for eight weeks at a time. No-one has told me how sole parents and their children will cope with no income coming into their household for eight weeks at a time. In other words, it will be: accept the contract on offer for the job on offer and, if you do not take it, not only do you risk not finding meaningful work but also you face the loss of your entitlement. In the words of the St Vincent de Paul Society:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Our concern lies primarily with the way in which the combination of these two reform agendas will result in some of the most vulnerable members of the community being pushed off social security and into low-paid jobs that will be offered on the proviso that an Australian Workplace Agreementâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">that is, an individual contractâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">be accepted, even if that Agreement results in a lowering of real income and a loss of conditions such as penalty rates. The potential for those AWAs to wreak havoc on the lives of Australian families, especially the precarious positions of single-parent families, is very real and profoundly disturbing.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I think it is profoundly disturbing because these people, who are going to be forced into work after already facing a reduction in their current levels of entitlement, will be on the last rung of the bargaining ladder. In many situations, they will have no option but to accept a contract on very low minimum conditions or lose their entitlements. In reality, the result of this interaction of the two pieces of legislation, both of which we vehemently oppose, is that single parents or those with a partial work capacity will be presented with a stark choice: accept a job that many others would not accept because it is below current award standards or lose your benefits.</para>
<para>The member for McMillan has claimed that it is baseless to assert that there will be the possibility, if not the distinct probability, of increasing levels of poverty in our community and increasing growth in the number of working poor. Yet, as he himself has recognised, in his area and mine we do have problems of intergenerational poverty. This bill does nothing in a tangible way to make the prospects of the people who are most vulnerable in our community any brighter into the future. These are the most drastic changes that we have contemplated to the social welfare system since the introduction of the Social Security Act in 1947. In my judgment, they fail to pass any objective and reasonable test of so-called welfare reform. In my view, real welfare reform would look at the reasons people are not engaged in paid employment and, instead of shifting the blame onto them, would actually look at areas like mine where paid employment is not a feasible option for many people currently on the disability support pension. I have youth unemployment rates of 25 to 30 per cent in my electorateâin some suburbs the rate is over 30 per centâand we have managed to put in pilot programs that have helped young people move from being unemployed into an apprenticeship. But it is not easy, and it is certainly more problematic the older people become, particularly for those with disabilities.</para>
<para>I thought real welfare reform would actually look at the reasons why people are not in paid work and would deliver practical and meaningful solutions. But, instead of helping people shift from welfare to work, the so called reforms outlined in this legislation will simply have the end result of dumping people from one benefit to a lesser one. The bill provides insufficient support and reward for many welfare recipients to move from welfare to work. Improving work force participation is an enormous challenge facing our nation, particularly at a time when our population is ageing. But if we really want to get more people into the labour market, then we really need to think of tangible and real methods of assistance and the right incentives particularly focused on the impact of the effective marginal tax rates. When people are giving back to the government more than they are taking home from their earnings, then there is something seriously wrong. I think the essence of this bill really outlines a mean-spirited, punitive, cost-cutting approach. That really permeates the bill, and it is for this reason that I record my opposition to it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI hope the member for Throsby, having issued a challenge on certain aspects of the <inline ref="R2461">Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline>, will now listen to why her proposition is wrong. She informed us that some 10,000 people throughout her electorate could be affected by this legislation. If hers is a standard electorate, there are about 150,000 people living in it and, just for starters, I want to make the case for the other 140,000. Furthermore, I want to reject the proposition that the safety net which is provided to people who for whatever reason are unable to achieve paid employment should be taken into account when somebody gets a job.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Because they have never been unemployed, the 140,000 people in the member for Throsbyâs electorate do not believe that they are on $5 an hour when they are earning $12-plus. This particular argument of effective tax rates suggests that someone who has been supported through the safety net by all the other taxpayers has no incentive to go to work and give the 140,000 people in the member for Throsbyâs electorate a bit of a better chance. What about the young person who, possibly with the assistance of their parentsâand I hope in our new negotiating arrangements parents will go out with their young people to assist them in negotiating their first pay; that seems to me a very good ideaâis negotiating their first pay? The reality is that when they start they do not say the 12 bucks an hour they are getting is actually $5 an hour because if they had chosen not to work they would have got X amount of money. It is a fallacious argument and it is an insult to that high percentage of Australians who have never been on a benefit.</para>
<para>If the member for Throsby, having issued the challenge, had bothered to stay around to listen, I would have pointed out to her the table that the government has provided based on the minimum wageâand I might add that no-one will be forced to go into work for less than that; that is another condition of the legislation. If they take a job for a mere 15 hours a week at $12.75, their wage plus the benefits for which they will still be entitled is $487 a week. If it is $487, it is $487âdonât go and deduct the $433 they would have got for not working. Anybody that wants to stand up in one of the factories of the Illawarra and promote the argument to the workers that they should all discount their wages by what they would get if they did not work can do so. But it must be one of the stupidest concepts ever, and I am more than willing to stand alongside the member for Throsby in her electorate and debate her on that point.</para>
<para>I think it is time that within this debate we put a case for functional familiesâtaxpaying families in many of which the husband and wife are both employed. It is apparently impossible for a single parent of either sex to go to work because there are children at home, but there is no benefit for functional families whose parents both go to work when the children are at home. A latchkey kid is a latchkey kid whether there is one parent or two if they both workâand if one of those parents happens to be in small business they get home at eight oâclock. It is an irrational argument, and it is wrong. If you want to argue the case of parenting in a proper wayâand I would be supportive of thatâit is time that we gave tax deductibility for nannies and it is time, where both parents are working, that we gave tax deductibility for home services; it is another job.</para>
<para>What is more, I have proposed for years that the tax deductionâthat is, the amount by which you can reduce your income for tax purposesâshould be equal to three times the PAYE moneys you submit to the tax office on behalf of these employees. We all know about the cash economy in home services and the consequent abuse of the welfare safety net. So I say to the member for Throsby: for goodness sake, stop denigrating the working, tax-paying constituents of your electorate on the basis that anybody who has been fortunate enough to receive a safety-net payment has no incentive to go to work. They have an obligation to go to work if they are physically capable of being employed.</para>
<para>In that regard, there are a couple of other issues. I visit a particular shop to buy a certain product. Immediately behind the counter of that shop is an office that is occupied by a fellow in a wheelchair. He is a middle manager. If it gets too busy at the counter, he wheels himself out and serves customers. He could obviously argue that, because he is wheelchair-bound, he does not need to work. But he does work. He has a well-paid position and he obviously enjoys it and is proud of it. I know of some parents who had a child who was sufficiently disadvantaged to be unable to get a driverâs licence but who, for tax reasons, was a partner in the family business. He did not workâuntil Centrelink caught up with the fact that he had an income. He had never seen the incomeâas we know is the case in many of these arrangementsâbut some money had to be repaid. The member for Throsby tells us there is no incentive for people to take work if you take their benefits away from them. This young bloke got a job straightaway when the benefit disappeared because he was not technically eligible for it. So do not run the line that the benefits are so good that they are an incentive not to seek employment.</para>
<para>I want to take that a step further. In one of my local rural newspapers there was an article about Rural Skills Australia desperately seeking people to participate in agricultural skills training programs. Launched at the Royal Show last October, the first course offered was Harvest Operationsâfor which there is a huge labour shortage in my electorate with a record crop. There are businesses importing people from the Northern Hemisphere to hire out to farmers to drive their harvesting equipment. The first Harvest Operations course was offered by CY OâConnor TAFE at Cunderdin Agricultural College and only four of the 12 available places were filled. Yet there is an argument no doubt being promoted in this place during this debate that country people cannot find a job.</para>
<para>In the mining industry today, the preferred operators of heavy machinery are womenâbecause they are kinder to the equipment. And what is the difference between a harvester and a dump truck? Yet I am told it is an unfair imposition on single parents in my electorate to require them to undertake harvesting work. I attended a child-care conference in my electorate and I was told that one of the problems was that they cannot get child-care workers. I asked them about home careâand we even pay money to people to upgrade their homes for this. I was told that a couple of people tried it but it interfered with their social lives. Excuse me!</para>
<para>These are the issues that are being confronted in these matters. People have an obligation to take paid employment when it is available. I have two very large meatworks in my electorate. It is a credit to the community that one of those meatworks now has a âmother shiftâ from 9 am to 3 pm, and it has helped them immeasurably in the productivity they can achieve. I think it is a great idea. The other meatworks operates within reasonable transport distance of a population centre of 30,000 people and it is importing a full shift of Filipinos to start a second shift. Yet I am told that we have to maintain a system that pays people not to work when that quantity of work is available.</para>
<para>We also have training schemes which people are declining to participate in. To me, that is outrageous. I know the jobs are there. I would think that, if I were a supporting parent with a house, I could function and support others with a job. To my shock and horror, I was recently advised that the majority of child-care places that this government funds are used by people who do not work. For what? The disability support program costs $10 billion a year and it deals with a wide range of people, some of whom have a genuine entitlement. When we look at the briefings the government has provided, there is an extensive list of reasons why people do not have to take employment, including where the terms and conditions of the job are below the minimum terms and conditions under the Australian fair pay and conditions standard. In other words, if the remuneration is below $12.75 there can be no punishment if you refuse to take the job.</para>
<para>There are, from (a) to (j), all sorts of reasons. You do not have to take that work if it is in the Defence Force. Unfortunately, having quoted that example on training, âthe person lacks the particular skills, experience or qualifications that are needed to perform the workâ is an excuse. I keep referring to a harvester. A harvester today is a very simple piece of equipment from an operatorâs point of view. The newest ones even know when to turn the corner without the help of the operator. The cab is airconditioned. It is extremely safe. It could be operated by someone in a wheelchair. I am not suggesting that, but that is the ease of operation. Why are single parents not prepared to take that sort of employment? People are being brought in from the Northern Hemisphere. We read the other day that the fruit producers are delighted that 500 backpackers have had their stay in Australia extended by 12 months so that they will go and pick fruit for three months. I welcome that initiative from the government, but do not tell me that rural Australia has not got the capacity to offer employment for 15 hours a week. When do we pick most of the fruit in the south-east corner of Australia? It is done during the school holidays, yet we are told that people cannot participate. In that regard, the member for Throsby said that people would be $77 per week worse off if they went to work, yet they will get a gross of $487 and, if they stick at it for a period of timeâI have forgotten what it isâthey will have $16,000 worth of superannuation accumulated. You just cannot make the comparison that people have a right not to work because they do not get enough extra for going to work. The member for Throsby is virtually saying that, if you are on one of these pensions, you have to earn $1,000 a week before you can get off it.</para>
<para>There are other matters. As I said, I headed my notes, âA plea for functional familiesâ, and I guess I have addressed that to some extent, and in fact given some other examples. There are 630,000 Australians receiving parenting payments. They are typically femaleâand I do not want anything read into thatâbut in todayâs environment where do we see women working? We see them in the defence forces. We see them in the police force, frequently in the front line against protestors and, from what I have seen on television, some of those females handle themselves pretty well. As I mentioned, we also see women in the mining industry. There is a new environment and there are work opportunities. I am advised that a group of women in one of the isolated towns in the Pilbara has formed their own skills working group, and they guarantee the employer that X number of workers will be there to operate the machinery each day. They send them. There might be 20 of them and five turn up each dayâI do not know the numbersâbut that is the sort of initiative one group of people has taken, while others, with the full support of the opposition, say: âYou shouldnât think like that. You have a right to reduce the income entitlement of working Australians by being on a welfare benefit.â I am unable to understand the logic of those people. When people are quoting figures about people living below the poverty line I think it is time they took account of the fact that, statistically, many of them live in rich families. They do not have large incomes but, from a family perspective, they are very comfortable.</para>
<para>There are other matters of interest to me. I represent one of the three remaining electorates where rural industry predominates. Everywhere I turn I do not receive stories about people who cannot get a job. I receive stories from people asking whether I can help them to get workers in from South Africa, and from here and there, and whether I can help to speed up the immigration process et cetera. While that is happening I know of hundreds of peopleâI have my percentageâwho are claiming benefits. We know very well that the percentage of people shifted onto the disability pension in the dying days of the Keating government was significant. There was a reason: they did not come up in any unemployment statistics. These are all the issues that we have set out to do something about. Let me say something else about intergenerational unemployment, be it for physical or other reasons. Back in 1976 I had a fairly spectacular car accident. People will note that I limp to this day, and maybe my injuries are sufficient that I should be on a disability pensionâsome might suggest that is what I do in this place.</para>

<para>âYes, I know. You can always do me the favour of thinking I am stupid, because by doing so I have a number of victories. I spent five months in hospital. Throughout my life I have worked 24/7, and my vocation has always been my fun. I am an active person, and that is one of the reasons I am still in employment at 70. But during that period I was amazed at how adjusted I became to doing nothing. Someone walked in with my breakfast and I ate it. Someone walked in at about 10 oâclock with a cup of coffee, and we had a bit of a chat about what was going in the hospital, and then someone walked in with my lunch. I got to the stage, when I was mobile in the later stages in a wheelchair, of arguing with myself about going down to brush my teeth. Fortunately I recovered, left the hospital and got back to an active life. But it was a great lesson to me about the tragedy of creating an atmosphere where people think it is okay not to be functional and out there in employment.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I add in my closing wordsâand I have said it here time and time againâthat, for many parental situations, working from home is an excellent option. You can work four hours a day at home and net the equivalent of eight hours at work. That might be as a computer operator, as a pieceworker making clothing or as something else. The huge cost of going to work should always be taken into account, particularly if child care and other matters are involved. I think the government could do more about that, particularly as an employer. I have argued for a long time that I do not think we do enough, but I support this legislation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI am very grateful to have the opportunity to speak on the <inline ref="R2461">Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline>. The bill enables the government to change the eligibility for the disability support pension, DSP; parenting payment single, PPS; and parenting payment partnered, PPP, so as to restrict access to these payments. Would-be recipients of these payments will be moved onto Newstart allowanceâthat is, unemployment benefit or the doleâwhich is a lower payment with harsher, more punishing, effective marginal tax rates than the DSP and the PPS.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>A whole new raft of obligations will also have to be met if people are to receive their benefit. Some of the intent of this legislation has been anticipated. But it is fair to say that, until the legislation became available, no-one really knew what the detail would entail. Funnily enough, this piece of legislation and the lead-up to it did not in fact attract a $50 million government advertising campaign as other legislation did recently. This legislation was introduced on 9 November. With a great deal of reluctance, the government eventually agreed to a Senate committee inquiry to examine the details of this legislation. On that same day, 9 November, the committee received the reference. The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee invited submissions by 16 November. Only 62 were received. The committee held only four days of public hearingsâone in Albury, I understand, and three here in Canberra. This was an outrageously short time frame. The committee eventually reported, I believe, on 28 November, and today is the 30th.</para>
<para>I was so concerned about this truncated, unacceptably short time frame for an inquiry by a Senate committee into very complicated legislation that I took the effort to write to a number of organisations and individuals in my electorate as quickly as I could, encouraging them, wherever it was possible, to send a submission to that committee and, failing thatâif they were in a position to do soâto send some of their views to me, despite that very short time frame. I am pleased that some of them were able to do that. I will return to that a little later in my comments and share some of the views that I received from these people.</para>
<para>The government have tried a number of times to change the eligibility criteria for the disability support pension and each time they have failed. A fair question would be: why? The government might claim it was because of a hostile Senate at the timeâthat they have not been able to govern and that now they can. Well, there is no doubt about that, but the reality is the uproar and the strong arguments put forward largely and widely by the community against the mooted changes at the time.</para>
<para>The work test change from 30 hours to 15 hours a week for the DSP in particular drew the wrath of so many people across Australia and in my community. It was noted at the time that the government just withdrew their attempt to change the legislation. The government have now quarantined the 700,000-plus people who receive the disability support pension from the changes contained in this legislation. The problem with this of course is that these people will be excluded from any training opportunities offered in this legislation. I use those words reservedly, because we need to look at the number when we talk about training opportunities that may be attached to this legislation.</para>
<para>In doing so, I refer to a paper that was made available by the Australian Council of Social Serviceâan organisation which the government will probably immediately disagree with, but nevertheless their figures are absolutely correct. With respect to shortfalls in employment assistance, they said that the target groups to which training opportunities should be targeting for employment assistance include: 200,000 jobless parents with older children, plus 30,000 new recipients per annum; 700,000 current DSP recipients, plus over 20,000 people with disabilities moving onto the Newstart allowance each year; 200,000 very long-term unemployed, plus 50,000 per year who will become very long-term unemployed; and 70,000 mature age unemployed. The extra places per year that come in under this legislation include: VET, 5,000; open employment places, 5,000; rehab, 14,000 places; the Wage Assistance Program, 7,000 places; and the Personal Support Program, 3,000 places.</para>
<para>You do not have to be a mathematical genius to understand the stark discrepancy in those numbersâthe absolute inadequacy of the training opportunities that will be offered under the guise of this new legislation. If there are genuine opportunities to positively assist people off welfare and into work, those people currently on DSP should be offered that opportunity as well. This government has effectively written off every one of those.</para>
<para>In the financial year 2003-04, just under 10 per cent of people on the DSP had employment related earningsâthat is, around 63,000 people out of a population of 673,000 at the time. Australia had the seventh lowest employment rate in the OECD for people with a disability. According to the 2003 <inline font-style="italic">OECD Employment Outlook</inline>, Australian people with a disability had just over a 40 per cent chance of finding employment. The Commonwealth itself has contributed to this situation. Since 1996, the proportion of Australian government employees with a disability dropped from 5.6 per cent to just over 3.8 per cent.</para>
<para>As well, this government has capped the number of places in open employment servicesâthat is, services there to explicitly help people with disabilities into the workplace. This government capped those places not according to need but according to money. Those places were given a budget to operate on that did not reflect the level of need in the disability community in our country to try and assist people to move from the disability support pension and into work. All the while the government complained about the number of people on the disability support pension, holding these people up as malingerersâeffectively, in my view, shaming people who receive a disability support pension. There were never any criteria attached to these claims; it was a sweeping statement constantly made: âToo many people on DSP. Bad backs; malingerers. Weâve got to do something about it.â</para>
<para>There are a few facts that need to be considered. People only get DSP if medical or other experts chosen by Centrelink have assessed them. Over a quarter of DSP recipients have a mental illness. The strongest growth in DSP in the 1990s was among mature age women, not older men. Many people, such as MS sufferers or people with recurring mental illness, are able to work part time but they simply cannot hold down full-time work. The truth is that the government have dramatically failed these people in the past. They have done very little, if anything, to positively invest in or assist with training, personal care and other initiatives to assist people to move from a disability support pension into some form of work.</para>
<para>I am sick and tired of hearing some people oppositeâwe had a brilliant example a few minutes agoâtalk about bad backs, malingerers, people not wishing to do anything, people playing with the system in a fraudulent fashion, yet they do nothing to support positive progress for these people. It is no secret at all that the overwhelming majority of people with a disability would far prefer a different life. You do not have to be a Rhodes scholarâall you have to do is get out there and talk to and listen to people with disabilitiesâto understand what their real aspirations are. Every one of them you speak to, no matter what their degree of disability, would honestly, truthfully, wish to participate more fully in our community.</para>
<para>We on this side of the House believe in welfare reform that actually respects individuals, that does not punish them. I believe that people with a capacity to work should be able to do so, but you do not achieve those outcomes by cutting their effective income, by penalising them. It is not cheap to live with a disability, so how on earth can the government stand here and expect me and others to accept honestly that they think the right thing to do is to penalise people, to coerce themâas Minister Dutton has said in the pastâby cutting their effective income in an attempt to try to get them into work and off welfare? Real reform actively encourages employers to give people with a disability the opportunity to demonstrate their ability.</para>
<para>I want to endorse and associate myself with the contribution made earlier in this debate by the member for Jagajaga and the financial detail that she referred to when considering the impact of this legislation on sole parents and people with disabilities. I also wish to commend the statements made in this debate earlier this morning by the member for Pearce. I genuinely wish her and her colleagues, who are attempting to highlight the problems with this legislation, strength in their discussions within their party ranks.</para>
<para>I want to refer to the work undertaken by NATSEM on behalf of the National Foundation for Australian Womenâan organisation representing a very wide range of womenâs organisations throughout this country. According to NATSEM, if a person with a disability works 15 hours a week at the minimum wage, they will keep only 25c in every dollar they earn; the rest goes in tax. That means such a person will be $122 per week worse off by moving into work under these changes. The implications of this legislation are so far-reaching that I wish I could stand here for an hour or more to start touching on all the issues; I am touching on just a few of them. One that I need to mention is the breaching regime. Stopping income support payments to a single parent family or to a person with a disability for up to two months, often for minor breaches, will not help anyone.</para>
<para>Earlier I mentioned the responses I have had from within my community, from people who simply could not make the disgracefully short Senate inquiry time line. I want to say that again: the disgracefully short Senate inquiry time lineâwhat a farce. But some of these people were able to get to me some of the comments that they would like put on the public record. It is my honour to do that. I will do it here because, as I said, they could not do it in front of the committee.</para>
<para>The first one I want to refer to comes from the Care Inc. Financial Counselling Service. The service has been the main provider of financial counselling and related services in the ACT and the region since 1983. The majority of its clients have a Centrelink benefit as their main source of income. The predominant benefit sources between January and June this year were parenting payment at 41 per cent and disability support pension at 24 per cent. The people at Care are aware of the observations about the likely financial impacts of the proposed welfare to work reforms on the incomes of people receiving benefits. In particular, they have noted the economic analysis conducted by NATSEM which concluded that the incomes of many people currently on disability pensions will be cut by at least one quarter if this legislation is passed. Care notes:</para>

<para class="block">If consumers in receipt of such benefits already require the assistance of an agency like ours to make ends meet, it is entirely predictable that their situation will get worse if their already insufficient income actually decreases.</para>

<para class="block">Care also comment on the pressure of continuing unsustainable debt levels. More of their clients are using credit, particularly high-cost credit on card facilities to pay for necessities such as food, medicine, clothing, accommodation and so on. I would like to quote a couple of excerpts from the correspondence given to me by Care:</para>

<para class="block">that is, that of the writer of this letterâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">is that the current Commonwealth Government believes its welfare reform agenda will improve the lot of lower income consumers. That belief appears to be based on the logic that there is no better financial security than having a job. The collective and current knowledge of those who work most closely with low income consumers every day and reflect the experiences of those very consumers in their work, is that the intention of improving lives will not be achieved by reducing their incomes and making already strained financial situations worse. The stick and stick approach is fundamentally flawed ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">They go on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The basic lack of logic in the approach is well illustrated by the system of withholding benefits from people who do not undertake the activities required by the proposed Welfare to Work rules. Other financial arrangements, such as direct debit facilities and so on will fall over when benefits are suspended. Consumers will then be slugged with penalty fees and charges for payments not being processed because accounts hold insufficient funds.</para>

<para class="block">I also heard from a constituent of mine, Evelyn Scott OAM, who is the immediate past President of the ACT Down Syndrome Association and has done a vast amount of community work in this particular area of our community. I would like to just refer to some of the comments that she has sent to me:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The shortness of time allowed for submissions to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee is totally inadequate for particularly community organizations (consisting largely of volunteer staff) to prepare considered comments.</para>

Some people with disabilities may not have received sufficient encouragement/education/support to equip themselves with skills for the workplace for a wide variety of reasons; some people with disabilities may not be able to work; and some people with disabilities who receive a pension are highly fearful (and rightly so) that their current entitlements will be taken away from them when it is the only form of incomeâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">they have been able to receive.</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">BUT a large majority of people with disabilities want a REAL jobâa job in the workplace where they are treated as âjust another member of staffâ, where they are given work commensurate with their abilities, where workplaces learn to devolve duties so people with disabilities can be gainfully employed, where employers do not find it all âjust too hardâ to design jobs for people with disabilities, and where people with disabilities are included in staff training and development exercises, social activities, etc.</para>
<para class="block">Jobs for people with disabilities need to be designed to fit their abilitiesânot their disabilities.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I also heard from the current President of the ACT Down Syndrome Association, and she has told me that this response has been authorised by their committee at a general meeting on 14 November. They say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">* The time allowance for submissions to these Bills does not allow for community organisations, particularly small and unfunded ones, to consider these Bills in depth before making their responses.</para>
<para class="block">* People with disabilities do want to make a contribution to the community at large, especially within the workforce. They feel it is their right to be an individual placing their commitment to a workplace, just as any other person. This enables them to feel a sense of belonging, being a part of their larger community, and to be a worthwhile member of the community, again as any other person.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In conclusion, I note that in his second reading speech on the tabling of this legislation the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The government firmly believes that the best form of welfare is a job.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">All I can say is this: with the governmentâs extreme changes to industrial relations, people with disability and sole parents, who already have very little bargaining power in the workplace, will have even less protection from exploitation at work.</para>
<para>This legislation is offering a fundamental change in the social fabric of our communities and to the people within them. Rather than holding people with disabilities and sole parents up as people to complain about, a better and a more positive way, I am sure, of getting the outcome that we would all want for these people is to offer encouragement. We need to offer true, honest training and not fudge the figures about just how many training places are going to be available. We need to be real and honest about it and, at the end of the day, we need to congratulate thoseâparticularly those with disabilityâwho achieve an outcome that we can all join with in applauding. I support the amendment; I deplore the bill as it stands.</para>

<para>âWe now know the Australian Labor Partyâs view: it opposes the philosophy that the best form of welfare is a job. I am astounded, because when you talk to the community this is what they will tell you: âI want a job; I donât want to be sitting on welfare.â They want to contribute. They want to feel valued, whoever they are. I even know blind people who seek to work because they want to contribute.

It is a great tribute to that particular fellow, because he wants to work and he wants to contribute.</para>

<para>I have read the Labor Party amendment. The first part says, âthe House declines to give the Bill a second readingâ. As you would expect, what the Labor Party does is oppose, oppose, oppose.

<para>In my electorate, if you look at the classifications by occupation and the vacancies that have been advertised over the last 12 months to September 2005âso these are current figuresâand if you look at the number of jobs that were filled within 28 days and the percentage that were not filled within 28 daysâin other words, a measure of demand for labourâyou find that, for labourers and related workers, there were 9,896 vacancies and 48.6 per cent were not filled after 28 days. In the category of intermediate clerical, sales and service workers, there were 2,588 vacancies advertised in 12 months and 56.6 per cent of those vacancies were not filled within 28 days. There were 2,476 vacancies for intermediate production and transport workers over a year and 52.9 per cent were not filled. For tradespeople and related workers, there were 2,365 vacancies and 70 per cent were not filled within 28 days. For elementary clerical, sales and service workers, there were 1,767 vacancies and 53.5 per cent were not filled within 28 days. This is in my electorate. That tells us something. It tells me that there are opportunities there for people to work, not sit on welfare dependency. There is an opportunity for the government to provide the mechanisms whereby people can be equipped to get into the work force, even if they have some kind of disability.</para>
<para>In the 2005 budget the government announced $3.6 billion to increase work force participation and ensure more Australians participate in our economic prosperity. That is a wonderful ideal. It is a wonderful lump of money to help people participate in our economic prosperity. Because of that, increasing work force participation is a key fourth-term objective for the coalition government. We do have a key agenda. This is part of it. This measure before the parliament is not a cost-saving measure; it is a cost against the budgetâand I will outline that shortly.</para>
<para>As part of our key fourth-term agenda, the government announced the pillars of our workplace relations reform program in May and the detailed policy framework, Work Choices, in October. The Work Choices legislation represents the implementation of the governmentâs fourth-term workplace relations agenda and addresses a number of longstanding policy commitments which had been blocked by the Australian Senateâread âAustralian Labor Partyââsince 1996. This is a key element of the <inline ref="R2461">Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline> we are debating here this afternoon. The government is determined that the Work Choices bill will be passed by the end of this parliamentary sitting period and commence operation in March 2006 because the bill will deliver substantial reform in the workplace relations system. It is comprehensive but evolutionary reform. It is moderate and sensible and it will implement a number of new policy items and build on the reforms introduced by the government in 1996.</para>
<para>This is related to the legislation we are discussing today because it shows the way ahead for those who are going to move off welfare dependency into a job. It allows for these people to engage in Australian workplace agreements, for example. They have the choice to have other forms of agreements, but in Australian workplace agreements they can have flexible start and finish times, which may suit people with a disability; they can have flexible working days; they can have paid time off during school holidays; and they can have employee-nominated hours of work. Isnât that fantastic? And employees can bank additional hours worked for paid or unpaid leave.</para>
<para>There are also other flexible provisions that are specifically tailored to meet the needs and requirements of individual employees, such as people currently on a disability payment or a parenting payment. Yet the Australian Labor Party seeks to vote the availability of these new conditions down. It seeks to vote against the legislation we are discussing this afternoon. Only the government has the foresight and the agenda to move Australia forward and to move its people forward in a way that benefits the country and its citizens.</para>
<para>It is interesting to know what Laborâs position is on these bills. Labor are opposing these bills for the sake of opposing them but do not provide any alternative policy. Labor represent a policy-free zone when it comes to addressing the issue of welfare dependency and increasing work force participation in the interests of those who want to work. Labor claim that they support the notion that it is important to assist unemployed people into work. However, they do not support the movement of people from pensions to unemployment benefits which contain mutual obligation requirements. Labor talk about welfare reform but have never actually produced a policy that directly addresses the issues.</para>
<para>Labor claim that welfare to work reforms will create a âworking poorâ. Such claims are baseless. The primary cause of low income is not low wages but joblessness. I have come back to where I startedâobserving that Labor oppose the view that the best form of welfare is a job. I do not oppose that view; I think it is spot on. I intend to support these bills.</para>

<para>âAnother week, another extreme agenda introduced by a single-minded and ideologically driven government which arrogantly knows it controls both houses of this parliament. Last week legislation was passed which will destroy the rights and conditions of Australian workers. Last night counter-terrorism legislation was passed which will reduce societal freedoms without appropriate checks and balances being included. Now we have before us the <inline ref="R2461">Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2457">Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work) Bill 2005</inline>, which do nothing more than transfer vulnerable Australians from one form of welfare to a lower form of welfare.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I wish to make it quite clear from the outset that I would like nothing more than for people in my electorate to be gainfully employed. I dare say there would not be a member of this parliament who would not want the same for all the constituents in their respective electorates. So it is not a matter of whether we support assisting people from welfare to work; it is the way that is achieved. In a modern society, work is a cornerstone. There is no argument with that. It is the foundation on which future opportunity is built and it is central to economic inclusion and advancement. However, these bills have nothing to do with providing welfare recipients with a decent shot at finding real work. They have nothing to do with advancing the employment prospects of the nearly 10,000 people receiving disability support pensions or parenting payment single in my electorate of Werriwa. There is no mistake that these bills are about creating the largest stick possible to whack welfare recipients in an effort to force them into accepting a jobâany jobâto get them off the governmentâs welfare books. Despite the governmentâs obsession with using fear as a motivator, there has not been a skerrick of evidence presented to indicate that moving people from one welfare payment to a lower welfare payment will assist them in finding a job.</para>
<para>The changes contained in these bills are expansive, and it takes some time to really get your head around the full impact of what is being presented. The interaction between payments, entitlements and income tests and movement in the private income thresholds under each payment can make it rather confusing for people to conclude whether they will be better or worse off under these changes. Fortunately, some light has been shed on this. The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling have examined the changes to try to clear away some of the confusion and myth that this government has tried to spin in relation to these bills. NATSEM examined the payments and income tests for a sole parent whose youngest child is aged six and who has no private income. They found that compared to the current payment rates that person would end up receiving, on average, $29 a week less under the parenting payment single. The biggest impact stems from the rate of withdrawal from the Newstart payments once this parent starts to take on a little work. NATSEM report that once the threshold of $31 a week is reached someone receiving Newstart will lose between 50c and 60c in the dollar of private income above that threshold.</para>
<para>If we extend this situation to someone who is working around 15 hours a week and who is earning minimum wagesâaround $13 an hourâyou can see what sort of impact that will have. For each additional hour they work they will be worse off. If, for instance, you are working 15 hours a week at $13 per hour, you would be earning $195 a week in private income. For all that effort, the individual would get to keep $81 while the Howard government will get to take $114 through tax and through reductions to Newstart, because of the adjustment in the threshold. At the end of the day this person will be $91 a week worse off under these changes than if they were moved into work under the current arrangements. They would be $91 worse offâthat is certainly not something to be sneezed at, particularly if you are receiving those payments.</para>
<para>These bills tinker at the margins when it comes to withdrawal rates for Newstart recipients, because the government realises that, despite its protestations to the contrary, people will be worse off under the arrangements. Under the proposals put forward by the government, there is an intention to increase the level at which the payments are withdrawnâfrom 50c in the dollar, which I think cuts in at a little over $50 a week, to the 60c withdrawal rate, which kicks in at around $125 a week. I do not know that the more than 4Â½ thousand sole parents in the western suburbs of Werriwa will be dancing in the streets when they hear about these so-called minor changes or this tweaking at the margins. They still knowâas a matter of fact, anyone who can do rudimentary maths will knowâthat it is highly likely they are going to be worse off. The government might have set a cut-off date earlier in the year, but the vast majority who have heard about these changesâand I suspect that is probably not many, having regard for the fact that this legislation has not been subject to the multimillion dollar advertising blitz the federal government decided to use for the industrial relations changesâwill at least know that they are now in the governmentâs sights.</para>
<para>In typical style, and I suppose it can only be classified as downward envyâthat seems to be the colour and drive of this governmentâs policyâit has set about trying to solve a problem by making things worse rather than better. Many of the people who are going to be impacted by these changes are quite frankly not ready for work. In most circumstances it is not a case of not wanting a job; in many cases these people are simply not prepared for work. That does not mean they are not prepared to work. By this I mean that they are not equipped with the skills that are in demand with employers or that the employers lack the services they need to support someone entering the work force. It is simply not possible to find a stable, reasonable paying job if you are not fulfilling the labour demands that an employer has.</para>
<para>To that extent, these bills do not help but actually hinder peopleâs chances of entering the work force. The people who these bills target need to become job ready and in their ongoing search for employment need to be assisted with adequate investment in training and support services. I do not quite understand how the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations can expect that a group of people who have been out of work for some time will all of a sudden be able to enter the job market and be snapped up by waiting employers just because the minister has decreed that that is what should occur. That is not the way the world works. Meaningful welfare reform must provide opportunities for unemployed people to gain skills that employers demand, skills that will get them into a job and sustain them in employment. This does not necessarily mean enrolling in multiyear TAFE courses or obtaining trade qualifications. Sometimes it might be as simple as acquiring computer skills or doing a refresher course or an update program.</para>
<para>When I was considering this issue I was reminded of two people in my electorate. Although they are not subject to these changes because of the cut-in, their plights certainly typify those of many unemployed who are keen to get themselves back into the work force but cannot. One is a woman who came in to see me and indicated she had applied for many jobs. She seemed to be quite skilled and from her references I would have to conclude that in the past she would have been regarded as a hard worker. The problem was that this woman who came in to see me did not have any front teeth. Not that this is an impediment to a jobâit is certainly not something that you would find to be a prohibition to employmentâbut, as this woman said to me, âChris, whoâs going to give me a job when I look like this?â That is a real-life experience. This woman was ready, willing and, quite frankly, able to work but simply getting her teeth fixed was a prerequisite to fronting up to an interview for an office job. Newstart payments did not leave her enough money to go to the dentist to have those teeth repaired.</para>
<para>Another fellow came in to see me. He was a local chap who had injured his back a little while ago and for a couple of years had not been able to work. These days he has been looking every day for a job, going through the advertisements. He certainly wants to work, because the Newstart allowance that he is receiving is barely enough to live on. He wants to work, but the thing that is stopping him from getting a job is his computer prowess. He is an accountant and he desperately needs to upgrade his computer skills in modern accounting practices and programs, but the Newstart job provider will not pay for courses for him, so he simply cannot afford it. As I say, these are not manufacturedâthey are real-life experiences. These are two people who came into my office in the south-west of Sydney. They do not need to be motivated with a big stick.</para>
<para>The government has set about crafting this legislation in such a way that we can use it against the unemployed and disadvantaged. Generally they want to work, but getting that first step into the job market, it has to be said, is extremely tough. As the government consistently reminds us, it is a competitive marketâand if you do not have the skills that are required then how does the minister seriously expect that people are suddenly going to find employment? Real welfare reform involves strong government support to equip people with the suite of skills that they need to find work and to keep work. It is not about simply taking a job to keep Centrelink off your back.</para>
<para>The other thing that the government has failed to address in these reforms is the support servicesâthe networks and the help that are required to give people the freedom to work. The fact is that sole parents, if they are to work in any meaningful way, will need child care. I note with interest that the government has tinkered at the margins with the requirement to not go to work if the cost of child care is prohibitive. The Prime Minister has promised that single parents will not have to accept a job that results in low or negative financial gain once the cost of child care is taken into account, but this legislation does not deliver on that promise. Rather than enshrining this principle in the legislation, this has now been left to some unknown bureaucrat to decide how it will work. They will judge whether the costs are prohibitive, and at this stage there is no clear standard against which these costs will be judged.</para>
<para>If the government were really serious about this, it would act to help all working parents by taking some real action to fix the crisis in child-care places. As a representative of an electorate in which both parents, by and large, are forced to work so they can afford somewhere to liveâand anyone who has an electorate in south-western Sydney is in the same position as I amâI can assure members opposite that it is not just people transitioning from welfare to work who find the cost of child care prohibitive. In fact, members opposite may have read the recent newspaper reports demonstrating that in many cases working parents, in particular working mothers, are going to work basically so they can afford child care. I suppose to some extent that is if they are lucky enough to be able to secure a child-care place. Government members may not realise that this is a real problem for working parents. These are real difficulties that working Australian parents combat each day just so they can go and find work or go to work.</para>
<para>While able-bodied single parents are going to find a number of difficulties, spare a thought for the disabled Australians who will also be subject to the tougher Welfare to Work regime. Once again, this group are not going to be supported or supplemented by any real or proper level of assistance. This group of Australians are among the hardest working when they are able to find suitable jobs, but they need the right sort of help, quite frankly, to find the right, and suitable, type of employment. They are not going to get that sort of help from this government. What they are going to get is a more extreme activity test and tougher penalties for breaching the strict compliance regime.</para>
<para>It is the compliance regime that will probably be the greatest sleeper in the brave new world of Welfare to Work. There is no doubt that a reasonable and balanced compliance regime is necessary when it comes to issues of public expenditure. Many members opposite will probably regard an appropriate compliance regime as something that should be avoided, particularly when we are spending on marginal seats or in addition to the multimillion dollar advertising campaigns on issues that take their fancy. But, when it comes to cracking down on vulnerable Australians and their families, government members are willing to institute a very tough and tight compliance regime. If you, Mr Deputy Speaker, are one of these persons on a disability support pension and you get breached, you will get nothing.</para>
<para>The compliance regime in these bills has been labelled by the minister as âfair but firmâ, but in reality it is neither. The compliance regime will see vulnerable Australians pushed over the edge by stopping income support in all formsâtaking the food from the mouths of children and putting people behind in their rent. That is a compliance regime modelled on some medieval torture chamber rather than being something that represents a fair approach to encourage people to keep up their end of the deal. It is yet another example of the perverse and distorted incentives that this government is implementing under its regime.</para>
<para>The impact of these bills does not simply stop with the receiving of welfare. There are multiple rounds of impacts from these bills as they interact with provisions of the governmentâs industrial relations agenda. The governmentâs great concession when it comes to this interaction is that people who are subject to the Welfare to Work reforms will not be required to accept a job that has pay and conditions below the minima established under the new Australian fair pay and conditions standard. This flimsy safety net is not going to help those people when they come to negotiate their near-on compulsory AWA under the workplace relations legislation. People who are subjected to these reformsâthe welfare to work provisions at leastâare already in the weakest of all possible bargaining positions and every employer knows it. What hope have they got to negotiate a good deal for themselves when they have no bargaining chips? But the impact does not stop there. The governmentâs industrial relations reforms give the green light to commence the race to the bottom when it comes to pay and conditions. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âIt is a pleasure to rise in this House today to offer some positive comment and constructive thought on the opportunities and benefits that I feel certain will emanate from these reforms. The <inline ref="R2461">Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline> is about encouraging those in our community who are receiving assistance from our welfare system to join or rejoin the work force. It is all about this government and the people providing support enabling recipients of assistance from welfare to enter productively into the future work force.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The objective of this legislation is to increase work force participation by those receiving working age income support and to reduce the adverse consequences of passive welfare dependence. I do not know of anyone who wants to be in that position. There are currently 700,000 children in Australia living in households in which no adult of working age has a job. Two-thirds of these households are headed by single parents. It is difficult for single parents as they do not have the stimulation, the self-esteem or the ability to do what they would like in a work situation.</para>
<para>Working has many positive influences on an individual and their family members. Participating in the work force provides confidence and a sense of responsibility. People develop skills and knowledge and varying relationships with co-workers and clients, resulting in a sense of wellbeing for the whole household, a sense of pride and a can-do feeling within the household. For those with children, working provides a fantastic example of the many benefits that a job brings and sets a positive example of the responsibilities of entering into adulthood. Seeing mum and dad, or mum or dad, going off to work, time managing, establishing an organised household, being responsible for the accounts for the household and being able to provide heating, cooling and other requirements instils a sense of responsibility in a child right from the beginning. When there is no role model in a household, it is unfair to expect a child to have any desire or motivation to enter the work force.</para>
<para>Australia is currently experiencing a shortage of workers. This will continue to worsen as our population ages and fewer workers enter the work force. Because of this, the government is acting to ensure that Australians can continue to experience a standard of living that many of us have come to expect. I am looking forward to the many opportunities that will result from these reforms. In 20 years time, the same number of taxpayers as now will be required to support double the number of people over retirement age; therefore, it is important that all Australians who can work are working, thereby reducing the burden on those in the work force.</para>
<para>Australiaâs total welfare budget for 2005-06 is $60 billion. More than $10 billion of that is being spent on the disability support pension alone. Our participation rate for working age people is 73.6 per cent, well behind other OECD countries like Canada, Denmark, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. There are many people on genuine and legitimate disability support pensions, and for them absolutely nothing will change. I also have people coming into my office who desperately want to re-enter the work force after a slight injury at workâa bad back; a soft tissue injury; reconstructed shoulders, knees, hips or whateverâbut they do not have the opportunity to do so. As soon as they indicate on their job application forms why they have not been working, the employer becomes concerned that, if they employ this person, they may be subject to costs down the track. That is not supposed to happen, but it certainly does happen, and ultimately after a long period out of the work force, after being knocked back, demoralised and disillusioned about looking for a job, they get put onto a disability support pension.</para>

<para>âHere we have the entry of the interjector, who will always interject on somebody but does not expect to be interjected upon. Many of the people being relegated onto the disability support pension do not want to be there, but they are given no other choice. They have been through a regime of employment prospects and it simply is not working for them. Now the whole package, the whole suite, of benefits is out there to encourage employers to employ people who have been on disability benefits and to act more positively towards the long-term unemployed.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>This is not just about introducing one suite of reforms without another suite of measures to support, back up and assist the reforms to become a reality and to provide the support and assistance that many of these people need. They do not want to be relegated to the too-hard basket and looked at and condemned as though they are dole bludgers or pension recipients. They have at times found themselves in a place where they have no other choice. This legislation is about encouraging all employers and the whole work force to start looking at employment prospects in a totally different light.</para>
<para>I see that one of those benefitsâthe No. 1 benefit, hopefullyâwill be to the children of working parents. Hopefully, these children will have access to more family day care mothers, fathers and families who can offer places, rather than those children being put in long day care centres without a family environmentâalthough long day care centres are very good places.</para>
<para>To be a family day care mother is rewarding. They are a success in themselves. They can financially achieve, but the rewarding part about it is that they can contribute to a childâs life. It is an open opportunity. I have so many family day care places that I would like to have people coming in, doing training and deciding that that is the employment that they would like to be involved in, because it is an excellent source of income and an excellent source of reward not only for the child but for the day care mum or dad.</para>
<para>I was in Griffith a few weeks ago at a presentation night for family day care mums. Some of these mums have been in the business for 20 or 30 years. They do not ever want to leave it; they love it. They have brought up many children. These children still consider them as integral family members and themselves as being a part of the family day care mumâs family. And, in turn, the family day care mum and dad find themselves part of a childâs life. Nobody should scoff at these positions and nobody should be thinking that there are no positions available out there. These are genuine and fantastic opportunities.</para>
<para>After school care opportunities in my electorate are huge. At the moment I am finding it very difficult to attract the workers to work in out of school hours care. We are getting myriad places. I announced only last week 155 additional outside school hour care places throughout my region. What I really need is to be able to attract mums and dads or workers to be able to fulfil the role of providing out of school hour care.</para>
<para>What a perfect opportunity for somebody who is re-entering the work force. If your youngest child is around six you could say, âI am going to now prepare myself for when they turn eight; I am going to start going into a bit of mutual obligation and look for productive work for limited hours per weekââremember, this is limited hours; 15 hours per week. What better opportunity to say, âIâm going to go and get my St Johnâs first aid certificate. Iâm going to get myself in a position whereby, when my child is at school, I can then fulfil my role and obligation in work but also move towards working more productively, with better benefits to be returned to me and my familyânot only that, but my child can be in after school hours care with me and I will not be missing out on my child after school.â</para>
<para>We have so many opportunities in our country areas. A significant amount of jobs are availableâa significant amount of placements that cannot be filled. I am looking forward to these reforms coming into play so that not only can I get these positions filled for employers but I will also be able to satisfy the requirements of many of the people who would dearly like to be encouraged, supported and provided with the tools and the mechanisms to be able to fulfil their lives.</para>
<para>So we had a suite of changes in a measure of legislation that was announced in the beginning by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Then we saw that maybe there were some small issues that needed to be looked into. To their credit, Minister Dutton, Minister Andrews, the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and others were willing to sit and listen to the concerns that I and many other backbenchers were raising. And to their credit, many changes were made. That is what it is about. It is about being effective and working cooperatively as a backbench towards achieving good policy, policy that has the intention of being very good but which, with some finetuning and some tweaking, can be absolutely excellent policy.</para>
<para>Rather than just being negative, and raising the negative side with every person who comes into our offices with significant concerns about what they may have to do, why not positively encourage these very same people? It is up to us to assist them to take advantage of the opportunities that are coming in with this reform package.</para>
<para>Some of the changes that were made to the original draft policy, I think, were quite significant. These included lifting the age of the youngest child of parents who will continue to receive parenting payment single, from six years to eight years of age; providing a top-up payment for primary carers who are exempted, so that they are not financially disadvantaged; and a list of safeguards for work participation requirements, particularly for rural people. My concern was how this would work in a practical sense rather than in a theoretical sense. As I said, I cannot thank the minister enough for listening and adapting to these concerns.</para>
<para>For part-time work, the guidelines will now state that a general travel time of more than 60 minutes is to be considered unsuitable for commuting between home and work and vice versa. The job seeker will not be required to accept job offers exceeding the 60-minute rule. In some circumstances, a journey of 60 minutes both ways may even be considered excessive travel time and so a shorter time might be considered a reasonable maximum. Such circumstances include hours of work of very limited duration; part-time work spread over five days, where travel must be undertaken five days a week; and when care arrangements can only be organised if a shorter travel time is undertaken. So we have really looked into and addressed those considerable concerns, which are particularly pertinent to rural areas. The existing 90-minute rule will continue to apply for those who have a full-time participation requirement. But, for those who do not, we have certainly looked to rectify that issue. A person will not be expected to take up a job if their travel costs are greater than 10 per cent of the gross wage.</para>
<para>These are things that people are not hearing about. They are only hearing about all the negatives. The fear instilled in these people is absolutely understandable. They are not being told, âNo, that wonât happen to you.â They are being told that the extreme will happen to them. They are being told, âYouâd better brace yourself. Are you going to be socked!â That is not the case. I get tired of listening to this negative banter on all aspects, on both sides of the fence, purely for political bashing purposes. I repeat: a person will not be expected to take up a job if their travel costs are greater than 10 per cent of their gross wage.</para>
<para>For people with disabilities who cannot use public transport or where it is not available, there is the mobility allowance, worth about $100 a fortnight. Parents and people with disabilities will also retain access to the pensioner concession card. Of course, we never hear anything about what you retain. We only hear, âOh, youâre losing all of this.â We do not hear what you retain and what benefits are out there for people. The pensioner concession card, amongst other things, provides for discounted fares on public transport where it is available.</para>

<para>âYouâve been a bit slow. I have actually covered child care and the opportunities in child care. What about the opportunities for child care? A two-year suspension rule will also be applied to DSP recipients who enter the work force.

What things does this include? The person may lack the particular skill, experience or qualification that is needed to perform the work and no training may be provided by the employer. It may be established that there is medical evidence that the person has an illness, disability or injury that would be aggravated by the conditions in which the work would be performed. The person may not have access to appropriate care and supervision for the child or children for whom the person is the principal carer at the times when the person would be required to undertake the work. It may be that performing the work in the conditions in which the work would be performed would constitute a risk to health or safety and would contravene a law of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory relating to OH&amp;S. It may be that commuting between the personâs home and the place of work would be unreasonably difficult. The work may require enlistment in the Defence Force or the reserves. I could go on. The work may require the person to move from a home in one place to a home in another place. Or, for any other reason, the work may be unsuitable for the person. The safety nets and safeguards are very significant, but that is one thing you never hear about. It is just a fear campaign from the start to the finish.</para>
<para>I completely concur with the ministerâs comments that the best form of welfare is a job. However, I understand as well that there was a need to recognise that living in rural and regional Australia could present some difficulties in meeting the objectives of the original package. That is why I am so thankful that there was a mind to listen to the concerns raisedâand not only that, but to move towards resolving those issues.</para>
<para>Meaningful welfare reform is about having the real interests of our constituents at heart. The system and past attitudes have convinced many people that they are of no value and are unemployable. That is what is being drilled down into everybody in the speeches that are being made in this House: again people are being relegated to a devalued area. Because their self-worth and self-esteem is low, they then resign themselves to a lifestyle. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI come to this debate on the <inline ref="R2461">Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2457">Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work) Bill 2005</inline> with actual experience in working as an advocate for people with disability, helping them to get workâto get the jobs that the member for Riverina spoke about. I can tell her that her contribution to the House today showed her total lack of understanding of the issues that people with disabilities face on a day-to-day basis when they seek employment. They do not need this kind of legislation. They need legislation that will actually do something to assist them to get into the work force. I am quite disappointed in the contribution of the member for Riverina.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This legislation, coupled with the governmentâs workplace relations legislation, will change the face of Australia. The governmentâs draconian workplace relations legislation will attack the security of wages and conditions for ordinary Australian workers. This legislation wages war on some of the most disadvantaged people in Australiaâpeople with disability, single parents and mature age workers, all groups of workers who have difficulty in obtaining employment because of the barriers which exist, barriers which prevent them from securing a job.</para>
<para>Why are we debating this legislation? Why has the legislation gone so far? The answer is quite simple. The government has the majority in the Senate. It can ram through the legislation. It can blatantly and arrogantly disregard the needs of people who elected it to this place to look after their interests. I am quite disgusted that the government is going down this path and has introduced legislation that is going to actually impact on the ability of people with disabilityâI mention that in particular because it is an area that I have had a lot of experience inâto re-enter the work force.</para>
<para>I agree wholeheartedly with the government that a person who is able to work should be able to work. I believe that it is the role of government to create real opportunities for people to do just this. I do not believe that the emphasis should be on moving a person from one benefit to another benefit. I believe that reform should be real reform; it should not just be a blatant exercise in cost cutting and saving money, and that is what I believe underlies the whole of this legislation.</para>
<para>The government in its budget and in its rhetoric has identified that there has been a growth in the number of people receiving disability support pension. It sees that as an issue that needs to be addressedâan issue that is contributing to the cost of government. Similarly, the ageing population is identified, by the Treasurer in particular, as a cost to government. Here we are looking at issues that are affecting peoples everyday lives. A person with a disability on disability support means they have a significant impairment that affects their daily lives and their choice of jobs. But the government sees it as a cost. It sees the fact that a person is on the disability pension as something that is abhorrent and is looking to get people off disability support.</para>
<para>Through this legislation the government will be moving people from the disability support pension to Newstart. It is all about increased compliance and increased requirements. But it is not getting to the core of the issue. It is not looking at solving the issues that people with a disability or sole parents face every day. This is a government of ideologues driven by an extreme and ultraconservative philosophy. It is a government that is bereft of any compassion and committed to the cult of the individual. It is a government that promotes in-groups and out-groups in our society. Today it is attacking a couple of groups that have been identified as out-groups.</para>
<para>This legislation is a testimony to this, as it will create an underclass in our society comprising people who are already struggling to survive. The government is not tackling the reasons that people are not in the work force; rather, it is saying: âYou must be in the work force. If youâre not, youâre going to be punished.â All that will do is force people from one benefit to another.</para>
<para>People who receive a disability support pension or a single parent benefit represent some of the poorest households in the country. These families do not have great financial resources. This legislation will cut their budgets and really cause hardship. Around 300,000 Australians will be worse off after these changes. Only 109,000 will gain work, and many of those that do gain work will be worse off. I find that totally unsatisfactory.</para>
<para>I believe a governmentâs role is to create opportunities. If there is a problem that has been identified, the government should look to solving the problem; it should not try to sweep it under the carpetâit should not try to cut costs to create an image it is doing something. In this case it is doing something, but it is not doing what it states: creating opportunities for people with disabilities, single parents and mature age workers to enter the work force.</para>
<para>The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations in his speech referred to mature age workers. He said that the legislation would place the same requirement on them as younger jobseekers and that they would be required to undertake voluntary work and meet the same sorts of activity tests that other workers meet. If the minister thinks this will address the issue of mature age unemployment, I would like to disagree with him. The minister sat on the inquiry with me which produced <inline font-style="italic">Working for Australiaâs future: increasing participation in the work force</inline>, and I do not think that was the message that we received. I have before me a paper that was written by Sol Encel, a very eminent researcher in this area. He says that the principal difficulty experienced by older workers is the attitude of employers who constantly give preference to younger workers. I think you will find that that also applies generally to people with a disability.</para>
<para>I would like to touch on the issues surrounding sole parents and the fact that in future a parent will be put on Newstart or, as the government likes to call it, the dole, once their child reaches the age of six. Instead of helping parents who are in that situation, the government will be punishing the children of those families. It would be wise for members on the other side of this House to look at the impact that this legislation will have on the families as a whole; the impact will not just be on the person who is receiving that payment, be it the mother or the father of those childrenâor the grandparents for that matter. This legislation will ensure that there will effectively be less disposable income for those households. I find that abhorrentâand I know the member for Sydney, who is sitting at the table at the moment, has identified the very real issues that surround child care.</para>
<para>As I indicated at the beginning of my contribution, I have worked with many people who have disabilities. I assisted them to re-enter the work force or to enter the work force for the first time. Contrary to the belief of members on the other side of this House, those people are not shirkers and they are not bludgers: they are people that would really like to enter the work force. Moving them from disability support benefit to Newstart will hardly achieve that. What a person with a disability needs is a comprehensive program. They need a job that will not exacerbate their injury and they need support while they are establishing themselves in that job, and they need employers who are prepared to accept them and to offer them the opportunity to work for them. I have spent many hours on the phone ringing employers, asking them to give an opportunity to a person with a disability to work for themâwhere they do not have to pay a wage and where they are covered for workers compensation. I have been refused time and time again simply because of the attitudes that those employers have to people with disabilitiesâthe stereotyping that takes place.</para>
<para>In the contributions from those on the other side of the House, people have spoken about issues like bad backs. The Treasurer even mentioned bad backs in his budget speech in May this year. I have news for people on the other side of the House: bad backs and back injuries are very debilitating. Bad backs prevent people from going to work. If a person who has a back injury finds employment and that employment is unsuitable, they exacerbate their injury. So not only does this legislation have the ability to force people back into the work force and into unsuitable jobs but it also could create further injury for those people. It is very important that any person with a physical disability has a proper work assessment, a proper physical capacity assessment, before they enter the work force. This government is very big on promoting myths that the only reason that people are not re-entering the work force is that they are being encouraged to be welfare dependent. I believe this legislation will encourage that dependency, because people will not be prepared to take the risk.</para>
<para>I refer to the budget submission made by the MS Society. âAndrewâ has had MS for 12 years. He lives alone because his disability is such that he has some cognitive impairments which make it impossible for him to live with other people. He works 20 hours a week and he gets $600 a fortnight. So he is a guy who is in there having a go. You might ask what this legislation will mean to him. Currently his disposable income is $970. He pays $480 rent. His medication and modified diet costs $130 a week. His food and household expenses are $220 a week. His car and fare expenses are $155 a week. His total expenditure is $985 a week. Thus he has a shortfall of $15 a week. He relies on his family to meet that shortfall. If Andrew were on Newstart instead of DSP, his fortnightly disposable income would drop to $736 or only $368 a week. That would leave him $249 per fortnight worse off. If this legislation has been designed to assist people with disabilities, that is not the case when you look at an example like Andrew.</para>
<para>In the UK they have introduced a new deal for people with disabilities, but that is a voluntary program that is aimed to help people with health conditions and disabilities to obtain and sustain employment. That is a very different type of program from the program that we are looking at here. I think the government could learn a lot by looking at that. I do not have the time in this speech to detail that program; needless to say, this governmentâs approach is not the approach that has been undertaken over there. Rather, this is an approach that moves more towards one of blame.</para>
<para>We need to look at the governmentâs performance in the area of disability. No area demonstrates more graphically than the Public Service the governmentâs failure in the employment of people with disabilities. When I was working with people with disabilities, the federal government had a very strong policy of creating employment opportunities for people with disabilities. They were very proactive in that area. Under this government, unfortunately, the number of people with disabilities in the Public Service has declined dramatically. A number of the people with disabilities that I assisted into work in the Public Service have subsequently been sacked or given a redundancy.</para>
<para>One young womanâand I find this quite heartbreakingâwas a deaf girl who worked for the department of social security. Once this government started to introduce efficiency measures, she was one of the first to go. She was no longer employed. She also developed diabetes. Within a month of her being made redundant, she was dead. I feel that she was a victim of this governmentâs cost cutting and discrimination against people with disabilities.</para>
<para>The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation inquiry into increasing participation in the work force received a number of submissions from people with disabilities, and that area of employment in the Public Service was highlighted. The minister was a party to that inquiry, and I do not know how he can bring down legislation like this. It shows that he had blinkers on and that he was not listening.</para>

<para>âIf you listen to statements made by people with disabilities, you would knowâas would the member oppositeâthat people with disabilities need support, security and assistance. They do not need to be transferred from one welfare payment to another, and that is what this legislation is about. It is about transference from one benefit to another, not about creating real and new opportunities for people with disabilities.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>People with disabilities, single parents and mature age workers are the most disadvantaged people in our community. This legislation is set to extend that disadvantage and increase their level of disadvantage. They have less bargaining power than other workers, and the new workplace relations legislation will make them prime targets for exploitation. They have limited ability to negotiate AWAs, and, as for unfair dismissals, we all know who will go first. As a person who has worked with people with disabilities and fought for them to be given the opportunity to get a job, I know how difficult it is for them to find a suitable jobâone that they are able to perform, that is within their physical capabilities and where they have a supportive employer. I believe this legislation will act as a disincentive for people with disabilities to take the risk to enter or to re-enter the work force. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI need to start my contribution by correcting a misrepresentation by the member for Shortland. As the member knows, the Minister for Workforce Participation, while his name appears as a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation, was a member of the committee for only a very short time prior to being promoted to his portfolio. In fact, he was not part of much of the committeeâs deliberations, considerations or recommendations or much of the evidence that was submitted. That needs to be clarified as something that was thrown in there by the member for Shortlandâ</para>

<para>âThere has been enough waffling. I will go back to the substance of the legislation. The debate on the <inline ref="R2461">Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline> is significant, and it comes at a time that is right for Australia. If you were going to make changes that would help to encourage people into the work force, when would you do it? You would do it at a time when there is a drop off in the participation rate and a need for jobs to be filled in the workplace. It is important for structural changes to take place right now to help ease people away from the growing trap of welfare dependency. This is especially so at this very time when there is a crying need for an increase in the labour force, a need which is not going to go away but in fact will increase as the years march on.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The notion of welfare as an inalienable right, which members on the other side would have you believe, is an unfortunate legacy of the years of their great mentor Gough Whitlam. In a strong, productive and prosperous society, welfare is only a solution when the means towards employment are simply not available. The means to employment and the incentive by business to employ is there today. When you do not have the confluence of those factors taking place then you can understand why welfare would be seen as the one and only solution. At present, Australiaâs work force participation stands at 63.8 per cent. It is a very low participation rate and one which can certainly be increased.</para>
<para>Our current net growth in the Australian work forceâand this is an important statisticâis 170,000 people each year. Access Economics has estimated that over the decade 2020 to 2030âand that is only 15 years awayâit is expected that the work force will grow by only 125,000 people over the period compared with 170,000 per annum right now. There is going to be a major shortage in the years to come as I enter that phase which perhaps you, Mr Deputy Speaker, might be entering a little earlier than meâbut not by muchâof exiting the work force. A mere 12,500 people a year will enter the work force for that entire decade. There is a gap there of 157,500 people. Do we take action in 15 years time, do we take action in 10 years time or do we take action in 20 years time? We must take action now, while we have a strong economy where the need for jobs is growing and a shortage is taking place.</para>
<para>This is one of the lowest participation rates in the Western world and a real, long-term concern for our economy. The member for Shortland highlighted the report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Working for Australiaâs future: increasing participation in the workforce</inline>. I am very proud of that report as I chaired that inquiry. I took over from the previous chairman, and the committee completed that inquiry earlier this year. Certainly we heard a lot of evidence, but it was not one-dimensional, as the member for Shortland might have represented.</para>
<para>One of the pieces of evidence from one of the submissions is that by 2030âthe end of that decade periodâAustralia will have 500,000 jobs with no-one to fill them. If you were dependent on welfare in 2030, you would be asking yourself, âWho is in the work force to pay taxes in order to pay for the welfare that will be much needed by those who cannot look after themselves?â We need to take action, and we need to take it now. We cannot wait. We cannot have another talkfest. I notice that the Leader of the Opposition is saying that we should have a poverty summit. The problem with the opposition is that, whenever there is a difficult issue, they always want a summit, a conference or some other sort of talkfestâor they want to refer it to a committee. We would have an endless period of inquiry with no time frames, and all that will happen is a lot of talk and very little action. The Australian people vote for their representatives to take leadership, not simply to enter into endless meaningless talkfests that do not seem to achieve anything.</para>
<para>It is a bit amusing to see the Leader of the Opposition call for a poverty summit. Halting the decline in our work force participation rate and breaking the cycle of welfare dependency requires vision, which is something this government possesses with genuine zeal. Australia still has more than half a million people looking for a job, with many more in work who believe they are underemployed. There are also over 600,000 children living in jobless households. Unless we take bold steps now, the Australian labour market faces a real crisis in the next 15 to 20 years.</para>
<para>In his <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational report</inline>, the Treasurer, Peter Costello, referred in part to some of these problems as the three Psâthe participation, population and productivity problems we are going to face in this country. Through the Work Choices bill, which has been debated in this House and is currently in the Senate, the government is working to address some of the potential future shortfalls that will be characterised under the third P, productivity. The Work Choices bill provides the ability to enter into flexible working arrangements that suit individual circumstances. Additionally, rigid work practices can often be a huge disincentive to those on some form of welfare payment who are trying to re-enter the work force. This bill tackles another aspect of it. It provides the incentives and highlights the disincentives of not being part of the work force. As has been acknowledged by members on the other sideâand it is one of the things I agree withâthe best assistance anyone can offer to someone who is on welfare, the best way to get out of welfare, is a job. There is nothing better than having a job to get out of that situation.</para>
<para>One of the three Ps that was mentioned is population, and the government has looked into this through increasing migration, particularly in areas of immediate need because of skills shortages. This is not a long-term solution. We have skilled people. We have people with ability in the Australia marketplace today who have, for one reason or another, not been part of the work force participation group. Somehow we need to encourage this group to come back into the work force. The time is right to make these important changes, and this bill does that by helping to ensure that our welfare system remains on a sustainable footing. At the moment, the growth of those on some form of welfare is not at all sustainable, and members on the other side must acknowledge that an unsustainable growth is taking place. We also haveâand I recognise thisâan obligation as a government to provide support to those in genuine need. The task is not only to create a balanced environment where people can participate in the work force but also to dispel the myth that people cannot afford to move off welfare and back into the work force.</para>
<para>In debating this bill, a number of areas have been highlighted, such as single parents and those on the disability support pension, DSP. It is important to highlight that a healthy working life can be very good for a parent. Employment brings with it a sense of independence, and it has a positive effect on the long-term wellbeing of parents and families. The positive effect of a steady job and a life outside the home cannot be underestimated. Earlier this year I told the House about a study that demonstrated this, and I would like to share it with the House again today. It was a study by the Australian Institute of Family Studies called <inline font-style="italic">Growing up in Australia</inline>. The study found that 70 per cent of parents feel that working makes them more competent parents. At the time of the study, the director of the study, Ann Stanson of Melbourne University, told the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... a lot parents feel that outside involvement helps them to be positive and responsive to their children when they are there ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This study focused on the families of 1,000 infants under the age of 12 months and children under four and five years old. The results are very significant, because they go a long way to dispelling misguided assertions about what mothers will feel in returning to work. In many cases, young single parents want to work. While the workplace environment can provide a boost to confidence and self-esteem, the last thing a young parent wants to face is a financial burden when they enter part-time work.</para>
<para>The changes to the parenting payment are fair. From 1 July 2006, parents who apply for parenting payment single will no longer be eligible for it once their youngest child turns eight. This stands as a very generous measure when you compare it with those of nations around the world with an economic status similar to ours, be they in Europe or across the Tasman. At the moment, we have an eligibility age of, I think, 16 rather than four or five, which is common in other countries. We are increasing that to eight for those who are currently on parenting payment. From the same date, parents who apply for parenting payment single will have a part-time work requirement of 15 hours per week, once their youngest child turns six.</para>
<para>When listening to members on the other side, you would be hard pressed not to believe that we are forcing parents to go back to work full time. The requirement is 15 hours per weekâthat is, a 15-hour contribution to a workplace in dire need of the skills, possessed by a lot of these people, which are needed by this country. That 15 hours of contribution will be not only of financial benefit to parents but also of benefit to their self-esteemâa sense of self-worth that takes place by being part of the work force, by enjoying the camaraderie of the workplace, by achieving, by doing things in an environment where there is real progress and by helping out in a business environment or wherever else they work.</para>
<para>This legislation is generous and helps both the individual and the nation as a whole. Members opposite carp on about how parents in part-time work will be financially worse off than when they were dependent on the parenting payment. Once again, this assertion is misguided. As the minister recently highlighted, a sole parent in receipt of the single parenting payment now has a weekly income of $433.13. Under the proposals in this bill, when the youngest child turns eight the sole parent will be encouraged to find a minimum of 15 hours work per week. If they are working on a minimum rate of $12.75 per hour, combined with the income support and family tax benefits they retain, the parent will have a weekly income of $487.81. So under this scheme a sole parent will be $50 per week better off. In addition, access to the pensioner concession card, the telephone allowance and pharmaceutical benefits allowance will remain. Those benefits will not be taken away. If they work 15 hours per week on a minimum rateâand most of them will probably go back to work on a rate higher than the minimum rateâthey will receive a combination of the new payment through Centrelink and their working payment as well as all their concession cards and allowances. They will be much better off. The reforms in this bill are sensible and fair.</para>
<para>While it is important that parents are encouraged into the work force, as part of these changes people with disabilitiesâthe other cohort that is often talked aboutâwill also be able to fulfil their potential in the workplace. Like the member for Shortland, I have a special concern for those who are receiving DSP, and recognise their special circumstances. Australia has one of the highest percentages of people on DSP in the world. Is there something about the Australian sun or our way of life that makes us far more prone to be on DSP than people in other nations? Why do we have more people on DSP than any other OECD nation?</para>
<para>Why do those people on DSP in Australia have the lowest work force participation rate in the world? Is there something about our employers and what they are doing, or the incentives or disincentives out there, which is stopping people from entering the work force? The answer to the second question is partly yes. We need to break down the barriers that may be erected by employers to putting on people who may have a disability but who do have the capacity to work at least 15 hours. As much as possible, we need to break those barriers down and help employers realise that there is a real benefit to their business in employing people who have some form of disability.</para>
<para>We do not need to go very far to see the evidence out there of the benefits of putting on someone who has a disability. Earlier this year Minister Dutton came to my electorate and visited the MS Society, which is located in Blackburn in the electorate of Deakin. The MS Society is taking a proactive role in disability employment. This year it began its Saving Jobs project, which focuses on building awareness between employers and employees. The project breaks new ground between MS employees and their employers. Minister Dutton, when he visited the society, met with local employers and job agencies. He also met with an academic from Deakin University, Dr David Edwards.</para>
<para>Dr Edwards is a researcher who has concluded from a recent study across a number of organisations that, on balance, employers consider that they get an economic return on their employees with a disability. Moreover, they consider that the employee with a disability enhances the social value of their business. This complements some of the research coming from the United States, which indicates, on every human resource indicatorâwhether it be absenteeism, staff turnover or staff moraleâthat those who have a disability and are employed in the work force are some of the best workers that an employer can possibly have. That kind of commonsense approach needs to be encouraged in the work force, not one of engaging people with a disability for altruistic motivesâalthough that should not be scoffed at. If need be, it does make economic sense to put on people who have some form of disability. We are asking for 15 hours per week where it is possible.</para>
<para>This is positive legislation. It has an eye on tomorrow for the nation, when we are going to have a shortfall in the numbers participating in the work force. The legislation also has an eye on providing real benefits and encouragement to those who are not participating in the work force to enter it and get themselves off the dependency cycle and into a situation where they can be masters of their own destiny and in control of their financial circumstances. This legislation deserves the support of the House.</para>

<para>âThe governmentâs attempt at welfare reform, as represented in the <inline ref="R2461">Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline>, should be opposed because it does nothing to support parents or people with a disability to gain appropriate skills to enter the work force. It does nothing to help sole parents or people with a disability make a successful transition from welfare to work. It punishes these most vulnerable Australians, effectively dumping them onto a lower Centrelink payment with more compliance. It fails the governmentâs own test at welfare reform in not addressing the growth in the number of people on welfare payments.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The measures in this bill, alongside the governmentâs extreme industrial relations agenda, are set to create a new class of working poor, forced to accept any job, regardless of the pay and conditions, regardless of whether they will be worse off financially. I want real welfare reform in this country. God knows, we only have to look at the current system to see why it is needed. We need real welfare reform that tackles the reasons someone is not working and delivers practical solutions to them. We need real welfare reform that treats people with dignity and respect and helps them find work. We need real welfare reformânot this Claytons welfare reform, which is all about reducing the cost of welfare and not about helping people into work.</para>

<para>âAs I made clear yesterday, what I said to Mr Gerardâand I will repeat itâis that, in order for his appointment to go forward to the cabinet, he would have to give an assurance about his tax affairs in a standard form, which he said he was able to do and which in fact he did. In addition to that, he forwarded to the government a letter from the Commissioner of Taxation, which I tabled yesterday, which said that the Tasxation Office had no current disputes with Mr Gerard. I indicated to them that, given the fact that he had given an undertakingâand, indeed, the commissioner had given an undertakingâit could go to the cabinet. It went to the cabinet; it was approved by the cabinet. Mr Gerard has been on the board for 2Â½ years. In those 2Â½ years, he has discharged his duty as a director of the board very well. Can I say that I thoroughly endorse what the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday when he said that he was not putting any questions as to his fitness for office.</para>

</talker>
<para>âI thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question and recognise the enormous contribution that the electorate that she represents makes to Australiaâs export effort. The member for Riverina would be aware that, in 2004-05, there was a record level of exports out of Australia of $162.3 billion. Some of the products that are produced in the electorate of Riverina made a significant contribution to that figure. Beef exports rose by 24 per cent to $4.8 billion. Lamb exportsâand we all remember the dispute we had over lamb exports and tariffs a few years agoâgrew by nearly nine per cent last year and now stand at $1.19 billion, which is an enormous amount of growth in recent years, and of course coming from the memberâs electorate. Dairy exports rose by 9.4 per cent to top $2.36 billion.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>All this has taken place in a global economic environment that from time to time has been challenging, with an exchange rate that has been higher than it has been in some recent years and in the face of one of the worst droughts that Australia has had in recent years. It is very important that we recognise the great effort and great job that Australiaâs farmers and exporters do in making a contribution to that export figure.</para>
<para>This means increased income for regional Australia and jobs in regional Australia. The member for Riverina knows only too well the importance of flexibility in the labour market, particularly with some of the agricultural and horticultural industries in her electorate of Riverina. The member for Riverina, along with the National Farmers Federation, would recognise the importance of the governmentâs workplace relations reform package that we have before the parliament. The NFF have said that the governmentâs workplace relations reforms are critical for continued economic growth in Australia. The NFF have also said that the flow-on effects from the introduction of the Work Choices package will be a crucial component for our industry to continue to remain competitive.</para>
<para>Interestingly, at the Senate inquiry into the Work Choices bill, the NFF stated that Work Choices is the right choice for Australia. The NFFâs views are supported by their state based affiliates, including Agforce in Queensland. Agforce believe that the Work Choices reforms will provide an opportunity for wages and conditions to reward individual effort and initiativeâthat is, to benefit employees, not employers. Agforce went on to say, âIf excessive industrial relations regulations are removed, the flexibility and competitiveness of farming businesses will be increased.â That is something they want to see happen, and they want to see this legislation pass through the parliament.</para>
<para>I will leave the last word on this to Peter Corish, the President of the National Farmers Federation. He said, âIt is imperative that the bill is passed before Christmas so that we can get on with the job of educating farmers about the changes and implementing the reforms we have sought for decades.â This government is delivering those opportunities. As I said yesterday, the coalition will continue to work with, and listen to, the job creators in this nation. We know that the Labor Party is tied hand and foot to the job destroyers in this country.</para>

<para>âWithout asking all the members of my office, which I am quite happy to do, I cannot vouch for them. But, as I have already told the honourable member, the obligation to give an undertaking as to tax affairs is always that of the appointee. In this case, as in every other case, the appointee was told that he would have to give an undertaking as to his tax affairs. Not only did he do that but he produced a letter from the commissioner as to his tax affairs.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As I said yesterday, I do not believe that there are any matters in dispute between Mr Gerard and the Commissioner of Taxation. Indeed, I believe that all outstanding matters are settled. I do not believe that it is wrong for a person to contest a tax audit. There would be thousands, probably hundreds of thousands, of Australians who do that. Every Australian has the right, if they do not believe they are being assessed for the proper amount of tax, to contest that in court. The fact that they do that is not wrong; it is not illegal. It is a right that every Australian has. If an Australian goes to a court or contests a tax audit, that is not a blemish on their character. They have every right to do so, whether it be Mr Gerard, members of parliament or other companies.</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for his question. I can inform him today that Standard and Poorâs have just issued a press release which has reaffirmed Australiaâs top credit ratingâa AAA credit rating. Standard and Poorâs say that Australiaâs AAA rating has been affirmed on solid finances and a robust economy:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">Public sector finances remain extremely strong in Australia, and the Commonwealth has very low levels of debt and strong commitment to ongoing fiscal discipline.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It was not always the case that the Commonwealth had extremely strong finances. We can remember back to 1996. The then Minister for Finance, now the Leader of the Opposition, had the federal budget in deficit by $10 billion. The then finance minister, now the Leader of the Opposition, had racked up Commonwealth debt of $96 billion. Let me also make the point that, back in 1996, Australia did not have a AAA credit rating. In 1996 Australia had been downgraded twice because of the policies of the Australian Labor Party. We were downgraded for the first time in 1986 and for a second time in 1989. It was only after the election of the coalition government that we were upgraded in 1999, and our final upgrade to a AAA rating was in 2003. So it was Labor that ran Australiaâs credit rating down and it was the coalition that ran it up again.</para>
<para>The consequence of that, of course, is lower interest rates, because if Australia were not AAA rated there would be a premium not only on government borrowing but on private companies through the interest rates they pay. I think all Australians would probably welcome the fact that Australia has a AAA credit rating. I have only known of one member of parliament who has complained about the upgrading of Australiaâs credit rating, and it was the member for Lilley, who complained on 17 February 2003 about Standard and Poorâs upgrading Australia to a AAA rating.</para>

<para>âThat is absolutely false and I repudiate it in its entirety. The reason the commissioner wrote a letter saying that he had no dispute with Mr Gerard is that he had no dispute with Mr Gerard. That is the reason he wrote the letter. The Commissioner of Taxation made it clear that he had no dispute with Mr Gerard. To my knowledge, he still has no dispute with Mr Gerard. To my knowledge, Mr Gerard did what any taxpayer is entitled to do. You are entitled in Australia to contest a tax audit and, what is more, it was settled to the complete satisfaction of the parties.</para>

</talker>
<para>âI thank the member for Kooyong for his question and, in response, say to him that the system of enterprise bargaining in Australia has led to more jobs, higher wages and greater productivity in this country. This is a system which is underpinned by the corporations power in the Constitution. Indeed, in the Work Choices package before the parliament the corporations power will be used to further that system, rather than have the old system that we had in the past based on a system of industrial disputes.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The corporations power was first used not by the coalition but by the Labor Party under the leadership of the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating. Indeed, in is second reading speech in 1993 the then Minister for Industrial Relations, Laurie Brereton, said this:</para>
<quote>
<para>The operation of enterprise flexibility agreements will be supported by the use of the corporations power. This removes the requirement for an interstate dispute and makes the arrangements more accessible</para>
</quote>
<para>This was not a new idea for the Labor Party. Indeed, as far back as October 1972, in an address to the Metal Trades Industry Association, the then Prime Ministerâthe then Labor Prime Minister, Gough Whitlamâhad also advocated the use of the corporations power for industrial relations in Australia. In the past, Mr Whitlam, Mr Keating and Mr Brereton were all in favour of the use of the corporations power because this enabled the creation of a system based on cooperation rather than a system based on the old Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which at its core had this bizarre proposition that, to resolve an industrial arrangement, you first had to create an interstate dispute in order to have an arbitration commissioner move in and then resolve that dispute. So the corporations power was strongly advocated by the Labor Party and its leadership in the past. What is the position of the Labor Party today? This was revealed on the <inline font-style="italic">Insiders</inline> program last Sunday when the Leader of the Opposition was interviewed.This is what he said when he was asked about this matter:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The theory under which itâs imposed, that is, using the corporations power to do industrial relations legislation, thatâs all wrong.</para>
<para class="block">Â I mean, basically, industrial relations legislation should be done under the conciliation and arbitration power as the founders of this nation determined it should be. So, all of it is wrong. The whole theory of it is wrong. Thatâs why youâve got to junk the lot.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So we had the Leader of the Opposition say use of the corporations power is all wrong. He went on to say:</para>

<para>âSo what we have here, whether he intended it or not, is a clear indication that the Leader of the Opposition wants to rip up the use of the corporations power, which was advocated by Gough Whitlam and Paul Keating and put in place by Laurie Brereton as industrial relations minister. What that means is this: the consequence of that is not just undoing the reforms that this government has put in place; it is undoing the reforms which the Leader of the Opposition voted for when he was a member of the Keating cabinet. That is what he is doing: he is saying I am going to rip up the reforms which I was partly responsible for in 1993 to bring about a more collective approach in Australia. He wants a system which is based on awards and conflict rather than a system based on cooperation. The consequence of this is not just a rip-up of legislation; it is a rip-off of ordinary Australian workers, because under both collective and individual agreements they earn more. That is what we will be telling the Australian people day in and day out.</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for Cook for his question and for his interest in economic policy. The OECD overnight released a very positive economic assessment of Australiaâs economic outlook. The OECD expects Australiaâs GDP to grow 2.6 per cent in 2005 and its growth to accelerate to 3.2 per cent in 2006 and 3.6 per cent in 2007. It expects business investment to be underpinned by high company profitability and healthy corporate balance sheets. The ongoing investment boom is expected to make it possible to take advantage of buoyant export markets. In line with that, the OECD expects that the current account deficit will narrow during 2007, forecasting 5.2 per cent. The OECD expects inflation to be affected by higher energy pricesâwhich is also the position of the governmentâand predicts that underlying inflation will peak at around three per cent in 2006 before easing. So this is a very positive assessment of the Australian economy and, in particular, of the strong Commonwealth government finances underpinned by surplus budgets and low Commonwealth debt.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>One of the recommendations the OECD makes about how Australia could improve its economy is that there should be ârapid implementation of the planned industrial relations reformâ. The OECD is a group of developed economies in the world. There is regular peer assessment. The United States, France, Germany and Japan are all members of it. What does the OECD call for in Australia? Rapid implementation of the planned industrial relations reform. So that is what the developed world believes would help Australia. That is what the developed world has called for in Australia. We have the OECD calling for it and we have the IMF calling for it. Practically every economic commentator says industrial relations reform improves flexibility. And who have we got opposing reform in Australia? None other than the Leader of the Opposition, âMr Anti-reformâ himself, who has stood opposed to every reform that has got Australia to where it is and stands against every reform as to where it wants to go in the future.</para>

<para>âIt was achieved in late 2003, I believe. I cannot give you the precise date. I do not believe that Mr Gerard would be the only director of a company which would have outstanding matters with the tax office. Without going into the detail, I would be very surprised if there were not other bank directors who have also been associated with public companies or other companies that have contested audits, as they are entitled to do. I repeat, as I have said to the House on many occasions, that every Australian has the right to contest a tax assessment. Every Australian has the right to go to court in respect of a tax assessment. It is no crime to contest a tax assessment. Particularly when the matter is settled without any findings of factâ</para>

<para>âor settled without any findings against the person, there is no adverse implication on that person at all. The fact that a person has settled their affairs with the Australian Taxation Office indicates that the two have come to an agreement. As I said earlier, Mr Gerard has been a valued member of the Reserve Bank board for 2Â½ years and no-one has suggested that he has not discharged his duties properly.</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for her question. I appreciate the interest she has in this issue. Planning by the Iraqis is going ahead now for general elections to be held on 15 December to elect a new national assembly and indeed to elect a new government in Iraq under the constitution that was approved in October. Our expectationâwe obviously do not know for sureâis that the turn-out for that election will be at least as great as the turn-out for the referendum, which was 10 million people. The government has contributed $12 million to the United Nations to support both this election and the referendum in addition to the $5 million we provided to support the first election on 30 January. Australians are also assisting the process, including through the International Mission for the Iraqi Elections.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The deputy head of the Australian Electoral Commissionâwho will no doubt be known to some membersâPaul Dacey, is the deputy chairman of the International Mission for the Iraqi Elections. We have supported out-of-country voting in Australia for the 30 January elections, and we will do so again for the elections in December. I am sure the Speaker of the Knesset would agree with that analysis, and how welcome he is here todayâhe is a very good man. Let me make this point: the advent of democracy in Iraq for the first time is an extraordinary and great thing. On this side of the House we are very proud of the role that we, members of the Australian Defence Force and many officials have played in helping to make that possible.</para>

The House may be interested to know that the opposition has now had 31 different policies on Iraq. The latest one is apparently back to where Mark Latham wasâthat is, all the troops out.

<para>âAs a Queenslander the honourable member for Hinkler will be pleased to learn that, at long last, the Queensland government has signed the AusLink agreement. It has taken a long time but, finally, Queensland has signed up to an agreement that will deliver $2,688 million to Queensland, until 2008-09. This includes $1.864 million under the AusLink investment program and over $1.5 billion for construction. This funding from the Commonwealth government represents an 81 per cent increase in construction funding for roads in Queensland over the five-year period of the agreement. The funding represents a significant advance and a real opportunity to address some of the really important projects in Queensland. The Prime Minister has already announced $550 million in funding under AusLink for the Ipswich Motorway. The member for Groom, the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, announced $10 million in funding for the next stage of development in the project in the Toowoomba Range. There is significant funding for the upgrade of the Bruce Highway and for a range of other important projects in the state.</para>

<para>âYes. He indicated in his election platform that this would be a project he would be pressing for, and now he has delivered. AusLink has enabled these sorts of projects to be delivered. In all, there is $12.7 billion nationally for getting on with the job of upgrading the roads and upgrading the rail systems. Last week the Leader of the Opposition presented what he called the âblueprint speechâ at AusRAIL â05, with regard to the Labor Partyâs proposals for road and rail upgrading. There were three essential elements. Firstly, he is going to have a national infrastructure audit. AusLink has already done that. We had a public process which identified deficiencies and what we needed to fix them. Secondly, he is going to establish a national infrastructure priority list. AusLink has done that too. We have five years of projects already identified on a 20-year planning scale. Thirdly, he is going to set up a Commonwealth statutory authority to oversight all of this. So instead of action and road building we are going to get another bureaucracy to redo all that AusLink is already doing. We are getting on with the job. Labor will only ever talk and never deliver.</para>

<para>âI would be surprised if that were case because I would be very surprised if the Australian banks are not being subject to audits. I think you ought to recognise the fact that the Australian Taxation Office conducts audits on all major companies in Australia. For most of them I would believe that the Australian banks would have been under tax audit for quite some time. In addition to that, the Australian Taxation Office does audits on all so-called high-wealth individuals, so I think there would hardly be a high-wealth individual in Australia who has not been subject to a tax audit. Most of these tax audits go on for very long periods of time. Without going into the matter, I would be very surprised indeed if the Australian banks had not been subject to tax audits.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Solomon for his question. Like the rest of the government, he understands that you cannot have a strong Medicare system in this country without a strong complementary private health sector too. Support for the private health system has been one of the signature policies of the Howard government, particularly the private health insurance rebate. It is a rebate worth $1,000 a year to the average Australian family with private coverâa rebate which means that nearly nine million Australians now have access to the choice and security that private cover brings, including nearly one million people with incomes of less than $20,000 a year. In the September quarter, nearly 60,000 people took out private insurance, and from tomorrow the government is taking further steps to guarantee that portability of private cover is a reality.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Bonner for his interest in the young people of his electorate and the young people of Australia and their financial future. At the last federal election the Howard government announced that we would be establishing the Financial Literacy Foundationâwhich we subsequently have done and funded to the tune of $5 million a yearâto raise awareness amongst the Australian population, young and old, of the significance that financial literacy can make in their lives by providing them with the information and advice they need to be able to make appropriate decisions. I want to commend the Commonwealth Bank on some groundbreaking research that it did which pointed to just how beneficial this work can be. A key finding of the CBA stated:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">An improvement in financial literacy has the potential to boost Australiaâs economy by $6,000 million a year with the creation of more than 16,000 new jobs.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">You can appreciate that these are significant things for the average Australian. The CBA also identified the particular target groups which have the lowest level of financial literacy in Australia. Unfortunately, one of the highest groups represented were young males, aged 16 to 20. The Australian Financial Literacy Foundation and the Master Builders Association here in the ACT have teamed up together to provide the first opportunity for young apprentices in the building fieldâpredominantly young menâto gain, as of March next year, direct financial literacy advice and assistance so they will understand budgeting and how to conduct their own finances. It is quite likely that many of these young men, and some young women, will find themselves in business in four or five years time, adding to the wealth of this nation.</para>
<para>It is a well-known fact that apprenticeships were at a 30-year low when the Howard government was elected in 1996, due to the neglect of apprenticeships by those who sit oppositeâthe Labor Party. It is also a fact that these same apprentices today are more likely to be in full-time employment throughout their life than even those with a tertiary education. It is absolutely essential that they gain the financial literacy skills that they need, so they can make the right decisions in their personal lives and in their business lives. This is what the Financial Literacy Foundation was established to do. It is the start of what is going to be fantastic work, raising the financial literacy standards of all Australians to the benefit of both the individuals and their families and the wider Australian economy.</para>

Wasnât the Treasurer thoroughly aware that Mr Gerard had, on behalf of his company of which he was the major shareholder, negotiated in the Cayman Islands an insurance scam that had been fought by the tax office for 14 years? Isnât it a fact that Mr Gerard should not have been appointed to the Reserve Bank board because of that tax scandal? Isnât the Treasurer inventing spurious distinctions in full cover-up mode to try to escape responsibility for having made this grossly inappropriate appointment of a Liberal Party mate?</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for Hughes for her question. She knows when there is good news pending and there is good news. We want Australians to have the opportunity to get a job. That is what the coalition believes in. The <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational report</inline>, released by the Treasurer, properly forecasts that Australia is running out of workers. In fact, over the next 15 years, work force participation is expected to drop by close to four per cent. The coalition recognised that this issue had to be addressed. So we have two approaches. The first one is structural reform, workplace relations reform, which the coalition is absolutely committed to.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The second reform is Welfare to Work. It is about providing up to 2.6 million Australians of working age, who may not be working, with the opportunity to get a job. When I first became Minister for Human Services, we approached the Centrelink call centres and asked them for the first time to start ringing people on benefits and ask them, on a voluntary basis, if they were prepared to workâto make a commitment to serve the country by getting a job for a few hours. This was on a voluntary basis. We rang nearly 300,000 people over the last 12 months. One hundred thousand indicated that they were prepared to work, to be referred to the Job Network, and 45,000 have gone into jobs. Forty-five thousand people work on a voluntary basis because we rang them up and asked them if they were prepared to work. It is an even better chartâand we all have to have charts. It is an even better chart, a good chart, a bit like the Qantas symbolâindicating the number of new jobs on a voluntary basis of people who are prepared to work.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for La Trobe for his question and acknowledge his deep interest in aged care issues in his electorate. Over the past decade, an increasing number of older Australians have sought the delivery of aged care services at home. The Australian government have responded. We have led a quiet revolution in the way aged care services are delivered in this country. We are providing far more choice. We are moving away from the one size fits all mentality that was the hallmark of Labor aged care policy back in the good old daysâwhen Labor had an aged care policy.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We are increasing the types of services that are available and we are increasing the availability of those services, and the sheer volume of change speaks for itself. When we came to office there were only 4,000 community aged care packages; today there are 34,000. That means that 34,000 people can receive hostel level care but at home. The Howard government introduced the Extended Aged Care at Home package. There are now 2,700 of these packages. That means people can receive nursing home level care but at home. And we have now introduced another model of care, dementia specific Extended Aged Care at Home, so people living with dementia can stay at home rather than enter a nursing home. This choice is in addition to the increase in residential aged care places that we have introduced to meet the challenges of the ageing of our population.</para>
<para>Since coming to office, over 95,000 new aged care places have been allocated and subsidised by the Australian government, and we are well on the way to meeting our target of 200,000 operational aged care places by 30 June 2006. As at June this year, there were a record numberâ193,753âof operational aged care places in Australia. This demand for greater choice seems to have passed Labor by. They do not understand the importance of community care. They do not have an aged care policy to meet this issue. They neglected aged care in government; they have abandoned it in opposition. Meanwhile, this government is getting on with the job of providing world-class care with choice to meet the needs of individual Australians.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Calare for that question, and I will respond to him now. When I declared the final question on the <inline ref="R2469">Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline> in favour of the ayes, I heard the member for Calare indicate that he was voting no. The chairâs declaration, the result of a vote on the voices, must be challenged by at least two members. I was not aware of any other dissentient voice at that time, and I heard no call for a division. The member for Calare then indicated he wished his dissent to be recorded, as it will be in the official record of the House. Subsequently the member for Franklin also asked for his dissent to be recorded. I did not hear the member for Franklin vote against the final question, and I did not hear him call for a division when he asked for his dissent to be recorded. The time for a division had passed. It is not possible for the dissent of two members to be recorded formally in the way allowed by standing order 126, but their words are recorded in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Furthermore, my attention has been drawn to a media release issued yesterday in the name of the member for Calare about this matter. The media release casts some serious reflections on the actions and motivations of the chair. Such reflections seriously undermine the orderly conducting of the business of the House. I will require any reflection of this kind, made inside or outside the House, to be withdrawn without qualification. Accordingly, and in the light of my explanation, I require the member for Calare to withdraw his reflections on the House.</para>

<para>âMr Speaker, as a member representing an electorate in Canberra, it has come to my attention recently that community groups are having difficulty in the normal course of access to this building when the parliament is not in session. If I can briefly explain, there was a national organisation here in Canberra last week and they sought my assistance in holding a function in this place as a national organisation, with schoolchildren from almost every jurisdiction in attendance. Because of the security requirements now in this building, it was not possible for that function to be held unless I personally or a member of my staff were in agreement to be in attendance at all times, from the beginning to the very end of that function.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I wonder if you could consider this situation and maybe come up with a way that we could continue the relationship between the parliament and the community without having that sort of requirement put on it. While I am very happy to play that role, it is not always possible for me to do that. I respect the security arrangements, but I am also concerned that, without that personal involvement by me or one of my local colleagues, organisations like the school group I am talking aboutâthrough the Epilepsy Foundationâwould not be able to utilise this building in the way that they have in the past.</para>

<para>âI withdraw. The Treasurer of this country did not come into the House and tell the truth today. He asserted that Mr Gerardâs tax affairs were in order before he was appointed to the Reserve Bank board. That has been his defence right through this debate and it is simply not the case. Mr Gerardâs personal affairs may have been order, but his business tax affairs were not settled until September. Mr Gerard was appointed to the board of the Reserve Bank in March 2003, but the Treasurer cannot admit that because if he did admit that he would have to acknowledge that someone under investigation for tax evasion had been appointed to the Reserve Bank board. And that is his problem. Such a person would never have been appointed to the board of a major bank in this country if they were in a situation similar to Mr Gerard, because he would have failed the fit and proper person test under the Banking Act. He would have been disqualified for board membership. That is the fact.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Let me just quote from the RBA code of conduct as it relates to board members. It says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In pursuing the ... legislated goals, members recognise their responsibility for maintaining an unparalleled reputationâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">an unparalleled reputationâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">for integrity and propriety in all respects.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Let us go to the Banking Act. Let us look at the fit and proper person test, which says that the relevant APRA criteria would include an assessment of whether the person has (1) been criticised by a regulatory body, (2) been obstructive, misleading or untruthful with a regulatory body, (3) demonstrated a lack of willingness to comply with regulatory requirements or (4) been involved in business practices that appear negligent, deceitful or in other ways improper. He fails all of those tests if you look at the results of the ATO audit team.</para>
<para>So we say that this Treasurer has not upheld the highest standards of corporate governance in the appointment of Mr Gerard. In the last 48 hours he has not provided one satisfactory explanation for any of the allegations made against him in this affair. He has sought to cover up his knowledge of Mr Gerardâs business dealings to create the impression that his appointment was above board. On <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> this morning we got more evasion, but one essential fact remainsâone hurdle this Treasurer cannot jump over. He cannot deny, and has not denied, that Mr Gerard said that the Treasurer said to him, âI know there is an issue with the tax office but you can go on the board anyway.â You have never denied saying that, Treasurer. The Treasurer has never denied saying that Mr Gerard could go on the board anyway, despite all of the evidence from the ATO audit.</para>
<para>So what is the situation we are dealing with here? You can get on the Reserve Bank board through the size of your donation but you cannot have a probity process that applies the highest standards of integrity. In the case of Mr Gerard those standards have not been applied. You could see in question time today the embarrassment on the faces of the backbenchers over there, who have all deserted the Treasurer. The Liberal supporters on the back benches are disappearing like an <inline font-style="italic">Australian Idol</inline> audienceâthe numbers just get smaller and smaller. Look at them over there. There are two or three supporters of the Treasurer; they would fit into a Tarago van. You can see that your colleagues are cringing, Treasurer. They do not want to know you today. They do not want to go back to their electorates on Thursday night and defend your actions in this affair.</para>

<para>Treasurer, there has been no clamour to support you today from the frontbench. There has not been a peep from the member for Bradfield. Did anyone hear what he had to say? There has not been a peep from the member for Warringah. There has not been any support there. There certainly has not been a peep from the member for Mayo, who looked very embarrassed when we were raising questions about his role in the affair. And there certainly has been nothing from the member for Wentworth. So there has been stunning silence from the Liberal Party backbench because they know there is a stench associated with this affair. They want it to go away and you will not tell the truth.</para>

<para>âThe Australian people always knew there was something sneaky, tricky and arrogant about the Treasurer, and this whole affair simply proves it. What are the facts that we are dealing with? What are the facts of this affair that condemn this Treasurer and prove that he has been misleading the House? The first point is that there has been an argument going on with the tax office for 14 years. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister got up and talked about Mr Gerard as if he had made a mistake in his personal tax pack. They did not talk about the fact that, following the conclusions of the ATO audit, $150 million was at stake in Mr Gerardâs negotiations with the tax office.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>We should remember what the conclusions of the ATO audit were. The audit concluded that either there was a deliberate and knowing intention on the part of Gerard Industries to avoid the payment of tax or there was a flagrant disregard for the operation of taxation law that could not be excused in people of their skill and experience. Does that sound like a recommendation for a member of the Reserve Bank board? It certainly does not. Does that sound like the standard of probity that we expect of members of the Reserve Bank board? Absolutely not. It was simply a no-brainer that he could not be appointed to the Reserve Bank board. We want to know what went on in the Liberal Party backrooms when this appointment was made. We want to know what the conversations were. We do not want the continual misleads that we are receiving in this House.</para>
<para>This investigation culminated in an audit by the ATO and court action. So this was not some minor dispute. As the Leader of the Opposition demonstrated at the end of question time, the ATO, through the DPP, had a very substantial claim on the assets of this manâto the tune, I think, of $250 million. That was put in court documents filed by the DPPâand the Treasurer comes into this House today and denies that there were any issues! In fact, he said that these matters were all resolved when Mr Gerard was appointed to the Reserve Bank board in March. But the documentation today proves that these matters were still outstanding months laterâand that is despite the fact that there were press reports at the time of Mr Gerardâs appointment which proved that this was a matter of discussion within business circles in South Australia and, I believe, within the Liberal Party at a wider level. And there were documents in the Supreme Court registry in South Australia for over six months. But we are expected to believe that this Treasurer knew nothing about these things and that it was all okay. The manâs personal tax records and affairs were all okay and somehow they are completely distinct from his business life! The company is called Gerard Industries, Mr Treasurer, and for you and the Prime Minister to pretend in this House that there were no issues involving this gentleman sets a new standard in public life.</para>
<para>Now we come to the evidence from Mr Gerard. Mr Gerard has said that he rang up the Treasurer and said to the Treasurer, âCheck me out.â Did the Treasurer check him out? What checks were made after Mr Gerard made that invitation to him, as Mr Gerard says on the public record? Mr Gerard has also said that in a subsequent conversation the Treasurer said that he knew all about this but it did not matter to him. His standards of probity did not matter because no standards of probity applied.</para>
<para>What actually happened between when Mr Gerard first spoke to the Treasurer and the subsequent phone call when the Treasurer said, âI do not have a problem with your tax issueâ? What went on in the Liberal Party? What went on in the smoke-filled rooms during that period to convince the Treasurer that this was all okay? There is a knowing smile on his face. Perhaps he is thinking: âThe Prime Minister made me do it.â Maybe that is his excuse. Maybe that is an excuse he may choose to use later onâthat it really was not his fault that he did not uphold the highest possible standards that we expect of a Treasurer in this country.</para>
<para>Perhaps he did not do it because the Prime Minister did it or perhaps because the Prime Minister got Alex to do it or perhaps because the Prime Minister was speaking to Senator Minchin. There may be a whole set of implications regarding who was involved in this, but we certainly know that this Treasurer did not uphold the highest standards of office that we would expect from a Treasurer of this country for a body as important to us in economics as the High Court is in law. This is a body which has a fundamental impact on the lives of all Australians, a fundamental impact on the interest rates they pay and a fundamental impact on our macro-economic stability. This Treasurer, and indeed this Prime Minister, can be so ruthless with working Australians but so soft on their mates in the Liberal Party, particularly when they have become very large donorsâin this case to the tune of $1.1 million.</para>
<para>So what I say to the people of Australia, Treasurer, is simply this: this is exhibit A in the case against you ever leading this country, exhibit A in the case against the Treasurer ever succeeding to the leadership of the Liberal Party. The whole episode is tied up in your ham-fisted and pea-hearted bid for the Lodge, and it should disqualify you from that job. The real import of this scandal is very simple, Mr Treasurer: if you are an ordinary PAYE taxpayer, it is impossible to dodge the highest taxes in the nationâs history, but if you are a million dollar donating mate of the Liberal Party you get rewarded for it. You get rewarded for this sort of action: you get elevated to the highest body in the land.</para>

<para>âThe point is this: if you are a million dollar mate of the Liberal Party, you get rewarded for it. He gets a seat on the Reserve Bank board. You can be appointed to the Reserve Bank board with no probity checks whatsoeverâand they hang their hat on their financial management credentials! You can see the reputation of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer of this country demeaned when they come into this House and pretend it was okay because there was a letter from the tax commissioner saying his personal affairs were in order, somehow expecting the country to believe that they did not know anything about his business affairs.</para>

<para>This is a very sad reflection on the Howard government. The truth is that the whole episode really points to a creeping arrogance in the Howard government and a moral decay at the heart of this government that goes to its approach in so many other areas: its suppression of the parliament, its use of terrorism to divide the community, its attack on working Australians through its divisive industrial relations legislationâall of these things are on a par with the record of this government. But, Mr Treasurer, no slippery barrister talk is going to get you out of this oneâno more evasion, no more distortions or nondenials. We need answers from you, Treasurer, and we are going to hound you for the term of your political life because you are not worthy of the top job in this country and you are most certainly not worthy of the title Treasurer of Australia.

<para>âWe just had 15 minutes where the member for Lilley produced no substantive news and where he had trouble seeing out the 15 minutes, which ended up with personal abuse and the suggestion that someone is not fit to be Treasurer of Australia. Can I suggest that it was very clear after the MPI speech who is not fit to be Treasurer of Australia, and that is the member for Lilley. The one thing we did not get in the course of the discussion was an address of the MPI, because the MPI is âthe need to uphold the highest standards in the selection of candidates for the Reserve Bank boardâ. Let me make this point: the people who currently sit on the Reserve Bank board are held in the highest esteem by the business community and the general community of Australiaâand certainly in much higher esteem than appointees to the Reserve Bank board were held during the period when the Labor government was in office.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>One of the things that this government has done is to elevate the independence of the Reserve Bank and, if I may say so, it has ensured a wide cross-representation of qualified people to sit on that bank board. One only has to go back to the last Labor government and look at some of the appointees. The member for Lilley would say he is very worried about the probity of Reserve Bank board members. Let me remind the member for Lilleyâhe did not seem to go back very farâthat it was not so long ago that Labor appointees to the Reserve Bank board did jail terms. I am not going to name the member of the Reserve Bank board because his family has probably suffered enough, but there was a member of the Reserve Bank board appointed by the Labor Party who did a jail term.</para>
<para>If the member for Lilley comes in here and says that the standards on the Reserve Bank board are slipping, let me say that under the Labor Party we had Sir Peter Abeles sitting on the Reserve Bank board. Under the Labor Party we had Bill Kelty sitting on the Reserve Bank board. What is the gravamen of the charge here? Mr Gerard had been a donor to the Liberal Party. Mr Kelty had been more than a donor to the Labor Party; he had been the financial controller of the Labor Party, funnelling union funds in the tens of millions through to the Australian Labor Party.</para>
<para>Mr Gerard is not suitable to go on the Reserve Bank board but Bill Kelty is! Bill Kelty is the financial controller of the Australian Labor Party with a 60 per cent interest, because the trade unions own 60 per cent of the votes of the Australian Labor Party. So their major shareholder and major financial controller sat on the Reserve Bank board. Did the member for Lilley deal with that? No. Did he deal with Sir Peter Abeles? No. Did he deal with Bob Hawke? Was Bob Hawke a political neutral? Bob Hawke was on the Reserve Bank board before he went on the wagon. He was sitting on the Reserve Bank board as a member. As the President of the ACTUâapparently that was no conflict of interestâhe was sitting on the Reserve Bank board. And the Australian Labor Party would have you believe that they are worried about the prestige of the board. Let me tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, the prestige of the Reserve Bank board is higher than it has been for decades, possibly ever.</para>
<para>We did have a bit of a blast from the past today when I was asked on the <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> program about comments from a certain former Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Bernie Fraser. Without going through Mr Bernie Fraser in detail, I will remind the House that during the term of Reserve Bank Governor Fraserâ</para>

<para>âthe Treasurer of Australia, one PJ Keating, said publicly that he had the Reserve Bank in his pocket. There is no more damaging statement that has ever been made about the Reserve Bank than when the Treasurer of the day said that he had the Reserve Bank in his pocket. What he was essentially saying was that the Reserve Bank was not independent, that it did not have independence, and that it was the Treasurer of the day who was calling the decisions of the Reserve Bank. That comment haunted Australia for years. It haunted Australia and the financial markets because it was always believed that when Mr Keating made that comment he was making it about the bank and about the governor of the bank, Mr Bernie Fraser, who had been a former Treasury secretary.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>This is the government that pulled the Reserve Bankâs independence up with an agreement between the Treasurer and the governor which enacted its independence and gave it a new standard of independence that the Reserve Bank board had never had before. When we actually did that in 1996, what was the position of the Australian Labor Party? They opposed it. The Australian Labor Party claimed that the agreement between the Treasurer and the Governor of the Reserve Bank to enhance and recognise its independence was illegal. The then shadow Treasurer, Gareth Evans, said he would be taking legal action on behalf of the Australian Labor Party to strike down an agreement which gave the bank its independence. That is how much the Australian Labor Party cared about the independence of the Reserve Bank.</para>
<para>Not only did we enshrine its independence, not only did we make sure that no person could say or claim that the bank was in the pocket of the government of the day, but also we appointed people to the bank board who had wide experience in business and industryâand Mr Gerard is one of those people. Let me tell you why Mr Gerard is on the Reserve Bank board. He is a major manufacturer in Australia, probably one of the largest manufacturers in Australia with 3,300 employees and with the Clipsal brand, which not only has been a household name hereâliterally a household product here in Australiaâbut has gone right up through Asia. So, if you want somebody on the Reserve Bank board who can give business experience about manufacturing and about the state of housing constructionâwhat is needed in relation to housing markets, manufacturing markets and manufacturingâMr Gerard is highly qualified.</para>
<para>The opposition would now say he never should have been appointed because everybody knew he was contesting a tax assessment. Everybody knew. The Australian Labor Party can come back into this parliament and they can give all of the statements where they stated they knew and where they opposed it. I have been looking through all of their web sites and there was not a mention from the Australian Labor Party at the time of Mr Gerardâs appointment that he had a tax objection on foot, nor was there a mention that it is improper to have a tax objection and nor did they say he was disqualified from going on the bank board as a consequence of that.</para>
<para>All of this objection to Mr Gerard relates to the fact that he supported the Liberal Party and, as of yesterday, the Australian Labor Party decided they would find a few bullets and they would try and fire them off. After 10 questions today what did they actually establish? Their big question of the day was: what happened to this letter to the Attorney-General about the tax affairs of Gerard Industries? As the Attorney-General said, what happened to it was that it was never written. There was no letter to the Attorney-General, let alone a letter passed from the Attorney-General to the Treasurer. They did not even have a question for the Attorney-General about that after that little attack fell flat on its face.</para>
<para>The member for Lilley then says that there are no probity checks in relation to Mr Gerard. The probity checks on Mr Gerard are the probity checks that are made on every other director of the Reserve Bank board and, as far as I know, in relation to taxation affairs, they are the same probity checks that were undertaken by the Australian Labor Party during its 13-year term of office from 1983 to 1996. They are the same probity checks that are undertaken, I believe, on judges. They are the same probity checks which are taken in relation to all Commonwealth appointees. That is, if a person is qualified for a Commonwealth appointment by reason of their experience, their ability, their training and their qualifications, the last thing that they are asked to do in the process is to sign a statement as to their tax affairs in a standard formâa form that was used under the Australian Labor Party, a form that was used for every other member of the Reserve Bank board and a form that I believe is used in relation to Federal Court and High Court judges. They are asked about their taxation affairs.</para>
<para>Mr Gerard gave that statement and, what is more, the Commissioner of Taxation had written him a letter which also indicated that there were no outstanding disputes. The taxation commissioner could have come back and said, âIâve got objections to this, this or this.â Did he? No, of course he did not. The taxation commissioner could have said, âI am not satisfied as to his taxation affairs.â But he did not. The taxation commissioner came back and said, âThere are no disputes with Mr Gerard.â So Mr Gerard is given the undertaking which every person, including judges, the ACCC chairman and the ASIC chairman, can get. The Commissioner of Taxation said that he had no disputes. Mr Gerard was eminently qualified. He has sat on the board for 2Â½ years. Is there one incident in which he has failed to properly discharge his duty? No. Is there any complaint about the way in which Mr Gerard has exercised his powers as a member of the Reserve Bank board? No. There is nothing.</para>
<para>In fact, the member for Lilley said earlier, âInterest rates are set by the Reserve Bank board, and heâs on it.â I would think most Australians would be pretty happy with the way interest rates have been set in the last two years. I can tell you this: as I walk down the streets of Australia and talk to people about interest rates, they do complain about some people and their record, but they do not complain about Mr Gerard. The people they complain about are Mr Paul Keating and the Australian Labor Party. They remember them very well. I have never had a house buyer who has said to me, âIâm unhappy with interest rates, and Mr Rob Gerard has not adequately discharged his duty on the Reserve Bank board.â I have never had a house buyer say that.</para>
<para>Then the member for Lilley said: âHouse buyers are worried. The fate of their mortgage rests on this man on the Reserve Bank board.â Funnily, I have never had anybody in Australia say, âIâm worried about my mortgage because Mr Gerard is on the Reserve Bank board.â The Australian Labor Party could have mentioned in relation to the discharge of his duties some action in the last 2Â½ years which proved that he was not fit to be a board member. They cannot. They have no objection to the discharge of his duty.</para>
<para>Even the Leader of the Opposition in question time yesterday said: âWeâre not asking questions that go to his fitness. Weâre not asking questions which go to whether he is fit and proper.â By <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> last night, they were asking questions. This morning, when they were asked, âShould Mr Gerard be sacked from the board?â the answer was no. They are not asking that he be sacked. They were not questioning his fitness yesterday afternoon, although they were on <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> last night, and this morning they are not questioning his eligibility.</para>
<para>So where does this leave it? The Australian Labor Party are not questioning his eligibility. They do not say that he should be sacked or that there are grounds for sacking him from the Reserve Bank board. So where does that leave it? It leaves it here. The Australian Labor Party will, if they can, smear someone in public life if they think there is a political advantage in it. They could not care less. They will, if they can, smear someone in public life if they believe that there is an advantage in it.</para>

<para>âWe have just seen the Treasurer of this nation resort to a shameful attack on an opposition member to divert attention from the fact that there is no substance to his defence.

The context that he tries to put it in is that this is some sort of trifling dispute between an honest citizen and the Australian Taxation Office.

<para>âMr Gerard was required to pay to the tax office $150 million. But this was not back tax; $36 million of this was tax penalties. The Australian Taxation Office audit team demanded that the maximum penalty be imposed. This was not simply a disagreement. Mr Gerard did not simply say, âWe donât agree with the tax bill weâve got, but weâll pay it.â A penalty of $36 million was imposed. For the layman in the street there is another word for a tax penalty, and that is a fine. He had to pay a fine of $36 million for tax evasion. We are not talking about tax avoidance. We are not talking about a lawful way of reducing your tax bill. We are talking about tax evasion.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The Taxation Office alleged that this tax evasion occurred over a period of 12 years. This was not a slip-up or an accounting error; this was 12 years of tax evasion. The tax office made the case that Gerard Industries set up a company and deliberately made it look like it was part of another group of companies. The ATO also argued that Mr Gerard made false and misleading statements during an investigation and did not provide âa reasonable level of cooperationâ. Yet with all the eminently qualified industrialists in this land, with all the heads of industry with impeccable credentialsânone of which would have been questioned by the Labor Partyâand with all the economic experts available for appointment to the Reserve Bank board, the Treasurer thought Mr Gerard was the best Australian that he could appoint.</para>
<para>There is evidence that there was plenty of information available at the time to suggest Mr Gerard was not an appropriate appointment to the Reserve Bank board. It is not the case that the Treasurer appointed Mr Gerard and then later an issue arose. Mr Costello could then have come into the House and said: âI trusted Mr Gerard, I thought he was the best appointment, but he let me down. I made a mistake and I am sorry I appointed him.â A reasonable observer would say that was fair enough. But the Treasurer cannot say that because Mr Gerard says he knew. And if the Treasurer did not know, he should have, because there was plenty of information on the public record at the time. There was plenty of information on the record of the Supreme Court of South Australia for the alarm bells to ring in a very serious way. At every level this is a scandal of the highest proportion.</para>
<para>The Treasurer was quick to point out yesterday, and he did it again today, that this was a cabinet decision. âItâs not all my fault,â he said, âthe whole cabinet is responsible.â We have seen some ducking and shoving from cabinet members. Yesterday in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> a senior unnamed cabinet member was quoted as saying that Mr Gerardâs tax record was not discussed around the cabinet table and that the Treasurer did not reveal it. Mr Costello had an obligation to say to his cabinet colleagues, âThis is the man I want to appoint to the Reserve Bank board. Heâs in a major tax evasion case with the Australian tax office, which answers to me as Treasurer as well, but I want to appoint him anyway.â The cabinet could then have made an informed decision. But, judging by the statements made by the senior unnamed cabinet minister yesterday, that is not what occurred. Some ministers would have known about the tax evasion problem, particularly ministers from South Australia, I would presume, but others would not.</para>
<para>What about the Treasurerâs other line of defence? He brandishes a letter. He says, âThis letter vindicates my positionâthis is my defence.â But the letter was signed by none other than Mr Gerard. It is a letter of self-defence. This is the weakest line of defence that has been used in this House since Doc Evatt stood up 50 years ago and said, âThere are no Russian spies in Australia because the Russians told me there arenât.â The Treasurer has adopted the Molotov defence. Mr Gerard said there was nothing in his tax record to embarrass the government. I think he got that wrong. Next the Treasurer relied on a letter from the Commissioner of Taxation. He brandishes this as exhibit B in his defence. He says the tax commissioner signed off that there was nothing wrong with Mr Gerardâs tax records. But, of course, there was a very important caveat in that letter: it said that the tax office had no dispute with Mr Gerardâs personal tax record. It did not indicate anything about Gerard Industries, in which Mr Gerard happens to be a 50 per cent shareholder. These defences are convenient for the Treasurer, but they are fallacious.</para>
<para>All government appointments are important and should be handled with great care. But the board of the Reserve Bank of Australia is a particularly important appointment. The Reserve Bank of Australia does not just set interest rates, as important as that task isâthat is its highest profile role. The Reserve Bank has several other responsibilities. It is responsible for maintaining financial stability. It is also the banker to the government and conducts foreign exchange on behalf of the government. The term âbankâ in its title is not symbolic; it is called the Reserve Bank because it is a bank. I have stood in the foreign exchange room of the Reserve Bank with the Governor of the Reserve Bank and with other members of this House, including members opposite, and watched the foreign exchange being conducted. The Governor of the Reserve Bank regularly makes the point that the Reserve Bank is, in some ways, just another bank.</para>
<para>If it were just another bank, then there would be certain rules as to who could be appointed to its board. There would have had to have been an assessment as to whether the applicant to the board had (1) been criticised by any regulatory body, (2) been obstructive, misleading or untruthful with any regulatory body or (3) demonstrated a lack of willingness to comply with regulatory requirements. If any one of these requirements had been enforced, then Mr Gerard could not have been appointed. Of course, these requirements do not apply to the Reserve Bank; it operates under its own act of parliament. But wouldnât you have thought that the Treasurer of this nation would want at least the same level of integrity in the appointment of board members to the Reserve Bank as would apply to any other bank in this nation from the smallest to the largest? Wouldnât you have thought that that would be at least the minimum requirement of the Treasurer? You would think so, but apparently this is not the case.</para>
<para>The Treasurer thought it was more important to appoint a Liberal Party mateâa long-term member of the party and one of its major donors. Heather Ridout belled the cat on this issue yesterday in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> when she indicated that Mr Gerard is close to the Prime Minister. This is a Prime Minister who boasted about higher moral standards in government when he came to office. We saw how long that lasted.</para>
<para>The Treasurer says, and it is true, that it is not a disqualification for appointment to government boards to be close to certain government figures. It is quite true that donating money to the Liberal Party is not a disqualification from serving on government boards. The Labor Party are not making that charge and never have, but we do say that people appointed to senior government roles should be of the highest integrity. Donating $1 million to the Liberal Party should not be enough to buy you a seat on the board of the Reserve Bank of Australia. The people of Australia deserve better than this lack of integrity from the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and the most senior levels of this government. They deserve transparency and honesty. They deserve integrity. This scandal makes it clear that they will not get it from this government or this Treasurer. He has appointed a long-term mate of the Liberal Party to the board of the Reserve Bank, and he should hang his head in shame. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThis MPI today is about one thing. It is about the fact that the Labor Party members who sit opposite and call themselves an opposition are bereft of policy, bereft of direction and bereft of leadership. Look at their so-called leader who sits here at question time pulling faces across the chamber like a schoolchildâthe Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand. There is no excuse for this opposition who are trying to be relevant in the important economy that we have today. That is just plainly pathetic, as is the attack that we have seen on Mr Gerard.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We all know that the Labor Party have been told that they have to muscle up. No doubt they have done new focus tests which have said the member for Brand, the Leader of the Opposition, is a bit too soft and fuzzy. So his way of muscling up is not to get into policy debate with the Treasurer, the Prime Minister or any of the other members of the Howard government but simply to get down into the gutter and to start throwing insults at both public and private individuals to deflect the criticism that is rightly coming the oppositionâs way because they have not spent any time as an opposition over nearly 10 years on developing policies that can benefit Australia.</para>
<para>They are great at knocking thingsâabsolutely first rate. They know only too well how to be negative but they do not know how to construct positive policies. So what do they do? They muscle up with personal attacks on individuals that cannot be sustained and they use cowardâs castle in order to do it. And we have seen nothing more disgraceful than the behaviour of the two speakers from the Labor Party that have just led this attack, not using the rule of law, where in this country an individual is actually innocent until proven guilty, but making wild allegations that cannot be founded in any way, shape or form about reputable Australians.</para>
<para>We saw on Monday how their tactics in this place went wildly astray. When the member for Perth made the huge tactical error of defying the rule of the Speaker on three separate occasions, âMr Muscle Manâ, the member for Brand, decided he would muscle up and take on the Speaker, because he cannot take on the Treasurer. We do not get any economic questions to the Treasurer and we do not get any questions to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations on industrial relations, so what do we get? We get an attack on the Speaker to waste the time of the parliament and we do not get questions on what is potentially and arguably one of the most important passages of time in this parliament in the time since Federation. Here we have industrial relations and monumentally important legislation before the parliamentâMonday an attempted question, Tuesday zero, Wednesday zero. In fact, the only time industrial relations was mentioned by anyone of any substance on the other side was in the last two minutes of the contribution from the member for Lilley when he was making the MPI and that was as a passing referenceânothing of any substance, yet they are out there shoulder to shoulder with the union movement telling us this is going to destroy Australiansâ way of life. What a load of rubbish! If there is so little to discuss of national or international significance in this place, maybe that is the reason they have decided to attack Mr Gerard.</para>
<para>We have had questions today from this side of the House on significant issues such as exports, industrial relations, Iraq and the Australian economy. The Treasurer took a question today on something that does involve interest rates and the Reserve Bank of Australia and is of interest to every Australian who has any interest at all in the economy of this countryâour credit rating. Australiaâs having a triple A credit rating means that we are allâbusinesses, individuals and the nation as a wholeâpaying less for the loans that we take out, no matter what they are. So you have to go to the motivation. What is motivating the Labor Party? The fact is they have no real policy position on industrial relations other than to oppose it; they have no real position on Welfare to Work other than to oppose it; and then we have counter-terrorism. Here are three extraordinarily significant and important pieces of legislation before the Australian parliament. In question time today, what of the opportunity that democracy allows the opposition to ask questions of the pertinent ministers? There was not one utterance from any of them on these issues of significance.</para>
<para>So let us go to the MPI today. The Treasurer put it very succinctly: we heard nothing from the two Labor Party speakers on the MPI today that actually went to the core of it. The core of this was âto uphold the highest standards of probity in the selection of candidates for the Reserve Bankâ. Let us look at the one person they are interested in here and at this individualâs history to see whether or not he is suitable to be on the board of the Reserve BankâMr Robert Geoffrey Gerard AO. This is the individual we are referring to, a person who has been in public life, who has been scrutinised and whose life has been open for people to see for a very long time in South Australia and in Australia generally. This is a little bit about the person that they stand here and denigrate today, saying that he is a tax cheat in cowardâs castle when there has been nothing about him in a court of law anywhere. Nowhere has this been even suggested by the Australian Taxation Office; never has it been brought up in a court of law. It has been suggested only by those who sit opposite, because they are bereft of policy.</para>
<para>This is the individual who gives his time to the Reserve Bank. He is currently the Chairman and Managing Director of the Gerard Corporation Pty Ltd group of companies. He holds the following positions. He is a board member of the Reserve Bank. He is Chairman of the Australian Made Campaign. He is a councillor of the Australian Business Arts Foundation. He is a councillor of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He is a director of Order of Australia Association Foundation Ltd. He is a trustee of South Australian Business Vision 2010âand it goes on. He is the Chairman of the Royal Zoological Society of South Australia. He is heavily involved in the Duke of Edinburgh Award. Is anything getting through to those that sit opposite about the credibility of this man, his longevity in public life, the sorts of values that he holds dear and has espoused and what he has performed over a very long time in public life? He is Chairman of the South Australian State Award Committee and is Deputy Chairman of the World Fellowship, Australasian Region. He has also been a major fundraiser for South Australia, for the Olympic fundraising appeal, having raised over $1 million as part of that committee from 1994 to 2000. He was also appointed as an Officer in the General Division of the Order of Australia in the Queenâs Birthday honours list in June 1999. He was made honorary consul for Austria in South Australia and the Northern Territory in May 1997.</para>
<para>Robert Geoffrey Gerard was recently appointed Master Entrepreneur for the Central Region. In other words, he is a person who drives innovation and understands what it is to be in business. He is the sort of individual who understands what it takes to employ Australians and he has demonstrated that through his actions. In 2000, he was honoured as South Australian of the Year for his contribution as an ambassador for the state. If you are looking for someone qualified to be on the Reserve Bank board, you cannot go past this gentleman.</para>
<para>But the only thing we have from the opposition is a smear campaign. They came into this House yesterday grinning from ear to ear because they had a chance to get off the policy hook. They did not have to deal with the issues that the people who sit in the gallery, the people who listen to parliament and the people who will pick up the newspaper tomorrow have to deal with every dayâare they going to have a job, are we going to help people on welfare back into work, are we going to protect Australia from terrorism and are we going to liberalise the industrial relations laws? These are the policy issues of the day and these are the policy issues the Labor Party have elected to move away from because they have no position at all on these issues.</para>
<para>The one allegation they make is that Mr Gerard was in dispute with the tax office. As Minister for Revenue, I know only too well how many people there are in this country who disagree with the rulings of the tax office. That is not a crime in this country. There is nothing wrong with that. People have a different perspective and a different view. They get private rulings, they get public rulings and they go to the courts. If they are found guilty in the courts, the book is thrown at them. That is not the case here. What the Labor Party will not admit toâwill not acknowledgeâis the letter, dated 3 March, from the Commissioner of Taxation, Michael Carmody, which goes to the heart of whether or not Mr Gerard had a conflict with the ATO which would preclude him from being on the RBA board. The letter says:</para>

</talker>
<para>âThank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to continue my comments on the <inline ref="R2461">Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline>. The government has again shown its contempt for this parliament and the people we represent by failing to allow proper scrutiny of this bill. The government has limited time for debate. It has allowed the Senate only a cursory inquiry and now it has rushed the bill on for debate, with the ink barely dry on the Senate report. The government has failed to take into account any of the genuine concerns raised in the Senate reportâconcerns that clearly show that this bill punishes some of the poorest people in this country and makes it harder, not easier, for them to move from welfare to work.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This bill is not about welfare to work. The reality is that it is merely about dumping people from one welfare payment to anotherâa lower payment at thatâand making it even harder for people who are already struggling to survive with increasing day to day living costs. These families are already struggling with high petrol prices. Food, utility charges and housing costs are all on the increase. The cost of basic phone services has increased and is set to increase more under a fully privatised Telstra. The governmentâs own policies have seen out-of-pocket health costs skyrocket. By cutting paymentsâwhich, effectively, is what this bill doesâfamilies will struggle even more. The government has not proved that cutting payments will help these people into work; in fact, of the 60 written submissions and over 60 witnesses heard during the Senate inquiry into the changes, not one provided evidence that linked reduced payments to increased chances of finding a job. Even the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations could not provide evidence of this link.</para>
<para>Cutting payments will not make it easier for parents to find part-time employment that fits in with child-care responsibilities, and it will not help a person with a disability to find satisfying or appropriate employment. The government has admitted that 300,000 Australians will be financially worse off under these changesâ300,000 Australians will be affected. At best, fewer than half of them will be able to find work and many of those who do find work will actually end up poorer. I cannot support this bill, because the Australians that it targets will not be better off nor will they have a better chance of finding a job.</para>
<para>The bill is not about improving the lot of those about to be dumped from parenting payments or those who are unable to claim the disability support pension due to the new eligibility criteria. It is a retrograde step aimed at punishing those who have the responsibility of raising young children, sometimes on their own, and it also punishes those who have the burden of a disability. We all accept that nobody benefits from unemployment and that the best way that we can help people is to get them a job. But, under these changes, many will not benefit from employment either. Sole parents who are pushed onto Newstart when their youngest child turns eight will find it very difficult to juggle their parenting responsibilities with their new responsibilityâprovided by the Howard governmentâto find work.</para>
<para>Family-friendly work hours are now rare in most workplaces. Finding a job can be difficult, but finding a job that fits in with school hours is a very difficult task indeed. However, when a job has been found, locating child care can be an equally difficult task. Once you have got over these major hurdlesâyou have found a job, located child care and managed to find a workplace that you can fit around your child-care responsibilitiesâimagine discovering on pay day that you are in fact worse off with the job than you were on a welfare payment. It is absolutely absurd.</para>
<para>According to the modelling completed by NATSEM, the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, a sole parent who has one child and works 15 hours a weekâdoing the right thing and getting a jobâwill keep only $81 of their earnings, while the Howard government claws back the other $114. This means that this parent will be $91 a week worse off by working under the proposed arrangements than they would be if they moved into work under the current arrangements. Effectively, they will be working for $3.88 an hour.</para>
<para>The government may say that the best assistance you can give people on welfare is a job, but what sort of assistance is it if you are worse off in the job? The last time I looked, it actually cost people money to look for work, so cutting peopleâs payments to get them into work is really not the most sensible suggestion. Labor proposed ideas such as welfare to work tax bonuses, which would improve the financial reward for those making the transition from welfare to work by increasing the tax free threshold to $10,000 for those earning under $20,000. But what did the government do when Labor made these sensible suggestions? They gave the biggest tax savings to those who were earning the most rather than assisting those who were earning the least. Not only will every-day Australians be worse off under this bill but also the number of people reliant on Centrelink payments will not decrease.</para>
<para>The government has failed its own test on welfare reform. It says the test of its welfare reform is the reduction of the number of people on welfare payments. This bill fails that test. This bill does not address the growth in the number of people on welfare payments. Moving people from one Centrelink payment to another does not reduce the number of people dependent on their fortnightly Centrelink payment. Labor wants real welfare reform that tackles the reasons why someone is not working and delivers practical solutions. Directing Centrelink to shuffle the deck and to move people from one payment to anotherâfrom one database to anotherâdoes not reduce the numbers who are receiving payments. When Australians are moved to another payment, what support do they get under this bill?</para>
<para>This bill lacks any real opportunities for skills acquisition, and it provides little support for those who need it. However, it does provide for punitive breaching of parents and persons with a disability if they fail to follow instructions. Parents will be given a Job Network guarantee which, if it is anything like mutual obligation, will be a one-way street at best. I am sure that this will guarantee parents one thing: if they do not play the game, they will be breached and their payments will be cut or suspended.</para>
<para>Catholic Welfare Australia stated in their submission to the Senate inquiry that the proposed breaching regime is unnecessarily harsh and that, if the ultimate objective of the breaching regime is to actively re-engage job seekers, this is counterproductive. This could also mean that job seekers could walk out the front door of the agency that breaches them and in the back door of the same agency to seek emergency relief and material support. The ability of parents to return to work is affected by a number of issues, including the ability to access affordable child care and appropriate vocational training. Parents who are returning to work and people with a disability who are seeking employment need further assistance and support, including vocational education and training. Parents who have spent years performing the important role of raising children, at the same time being out of the paid work force, do need training. They need access to quality vocational education that updates skills, builds confidence and improves their employability. Without appropriate training, parents returning to the work force or seeking employment for the first time will be at a great disadvantage as they compete against those with a recent employment history.</para>
<para>Parents and people with a disability are currently able to access training with the assistance of the pensioner education supplement. Being dumped onto the dole will mean that they are no longer able to access this payment. The pensioner education supplement is $62.40 per fortnight for full-time study and $31.20 per fortnight for part-time studyâstudy that improves peopleâs confidence, their skills and their employability. Under these reforms, the pensioner education supplement will be gone, and 60,000 parents will have to fight 60,000 mature age unemployed for the few vocational places availableâonly some 12,300. With many single parents having high school as their highest education level, if they are unable to secure one of these few vocational training places, their ability to be competitive in the labour market will be greatly curtailed. People with a disability also need a great deal of assistance with vocational guidance, identifying suitable employment, vocational trainingâall of thisâbefore actually finding an employer who will give them a job.</para>
<para>In my own electorate of Ballarat, I have utilised the services of Highlands Personnel, a specialist disability employment agency that assists with the training and placement of job seekers with a disability. I am impressed by the quality of their service and the standard of the young person that I employed for a short period of time in my own office. Highlands Personnel have a large client base of quality job seekers seeking employment. But for many years Highlands Personnel and the CRS struggled with lengthy waiting lists of people with disabilities who were desperate to get work but who were unable to get assistance from the specialist disability employment service because the federal government would not provide enough funding to allow that to happen. Two hundred people were actually on the waiting list of Highlands Personnel at one stage, and the federal government is now telling those 200 people who were desperate to get work and who were on the waiting list for Highlands Personnel: âWe think youâve really been bludging on the disability support pension, and weâre going to force you into work.â It is an absolute disgrace.</para>
<para>The issue is not just about what has happened in terms of disability employment services or training availability for people with disabilities; the issue is also about incentives available to employers and the willingness of employers to give a person with a disability a fair go. And there is always the issue of the funding to assist with the training of the job seeker and, in some cases, the cost of ongoing support once they have located employment. But again, once a person with a disability secures employment, they will actually be worse off under this bill.</para>
<para>Modelling completed again by NATSEM shows that if a person with a disability works 15 hours a week at the minimum wage, they will keep only 25c for every dollar they earn, while the Howard government takes the other 75câsome incentive to work. They would be $122 per week worse off by moving into work under these changes than if they moved into work under the current arrangements. This means that the Howard government is actually asking people with a disability to work for a return of $2.27 per hour. It costs money to gain work, and this bill is forcing people onto a lesser payment which means that they in fact will find it very difficult to afford the costs of finding work.</para>
<para>It is bad enough, without considering the limited bargaining power people with a disability will have after the Howard governmentâs extreme industrial relations changes come through this parliament. What position will a person with a disability be in when trying to negotiate wages and conditions with an employer? With jobs being difficult to secure and the proven difficulty disadvantaged Australian job seekers already have finding employment, they are going to be in no position to negotiate with an employer for overtime pay, Christmas and other holidays, leave entitlements and penalty rates, let alone a reasonable wage.</para>
<para>As I mentioned earlier, these Welfare to Work changes will force people with a disability and parents to accept âsuitableâ work, and they will suffer penalties if they do not comply. They will not have to accept work if there are special circumstances, but there are too many unanswered questions. What constitutes a âsuitableâ job under this bill? What constitutes a âspecial circumstanceâ under which to refuse a job? What will happen if a job seeker is âbreachedâ? Under the Howard governmentâs extreme industrial relations reforms, âsuitable employmentâ could mean just about anything. But we do know that a job seeker will be breached if they do not accept a job that pays below award rates. What position will a person with a disability or a parent returning to the work force be in when trying to negotiate with an employer? A pretty poor one, I would think. We also know that if someone who is successful in finding employment is âdismissed for misconductâ they will also be breached. It will be hard to tell if someone has been dismissed for misconduct or unfairly dismissed under the Howard governmentâs extreme industrial relations changes.</para>
<para>The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee Chairman, Liberal senator Gary Humphries, said that the committee was worried that the âdevil was in the detailâ. A lot of the detail of this bill will not be available until the legislation is passed and the bureaucrats of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations have laid down their guidelines. Rather than shuffling people from one payment to another, what Australians need is real welfare reform.</para>
<para>I cannot support this bill, and I certainly hope that the new member for Greenway who, like me, is social work trained, actually understands the impact that this sort of bill is going to have on the people that she used to work for. These reforms do not adequately address why someone is not working and do not provide practical solutions to help them find a job. What the government is proposing is not welfare reform. The bill just allows people to be moved from one database to another, without offering anything tangible to assist them to enter the work force. Rather than providing opportunities, it provides hurdles. We should be investing in the skills of welfare recipients, leading to employment. We need to look at skill shortages and provide real training opportunities.</para>
<para>I want to briefly mention that I have had a social work student on placement in my office, which is something that I do regularly as a field educator for social workers, and he has been having a really good look at the Work for the Dole program compared to the state government funded Community Jobs Program. He has only been able to have a fairly limited study, and I am going to have a good look at that. It seems unbelievable to me that this government can continue to say that the outcomes in terms of employment and entry into study under the Work for the Dole program are acceptable when you see that, post three months of the Work for the Dole program, the outcome rate in relation to further employment and study is 27 per cent compared to the outcome under the Community Jobs Program, which is a wage training program, of 74 per cent.</para>
<para>The Community Jobs Program provides a real labour market training program, yet the governmentâs ideological obsession with blaming the victims of structural unemployment, with bashing âdole bludgersââand I have heard that language used incessantly by the other sideâmeans that it is committed to a labour market program that, yes, provides some great community outcomes for local communities in terms of the terrific work that Work for the Dole people put in but does not provide for real work and training outcomes. The statistics prove that, and the comments of people who have participated in both the Work for the Dole program and the CJP indicate that as well.</para>
<para>I will read some quotes from the people from that program. Under Work for the Dole, one of the people who participated in my social work student study said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Work for the Dole in fact cost me $15 per day on petrol to come into the program. The program actually takes money off you compared to CJP. $12 per hour is better than the unemployment benefits.

<para class="block">The government should be tackling the real reasons that someone is not working and should be delivering practical solutions to those. People with a disability or parents entering the work force are not held back because they are work-shy or lazy. I am sure that, having done a four-year social work degree, the member for Greenway would understand what the talking-down, blame-the-victim approach means. This blame-the-victim approach does not help people move off welfare payments, does not help build their self-esteem and does not help them get into the work force. People with disabilities are not work-shy or lazyâthey desperately want to get into the work forceâbut the governmentâs big stick approach would make you believe that that is the case. People cannot find employment for a number of reasons: a lack of recent work experience; poor skills; a lack of vocational training; an inability to find child care that is both accessible and affordable; and a lack of employment opportunities in the region they live in.</para>
<para>If the government were fair dinkum about welfare reform, it would address these issues. The government would provide employers incentives to encourage them to employ people without a recent employment history or people with a disability. The government would continue to provide the pensioner education supplement to people moving from parenting payments and to those who are not eligible for the DSP under new stringent guidelines. The government would provide adequate funding for skills and vocational training that meets the needs of employers. The government would fund adequate child-care places to meet the needs of parents of school-aged children returning to the work force, and it would improve on its own record in relation to the employment of people with a disabilityâwe would not see a massive drop from 5.6 per cent to 3.8 per cent of Australian government employees with a disability, which has happened under the Howard government.</para>
<para>Without a doubt, under the Howard governmentâs Welfare to Work proposal, people are going to be worse off. They will have their payments cut and their compliance requirements increased, the training and education opportunities they need to get work will not be available to the majority, and accessible child care to enable parents of school-age children to work is not readily available. Real welfare reform would provide opportunities, incentives and support, not penalties, punishment and reduced payments. This bill is not real welfare reform. It is a mean-spirited attempt by the government to cut the welfare bill and punish sole parents and people with disabilities. It fails to deliver the governmentâs end of the mutual obligation deal by putting in place programs that help people find work, not just churn them through the system. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI rise to support the governmentâs <inline ref="R2461">Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline>. This is an issue I feel very strongly about. With 23 years experience working at the grassroots level, I have seen first-hand the impact of people dependent on welfare. I feel that I am uniquely placed within this parliament to speak about the real impact of welfare dependency, particularly when this becomes intergenerational. In contrast to the members opposite, I believe that many people who are dependent on welfare have the capacity to work and that their potential is limited by the current environment.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Underpinning this bill is the governmentâs belief that there are Australians receiving welfare payments who can and do want to work. This side of the House firmly believes that there are people receiving welfare payments who have the capacity to work and who should do so; that the best form of family income and security comes from a job rather than welfare; and that services provided to those people who do have an obligation to seek work should focus on getting them into the workplace in a timely manner.</para>
<para>There is no doubt that one of the most alienating feelings is a feeling of dependency and as though there is a shortage of pathways and options. For those Australians who have become dependent on welfare and whose skills are outdated or underutilised, there is little doubt that there is a feeling of disconnectedness from society. Intergenerational dependency is a major concern for our community. Far too many children live in families with no experience of participation in the broader social and economic life of their communities and their nation. These children can often grow up feeling as though there is little point in trying to break this cycle. I have spoken with teenagers in my own electorateâpeople who live in my very suburbâwho talk about wanting to become doctors or pilots. A young woman of only 15 talked about wanting to become a policewoman. She said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... but that will never happen and I guess I will end up on the dole.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This is an attitude that is deeply concerning and should be the concern of all members of this House. I have personally challenged this statement. This young woman, like many other young people across this nation, has the potential and the capacity to achieve her goals and aspirations. On this side of the House we are taking responsibility for ensuring that these young people have every opportunity. There are 700,000 children in Australia who are growing up in households where there is no working adult, and two-thirds of these households are headed by single parents. Let me say that I believe in the potential of these single parents and their children. We believe in them and we place value on them. This is not about punishing them but encouraging them to reach their full potential.</para>
<para>There are 2.6 million Australians of working age between the ages of 15 and 64 who receive welfare payments. Of this number, only 15 per cent are required to actively look for work. It is little wonder that many people and their families fall into a cycle of dependency, unable to fully enjoy Australiaâs prosperity.</para>
<para>The number of people receiving welfare assistance from the Australian government has increased significantly over the last decade. Between 1997 and 2004 the disability support pension grew by 26 per cent and the single parenting payment grew by 33 per cent. More concerning, there are now more working age Australians on disability support pension than there are on Newstart allowance.</para>
<para>Let me highlight the breakdown of the figures we are seeing. There are 705,000 working age Australians receiving disability support pension. There are 630,000 working age Australians receiving parenting payments. Two hundred and sixty thousand people receiving income support are over the age of 50. Five hundred thousand Australians are in receipt of Newstart allowance. The implications are far reaching, with economic and social consequences. The bare economics of the problem show that the level of increase is not sustainable. In the 2004-05 financial year, spending on the disability support pension alone exceeded more than $10 billion. In the coming financial year, the total welfare budget for Australians will be $60 billion.</para>
<para>Although the economics of the problem are concerning, it is critical that we also examine the social ramifications. The Smith Family undertook a study into welfare dependency in 2001. The reportâs author, Ann Harding, of the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, made some important findings. She found that, of the waged households in Australia, only three per cent were in poverty. Compare that to the 31 per cent of households in poverty that rely on welfare. The report clearly demonstrated that a person was more likely to live in poverty if they were unemployedânot in the labour forceâand/or dependent totally on income support.</para>
<para>The Australian Council of Social Service has agreed with this side of the Houseâs assessment that the best way out of poverty is a job. With jobless poverty comes a real sense of despair and isolation. As a government we have a responsibility to assist people to reach their full potential and make important contributions to their communities. For many people on income support, work is something they have the capacity and the desire to engage in. A job really does provide the best route out of poverty. This side of the House is committed to finding real solutions and outcomes for people on income support. We recognise that, with an ageing population and an increase in the number of welfare recipients, Australia faces new and unique challenges.</para>
<para>Let me highlight an example of a single parent in my electorate. She lives in Toongabbie and has five children. As a young woman, her youngest child was diagnosed with a brain tumour. This left that young child with severe disabilities, but this young woman was determined to provide a future for her children. She engaged in training when her youngest child was able to attend school. She was then able to obtain a job. She saved enough to find a deposit for a home. She now lives in her own homeâa single parent. Her children will not grow up in poverty.</para>
<para>Unfortunately on the other side of the House there has been a policy vacuum. Rather than try to debate sensible policy options for Australiansâreal solutionsâthe Australian Labor Party has come here with the obstructionist tactics that we have all come to expect. The people of Australia deserve better. They deserve a government that is committed to providing opportunities for all Australians and that is planning for their future. It is about placing value on them and their future. We have for a long time been of the view that participation in the workplace provides people with psychological and social benefits, and this is borne out in the findings of research being conducted by the Australian Institute of Family Studies. Their findings demonstrate the impact clearly. Seventy per cent of parents agreed that work made them feel more confident; 84 per cent of parents considered that their working had a positive effect on their children.</para>
<para>Consider also that 70 per cent of the jobless customers at Centrelink who responded to a survey by the Social Research Centre said they would prefer to be in paid work. I would like to echo this finding with something from my own experience. A young man who was unemployed and had a history of being in prison came to me after the birth of his first childâat that time I was working in emergency support. These were his words: âI want to find a job so that I can pay for my daughter to experience ballet classes.â This young man had a terrible background, but he had a future and a dream and a desire for a future for his children.</para>
<para>Some of the most compelling findings come from the Australian Unity Wellbeing Index 2005. That study shows that sole parents demonstrate the lowest levels of overall personal wellbeing, putting them at high risk of mental health disorders. There is little surprise in the fact that increases in income correlate with increases in wellbeing across the index. ACOSS itself has acknowledged the impact of long-term joblessness. Their <inline font-style="italic">Welfare reform: participation or punishment?</inline> paper demonstrates that people receiving the parenting payment are three times as likely as people in employment to suffer from depression or anxiety disorders. ACOSS figures estimate that 50 per cent of sole parents suffer from poor mental health. There are clear signs that we need to re-engage people into the work force. There are clear signs that we need to provide assistance for Australians to reconnect.</para>
<para>Australia is a country that is prosperous and generous. It is a nation that provides a wealth of opportunity for people. Australian governments have recognised that there are people who require assistance. We have one of the most generous social support systems in the world. Our system has been developed with an eye to supporting those people who do not have the capacity to work, but we must focus on helping those who can and want to work to make the transition to the work force, while providing support to overcome any potential barriers to employment.</para>
<para>This is about recognising the value and potential of all Australians. In particular this bill looks to make changes to the arrangements for those on the disability support pensionâDSPâand on parenting payment. It is important that we look at these two categories, given their incredible rate of growth over recent years. It is also important to highlight that people receiving DSP and parenting payments remain on those income supports for a very long time. The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations estimates that the average duration of receipt of the DSP is eight years. The department also calculates that over 80 per cent of sole parents receive income support. What the department is finding is that, on average, a sole parent remains on income support for more than 12 years during their working age life.</para>
<para>What are the consequences of such extended periods of reliance upon income support? The longer you are out of the workplace the harder it is to get back in. Not only do your skills need updating but your social interactions change, making re-entry to the work force that much more challenging. For single parents, being out of the workplace for extended periods of time raises significant problems when the child reaches an age of independence, and re-entry into the workplace becomes daunting and difficult.</para>
<para>While the Australian welfare system was designed when full-time work was the norm and female work force participation was definitely the exception rather than the rule, things have changed significantly. Thankfully, there are a great number of women active in the workplace. Employment is not now restricted to only full-time options. These changes mean that our welfare system can provide a great many more opportunities to assist Australians to make the transition from welfare dependency to work.</para>
<para>The Australian Labor Party have tried to argue that this government is making onerous demands on single parents and DSP recipients, so I think it is critical to highlight the following. Firstly, the majority of recipients want to work and want the skills to be able to work. The requirements that recipients of parenting payments are now subject to are far from onerous. Currently, recipients are required to attend an annual interview with a Centrelink personal adviser if their youngest child is between the ages of six and 12. Recipients whose youngest child falls between the ages of 13 and 15 are required to participate in 150 hours of approved activities that are not work focused over a six-month period. We know that, by international standards, this is far from tough. Danish single parents in receipt of income support have no special treatment or assistance when it comes to looking for work. They are entitled to one yearâs leave and are then required to seek work on their own. In Austria, Germany, France, Italy, Norway and Switzerland single parents must look for employment when their youngest child turns three.</para>
<para>The provisions in this bill, which require a greater level of participation in the work force, have a series of benefits. Firstly, let us be clear: by no means is the government requiring single parents to go unsupported into the work force. The two-year training provision provides assistance for parents to reskill and reconnect. It boosts the chances of finding income from work and increases the self-esteem of parents. Being a single parent is a tough job. In my later teens I was a child of a single parent. It is even tougher to find yourself in a situation where the children have grown up and you have few skills to fall back on. We want to break the cycle and set up Australians for success by empowering them, but it is important that the right balance is struck between assistance, incentive and obligation.</para>
<para>The change to principal carer payments requiring engagement in part-time work force participation of 15 hours per week reflects that the capacity of these carers to work is not at a full-time level, given their parenting responsibilities. Given the rise in part-time job creation, this requirement provides single parents with a great deal of opportunity. This demonstrates that the government is providing an opportunity for them to supplement their income through work, while not being deprived of government assistance. Single parents will have full access to employment assistance. This means that a new employment service, Employment Preparation, will be established to help parents, carers and mature age people returning to the work force. I have long been an advocate of providing suitable service delivery during this transition. I hold the belief that it is important to reconnect people with the work force and that this requires the highest level service delivery, coupled with assistance.</para>
<para>I am pleased to see that this focus is shared by my colleagues on this side of the House. Employment Preparation will provide specific assistance to individuals which is tailored to their own circumstance. This may involve career counselling, short courses for updating skills, addressing self-esteem issues or assistance with outside of school hours care and its associated practicalities. I am even more pleased to see that this program will be uncapped for those single parents who are receiving income support. There are a great many safeguards in place to ensure that sole parents have exemptions where necessary and that they be required only to look for suitable work, not work that is detrimental to the care of their children. These are the initiatives that this government recognises as being important to helping people make the transition to the work force with dignity and preparedness.</para>
<para>I wish to turn my focus to the disability support pension. The disability support pension has grown rapidly over the past several years. With nearly 700,000 recipients, these changes are sensible and fair. Those people who were receiving the DSP as at 10 May 2005 will remain eligible for that payment under the current conditions and will not be required to participate in the work force. Those who claim the support between 11 May 2005 and 30 June 2006 will be assessed under the current eligibility criteria. They will be periodically reassessed. Those with a work capacity of under 15 hours per week will not be required to seek employment. Those with a capacity to work over 15 hours per week will be assessed for an alternative payment, such as Newstart or Youth Allowance, and will have a participation requirement.</para>
<para>From I July 2006, new DSP claimants will undertake a work capacity assessment. Again, those with a capacity of fewer than 15 hours per week will remain on the DSP and will not have any work requirements. Those who can work for 15 hours or more independently of support, with up to two years of assistance, will be assessed for an alternative payment and have a part-time participation requirement. Let us just clarify what that means: it means 30 hours per fortnight of paid work or part-time work searching or participation in employment services or a mutual obligation activity. This does not lock an individual into any one option, but it does provide them with a choice.</para>
<para>I also want to highlight the fact that a safeguard will exist within the new arrangements. Should a person be unable to maintain their employment, they will be able to return to DSP within a two-year period. The focus here is on work capacity. I want to highlight the privilege I have of supporting an organisation called Ability Options in my own electorate. Let me highlight first that their focus is on ability, not disability. On many occasions when I have met participants who are working in open employment, they tell me they are all enjoying work and all its benefits and, let me tell you, they are some of the best workers that any employer could ever have.</para>
<para>Families want to provide a platform for their children that is positive and encouraging. People want to feel as though their contribution to society is meaningful. Individual and family development is bolstered when there is encouragement and empowerment. We are a government that believe in people and in their capacity to make a contribution and a difference. Above all, we are a government that believe every person and every family in Australia deserves a framework which helps them to achieve this. It is a pleasure to support this bill.</para>

<para>âI rise today to join other colleagues on this side of the House in opposing the governmentâs <inline ref="R2461">Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline>. Yet again, this is another bill which exposes just how extreme and incompetent the Howard government is in its handling of the most vulnerable of Australiansâin this case, sole parents and people with disabilities.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The nature of this bill is to change the eligibility for parenting payment and the disability support pension to make it harder for recipients to access these benefits in the future. The result will be that future would-be recipients will be put onto Newstart allowance instead, which provides a lower payment and carries more punishing, effective marginal tax rates as well as prescribing a whole new array of obligations that must be met in order for the benefits to be received.</para>
<para>This is the governmentâs much trumpeted Welfare to Work package, which is supposed to give people an opportunity to better themselves and improve the living standards of themselves and those of their families. The member for Greenway spoke before me, and I have no doubt about the sincerity of her commitment to seeing sole parents and people with disabilities enter the work force and better their own lives and those of their families. However, this Welfare to Work package does not help them, and that is the reality. It does not achieve the sorts of things that the member for Greenway hopes and aspires for her constituents.</para>
<para>This is supposed to be the legislation that gives people a hand up off welfare and into work. But a thorough analysis of the package and its ramifications, conducted by a number of key stakeholdersâas well as the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry which concluded recently and reported the other day to the parliamentâhas exposed weaknesses and flaws in the governmentâs package which will result in people actually being worse off under the new regime both from a financial and social point of view. And, far from assisting people to move from welfare to work, this legislation creates massive disincentives and setbacks for individuals and their families. In short, the governmentâs Welfare to Work package has been exposed as nothing more than a sham.</para>
<para>One of the fundamental weaknesses of this legislationâand there are manyâis that it is totally silent on the future of the 1.3 million Australians who are currently on disability support and parenting payments. This package offers them no assistance whatsoever to get into the work forceâas the member for Greenway wants them to doâand improve their lives. They will become the forgotten people, as the government creates a two-tiered system where individuals in identical circumstances will receive different treatment, depending on what day they apply for their benefits. So much for the governmentâs desire to help people get into the work force, and so much for its desire to address the overall skills shortage and projected labour shortage that this country faces, as we move through our ageing population.</para>
<para>The changes that the government proposes through this legislation are extreme in many ways. They will cut household budgets for families who can least afford it, they will not necessarily help people find appropriate jobs and they will not provide any incentive for people to work, given that those people who actually find work stand to be worse off.</para>
<para>We in the Labor Party support helping people get employment, despite what has been said by members opposite. We support helping people get into the work force. We knowâwe do not need to be toldâthat gaining meaningful employment is good for peopleâs financial situations, as well as providing the opportunity for self-development and improvement of their self-esteem. We also know that, if you are working, you are making a good contribution to your community, you feel good about yourself and you are also contributing to the overall economy. But you do this by creating realistic and meaningful opportunities in order to assist people off welfare and into the work force, rather thanâas this legislation doesâassisting them off welfare and into disadvantage.</para>
<para>Labor strongly believes that a successful Welfare to Work strategy, if it is to be effective, must invest in the skilling and training of the one million or so people who are currently on welfare, as well as those who will be required to enter the work force under this legislation. People cannot be expected to get jobs if they are not skilled accordingly. For example, the government should adopt one of Laborâs proposals to offer a training bonus as a practical solution to moving people from welfare to work. Our proposal for a training bonus will help cut the costs of study and transport for people wanting to improve their skills in preparation for work. You do not achieve successful reform by dumping people from one welfare payment onto a lower welfare payment, without providing support and real opportunity to improve their skills and qualifications so that they are job ready.</para>
<para>The government knows this legislation is flawed. It has already admitted or accepted that well over 200,000 Australians will be financially worse off under these changes, and only about 109,000 of these Australians are expected to find work. Of these, 60,000 are people with disabilities and some 77,000 are single parents. But what is concerning about this figure is that over 77,000 children of sole parent households will face reduced household incomes as a result of the impact of this legislation, yet the government remains unmoved by the hardships which await Australian families under its Welfare to Work package.</para>
<para>My electorate of Calwell is home to a very large number of welfare recipients, individuals and their families, who no doubt are going to suffer the consequences of these extreme changes. So it was no surprise to me to find out from recent NATSEM research and a recent ACOSS report that my electorate of Calwell will have the largest number of people affected by these changes in Victoria. Some 2,224 of my constituents will actually be worse off because of this legislation. In money terms that means more than 21 per cent of welfare recipients in Calwell are likely to lose between $29 and $164 per week because of these flawed and aggressive changes. On behalf of sole parents and people with disabilities in my electorate, I urge the government to rethink this Welfare to Work package and to get serious about implementing real welfare reform which addresses the reasons for unemployment and delivers practical solutions through investment in vocational education and training, rather than dumping people from one welfare payment to a lower one which, as we know, will do little more than reduce household budgets and compromise the ability of families to provide for their children.</para>
<para>I want to discuss my constituents who are on disability support pension because, as I have said, I have a large number of those people in my electorate. With regard to the disability support changes, we need to start this debate with an understanding that many people with disabilities who can work actually do want to work. I know this for a fact because a large proportion of people with disabilities live in my electorate and I speak to them constantly. I also work closely with organisations charged with helping these people find work. The reality is that people with disabilities struggle to find work, employers generally do not prefer to employ them and there is ample, documented evidence that proves the workplace reality for people with disabilities is difficult and unwelcoming.</para>
<para>From July 2006, under this legislation, all people who apply for the disability support pension will be assessed under a new capacity test. If they are deemed to be able to work at least 15 hours per week, then they will be put on Newstartâthat is, colloquially, they will be put on the dole. This is a much lower rate than the current DSP rate and these people will be worse off in many ways. My constituents are entitled to believe that the government is not being fair dinkum about helping them improve themselves and their earning capacities; it is simply looking for a cheaper way out of its welfare obligations to the most needy and vulnerable Australians.</para>
<para>There is a myth put about by many, including the government, that people on disability pensions are malingerers and welfare cheats. It suits the government and all those who are ideologically opposed to the idea of the welfare state to perpetuate this myth because it helps to justify the governmentâs extreme welfare reforms by playing on the misconceptions and prejudices of the broader community. The Treasurer himself conveniently referred to the so-called bad back syndrome in his budget speech earlier this year when he was introducing the Welfare to Work package. This is cleverly crafted language that vilifies people who are unable to defend themselves.</para>
<para>As I have discussed before in this place, those on disability support are not malingerers. Most of them are decent people, and the vast majority of those who are able-bodied enough to do so would actually like to work and to achieve the sense of purpose that comes with earning a living, interacting with people and learning and acquiring new skills. The reality is nobody wants to employ them. A sensible welfare to work policy would recognise and address the availability of appropriate jobs and employer attitudes. The government must match its rhetoric with appropriate and adequate programs that will train and support those disabled people seeking to enter the work force and it must also recognise the significant and considerable barriers that often inhibit a return to the work force by people with disabilities.</para>
<para>This point was made in the report on increasing work force participation, tabled earlier this year by the Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation, which noted that barriers to employment included negative stereotyping of people with disabilities, discrimination, inappropriate or inadequate assistance and support, lack of information for employers, poor job design and inflexible working arrangements. The committeeâs report also noted the evidence submitted by Disability Action Inc. which reaffirms the fact that people with disabilities effectively need adequate support in order to access job training and employment opportunities. Without that support they cannot sustain themselves in the work force.</para>
<para>In this legislation the government has not provided any sensible mechanisms to bridge the gap between welfare and work in a sustainable manner. The focus should be on encouraging, through employer incentives and other measures, the employment of people with a disability. It is no good saying that they have to work; you have to encourage the employment sector to employ them. For the sake of those people with disabilities who will be assessed under the new policy when it comes into effect, I ask the government to show that it is, in fact, fair dinkum about helping their transition from welfare to work. I certainly hope, for my constituentsâ sakes, that this is not just some cynical, cost-saving measure that will leave them and their families financially worse off and without any real prospects of gaining meaningful employment. But unfortunately, on the record of this government, I suspect that is exactly what my constituents are faced with.</para>
<para>Constituents in my electorate will also be affected by changes to the parenting payment. The changes to the parenting payment work obligations also provide no real assistance in moving parents from welfare to work and will only have detrimental consequences for those single mums or dads who will be forced on to a reduced Newstart payment when their child turns eight years of age. These changes are an attack on some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in our community, who are already undertaking the precious task of raising children in very trying circumstances. It is widely acknowledged that single parent families face a much higher risk of poverty than any other group in the community and as such need genuine and practical support.</para>
<para>The reduced payments and increased work obligations of the new sole parent payment do nothing to provide the training and other assistance needed to help sole parents back into the work force. It does nothing to improve the job prospects of sole parents, and it does nothing to provide the assistance they need to move from welfare to work. What surprises me about this debate is that it is also premised around another false stereotype: that single parents are bludgers. Single parents work hard raising and caring for their children, often holding down a part-time job and juggling their kidsâ schooling, sporting and social activities with the responsibility of putting food on the table while struggling week to week to make ends meet. This is a role which does not end at the childâs eighth birthday. It goes on far beyond that time, and these parents should be supported and commended for the task they are undertaking, not derided and punished.</para>
<para>Recently I met with the Council of Single Mothers and their Children, a community based organisation that provides support, information and aid to single mums. That organisation represents over 1,450 members and 120 organisations. They raised with me their concerns about Welfare to Work and its impact on sole parents. I would like to quote Jane Stanley, one of the representatives of that organisation:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">At best, the Welfare-to-work legislation does absolutely nothing to address the barriers which prevent single mothers from entering the paid workforce. At worst it is an attack on families who are already the poorest and most marginalized in the country.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">What I and many others want to know is: where in this legislation is the assistance and support to get single parents into the work force, and where are the jobs they are supposed to simply walk into?</para>
<para>The reality is that there are not enough jobs, let alone the jobs that offer flexibility to allow parents to drop their kids off at school in the morning and be home at night to help them with their homework and other activities. Because, let us face it, that sort of flexibility is rare, and in an industrial relations environment which the Howard government has now tipped in favour of the employers, people will be working harder for less money in less family-friendly workplaces and struggling to maintain that very important balance between work and family. With 130,000 unemployed single parents, the unemployment rate for single parents was at 12 per cent in July 2005âmore than double the national rate at the time, which was five per cent. Again, where are these jobs that single parents are supposed to go into? In my electorate of Calwell, unemployment has jumped from 6.6 per cent to 8.8 per cent over the past 12 months, so not only are there not enough jobs but there is concern about how an already struggling Job Network will cope with a dramatic increase to its caseload.</para>
<para>
<inline font-style="italic">Labour market assistance outcomes</inline>, a report by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, illustrates this point, with only 11 per cent of single parents receiving customised assistance from Job Network in the year ending September 2004 finding full-time employment and only 39 per cent finding a part-time job. So it is pretty clear that these jobs are very few and far between. But even for those sole parents who actually do manage to find jobs, there is an ominous fate awaiting many of them. A letter that was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on 27 October, entitled âWelcome, the servile stateâ, written by Gary Fallon, talks about a Melbourne company that employs process workers. I would like to quote from this letter, because I think it is very telling about the fate of the poorest and most disadvantaged Australians as they enter the work force:</para>
<quote>
<para>The company then intends to replace the present workforce with the same number of casual employees on AWAs and pay the absolute minimum wage that they can get away with, plus the basic statutory ... conditions. The higher pay scales, permanency, penalty rates, shift loadings and other benefits now enjoyed by this companyâs workforce will be converted into profit ... for the owners.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The letter also goes on to say that the owner:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... pointed out that in the area near the plant there is a large number of households containing single mothers who will be compelled to work under the changes to single-parent mutual obligation rules. Thus, to use his reasoning, the Governmentâs welfare reforms will deliver this company low-cost labour through compulsion.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This legislation does nothing more than cut benefits and create an underclass for profit-driven employers like the one described in this letter I have read in the House. This legislation, in addition to leaving sole parent families worse off, will also deny single parents the choice that other partnered parents have: the choice to stay home with their children as they progress through the critical years of schooling.</para>
<para>This legislation, coupled with the industrial relations changes, creates an appalling situation in this country where the poorest workers in our society will be forced into exploitation in the workplace. Make no mistake: today in this parliament we are being asked to vote on a bill that creates wage slaves in this countryâpeople who have no choice other than to work or face breaching regimes that could result in eight-week suspensions of payments and little prospect of finding anything but the lowest paid casual work, offering little job security and placing unreasonable pressures and expectations on their households and, in particular, their children.</para>
<para>The concerns I have outlined today have also been expressed to me by representatives of many agencies and community groups in my electorate. These groups include Uniting Care, the Salvation Army, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, Distinctive Options, City Mission Disability Services and North West Disability Services. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI lived through a period when I saw tens of thousands of people unemployed in Western Sydney. Nothing is more soul destroying for families or young people than not having a job. The Australian Labor Party were the government of the day, and the best remedy that Paul Keating, the Treasurer and Prime Minister, could offer at the time to protesters wanting jobs was to say to them, âGet a job.â There were no plans that were effective. The economy was in ruins. We have today an Australian Labor Party that would want us to think that they have reformed. I do not know how they can demonstrate that, because they have got to live down those records of the past.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The <inline ref="R2461">Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline> and cognate bill put into action $3.6 billion of remediation for people who have been out of work long term, who have disabilities or who are single parents. It is a program of support and assistance from which the government does not expect to see any economic benefit for some years. It is a program which seeks to establish a fair regime of compassionate support, training, education and assistance into jobs. Tony Blair has said many times that one of the keys to his success as a Labour Party leader has been to supply jobs. Across Western Sydney at this moment, instead of double-digit unemployment we have unemployment in most electorates of three, four or a maximum of five per cent. People are anxious to work. The prosperity is obvious. People are building homes, they are finding new schools for their children and they are planning their futures. The turnaboutâthe change in attitude and the dynamics releasedâsince 1991 has been massive. It is very interesting to see the increasing number of electorates that are changing their vote based on the delivery of services, opportunity, and prospect and future offered by the current government.</para>
<para>There are three principles that underlie the $3.6 billion program. The first is that people who have the capacity and are able to work should do so. The second is that the best form of family income comes from a job rather than welfare. The third is that services provided to people who have an obligation to seek work should focus on getting them into work as soon as possible. The most significant amendments in this legislation include changing the eligibility criteria and participation requirements for Newstart, parenting payments and the disability support pension; making private income taper rates for Newstart more generous; providing greater incentive for people to work and leave the welfare system so that the change from welfare to work is less harsh; and improving the suspension and compliance framework to encourage and reward participants.</para>
<para>This is what the legislation does. It is a balance between reward and encouragement. It must have both factors. One of the prizes for people who feel that they do not have a responsibility in society is to go onto a disability pension. That is for life, parked in a slot with no obligations to society and with no obligations on society as regards them. It is too easy. It is ineffective, damaging and destroying. I have a young man in my office who was for many years on a disability pension and he is partly on one at the moment. The change in his character and outlook from being able to have regular work and to study at TAFE is massive. His family cannot believe that he now has so much to offer where previously he had nothing, in the sight of many, to offer to society. I am so proud of his efforts and I am so proud that he has been able to take up the challenge. I believe there are many more like him.</para>
<para>A comprehensive work capacity assessment program needs to be established, and that is partly in action at the moment. It makes an assessment of a personâs physical or mental capabilities to fulfil a task. The establishment of rapid connect arrangements to more quickly link job seekers to employment services is also part of this legislation. A range of ancillary benefits will be available to a wider group of job seekers, such as the mobility allowance that encourages people and gives them a capacity to travel and look for a job. There is the pensioner concession card, the employment entry payout, the telephone allowance and the work for the dole supplement. All of these are adjuncts to the programs that are going into place. There is encouragement as well as compliance.</para>
<para>I think this program is something that many Australians have been looking for but we have not been able to provide for them. There are currently 2.6 million Australians of working ageâthat is, between the ages of 15 and 65âon income support. That is 2.6 million people, with only 15 per cent required to actively search for work. It is passive welfare. We are providing hammocks, not safety nets, and we need to do better than we are doing. As a nation we are falling down on providing people with opportunities. One only has to look at the change in the way in which benefits have been allocated over the last 12 months. In the 12 months prior to June 2004, 55 per cent of people who transferred to the DSP came from another payment of some sort. Parking somebody on a DSP instead of doing something of benefit to help them is not an outcome that is worth while for society.</para>
<para>In the seven years prior to June 2004 the DSP grew by 26 per cent and the single pension by 33 per cent. As of June this year, 705,000 working age Australians were receiving disability support pensions and 630,000 Australians of working age were receiving parenting payments. In 2004-05 spending on the disability support pension exceeded $10 billion. So $3.6 billion on top of that to try to resolve some of these problems is a worthy investment. Even if it only returns a little after a four- or five-year effort, it will be an effort worth making. We have the resources to do it. People talk about investing in infrastructure and that is fine in some ways, but it creates jobs for those who are already employed. Investing in personal infrastructure is what the government is doing with these measures.</para>
<para>The Smith Family 2001 report by Ann Harding of NATSEM found that three per cent of waged households were in poverty, compared with 31 per cent of those relying on welfare. Regular and ongoing employment is almost a guarantee against poverty. So it is not the payment of welfare that solves the poverty problem; it is the finding of a job and continuing employment that solves the poverty problem. A study done by one of the archbishops of Sydney found that it was not the amount of resources available to individuals but their incapacity to manage their finances that created poverty. Finding a job is part of that process.</para>
<para>The Australian Institute of Family Studies, in a report for the Australian government, showed that parents reported positively on the role of employment in the lives of their familiesâ70 per cent of parents agreed that work made them feel more competent; 84 per cent considered that their working had either a positive or neutral effect on their children. Therefore, the benefits to the whole family are obvious. These are things that we feel but seldom take the time to measure. Some measurement factors that I have quoted today are useful.</para>
<para>A University of Canberra NATSEM study by Lloyd, Harding and Payne, <inline font-style="italic">Australians in poverty in the 21st century</inline>, showed that around 41.1 per cent of unemployed people were considered to be in relative poverty, along with 17.9 per cent of people not in the labour force and 24.3 per cent of people whose main source of income was government cash benefits. Only two per cent of people whose main source of income was wages and salaries were considered to be in relative poverty. Those facts back up the whole process.</para>
<para>The Australian Labor Party are making some extraordinary claims today. I listened to the member for Ballarat and she seemed to indicate a wish to get back to the 10.8 per cent unemployment we had when Kim Beazley was the employment minister. She indicated that Labor would scrap the work experience programâ</para>

<para>âThe member has had a chance to remedy those things. Does she confirm that the Labor Party will scrap Work for the Dole? She deliberately misrepresented the fact that 27 per cent of participants of Work for the Dole were employed three months after completion of a project. That is wrong; the fact is that 41 per cent of participants of Work for the Dole are employed three months after completion of a projectâand this figure continues to grow. That 27 per cent is not the figure. I understand that the Labor Party do not like Work for the Doleâthey never have and they never will. That is obvious, and there is no substitute in their eyes.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>This takes the number of times Labor has criticised Work for the Doleâsomebody has been counting it, and I think this is fascinatingâto 397 since the program began in 1997. It is an excellent program. I have been involved in the hands-on program and its delivery. I suggest that the member for Ballarat get tightly involved with the committees in her area and use a bit of imagination and hands-on administration, and she too could have great results. This is an excellent program. Since 1997, 436,532 young job seekers have been helped by Work for the Dole programs.</para>
<para>Let us have a look at some of the other claims made by the Australian Labor Party. They claim that it is better to be on benefits than to work because the government is so lousy with its money. Let us have a look at what they are claiming. I will use some of the figures I have here. Let us compare someone on the minimum wage of $12.75 per hour and someone on the single parent benefit and the Newstart allowance for 15 hours paid workâwhich is the minimum. The private income of $12.75 per hour will bring in $191.25 a week. Income support brings in $247 per week, but under the Newstart allowance a part benefit of $134.95 is paid. Both the people I am drawing the comparison between would get family tax benefit A and family tax benefit B.</para>
<para>Of course the person who has 15 hours work would pay some income tax, but when you look at the total income that they can use per week you find that the single parent will gather, just on welfare, $433.13. The person who goes out to work has the benefit of $487.81. That is significantly beneficial. As well as that, there is an accumulation taking place through the employer contribution to their superannuation. They both receive the pensioner card, a telephone allowance and the pharmaceutical allowance.</para>
<para>The claim has been made that it is not worth working for that little amount of money. Come and have a talk to the bloke who works in my office. He stopped sitting around and found a future for himself. He has an additional amount of money and pride in his existence through having a job and being able to study at TAFE at the same time. Make the comparison between him and the person who does not do that, if you are prepared to, and still stick to your weak arguments that this program of $3.6 billion will fail!</para>
<para>Let us have a look at the difference under these proposals between the weekly disposable income of a person with no children, in receipt of the disability support pension and with no job, and that of the same person on Newstart with a job. Let us say that this person is on $12.75 per hour, the minimum amount. Of course, this person has an opportunity to work more than 15 hours a weekâthey are not going to stay on 15 hours a week for life and they are not going to stay on $12.75 an hour for life. They have an opportunity to go above that, as the bloke in my office has. The person on a private income working 15 hours at $12.75 will bring in $191.25 per week. On top of that, the income support, which includes rent assistance, will provide $168. They have to pay tax, of course, and there is a mobility allowance of $50.</para>
<para>The person on Newstart gains $296.95 per week. So what is the difference? It is $296.95 for the person on Newstart compared to $384.89âan increase in benefit of roughly $90 a week. In a year that is a significant difference. They are being supported, they are learning things and they are feeling better about themselves. And, yes, they are getting a superannuation contribution from their boss, the pensioner concession card, the pharmaceutical allowance and the telephone allowance. There is also a chance of earning more than $12.75 an hour or going beyond 15 hours. That is the rock-bottom minimum of somebody starting to participate in our system, and that is what the government expects to achieve over four or five years with the expenditure of $3.6 billion.</para>
<para>To say that these processes are harsh or that they are designed by people who dislike people with disabilities or who hate single mums is staggering. The claims of the Australian Labor Party that the expenditure of extra resources and the goal of participation and pride in success, both for oneself and oneâs family, can be presented as harsh and unreasonable defy description. One has to look at some of the claims made by the Australian Labor Party.</para>
<para>When Mr Beazley was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training we had a very unsatisfactory situation. I am afraid he did not apply his mind to what was going on in the Australian community and the needs of the Australian community. In too many instances his job creation record was poor. While he was employment minister, there was average unemployment of 10.5 per cent and peak unemployment of 10.9 per cent. This was absolutely devastating to families in Western Sydney. It was much higher than that there, and now we are down to rates of three, four and five per cent. Families are doing things, people are earning and they see a future. The lowest unemployment rate achieved by the Australian Labor Party was 10 per cent, in January 1992. The peak rate of long-term unemployment saw 329,800 people parked on unemployment. The incident rates were 36.2 per cent. That is the proud record of the Australian Labor Party. No wonder they are not believed in the community.</para>

<para>âWhen I listen to the government speakers on the <inline ref="R2461">Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2457">Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work) Bill 2005</inline>, I am amazed that they do not appreciate the deep passion that we on this side of the House have for helping people find work. Anybody who spends time in their own electorate, as I do in mine on a daily basis, would meet people day after dayâpeople with physical or mental disabilities and sole parentsâwho are desperate to work, who get up every day wondering how they can make that happen. When you look at bills called âWelfare to Workâ, you find yourself having a little bit of hope for a moment that perhaps we are going to be looking at bills that will actually help the many hundreds of thousands of people currently on welfare to find work. I deeply wish that these bills would achieve that, but we on this side of the House do not believe that they will.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Of the many people in my electorate who I talk to, some are sole parents without a car who need to find jobs close to the school where they drop their kids. I find sole parents who tell me that they would love to work but that, if they do go back, they will be financially worse off. If they could afford to be financially worse off they would go back to work, but currently they cannot afford to feed their kids, so going back to work and being worse off is not an option. I meet sole parents with 14-year-old boys who are at risk and who are getting into trouble and they are not game to leave them home alone after school. We all know that child-care facilities for 14-year-old boys are very rare in Australia.</para>
<para>I met a sole parent with a real dilemma. She had registered for child care when her child was born. The vacancy came up and she was offered it the month before she was due to start work. She could not afford to pay for the child care, so she had to turn the vacancy down. When she was to start the job a month later she did not have a child-care position, so she had to turn the job down. That is a standard dilemma in my electorateâwomen desperately trying to return to work who cannot do so because of the lack of accessible child care in the area.</para>
<para>I meet people with physical disabilities who are dependent on public transport to get to work. I met a woman with a mental illness. As long as she is taking her medication she is perfectly capable of workingâshe is even quite qualifiedâbut when she does return to work and loses access to the PBS she cannot afford the medication that she needs to keep her well enough to work. I meet mothers who have been out of the work force for several years who are lacking in confidence and with outdated skills who need considerable support in order to get them ready for work, let alone back into the work force.</para>
<para>If you dare call a bill âWelfare to Workâ, it really must assist these people, the many hundreds of thousands of people, the 700,000 people currently on the disability support pension and the 600,000 people on sole parent pensions, many of whom want to work. It really must provide the means for those people to return to the work force. But this bill does not provide assistance to these people. Instead, it assumes that they do not want to work and it creates a bigger stickâa bigger stick for them than the one they already have because of their circumstances. And why is this? It is because when the government looks at these people, these hundreds of thousands of people, it does not see essentially good people struggling to make a go of it. It does not realise that any of us could be in those same circumstances, that people do not choose necessarily to be a sole parent. Circumstances outside of their control can bring that on, as they can bring on mental illness and physical injury. Any of us, with the best will in the world, could find ourselves in the same position that many of these people are in.</para>
<para>When the government looks at sole parents and people with disabilities it sees bludgers. It sees 700,000 people on the disability support pension who are refusing to work and 600,000 sole parents who are refusing to work. Only if such people were bludgers, only if they were not willing to work, only if they had to be forced to work would this bill actually make a difference. Only if these people were not willing to work would forcing them into it actually do anything at all. But the reality for the majority of these people is that they want to work and the barriers are just too great for them at the moment. What they need is help in reducing those barriers.</para>
<para>When this government was first elected back in 1996 I came to the conclusion that it brought out the worst in usâit brought out our greed, our self-interest, our fear of others and our intolerance. It reached down inside us and brought out the worst. And then, after watching the government for a few years, I decided that it actually saw the worst in people. It saw the greed, the self-interest and people trying to rip off others. Since I have been elected to this House I have decided that the government actually governs for the worst elements of us. It looks at those 700,000 people on disability pensions and it believes they are all bludgers. The government has introduced a bill aimed at the very worst elements because there are a small number of people out there who could work and are not. There are a small number of bludgers, but you do not govern for everybody on the basis of the worst behaviour. You do not punish the good in order to force the worst.</para>
<para>In fact, it would be good to see this government start with the positive. Why not? Joe Hockey today said that Centrelink had called 300,000 people and 100,000 of those wanted to work. Let us start with those. Why not have welfare to work reform that actually helps the people who want to work? Why not start with the best of us instead of punishing the best of us in order to get at the worst of us? This government does this with all legislation. Whether it is super choice, the tax act or financial regulation, it always assumes that we Australians have to be forced to do the right thingâand the bigger the stick and the tighter the process the better. Whether it is forms that families fill in over their breakfast tables or whatever, it always assumes the worst about us and governs for our worst character.</para>
<para>The government in defence of this billâand it is really its only defenceâsays that the best form of welfare is a job. In Australia a job is not a form of welfare. A job is actually a thing of dignity. The current industrial relations legislation, which we assume will be passed in a few days, might change that for many Australians, but in Australia at the moment a job is not welfare; a job is actually a job. The problem with this bill is that it will not assist the good people at all. When unemployment gets as low as it is in Australia, you can assume that people are not working because of the extremely stubborn situations that they are inânot stubborn people but stubborn situations in which people have difficulty getting work, people are not skilled in appropriate areas and people do not live in the areas where the jobs areâand the extremely stubborn structural issues that keep them out of the work force even when they want to work. When you are in that sort of situation you have to assume that all of those issues are different, that one size fits all does not work and that you need sensitive and often long-term solutions almost on a one by one basis.</para>
<para>People returning to work after periods of mental illness or injury might, and often do, feel quite fragile. They might have several false starts as they return to the work force. They might move in and out of the work force, and they need to be able to do that. Under this legislation, if a person on the current disability pension or sole parent benefit manages to move back into the work force of their own volitionâwithout additional help from this government, I have to say, they are punished for that attempt. Many will fail the first time or the second time not only because their own bodies and minds might let them down after several months but because they might have a relapse, the stress might get to them or they might actually return to a period of more significant illness. Also, quite often the jobs that they get are not long termâthey are not secure or simply might not last long enough. But for these people who do make those tentative steps back into the work force the punishments are quite extreme.</para>
<para>I have recently employed two women in my office who have taken time out for children. When those people first return to the work force the time it takes to bring them back up to speed and the patience and support you need to give them is quite extreme. And for many that I meet their confidence level is simply not high enough for them even to apply. Their skills are out of date, their computer technique is no longer up to it, their speeds are down and they are not familiar with the current practices as well. Those people need significant programs to bring them slowly back into the work force.</para>
<para>If they return to the work force for a while and then need to drop out to stay at home with their children because their children are having difficulties, because their children are at risk or simply because as a parent they have no alternative for their children during school holidays, they move from the higher sole parent payment down to the parenting dole, the Newstart allowanceâa significant drop in support for these people.</para>
<para>For many people returning to the work force, there is a need for security. That security net that allows them to make false starts, that allows them to try, is extremely important, and the new system in this bill rips that security away. It removes from people tentatively trying to get back into the work force the opportunity to try a risky ventureâto try and move back into the work force when there is an extreme likelihood that they could fail. That is why in Australia we have a long tradition of paying higher amounts for long-term assistance. For many decades, we have paid higher amounts for long-term matters such as disability support, sole parenting and pensions. Short-term assistance like youth allowance and unemployment benefits are usually much less. We recognise that people with long-term conditions and long-term issues that make it difficult for them to work will need to move in and out of the work force perhaps many times because of their circumstances.</para>
<para>The government will turn that well and truly on its head in the next few weeks and rip apart what has been an extremely effective support system in Australia for many decades. And why is that? The government has been talking about welfare reform for years. It blames a hostile Senate for the rejection of its 2002 plans to tighten eligibility for the disability support pension. This has been on the governmentâs agenda for many years.</para>
<para>In addition to the fundamental unfairness of the proposed legislation, it is worth focusing on the welfare reform tests that the government set for itself. Specifically, the changes were meant to reduce the number of people who are already receiving welfare payments, provide greater incentive for these people to move from welfare to work and simplify the already complex welfare system. By its own test, this bill fails miserably. It will not reduce the number of people who are already receiving welfare paymentsâin fact, it completely corrals people who are currently on such payments. It leaves them where they are and, one could say, it traps them there.</para>
<para>People currently on disability support pensions will stay on the old system as long as they stay on the disability support pension. They might try to move back into the work force, as a friend of mine is trying to do at the moment after several years of therapy and drug treatment. If she moves back into the work force for a significant period and eventually relapses, which even her psychiatrist expects that she will, she will go back to the lower payment. I suspect that many people out there will be looking at their options now and thinking, âIf I take that risk and my circumstances change or if I have a relapse, can I afford to go onto the lower Newstart allowance, the disability dole?â Many of them will decide that the answer is no. Effectively, people currently on the disability support pension are trapped there by this legislation.</para>
<para>It is a similar situation for sole parents. Sole parents who form a new relationship or reconcile with their partners, even for 12 weeks, go from the current sole pension onto the new considerably lower one. So, again, we will find sole parents seriously considering whether or not they are prepared to take a risk with a new relationship and risk the financial security for their children.</para>
<para>Will the legislation provide greater incentive for these people to move from welfare into work? No. It will not be an incentive for those who are currently on a disability pension or for sole parents. They are better off staying where they are, on the current system. The legislation also removes the pensioner education supplement for new recipients, which means that people do not have the same opportunity to get training and education to move into better quality work. Will it simplify the already complex welfare system? It creates a brand-new, two-tiered system well and truly. It is not only complex but confusing.</para>
<para>Despite its so-called commitment to the changes, the government has been prepared to make three separate backdowns, as its own backbench react to community concerns about the harshness of the measures. Full credit to the backbench for doing that, because these are extremely harsh measures even after the proposed changes. The decision to delay taking the pension off a single mother until their youngest child turns eight rather than six is a concession that confirms that the governmentâs whole approach lacks any coherent logic.</para>
<para>The failure of the government in the initial stages of the legislation to consider parents of children with disabilities, foster parents and carers was extraordinary as well. It shows a complete lack of understanding that the vast majority of these people want to work but that sometimes circumstances make it extremely difficult. The so-called welfare reform package is confused. It fails to meet the governmentâs own objectives. It creates severe disincentives for people to move from welfare to work. It is manifestly unfair. It is not reform but punishment in large part of those who are currently on income support and who, because of their circumstances, have found it extremely difficult to move into the work force.</para>
<para>Under the governmentâs welfare changes, the income support paid to a single mother with two children will be cut by nearly $1,500 a year as a way of somehow encouraging her to seek work and give up full-time care of her children as young as eight years old. At the same time, the non-working partners of the better-off are eligible to receive up to $3,300 in welfare in return for them not seeking work and, instead, staying at home to care for their children. Under John Howard, if you are the non-working partner in a well-off couple, you should be supported by taxpayers to stay at home. But if a mother finds that, because of her circumstances, it is difficult finding local work and she prioritises being with her children above their being in constant child care or even leaving them home aloneâas I find people who are under difficult circumstances quite often do in my electorateâshe is well and truly to be punished.</para>
<para>In 2004 a single mother of two received two $600 per child family tax payment supplementsâa total of $2,400 in lump sum payments with no questions asked, no mutual obligation and no work test, just a bonus from a government buying votes in an election year. Give them money during an election year and rip it away from them in between. When it comes to the next election, I am sure there will be a few more little lump sums to buy their votes again. Give them money during an election year and rip it away as quickly as possible as soon as you regain power. In 2006 a single mum will have her income slashed by $1,500 per year when her youngest child turns eight. It will not take much to eat up that $2,400 lump sum payment at that rate. That is over $28 a week less to feed her children, even if she meets the governmentâs new work test.</para>
<para>Under John Howard, the welfare system has become filled with perverse incentives, poverty traps, disincentives to work and outright inequities. The Howard governmentâs economic and policy credentials in the area of welfare are in tatters with this bill, replaced with pre-election expediency and special deals for politically troublesome demographics. Give them money in an election year and rip it away in between.</para>
<para>Will these welfare changes reduce the number of Australians already on welfare? The short answer is: absolutely not. The governmentâs key economic argument in support of its plans is that the changes will provide greater incentive for people to move from welfare to work. This claim has been comprehensively rejected through economic analysis by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modellingâa group the Prime Minister himself describes as ârespected and independentâ. The NATSEM research shows that the two groups most affected by the proposed changesâthose on disability support pensions and single parents on parenting paymentsâare robbed of any incentive to work because of the higher effective marginal tax rates they now confront due to the governmentâs decision to dump them onto the dole.</para>
<para>NATSEM found that, as people are pushed from the disability support pension and parenting payment onto Newstart, they not only will suffer a direct cut in benefits of $46 or $29 a week respectively but also will be financially penalised for actually getting a job because of the different income-testing rules for Newstart compared to the pension. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI rise to add my support to the <inline ref="R2461">Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline>. I do so in a very positive and constructive way. This is a very important piece of legislation and I am very proud to be associated with it. At present there are three major challenges driving the focus of government legislationâthree challenges confronting Australia. One, of course, is the threat of terrorism, and that is the subject of other legislation. The other two major challenges that we confront as a community, as an economy and as a population are the ageing population and the continuing strong growth of globalisation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Let me briefly look at these two challenges. Regarding the ageing population, we know that studies by conservative groups suggest that within five years we will have at least 195,000 more jobs than we have people to fill them. It is a real issue and a real threat to our living standards, and we have to respond in a constructive and proactive wayânot put our heads in the sand. The other and related issue is that of globalisation, particularly the very strong emergence of China, India and some other countries in the region. It presents enormous opportunities, but it also presents very serious threats if we do not position ourselves as a country, as an economy and as a people to deal with these opportunities and these threats.</para>
<para>This legislation also goes to a related challenge. I see the challenge that we face as a country is that more and more Australians are beginning to lose the habit of self-reliance. It is a cultural problem that is creeping up on us and it must be addressed. It is, in part, a product of passive welfare. The low participation rate of people of working age in Australia compared with other major OECD countries is a reality. It is something we have to confront, and I suggest that part of the problem is that we as a people are starting to lose the habit of self-reliance.</para>
<para>This Welfare to Work legislation is part of a range of legislation designed to address the two challenges of our ageing population and the growth in globalisation. They need to be seen in the context of a range of legislation. There is no silver bullet that will deal with these challenges. We have to confront this in a comprehensive way across many portfolios. As such, the workplace relations legislation is a central part of this. It is critical to increasing work force participation. It is critical to the flexibility and fleetness of foot required for industry and workplaces to capitalise on the opportunities and to avoid the threats that confront us with the growing globalisation of our economy.</para>
<para>The independent contractors legislation that is in the design phase and has been foreshadowed is part of this pattern. Even something like the super drawdown for people who have reached the preservation age is another really important initiative as part of this matrix of legislation to deal with these challenges. The mature age worker $500 tax offset is another component, in tax policy, as is the senior Australian tax offset. All of these things make up a concerted attempt to deal with these challenges. The Welfare to Work legislation that we are debating in the House at the moment is very much a part of this attempt to increase work force participation, flexibility and the opportunities that are there for every Australian.</para>
<para>There is now a shortage of workers, not a shortage of jobs. This is commonly accepted. This situation will only accelerate with the ageing of the population. As I said earlier, there will be a shortfall within five years of potentially close to 200,000 workers compared with the number of jobs available. In order to meet the skill and labour shortages that the Australian economy will experience, we must ensure that as many as possible Australians of working age are able to participate in the work force to their highest level of capacity and availability. It is an imperative to deal with the challenges, but it is also an imperative for other reasons. At present the net growth in the Australian work force is 170,000 people each year. Yet it is anticipated that by the decade 2020 to 2030 we will have on average a mere 12Â½ thousand people per year coming into the work force, compared with 170,000 today. It is a very serious looming problem and the ultimate effect is an ever-diminishing tax and revenue base for our governments. This will seriously impact on the ability to provide a range of government services including old age pensions, working age income support, payments and health services. The genuine safety net that has been built up by successive governments throughout our history, which is a proud feature of policy in this country, is under threat unless we acknowledge and deal with this problem that is looming very large and is already on our doorstep.</para>
<para>This Welfare to Work legislation is part of that pattern of legislative response to deal with this. There are currently 2.6 million working age Australians on income support, of which only 15 per cent are required to actively search for a job. I put to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that passive welfare payments with no obligations lock people out of participating in Australiaâs prosperity and condemn them to a lifetime of poverty. Not only that, they contribute to this problem of a diminishing work force that is on our doorstep. They contribute to the acceleration and magnitude of that looming problem.</para>
<para>Despite Australia creating more than 1.7 million new jobs in the last 9Â½ years, the number of working age Australians receiving the disability support pension and the parenting payment has increased massively. In the 12 months prior to June 2004, 55 per cent of people transferred to the disability support payment from another payment. In the seven years prior to June 2004, the disability support payment grew by 26 per cent and the parenting payment single grew by 33 per cent. There are now more working age Australians on a disability support pension than there are on unemployment benefit. We have 705,000 working age Australians receiving the disability support pension, 630,000 working age Australians receiving the parenting payment, 260,000 aged over 50 in receipt of income support and 500,000 working age Australians on unemployment benefit.</para>
<para>This is not sustainable both culturally and financially. It does underscore in many respects an emerging cultural problem: we are losing the habit of self-reliance; we are losing the sense of self-responsibility. We are losing that great Australian trait of taking responsibility for ourselves to the best of our ability and of defying the odds and persisting. People need to be encouraged to help themselves to the best of their ability. Many cannot work; many have not got the opportunity of work. But we must do all we can as a government and as a legislature to ensure that people are encouraged to help themselves to the best of their ability. Passive welfare is undermining that objective in a very serious way. Something serious is happening which is not good for our country, and those statistics shine a very big light on that problem. In my view, those on the other side of the House have got their heads in the sand. I have listened to many of their contributions, and none of them have addressed this problem. None of them have provided any solution to this problem, this challenge, that we have. There is a critical mass of people who are reliant on passive welfare payments and it is starting to cause an emerging cultural problem in this country.</para>
<para>Australiaâs welfare system is designed to provide a safety net for those who genuinely need it. It is generous and it is well targeted by world standards, and of that we should be proud. This legislation does not in any way affect those who genuinely need the safety net. We can remain proud of it and we can remain responsible to those who genuinely need a safety net. But we are going to give some encouragement to people to help themselves to the best of their ability. Our system was designed at a time when most jobs were full time, most unemployment was for a short time and mothers and married women did not work. We have had the increasing availability of part-time jobs and the increasing flexibility of our work force, which was started by the other side of the House in 1993 with Paul Keatingâs changesâthose opposite conveniently forget thatâand continued in 1996 with further changes to the work force rules by the Howard government. We now have another body of changes proposed to increase flexibility in the workplace. All of that is driven by the reality of a globalised world. We are responding as a parliament to what is happening on the ground, to the imperatives on the ground.</para>
<para>Given these changing circumstances and changed opportunitiesâthe importance of and ability to provide part-time jobsâit is important that people with a partial capacity to work are encouraged to do so. Not only will the community benefit but also these people will benefit from the financial, psychological and social benefits of engaging in the work force. The best form of welfare is a job. We must never forget that. It is not a cliche; it is a fact. It is something that should drive our legislative response to these challenges. It underscores the Australian way of life. Employment also increases peopleâs self-confidence and self-esteem. It reduces anxiety and depression. It provides financial security and, more than anything else, it provides a sense of fulfilment to people. Having a job gives people the ability to do something constructive and make a contribution. This gives a sense of achievement which ultimately leads to happiness. No amount of money provided by passive welfare is a substitute for that. If we can encourage those who have some capacity to work to do so, we will have done a very good thing not only for the country but for those people themselves.</para>
<para>Research conducted in Australia shows that growing up in a welfare-dependent household leads to poor outcomes for young people. There are currently 700,000 children in Australia growing up in households where no adult of working age has a job, and two-thirds of those households are headed by single parents. We can encourage and make a change to that circumstance even with part-time work so that some of those parents can show an example. Most of these people want to work. We have to provide the encouragement and support that will lead these people to take up opportunities. In a time of labour shortage it is even more critical. Young people living with parents on income support are much more likely than average to leave school early, become unemployed, become teenage parents and end up on income support themselves. This is a well-researched and well-documented point. Young people whose parents work, even in a low-paid job, have the benefit of positive role models in their lives and fare much better. Disadvantaged families in which no parent is working are more likely to have mental health disorders, lower rates of immunisation, greater risk of juvenile participation in criminal activity, problems adjusting to schooling, a higher incidence of early exit from schooling and increased risk of youth suicide. It is a slippery slide.</para>
<para>I picked up a survey yesterday of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth perspectives. These were young people across Australia in our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The survey looked at the five most important issues affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people in their communities. One hundred per cent of them listed addiction and substance abuse as the major problem, 55 per cent listed crime and justice second, 42 per cent listed education third, 35 per cent listed physical, emotional and mental wellbeing fourth, and fifth was health and wellbeing. Four of the five problems go to personal abuse, substance abuse, addiction, crime and justice. This is a breakdown of community. What has been the problem? What has been identified as the cause of that? It is the cradle-to-grave welfare that is provided, with no obligation, to these communities.</para>
<para>Over the decades, we on both sides of this House have done a great disservice to these communities. The root of their problems is passive welfare. They have forgotten about self-responsibility and personal obligation. We have not learnt anything if we pursue this passive welfare approach across the rest of the community. Those arguing for cradle-to-grave welfare risk doing as much damage to the mainstream community as has been done by imposing the policy on the Indigenous community over the last few decades. We need to reverse this cultural trend. Laborâs answer is to throw more and more money at the problem, as if we have learnt nothing from the debacle within our Aboriginal communities. Labor believe that welfare is an absolute entitlement without obligations. Read between the linesâthat is what they are saying. They mouth all the platitudesââpeople who can work should workââbut they defy that prescription in their policy solutions.</para>
<para>The primary cause of low income is not low wages, but joblessness. The argument that minimum wages lead to the creation of a low-paid underclass is not supported by the facts. If people are capable of working, they have an obligation to work. It is good for them psychologically, socially and physically. Labor claims that people moving from a pension payment to Newstart allowance will be financially worse off. This is not true, because the majority of people on pensions do not earn any private income.</para>
<para>This is a wide-ranging piece of legislation. The two principles that underline the measures in this legislation are that people who have the capacity to work and are available to work should do so and that the best form of family income comes from a job rather than from welfare. Australians are losing the habit of self-reliance. We have to recapture the habit of self-reliance. These welfare to work measures are an important contribution to reversing this trend. No decent society forces those who are seriously disabled or caring for young children to go to work. This legislation does not do that. Contrary to what we have heard from the other side, this legislation protects those very important principles of protecting the seriously disabled and those caring for young children. But nor should a caring society hold out the perverse incentive of welfare passivity to those who can work. If it does so, it denies to those individuals a major source of meaning and satisfaction in their lives and risks creating a permanent underclass. If we do that, we not only let down the individuals in our community who should be given every encouragement to do what they can, but we also neglect the challenge that is faced by an ageing population which we must address and take responsibility for. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>âI rise to speak in opposition to the <inline ref="R2461">Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline>. I speak today on behalf of the people of Richmond to voice our grave concerns about how these proposed changes will severely impact upon their lives. The Howard government likes to call this policy welfare reform, and we have heard many speakers mention this today. But, after nine long years, we have come to know a lot about the glossy policy labels the government places on many of these measures. Almost always the detail contains a complex tangle of extreme legislative change, underpinned by a philosophy of unfairness, meanness and short-sightedness. And that is what is at the heart of this bill: unfairness, meanness and short-sightedness. This bill does not constitute reform by any stretch of the imagination. Just as the governmentâs Work Choices bill provides no choice for Australian workers, this Welfare to Work bill will not help people to get back into the work force.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Reform does not mean change for the sake of change. Reform means improving on how things have been done in the past, based upon new knowledge and clearer understanding. It means a holistic, considered and systematic change for the better. It is all about a vision for improvement. So when the Prime Minister talks about welfare reform it is in fact code for âpunishment of the most vulnerableâ, because there is nothing in this bill that is visionary. There is nothing about building a better society in which those who can work do and those who cannot are cared for. I would like to know, because the people of Richmond have put me here to ask the government on their behalf, how punishing the most vulnerableâand make no mistake about it: that is what this bill is essentially aboutâhelps our families and our communities. How does the Howard governmentâs brand of welfare reform make for a better Australia? What is visionary about this bill? What is visionary about cutting the household budgets of our most vulnerable families for no good reason? What is visionary about making 300,000 Australians financially worse off? What is visionary about shunting people from one welfare payment to a much lower welfare payment rather than providing real pathways to employment? What is visionary about making work less financially worth while by taking back more of every dollar that these people earn? What is visionary about all of that? Absolutely nothing.</para>
<para>It is true that those who can work should work. Nobody benefits from unemployment. We all agree that having work brings huge benefits to individuals, families, communities and our nation both financially and socially. We should never stop looking at newer and better ways to support people to get into the work force, to reduce unemployment and to fight disadvantage. But the Howard government strategy is to get out a great big stick and start whacking away at the most disadvantaged and vulnerable in our society. This government is hell-bent on rushing down the road of an American style welfare system in which benefits are low and the disadvantaged are driven into a new class of working poor. Under this new welfare system, individuals are no longer guaranteed a fair go and support. The tight targeting of benefits to those in need is gone. We now see that millionaires are eligible for thousands of dollars in benefits, provided their partners stay at home. Yet, at the same time, single parents and people with disabilities are to be punished by a set of changes that will do nothing to help them get a job. This proposed new system fails to deliver economically sustainable outcomes. We are seeing from this government a grand vision that consists of dumping 75,000 people with a disability and 85,000 single parents onto the dole, making them and at least 85,000 children a lot worse off. Is that really the best that this big, old and tired government can come up with? As usual, it has not even been able to provide a scrap of evidence to show that putting people on lower welfare payments will help them get a job. This is lazy policy development from an out-of-touch government that has all the control it wants but only archaic, second-hand ideas to deliver.</para>
<para>In my electorate I talk regularly with lots of single mums and dads, and they all tell me the same thing: they would love to find work and provide a better life for their kids, but they are struggling to find any work at all, let alone a job that can help them balance their parenting responsibilities. Not only that, even if they do find work, they cannot find any affordable child-care so that their kids are looked after when they are not at school. Under this legislation, a single parent will now be pushed off the parenting payment and onto the dole when their child turns eight. Adding parents to the dole queue does not provide them with support, such as training and reskilling, which they need to gain work. It provides no practical solutions and it does not assist them to realise their potential. Just like sole parents, many people with disabilities also want to work. They have a right to access work, and we have a responsibility to give them the right help so that they can be successful. My constituents are telling me that they already struggle to find an employer that will take them on if they have a disability.</para>
<para>This government talks a lot about family values and the important role of parenting, but this seems to be relevant only for those who are well off. While the government continues to reward rich parents to stay at home, it is obsessed with pushing single parents who are already struggling out into the work force. This work force will very soon become a whole lot less flexible once the governmentâs industrial relations changes take place. Under the governmentâs proposed welfare changes, the income support paid to a single mother with two children will be cut by nearly $1,500 a year as a way of somehow âencouragingâ her to seek work and to give up full-time care of her children as young as eight years old. At the same time, the non-working partners of millionaires are eligible to receive up to $3,300 in welfare in return for not seeking work and staying at home to care for their children. The hypocrisy is breathtaking.</para>
<para>The governmentâs key economic argument for these changes that they have proposed is that they will provide greater incentive for people to move from welfare to work. This claim has been comprehensively rejected through economic analysis by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, NATSEM. This is a group that the Prime Minister himself has described as respected and independent. Let us have a look at the NATSEM research. The research shows that these changes will remove incentives for welfare recipients to get work because of the high effective marginal tax rates they now confront, due to the governmentâs decision to dump them onto the dole. NATSEM found that, as people are pushed from the disability support pension and the parenting payment single pension onto Newstart, they will not only suffer a direct cut in their benefitsâ$46 a week and $29 a week respectivelyâbut also be financially penalised for actually getting a job because of the different income testing rules for Newstart compared to the tests for pensions. The NATSEM study also found that, if a person with a disability works 15 hours a week at the minimum wage, they will keep only 25c of every $1 they earn, while the government takes the other 75c. That makes such a person an incredible $122 per week worse off by moving into work under the proposed changes than if they moved into work under the current arrangements.</para>
<para>The Welfare to Work bill will actually penalise people for getting a job. The dark truth here is that the Prime Minister wants to take us towards this American style welfare system, where people are eligible for much lower benefits and are faced with very low net returns from any job that they get. Our Prime Minister wants to take us towards the creation of a new class of working poor. Under these changes this government is effectively asking sole parents to work for a return of $3.88 an hour and asking people with a disability to work for a return of $2.27 an hour.</para>
<para>This situation is indeed truly outrageous. This extreme punishment is made so much worse for people with a disability. As well as cutting income support, these changes force many people with disabilities to look for work. They are unprepared because they are not offered sufficient opportunities for training and skill development needed to help them get jobs. For example, only 7,600 new vocational training places have been allocated. For sole parents, not only is this government taking away money that parents use to feed their children, it has also failed to provide enough child care to support these changes.</para>
<para>The Prime Minister has given us his word that single parents will not have to accept a job that results in a low or negative financial gain once the cost of child care has been taken into account. Yet, after 10 years of deceit, his word is small comfort to many single parent families out there, and that is what many families in Richmond are telling me.</para>
<para>The hard truth is that there is nothing in this legislation that delivers on the Prime Ministerâs promises about child care. The Howard government is also leaving parents who receive benefits unprepared by failing to offer sufficient training. The reality now is that 600,000 parents will have to fight with 60,000 mature age unemployed for 12,300 vocational training places. It is no coincidence that these welfare changes are being introduced at the same time as the governmentâs extreme industrial relations changes. It is obvious that the industrial relations changes will provide employers with unprecedented power to offer cutâprice employment conditions to new employees, whilst removing almost all protections for new employees.</para>
<para>Those people most vulnerable under the industrial relations changes will be those filling unskilled positions on minimum wagesâthe jobs the government wants welfare recipients to accept under its mantra: âThe best form of welfare is a job.â This means that people with a disability and sole parentsâthose who already have very little bargaining power in the workplaceâwill have even less protection from exploitation at work. These same people can lose their payments altogether if they refuse to work under an unfair AWA, even if the conditions are totally unacceptable, such as allowing no flexibility for sole parents to spend time with their children.</para>
<para>Let us have a look at what we have got here: Welfare to Work plus Work Choices. Welfare to Work plus Work Choices means serious exploitation of the most vulnerable in our society. There is no doubt that these people will be like lambs to the slaughter. At the end of the day, this government is legislating to cut the benefits of the poorest in our society in an effort to force them into the labour market, whilst at the same time setting up a system designed to drive down wages and conditions. It is a disgusting situation, and it is not the kind of Australia that we want.</para>
<para>We are currently experiencing a major skills shortage in this country. It presents the government with a golden opportunity to assist people to move off welfare and into work for the economic benefit of all Australians. But, instead of strengthening the economy by investing in the skills, education and training of our work forceâby being a smart and great trading nation and by investing in infrastructure, innovation, research and developmentâthis government wants to strengthen our economy by punishing our most poor and taking away the working rights and conditions of our most vulnerable. I strongly believe that the people of Richmond and all Australians certainly deserve so much better.</para>
<para>I, like the rest of federal Labor, strongly support the principle of welfare reform. I believe that, as a government, there is a responsibility to deliver to the people of Australia strong, compassionate leadership on this issue and also fair, effective policies that encourage and assist people to move from welfare into work. Welfare reform of this kind is vital for Australiaâs continued economic and social prosperity. It has long been federal Laborâs view that the welfare system should be means tested and targeted at those in need so that we have a system that recognises that a job is the best outcome for individuals, families and societyâa system that never leaves people financially disadvantaged for finding a job and a system that helps people break down barriers to work, such as providing the skills and training that many welfare recipients need to help them get a job.</para>
<para>Unfortunately, the Howard government is not interested in these aims. Unemployment and welfare delivery is indeed a complex issue and it deserves a very detailed and sophisticated response from the government. Yet our Prime Minister thinks, âHereâs a magic quick fix: letâs just get out a bigger stick to hit people with.â When I go back to my electorate and I talk to families who are already doing it tough, do you think they say that they want their government to take us down the road of an American style welfare system where benefits are low and the disadvantaged are driven into a new class of the working poor? No, they do not. Of course they do not want that.</para>
<para>I am sure we all agree that everyone benefits when more people participate in our society, both economically and socially. We all agree that those who can work should work. But we also need to care for those who cannot. What my constituents say to me is that they want to see developed a strong, effective welfare reform package that addresses all these complex issues. They want to see a package that tackles the underlying reasons someone is not working and that delivers practical solutions. They want to see a system that gives people the chance to get the skills that they need. They want to see a system that encourages employers to give people with a disability the opportunity to demonstrate their ability. They want a system that understands that being a parent is an important job in itself and that work makes families more secure. They want to see a system that helps parents find the balance between supporting their family and raising their kids. They want to see a system that involves strong support from government in breaking down barriers to participation, such as skills, work-family balance and employer attitudes, alongside fair and reasonable requirements for job seekers, and they want a system that, at the end of the day, makes sure people get a fair reward for effort. That is what they are telling me they want to see. This is the kind of welfare reform that our great country needs and deserves and this is the welfare reform that Labor is advocating.</para>
<para>It is a type of welfare reform that includes people, picks people up and welcomes them to share in our economic prosperityânot one that leaves them out in the cold and all alone. To build a great and strong nation we need to get everyone on board so that we can work together to achieve great things. And this is not just about welfare reform. This is about the development and implementation of good policies across welfare, education, workplace relations and infrastructure. It means working with people in all aspects of their lives, across their life span to help them be and achieve the very best they can. This requires investing in our people and our country. It means giving our kids access to a decent education so that they can achieve all of their potential. It means making sure our young people are not leaving school with nowhere to go. It means giving them an opportunity to build their skills and get into vocational training.</para>
<para>In my electorate of Richmond, youth unemployment is at 34 per cent. These young people desperately need to have a future; they need to be able to access training and employment. This system also means helping mature age workers who have much to offer but who have been retrenched because their old jobs do not exist any more. These are people with great skills and great knowledge. It means a system to enable them to find work. It also means having a system that helps single parents to reskill and get jobs but not at the expense of their family life. It means finding that family and work balance.</para>
<para>This system also has to encourage those who need it to get involved, in the work force and in their community. It also means diversifying our industries and investing in our infrastructure and in research and development. This is what is required, not an extreme measure that punishes our most vulnerable but one that creates the basis for people to find their potential through adequate training and skilling. It is not one that disadvantages them all the way along.</para>
<para>There is much that can be done to build and make our nation a greater place and that does not involve punishing our most vulnerable. It does not mean destroying their lives and making it more difficult for them. I strongly believe there is much that can be done to make this country an even better place to live and we can become even prouder Australians with a fair go for everyone. Essentially that is what this is about. It is why I oppose this legislation, because there is not a fair go for everyone. It is extreme and it disadvantages so many people in our society. Instead, I want to see a fair and just system where people are given adequate access to training and reskilling.</para>

<para>âI would be absolutely the last person to rise in the House and suggest that the honourable member for Richmond was not speaking from the heart or was not sincere in what she had to say, but when one listened to the claptrap that the member uttered during her contribution one had to wonder whether some members on the Australian Labor Party side of the House actually understand how to run an economy. She seems to think that somehow there is a great money bin and unlimited resources. She does not seem to understand that the government needs at times to make difficult decisions to make our welfare system sustainable and to make sure that money gets through to the needy and not to the greedy; to make sure that, as a relatively wealthy country, we are, in fact, able to meet our social security obligations and, indeed, the obligations we have in other areas of government spending.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>One does not have to go past the first page of the explanatory memorandum to the <inline ref="R2461">Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline> to see that it states:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">This Bill implements the Governmentâs Welfare to Work reforms which are aimed at comprehensively rebalancing Australiaâs welfare system to make it more sustainable and to encourage increased workforce participation for those with the capacity to work.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The memorandum goes on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Bill includes a range of measures aimed at assisting and encouraging participation in the workforce, improving returns from work for people receiving allowances, a new compliance framework, and RapidConnect, which would require job seekers to register with the Job Network prior to making a claim for newstart allowance or youth allowance. The reforms recognise the importance of paid employment, whether full time or part time to each individualâs well being.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So, far from being an extreme and draconian piece of legislation, as the honourable member for Richmond would have us believe, this is a balanced piece of legislation brought in by a responsible government which understands, unlike its Labor predecessors, that you have to balance the booksâa nation cannot spend more than it earnsâand that responsible ministers are not able to meet every wish list of every interest group and of every person in the community. What the government has to do is balance the funds available against the needs of the community.</para>
<para>The member for Richmond also said that she would like to become an even prouder Australian and that we could make this country an even better country. I think the government would be the last to say that Australia is perfect, but certainly the Australia of 2005 is substantially better off than the Australia of 1996, when we inherited the keys to government. The best form of welfare is a job, and the best way to get ahead is for people to get out there and to find real and meaningful employment. This government has built job opportunities, increased the number of jobs which are available in the workplace, created the incentive where business is prepared to grow and invest, and caused a situation with the new industrial relations legislation where there will be new flexibility. People will get higher pay for more effort; people will be able to sit down and talk with their respective employers to work out mutually satisfactory arrangements. We are seeing a brave new world where Australia will be better off. So the honourable member for Richmond, after the implementation of not only this legislation but also the industrial relations legislation, will be able to be an even prouder Australianâalthough she has every right to be richly proud of what this government has achieved since 1996. I commend her for the sense of pride she has expressed.</para>
<para>Even though Australia is an extremely lucky country, it is easy at times to forget or to take for granted just how lucky we are to have a stable country, a strong economy, high employment, low inflation and also a very good welfare support system. None of these things happen without good government, sound government, responsible governmentâsuch as the government that we currently have. It could be argued by some people that our welfare system is perhaps too good. Some people suggest that in the pastâand even now, to some extentâthere was excess generosity and that there is not sufficient incentive for people to go out there and take the job opportunities which are now available. People are not always encouraged to get that first foot on the employment ladder.</para>
<para>There are plenty of anecdotes that endorse the idea that, if you continually give to someone who is in need, then that person will grow to rely on your handouts. Their life will become one of dependency rather than a preferred one of independence and growth. The two bills that we are debating here today are designed to help that general sector of the community that is growing dependent on Australiaâs welfare handouts to become self-sufficient and more self-reliant. The social security system ought to be a safety net and not a lifestyle choice. These bills are designed to reduce a financial burden on our welfare systemâa burden that is unnecessary, counterproductive and excessive.</para>
<para>The two bills, the <inline ref="R2461">Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2457">Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work) Bill 2005</inline>, aim to bring in the Welfare to Work measures that were outlined in the May budget. I have to say, and I suppose it happens with all governments, that at times it takes a longer than ideal period to bring in budget measures, but these measures are at least being brought in within months of the May budget being handed down.</para>
<para>Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, you personally may be interested to know that one of my staff members has relatives who live in Fiji. Fiji is a nation that is known for its beautiful islands, crystal clear oceans and friendly people. But it is strugglingâas is any developing nationâwith employment, economic growth, encouraging its industry and supporting its people. Members of the Labor Party might not be aware that Fiji has no welfare support system, and those who cannot find work must rely on relatives for support or must return to a subsistence existence of fishing and growing crops. Residents of many other nations also face similar conditions.</para>
<para>It is a source of regular frustration that many Australians are simply unable to appreciate by comparison just how good we have it here. Our welfare system as it is today is one to be admired by the needy in this countryâin fact, as Australians, we can take pride in it. We have payments for single parents, couples with families, the unemployed, the disabled, those going to school or university, those who are retiredâand the list goes on. These payments are legitimate to those in need and are designed to help them through tough times, but the reliance of some able-bodied citizens on welfare as their long-term source of supportâthose who have no intention of attempting to reduce their reliance on welfareâis an unfair burden on this wonderful support system and, might I add, on their fellow Australians. With Australiaâs total population of around 20 million people, it is a concern to think about 2.6 million are on some form of welfare to support their incomeâalmost one in eight of the total populationâand fewer than one in six are required to search for a job.</para>
<para>The two bills we are debating here are designed to usher in three foundational platforms. Firstly, those people in Australia who have the ability to work should actually work. I do not see that as being a terribly controversial proposition. Secondly, the most valuable and beneficial of incomes for families is that which is earned through a fair dayâs work rather than that which is received through government handouts. Who on earth could possibly object to what, I think, is a axiom of truth? Thirdly, welfare assistance that is given to those people who do not have a job should have as its underlining aim that of getting jobseekers into a jobâagain, hardly remarkable, yet we find that those opposite come into the House and oppose the very positive reforms outlined in this legislation.</para>
<para>Some members opposite seem to take the view that this legislation is in some way extreme. What an absolutely unsustainable proposition that these bills are anything other than moderate, reasonable and an important reform measure to ensure the long-term sustainability of Australiaâs welfare system. The need for these changes is underpinned by a recognition that the average age of our work force is increasing. If this continues, coupled with the demands on our welfare system, Australia will face significant economic difficulties in the years ahead.</para>
<para>As has been outlined in the House on previous occasions, the current net growth of our work force is around 170,000 per year and estimates are that this growth will slow dramatically to an average of around 12,500 per year from 2020 to 2030. If we do not make adjustments, it is not difficult to see the massive difficulties that this will cause. There will be a reduction in the worker base that helps fund the welfare system through taxation and reductions in general revenue for the government, resulting in significant cutbacks in service provision. The impact will not be felt for some time, but it will come down in a big way unless changes are put in place as early as possible.</para>
<para>As I said earlier, the government is strongly of the belief that the best form of welfare is a job. I have said publicly on numerous occasions that a worker gets much more than a regular income from his or her job. Not only does a person receive income to enable them to support their family; in addition, the employee gets the self-esteem that comes with achievement and they get the personal satisfaction that they are contributing to Australiaâs economy. They also get the satisfaction that they are providing for themselves and their dependants.</para>
<para>These are the foundational aims of these two bills: to build Australiaâs economy, to increase the overall productivity and efficiency of Australiaâs population and to reduce dependence on welfare so that we can prepare properly for the challenges that will come with our ageing population. These bills are not radical. These bills ought not to frighten anyone. These are bills which the government has brought in because it was economically responsible and necessary to do so. These are bills that preserve the underlying basis of our welfare systemâthat as a relatively wealthy society we cannot meet everyoneâs wish list but we do have the capacity to provide a safety net for those genuinely in need. This legislation is all about identifying those who are genuinely in need. It is all about weaning off welfare those people who are not genuinely in need or those people who have the capacity to re-enter the work force, receive and earn an income and in doing so receive the satisfaction of making a contribution to our nation and also the satisfaction of making provision for their respective families. I am pleased to commend the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005 and the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work) Bill 2005 to the chamber.</para>

<para>âThe name of this piece of legislation is quite intriguing: the <inline ref="R2461">Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline>. It represents the long-awaited welfare reform of the Howard government. But, if we really look at the detail of this bill, it should be called the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to a Lower Level of Welfare) Bill, because this 250-page bill is mainly about social security benefits. For 248 pages it amends the Social Security Act 1991 and the Social Security Administration Act 1999. On the last two pages it amends the Disability Services Act 1986 and the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Australians Working Together and Other 2001 Budget Measures) Act 2003. It is about income support.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Some members from the other side have claimed that this is really about encouraging people on benefits into work. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, in his second reading speech, quoted the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair. He is the person of last resort when the government wants to justify its actions. When the government quotes Tony Blair as saying that fairness starts with the chance of a job, all in this chamber could and do agree with that. In his second reading speech the minister went on to claim that the opposition refused to acknowledge that people on welfare have the same aspirations as other Australians. What a nonsense! In the main the electorates that are represented by members of the Labor Party have high numbers of people on the disability support pension or the parenting paymentâeither single or partnered. We do not have to be lectured that people on those benefits would like to be in the work force. We understand the benefits, not only in economic terms but in their psyche and their self-worth. So to be lectured in that way by the minister in his second reading speech is a bit galling.</para>
<para>What this piece of legislation does not do is provide the incentives for people to get work. There is a need not only for the work to be provided but also in many cases for the incentives for those who will go on to the new benefits after July 2006. The bill does nothing to prepare them for the next step from benefit to work. As must be emphasised, the main action of this piece of legislation is to take those who will go onto a benefit from 1 July 2006âwho in the past would have been on disability support pension but are assessed as being able to work 15 to 29 hoursâand place them on Newstart. It has to be emphasisedâand those opposite have to be reminded because most of them have forgotten, with one exception which I want to go to later in my speechâthat Newstart is a lower payment, has a harsher income test and is taxable.</para>
<para>These are the things that those opposite, in making their set piece contributions and in trying to justify their position to their electorates, are ignoring and will not emphasise. As is the case with the disability support pension, those who are on the parenting payment single pension before 1 July 2006 will remain on that pension. Those commencing a benefit after 1 July 2006 will go onto the parenting payment single if their youngest child is under six years old and will move onto Newstart when their youngest child turns six. They start on Newstart immediately, if they are commencing a benefit, if their youngest child is six years or over. Therefore, the Newstart benefit is less generous than parenting payment single and there are other disincentives in the payment.</para>
<para>In fact, if you look at the payment rate for those who have one child and compare PPSâparenting payment singleâto Newstart allowance, you find that the commencing weekly rate is $29 less. The amount of income that can be earned before payment is reduced goes from $76 to $31âso the difference is $45. In the case of Newstart the income support cuts out when private income reaches $426, while those on parenting payment single can earn $718 before the income support cuts outâthat is a $292 difference.</para>
<para>Many who have spoken in this second reading debate have looked at past NATSEMâNational Centre for Social and Economic Modellingâstudies and have quoted studies by Ann Harding and her colleagues. They ought to go to the study released in August, <inline font-style="italic">The distributional impact of the proposed welfare-to-work reforms upon sole parents</inline>, and another paper, <inline font-style="italic">The distributional impact of the proposed welfare-to-work reforms upon Australians with disabilities</inline>, to see an analysis of this change in benefits that should be taken into consideration. Those opposite have to understand the dramatic effect that this will have on people who are on these benefits and who then move into work. The decrease in the total income is quite dramatic and the change in the effective marginal tax rate, especially at the lower end of the scale, is quite appalling.</para>
<para>If you take, for instance, a single person with disabilities who, instead of being on a disability support pension after 2006 goes onto the Newstart allowance, you will see that there is a steady increase in the effective marginal tax rateâthe EMTR. With the DSP there is a cut-in point of about $75 through to 40 per cent after that, so if their private income is $100 the EMTR is 40 per cent. Under the new regime it goes to 65 per cent, and by the time they get a private income over their benefit of $200, the effective marginal tax rate is 75 per cent. So the government claws back 75c from every dollar of private income.</para>
<para>These are the changes that are really important and really bell the cat on what the intention of the government is in putting through this legislation. Whilst the minister, in his second reading speech, did not say that there has to be a change in the welfare system for economic reasons, time after time in support of this legislation backbench members of the government have talked about the <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational report</inline>. They have said that if this welfare system continues it will be a drain on the pockets of taxpayers. They are belling the cat by indicating that that is the main reason they support this legislation. Once you say that, you cannot then say that this is about welfare to work, as the titles of these bills imply.</para>
<para>In the contributions from the other side, because it is not in the hymnbook they are all singing from, most of them ignore the disincentives that exist to get people from welfare into work. I will acknowledge that the honourable member for Deakin, who has actually looked at these matters, did say that when you make international comparisons one of the questions that have to be asked is: is there something in the attitude of employers, especially as concerns people with disabilities? He went on to say that we must break down the barriers that employers have as regards DSP recipients. That was the only element in the main part of his speech that I agreed with, but that is the point that is correct. That is the point that we really have to look at.</para>
<para>It is intriguing that today the Australian Public Service Commission tabled its report, <inline font-style="italic">State of the service report 2004-05</inline>. On page 213 it has a series of comments about the employment of people with disabilities in the Australian Public Service. This government is introducing this legislation and beating the drum that it is important to get people from welfare to work for a whole host of good reasons, but what is its record as an employer? The Australian Public Service Commissionâs own document, which was tabled today, says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Over the past decade, the data shows a consistent decline in the employment of people reporting a disability as a proportion of APS employees. In absolute terms, the number of employees fell each year, before recovering slightly in 2002â03, and then declining again for the past two years. At June 2005, people with a disability represented 3.8% of ongoing APS employees, down from 3.9% last year, and from 5.4% in 1996.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So there was a 1.6 per cent decrease in the proportion of employees in the APS reporting disabilities between 1996 and 2005. The <inline font-style="italic">State of the service report 2004-05</inline> goes on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">While the decline can be partly explained by a reduction in the number of positions at APS 1â2 levels, where people with a disability were historically over-represented, the past 10 years has seen a decline in the representation of people with a disability at all classification levels.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">On page 214, figure 9.7 shows that dramatically, in graphic form. So much for this concern. If they are going to do things that encourage employers to take on employees with disabilities, they are going to have to do much better throughout the Public Service. I would hope that the ministers who sit around the cabinet table, who come up with legislation like this and proposals like this that were in the budget, will take that on board. That is a challenge for them.</para>
<para>We should not have to have the sorts of schemes that quite rightly celebrate the achievements of those employers who have gone out of their way to ensure that they employ people with disabilities. A couple of years ago I was quite happily involved in endorsing the nomination of Susan Fechner at Spotlight, Mill Park, for the Prime Ministerâs Employer of the Year Award. It is quite right, as I said, to have this recognition. In this case, Spotlight had employed seven people with disabilities over a three-year period. I met with a group of these employees at Spotlight and I have to say that they represented everything that people have been talking about in this debate. They really had increased confidence because their worth had been recognised and they were there in a job. One indicated to me that she was going to go for her car licence soon so that she would be able to drive herself to work. Many things flow from the rich experience of employment. Nobody has any beef about that. Across this chamber there is complete agreement. But letâs get down to the important things when we look at those with disabilities and those single parents who are on parenting payments. Let us look at what the impediments are for them in getting into the work force.</para>
<para>That is where I go to the contribution of the honourable member for Pearce, the first government speaker in this debate after the minister. Quite courageously, she revealed an attitude that indicated she understood very well the ramifications of this legislation. She indicated that she understood that the cut in income support was disturbing, especially in the context of her now being a backbench member of a government that is talking about large tax cuts for those on large salaries. She indicated that the government had had a real opportunity to look at this question of welfare and that it had lost the opportunity. Real incentives were needed for employers, and they are the things that should be supported.</para>
<para>As did the opposition, the member for Pearce decried the way in which the proper parliamentary processes had been transgressed. In the case of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, the process had been so truncated that its worth was lessened. In fact, a report has been tabled and we have not had time to go through that reportâthe report of an inquiry that was held over such a short period of time that there was no opportunity to advertise for contributions. These were done by networks and through email. But the fact is that still 60 contributions were made to the inquiry, and none of them was able to indicate how this legislationâ250 pages of legislation and 184 pages of explanatory memorandumâwas suddenly going to get people from welfare to work. Not even the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, in coming forward to the Senate committee, could make claims about that. As with a lot that we see from this government, they are unable to do so. This is a misunderstanding of the way in which people on welfare actually see that welfare. Of course to have people stuck for generations in unemployment and to have families that have not seen work is a problem, but it is not going to be solved by this legislation.</para>
<para>The other factor that is ignored and that has been ignored in the debate here is that this has spatial consequences: different regions of Australia will be affected by this in different ways. There is a very good ACOSS report, <inline font-style="italic">Who is worse off? The regional distribution of people affected by the Welfare to Work policy</inline>, which indicates that. I am glad that the honourable member for Solomon is going to follow me in speaking here, because he represents one of the top 50 electorates in numbers of people that ACOSS estimate will be worse off because of this legislation.</para>
<para>If we look at the seats in Victoria that will be worse off, we see they are the outer metropolitan seats. You start at Lalor and sweep around through Gorton and Calwell to the electorate that I represent, Scullin. You go down to the south-east, to Holt and Dunkley. We find that they are electorates that already have high numbers of people on DSP and parenting payments but, because of the way in which people are attracted to cheaper forms of housing, they will be affected by this. So what we need is support. People on benefits need affordable housing and they need support in retraining and gaining skills, but they do not need an income support system that drives them even further away from support. These are the things that are really going to be very important as we go forward. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI rise today to speak on this important Welfare to Work legislation before the House. I was interested to hear the member for Scullin mention the ACOSS report, which I will talk about later in this speech. The member for Scullin certainly displays that old handout mentality of the Labor Partyâso very, very sad to see. I believe that the <inline ref="R2461">Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2465">Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005</inline> are two of the most important bills for the Northern Territory that I have had the opportunity to debate since being elected in 2001. I want to start by saying that these bills perfectly highlight to me the profound differences between this government, a government that wants all Australians to get a job, and the Labor opposition, who believe that it is fine to throw money at people to keep them out of jobsâas was amply demonstrated then by the member for Scullin.</para>

<para>âThis government has a commitment to ensure that those Australians, and in particular those Territorians, who want to work can get every opportunity to get that work. Let us have a quick look at the differences between this governmentâa government of consistent economic growth, a government of ongoing job creation, a government of low interest rates, a government with a program of workplace flexibility and choice and a government that has delivered real wage increases of 14.9 per cent since 1996âand the Labor Party.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Since March of 1996 the coalition government has created more than 1.7 million jobs, the unemployment rate of 5.1 per cent is now close to a 30-year low and there are now more than seven million Australians in employment. Under this government there have been more full-time jobs created in the last six months than there were in the last six years of the previous Labor government. These figures show a government that is committed to creating jobs for all Australians. It is a government that is dedicated to the sustained economic wellbeing of all Australian families, and this can only continue through labour market reforms and through the welfare reforms that we have seen and are seeing now.</para>
<para>This is in stark contrast, of course, to the record of the Labor Party. In fact, Laborâs record in government says it all: a peak unemployment rate of 10.9 per cent in December 1992 and an average unemployment rate of around 9.2 per cent for their last two terms in office. That is Laborâs record of getting Australians a job. I was doing a bit of research today andâI am not sure if many members are awareâyesterday was the 15th anniversary of the announcement by former Labor Treasurer, Paul Keating, of the recession we had to have. Yes, on Thursday, 29 November 1990 the then Treasurer said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The first thing to say is that the accounts do show that Australia is in a recession. The most important thing about that is that this is the recession that Australia had to have, that the spending we had in the two years up to now was unsustainable, that we couldnât go on spending and consuming at the rate we were, carrying the imports we were, and the debt we were and, of course, the erosion on our gains of inflation.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">At that stage the unemployment rate was nearing 10 per cent and going up. We had interest rates around a whopping 12 per cent, a level of debt that left tears in most economistsâ eyes and a quarterly growth rate ofâget this, Mr Deputy Speakerâminus 1.6 per cent. Further, due to the labour market policies of the Labor Party the total number of unemployed Australians grew by over 460,000 between October 1989 and July 1992.</para>
<para>Of course, that is the difference between these two governments. This government is a government that wants to see more people in jobs and has the vision, the policies and the drive to see it through. Contrast that with the policy black hole that is the Australian Labor Party. This bill is designed to improve on the employment figures of this government and introduces measures that will address the future hurdles that we face because of an ageing population, demographic changes and continuing high levels of welfare dependency.</para>
<para>The remainder of my remarks in this debate will address the unique situation that the Northern Territory is placed in and why there is no doubt that this bill, and the industrial relations reforms, will significantly benefit many Territorians who are on welfare payments. I believe in a hand up, not a handout. I believe that getting a person into employment benefits not just that person but the whole community. In the Territory we face a unique situation. In my electorate of Solomon the unemployment rate is about three per centâlower than the national average. The unemployment rate for the rest of the Territory is about nine per cent, which means that the unemployment rate for the Northern Territory as a whole is 4.8 per cent. Why is it higher outside of Darwin and Palmerston? Because there is a higher proportion of Indigenous Territorians who have historically suffered from higher rates of unemployment. Indeed, the Chief Minister and the Treasurer of the Northern Territory have in the past argued that the real Indigenous unemployment rate would be 10 per cent higher than the figures show. On that argument, Indigenous unemployment under the Labor Party would have been around 20 per cent on their watch.</para>
<para>However, this government is about creating jobs in these regional and remote areas of the Northern Territory. As a complementary part of the industrial relations reforms and the proposed changes to the Aboriginal land rights act, the Welfare to Work package will create jobs in these regions of the Territory. There have recently been criticisms of the Welfare to Work reforms by the Australian Council of Social Service, as the member for Scullin mentioned, that the policy will mean less money in Indigenous and remote communities because welfare payments will be reduced if a person fails to find work. That argument does not wash with me. In fact, the opposite will be the case. These reforms will mean the creation of an additional 450,000 positions for employment assistance, training and rehabilitation to assist people around Australia in getting off welfare and into a job.</para>
<para>My understanding of economics is at times a bit vague but, as I understand it, if you have more people in jobs you will have more people spending money, you will have governments collecting more taxes that can be reinvested in the economy and you will have more money going into communitiesâall being driven by the reforms that the government is putting forward. For example, under the changes, businesses in the remote regions will have the flexibility to negotiate directly with workers to formulate an agreement that suits that business in their specific region. They will not be tied to the major centres in Australia such as Sydney or Melbourne; they will be able to negotiate flexible agreements that suit their particular location.</para>
<para>Mainstream businesses outside the remote regions will be enticed to set up operations in these areas because of the security of leases. Not so long ago, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs proposed changes to the Aboriginal land rights act. The reforms to the act would allow long-term leasing of Aboriginal land in communities and townships. If there were long-term leases, they would provide security for businesses such as butchers, bakers and market gardeners. Even McDonaldâs may choose to set up in these communities. At the moment, there are very few communities in the Northern Territory that have a market garden, a bakery, a butcher shop, let alone a McDonaldâs or an Irish theme pub. In any case, as businesses set up in these communities, they will have access to a ready pool of workers who live locally and who know the region.</para>
<para>These reforms will see young, single mothers across the Territory, of which a high proportion are Indigenous, being provided with all the opportunities possible to enter the work force. The Welfare to Work bill will see those Territorians on the disability support pension being able to get a job when and where they can. We have an untapped work force in the Territory that must be developed, particularly if we want Aborigines to gain better access to the mainstream economic system.</para>
<para>Once again, the approach by the government is completely contrasted by that of the Australian Labor Party, who believe that welfare should be handed out willy-nilly to all and sundry. They prefer to see a system where there is no incentive for the jobless to seek and gain employment, where the âsit-down moneyâ concept is retained and supported. We all know that that approach has not worked. It must change. Just ask Noel Pearson about the effect of welfare poison on Aborigines.</para>
<para>When I was first elected, all of the winning candidates were invited to give a speech at the Australian Electoral Commission offices about their plans for the future. I was interested to note that the fundamental goal of the member for Lingiariâhis overriding desireâwas to see a Centrelink office at Port Keats. That was his goal for the term. He succeeded: we now have a Centrelink office at Port Keats. But I often wonder: if that is the best that the member for Lingiari can come up with, things are pretty bad in Aboriginal communities.</para>
<para>Labor will of course protest and say that they have a policy that supports people getting into jobs. Fineâlet us see their policy in detail. What they have done in the past is a record of how successful any policy of theirs would beâand I clearly illustrated their record earlier in my contribution. With the industrial relations reforms, the Welfare to Work package and, specifically in the NT, changes to the Aboriginal land rights act, these bills and related legislation probably constitute the most important debates for me and the Northern Territory. These reforms will see more peopleâin particular, Indigenous Territorians but also non-Indigenous Territoriansâbeing provided with the opportunity to engage in employment right across the board.</para>
<para>I want to conclude with a quote from the current Leader of the Opposition. This is a perfect example of the difference between the current governmentâs policies, which deliver real benefits to Australians, and Laborâs failures. In this House on 31 October 1989 he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... we have been able to deliver on wages policy for one very important reasonâwe are trusted by the ordinary wage earner in this country, who holds his or her wage demand in check ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That has got to be it. Under Labor, real wages grew by just 2.2 per cent between 1987 and 1996. Under this government, they have grown by 14.9 per cent since 1996. That is the fundamental difference between this government and the Labor opposition. I urge all members to get behind these bills and support them.</para>

<para>âUnder this legislation a single mother is expected to work for $2 an hour. That is the brutal truth of legislation that the government says is all about encouraging people to move from welfare to work. Labor supports initiatives that encourage people to move from welfare to work and that improve the incentive to do so. But this legislation goes in precisely the opposite direction. It creates extra disincentives to move from welfare to work. It is punitive legislation and it puts the vicious nature of this government on display for all Australians to see.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Let me explain how a single mother is expected to work for $2 an hour. That is the take-home pay that she can expect to receive on the minimum wage when moving from the parenting payment into work, after taking account of the reduction in benefit as she moves from welfare to work, the increase in taxation, the loss of rental assistance, the estimated cost of travel to and from work, and work clothes. Those estimated costs have been provided by NATSEM and the figure of $2 an hour does notâI emphasise: does notâtake account of child-care costs.</para>
<para>This legislation has been designed by wealthy parliamentarians. It is a disgrace to this country that wealthy parliamentarians could design a system where single mothers, who have a responsibility for looking after their children and in most cases have been deserted by their partners, are required to work for $2 an hour. Yet this government has the gall to describe this as a welfare to work measure. It is nothing but brutal punishment of people for whom this government has no respect. Single mothers in this country do it tough. They deserve some respect, they deserve some consideration and they deserve some support in trying to improve themselves and some genuine reward as they move from welfare to work. Instead of getting that support, under this brutal government they are being punished. In many cases the effective marginal tax rateâthat is, the amount they will lose under these arrangements for every extra dollar earnedâis 75c. I find it sickening that there is a debate in this country about abolishing the top marginal rate of income tax because 48.5c in the dollar is regarded as a very tough marginal rate of tax, but for single mothers 75c in the dollar seems okay. As I pointed out, that does not include the cost of travel to and from work, child care, loss of rental assistance or any clothing that needs to be bought. That is the dimension of what this government is doing under this legislation. For people on the disability support pension, the rewardsâthe take-home pay from moving from welfare to workâare not much better than for single mothers.</para>
<para>We need to ask: why is the government doing it? The Treasurer of this country has rightly pointed to the ageing of the population and the need, therefore, to lift work force participation and productivity. Labor supports programs that are genuinely designed to lift work force participation and labour productivity, but these measures will not lift work force participation or productivity because, in the case of people on the disability support pension, they will be cajoled into the work force. With all respect to those peopleâand I have plenty of it, one reason being that there are many disability support pensioners in my electorateâthey are not the most productive people in the work force and they know that. So it cannot be on the basis of lifting productivity that the government is doing it. It cannot be on the basis of lifting participation, because the government is actually encouraging a shift not from welfare to work but from welfare to welfareâfrom one form of welfare payment to a less generous form of welfare payment. That is the real reason for this government introducing this legislation. The real reason has nothing to do with work force participation or productivity and everything to do with achieving some budget savings.</para>
<para>Let us understand these measures for what they really are. They are budget-cutting measuresânothing more, nothing less. So when the Treasurer and government ministers say, âThis is all about lifting work force participation and combating the ageing of the population,â they are wrong or they are not telling the truth. They know, as every Australian would know, that if you reduce the incentive to move from welfare to work you are going to get fewer people moving from welfare to work, and that is what this legislation does. It moves people off the parenting payment onto Newstart, the unemployment benefit, which is a lesser benefit. Therefore the government will achieve some budget savings. But, very importantly, the disincentives to move from Newstart into work are greater than the disincentives to move from parenting payment into work. The technical reason is that the taper on Newstart is more severe than that for the parenting payment.</para>
<para>Labor introduced the whole notion of reciprocal obligation. We do understand and acceptâin fact, we proposedâthat there should be some obligation on the part of those who are receiving government income support payments to reciprocate in some way, if they can, by participating in the work force to help pay their way. But this is not reciprocal obligation. This is not a two-way street; it is a one-way street of punishment.</para>
<para>Having established that the true reason for this has nothing to do with participation and productivity but everything to do with budget cutting, let me point out that, while the number of disability support pensioners has in fact ballooned over the last 20 or 30 years, it has since stabilised and there are forecasts that the rate of disability support pension is likely to fall over coming decades, so one of the major drivers of falling participation rates by men is set to play a much less significant role in the future. There is absolutely no doubt that this government is doing this for all the wrong reasons. What really should happen is this legislation should be withdrawn and in its place genuine incentives should be created in a bill for people to move from welfare to work. Those punitive effective marginal tax rates are stopping people from doing that.</para>
<para>I have already referred to the fact that single mothers would be facing effective marginal tax rates of 75c in the dollar. Labor, in the recent past, and I, even more recently, have proposed genuine tax reforms that would improve the incentive to move from welfare to work. For the record, one of those tax reforms is to increase the low-income tax offset from $235 to $625 and to phase it out not from $21,600, as is presently the case, but from $70,000. Treasury has recently costed that proposal, and the result of that costing confirms that this would be affordable in the 2006-07 budget. It would be a much better move by this government to adopt that sort of proposal, because by increasing that low-income tax offset and then converting it to a fortnightly or weekly paymentâeffectively a pay-as-you-go tax concessionâtogether with the tapering of that low-income tax offset from $70,000 means that there is an improved incentive for people on low incomes to move from welfare to work.</para>
<para>I made that proposal as part of a broader tax reform proposal in a prebudget submission. Such submissions were invited by the Treasurer from people all around Australia. That prebudget submission has been costed by Treasury. From documents that were obtained under freedom of information legislation, I know that the Treasury costings confirm that this sort of proposal would be affordable. I should add that also affordable would be a reduction in the 42c rate of tax to 36c on the way to its ultimate abolition. So for an affordable amount of about $7.5 billion or perhaps a little more, we could be restoring incentives all up and down the income scale. We could be restoring incentives for middle-income earners to do that extra overtime and go for a promotion. But very importantly from Laborâs perspective, as we do have a genuine interest in compassion for the poor, this proposal would improve the incentives to move from welfare to work.</para>
<para>This legislation ought to be thrown out in its entirety. The fact is this legislation was put together by very mean people. I say that advisedly. It was assembled by very mean people who could not possibly have any compassion for single mothers, most of whom have been deserted by their partners and are struggling financially and are struggling with the challenge of bringing up their children. Now they are being told by this government that unless they go out and actively seek work they will be dropped onto the Newstart payment, a lower payment, with a steeper disincentive to move from welfare to work. It is a vicious piece of legislation and it should be thrown out.</para>
<para>More generally, there should be a debate in this country about tax reform. That debate is being stifled by the Treasurer of this country. I do not agree with a number of the proposals put by Malcolm Turnbull but at least Malcolm Turnbull is debating tax reform.</para>

<para>âYes, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is the member for Wentworth. At least the member for Wentworth is actually debating and contributing ideas as to genuine reform. My priorities and those of the Labor Party do not coincide with his because he is so much more interested in abolishing the top marginal rate of tax. I find an extreme irony in that: that he would want to abolish a top marginal rate of tax of 48Â½c in the dollar but leave in place an effective rate of taxation of 75c in the dollar for single mothers. I would also point out, as the member for Rankin, that my seat covers most of the area of Logan City in which there is a very large preponderance of single mothers and people on disability support pension. I am proud to be able to stand here tonight and represent their interests and also their views that these measures are unacceptable and brutal and should be thrown out in their entirety. There is absolutely no doubt that the colours of this government that are flying high tonight are the colours of a vicious and mean government. This legislation should be rejected.</para>

<para>âI stand to oppose the <inline ref="R2461">Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline> and support the amendments put forward by the shadow minister. For the past 15 years we have had an unprecedented time of economic prosperity, mainly as a result of the solid foundations laid down by the Hawke and Keating Labor governments. But now we have the Howard government hell-bent on punishing those who are unfortunate enough to be unemployed, disabled or otherwise disadvantaged. The government spin on this punishing legislation is that âthe best form of welfare is a jobâ. Virtually every speaker from the government side has continually parroted this meaningless line. Of course people on welfare should take every opportunity to gain employment if they are able, but it should be meaningful employment without having the Prime Ministerâs gun pointed at their heads. The government spin hides the true motivation for these changes, which is to strip billions of dollars from the welfare sectorâand to hell with the impact on vulnerable people. The government also hide behind the one-size-fits-all mentalityâfurther evidence of their quest to cut welfare just because they believe in the American welfare system that leaves millions of people without any hope of a decent chance to secure even a modest future for themselves. This government will not accept that thousands of Australians who are disabled, whether intellectually or physically, are just not able to participate in any worthwhile job.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This welfare reform bill will ensure that more people will be reduced to living on payments as low as $200 a week, whilst only two per cent of the massive $11 billion budget surplus would be needed each year to prevent these people from being placed on lower payments. The so-called welfare reforms do nothing to help those people who are able to work. Reducing their payments, in an attempt to force people into jobs which, in most cases, do not exist, clearly shows that the Howard government is treating the most disadvantaged Australians with all the compassion of the Third Reich.</para>
<para>The Senate committee attracted overwhelming evidence that these payment reductions will not help people get jobs but will simply leave single parents and people with disabilities much poorer. The Senate inquiry proves beyond all doubt that the Howard government is guilty of the biggest welfare fraud in Australian history as, under this bill, the most vulnerable will be severely penalised by the most callous and uncaring federal government in this nationâs history. There is no credible evidence that reducing peopleâs payments decreases unemployment over the long term. Instead, jobless people will simply be less able to cover basic costs. If the Welfare to Work bill goes ahead unamended, single parents will lose $29 a week, because they will be on unemployment payments instead of pension payments, and people with disabilities will lose $46 a week. Time and time again, we have had the Howard government steering us down the road towards the American system, not only in welfare reform but also in industrial relations, education and foreign affairs policies. If the Prime Minister and his ministers think so much of the way the United States implements these types of policies, perhaps they should go and live there themselves.</para>
<para>ACOSS research presented to the Senate inquiry shows that, by putting people on lower unemployment payments rather than the current pension payments, this bill will reduce work incentives because more single parents and people with disabilities will face higher effective marginal tax rates. It is unfair that just because a single parent, or person with a disability, applied for a payment after June 2006 they will lose 60 cents in every dollar they earn when they get the job, while those on pension level payments lose 40 cents. ACOSS says that, rather than putting people on lower payments, to get more people into work the government must address work disincentives such as effective marginal tax rates and increase investment in employment assistance to give people the means and incentive to find a job. An estimated $400 million is required to restore the payment reductions proposed in the Welfare to Work bill 2005âjust two per cent of the expected $14 billion surplus in 2006. The figure of $400 million is an annual figure for the third year of implementation of spending and is calculated on the basis of figures from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations and ACOSS analysis.</para>
<para>The ACOSS research illustrates that countries that have had dramatic success in lowering unemployment tend to be those which have invested heavily and strategically in employment assistance for unemployed people. For example, Denmark reduced unemployment from 9.6 per cent in 1993 to 5.4 per cent in 2004 by spending three times more on employment training and counselling than Australia does. Denmark spends 1.6 per cent of its gross domestic product on active labour market programsâamong the highest in the OECD. Australia spends just 0.5 per cent of GDP on such employment programs. Ireland devised a National Anti-Poverty Strategy in the late 1990s which helped reduce unemployment from 11.3 per cent in 1996 to six per cent in 2004. It reduced long-term unemployment from four per cent in 1997 to 1.2 per cent in 2001. The Irish National Anti-Poverty Strategy resulted in increased numbers of people moving from welfare to work by boosting spending. In 2001, Ireland was spending 1.14 per cent of GDP on active labour market programs and had also raised the level of unemployment payments to reduce poverty.</para>
<para>ACOSS has been calling on the government to create and implement a national anti-poverty plan in Australia to tackle the combined issues of unemployment, poverty, homelessness, housing, education and other services. In Australia there are still many people who have been jobless for some time, despite relatively good economic times. The facts are that 330,000 people are on long-term unemployment payments; 800,000 children in Australia are growing up in households where no-one has a job; 700,000 people, many of whom want to work, are on disability support pension; and 600,000 parents, many of whom want to work, are on parenting pensions. The level of payment is not a significant factor in determining incentives to work. If a single person on an unemployment payment gets a full-time job at the minimum wage, their income goes from approximately $200 a week to $400 a week.</para>
<para>A Reserve Bank study of jobless people over time found that few people refuse job offers and concluded that a lack of job offers was the main reason people were still unemployed. The level of payment was not a causal factor in continuing unemployment. Effective marginal tax rates and a move in the Welfare to Work bill towards putting more people on unemployment payments will act as a disincentive to work. The taper rate at which payment cuts out as people gain work is different for people on pension payments, disability support pension and parenting payments than for those on the unemployment payments of Newstart and youth allowance. People on unemployment payments lose 60c of every dollar they earn when they work, while those on pension payments lose 40c. A jobless single parent who gets 15 hours of minimum-wage work a week gets a 19 per cent increase in income if they are on an unemployment payment but a 32 per cent increase if they are on a pension payment. A jobless person with a disability who gets 15 hours of minimum-wage work a week gets a 38 per cent increase in income if they are on an unemployment payment but a 52 per cent increase if they are on a pension payment.</para>
<para>Labor has called on the Howard government to offer a training bonus as a practical solution to move people from welfare into work instead of dumping single parents and people with a disability onto the dole. A training bonus would help with study costs such as books and transport for single parents and people with a disability. While Australia faces a skills crisis, the Howard government is stopping jobless Australians from getting the skills employers need. We need to be encouraging jobless Australians to gain skills so that they get off welfare and help fix the skills crisis, but the Howard government is leaving job seekers and the nation unprepared.</para>
<para>Under the Howard governmentâs incompetent welfare changes, when single parents and people with a disability are dumped onto the dole they will be refused access to the pensioner education supplement. This supplement acts as a bonus to working-age pension recipients who are improving their job prospects through approved training or education. Currently the pensioner education supplement provides $62.40 for full-time study and $31.20 for part-time study each fortnight. Blocking access to training shows how badly the Howard government has botched welfare reform. After all, a person only gets a job if they have the skills an employer needs.</para>

<para>âLast year Qantasâs net profit after tax was $648.4 million. In the same year, Coles Myer made a net profit of $678 million. These businesses are often held up as making a great contribution to the Australian economy. However, neither of these figures comes close to the contribution that carers make to the Australian economy. Many of us do not realise that the unpaid work carried out by carers equates to approximately $74.5 billion each year. Our carers are priceless, and I am fortunate enough to represent a community that has a great number of exceptional carers.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Community care agencies in my district have been running a very successful local campaign to raise awareness of the looming resource crisis in the community care sector. As part of this campaign, they have published a book entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Never Ending Stories</inline>, a collection of stories from local carers who, day in, day out, make amazing personal contributions to our community. <inline font-style="italic">The Never Ending Stories</inline> brings together the experiences of 26 different carers, and the blatant honesty of their stories is both refreshing and very confronting. I would like to share some of them. This is Valâs story:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">When my husband was diagnosed with an incurable disease it affects the one you love and you think you will spend the rest of your life with. Our life has been turned inside out, upside down and around. We can laugh and cry at the same time and, as a carer, I look into his eyes and I see the frustration as he is trying to tell me something that I want to hear. But he has no voice, his arms wonât move, his legs are useless, he can still smile. You want to hold him and tell him everything will be all right, but you know that canât be and that he canât hold you. Itâs so hard. When I read this story to my husband, we cried.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">An anonymous carer wrote:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I have moved away from old friends, lost my independence and my long companion, and although he is with me he is a patient these days instead of a husband and friend. I am happy to keep him here with me as long as I can get a day off every now and again.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Helen Newcombe writes:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">You eventually find yourself tied into a life controlled by time. You must leave work on time, you have a specific time allowance to get the shopping done or you donât eat and there is no spare time to do the little things like going to the library or just to have a coffee with a friend after work. You have no time just for yourself, and itâs like you are on call 365 days a year. Holidays are now a thing of the past.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Another carer wrote:</para>

<para class="block">We miss the things we used to do as a family, like going on holidays together and enjoying having a family social life. There was not much time to maintain social connections really. Our financial status changed as well.</para>

<para class="block">This is the story of another carer:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">There are many arguments and tears in the first few months he is home, mostly because you feel what you canât see doesnât exist. I expected him to be capable of more than he was able to do.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Sandra wrote:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">My role is different from parents whose main role is to nurture and help their children to develop. Instead, my role is to manage my sonâs condition and development. Having a child with a disability has opened up new doors for me. Skills that I have gained through having access to information, using a computer and discovering an ability to write have helped me deal with what life has thrown at me.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">These are but a few of the many stories that underline the extraordinary contribution that carers make to our community. The core theme of these stories is the desperate shortage of community care: shortages in respite places, home and community care, access to suitable accommodation and lack of support to carer organisations. The government has responded in the past two years with one-off payments to carers. Carers have accepted this money willingly, but that is not why they do the job. The money is helpful but what they are really after are community care services.</para>
<para>In many areas across our communities they are at crisis point. Cuts to the Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement and continued failure to take responsibility for young people in nursing homes, some of whom are under 10, are just a couple of areas where the government could better support carers. State governments, of course, also have to share some of the responsibility in terms of community care services. I would like to conclude by congratulating Carolyn Barrie from the Ballarat District Nursing and Healthcare, Jen Pollard and Deb Whitecross from the City of Ballarat, as well as Angela Taylor from Linkages and Bill Weidner from the Ballarat Hospice. Most of all, I want to acknowledge the carers who shared their stories. All these stories together make up the <inline font-style="italic">The Never Ending Stories</inline>, about the Ballarat carers, the people they love and the lives they live every day. Well done.</para>

<para>âWhen the veterans of World War I returned to Australia they had unknowingly created the Anzac legacy, which today still defines what it means to be an Australian. They epitomised the Australian values of mateship, patriotism, sense of adventure, courage, compassion and generosity. Two young and inspirational veterans of the Great War left Australia with another legacy: an iconic company which is also synonymous with these values and ideals created by the spirit of the Anzacs. This company is the second oldest airline in the world and, just last week, it celebrated its 85th birthday. Its company slogan, âSpirit of Australiaâ, conjures up patriotism and pride in each and every Australian. This company is Qantas.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I was honoured to attend the 85th anniversary celebrations in Brisbane. It was a fanfare of history, heritage and future plans for the company. This was particularly so with the newest aircraft soon to join the fleet, the Airbus 380, on display. As the member for Maranoa I have a real connection with Qantas, because its first moments in history were forged in several parts of my electorate. At the 85th anniversary celebrations the growth of Qantas was summarised: âFrom Winton to the worldâ. Winton was the venue for the very first board meeting, in February 1921, and later that same year Qantas relocated to Longreach. In November 1922 the first passenger flight took off from Charleville, bound for Cloncurry. This inaugural flight took two days to complete and included an overnight stay in Longreach. The total distance of the trip was some 923 kilometresâa trip which would have taken some 10 days, had roads been passable, in the motor vehicles of that era.</para>
<para>However, this first Qantas flight was three years in the making. In 1919, after returning from the Great War, Lieutenant William Hudson Fysh DFC and Lieutenant Paul McGuinness DFC were commissioned to locate a suitable landing site for an air race between Great Britain and Australia. After working together on this task they realised that to break down the tyranny of distance for people in outback Australia, air travel would play a significant part in the future.</para>
<para>These two men were backed by a prominent grazier, Fergus McMaster, who helped raise the capital for these two progressive and visionary young Australians to register a business name and develop a company. In Brisbane, on 16 November 1920, Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services Ltd was born. I pay tribute to these pioneering men: Fysh, McGuinness and McMaster. They had a vision and a commitment to forge new frontiers.</para>
<para>Today the name âQantasâ is an acronym for the original name and the company continues to remember its original roots and the Australian spirit in many ways. The spectacular sight of a Qantas Boeing 747, which today forms part of the Qantas Founders Outback Museum in Longreach, is a reflection of how Qantas has never forgotten its heritage. However, the true Australian spirit of generosity, compassion and determination are reflected in the decision of Qantas management to help Australians in South-East Asia caught up in the tragedies of the terrorist bombing and also the natural disaster.</para>
<para>Qantas assisted over 5,000 people, including holders of other airline tickets, to return to Australia from Bali after the two terrorist bombings. Transport was also provided to many more medical, consular, security and aid personnel to Bali. The Boxing Day tsunami also found many Australians stranded and yearning for family and friends back home. Once again, Qantas operated special flights to and from various countries which were devastated by this natural disaster to evacuate these stranded travellers. It also transported medical and charitable supplies free of charge. These more recent actions illustrate just how much Qantas reflects and resonates the real Australian spirit.</para>
<para>For Australian travellers on Qantas, there is always a sense of ease felt when you step onto that Qantas plane with its famous flying kangaroo tail to make the journey home. It does not matter where you have been or how far you have travelled, Australians all over the world call this great nation home, and of course they know the great safety record of Qantas will get you home.</para>
<para>My congratulations to all management and staff, both here and around the world, on the way they have upheld the visions of the original founders of Qantas: Fysh, McGuinness and McMaster. May their passion for flying live through Qantas forever.</para>

</talker>
<para>âI rise this evening to remember those who have been forgotten in the current debate about education standards. The Minister for Education, Science and Training is obsessed with assessment, national curriculum and elite universities, but what about teachers? They are pretty central to the education system. Teachers carry the most important responsibilities in our society: they are helping young people to achieve their full potential, to the benefit of all in the community, and they are creating the wealth and opportunities for young people of the future.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I think it is about time the government went back to basics. The research shows that a good education comes as a result of good teachers. Dr Kenneth Rowe, Principal Research Fellow at the Australian Council for Educational Research, describes emphasis on âmiddle-class curriculaâ as âpost-modernist claptrapâ. He urges a focus on what matters mostâthat is, quality teachers supported by strategic professional development. Dr Rowe says the focus has been on school structures, which account for less than 15 per cent of the variance in measures of student achievement. The minister complains about the quality of teacher training. But it has taken nine long years for this government to commit $30 million to it, only after it had stripped the university system of billions of dollars.</para>
<para>The New South Wales government has diverted scarce state resources into retraining and accelerated teacher training through scholarshipsâareas that should have been funded by the Commonwealth. The Victorian government is subsidising teacher training from industry. Teachers, in my humble view, are underpaid, overworked and stressed more than ever. A recent survey by the Australian Education Union of more than 600 first-year teachers reveals a worrying level of disillusionmentâa real problem for the Australian community. One young teacher told the AEU: âIt is difficult to sustain the energy, the workload keeps increasing and I am increasingly teaching out of my area and not enjoying that experience.â</para>
<para>Teachers may enter the profession on what we might regard as a competitive salary of $46,127 per annum but, after a short period, there is little incentive to stay when the best, most experienced teachers can only achieve a maximum salary of $65,414 per year. Unlike the top end of the Public Service, where the salaries are rising in competition with the private sector, those who are most critical to a well-functioning and decent societyâteachers, nurses and policeâare being left behind, as is also the case with firefighters.</para>
<para>How will current teacher shortages be met when young teachers are already disillusioned and around 50 per cent of teachers are now over 45 years of age? That is a real problem in terms of the regeneration of our teaching work force. It is also hard to see how teachers will be attracted and retained when they witness the disillusionment of their principals. More than 500 of them told a recent AEU survey that they were disillusioned with the increasing workload.</para>
<para>A major report by the Victorian Department of Education and Training, aptly entitled <inline font-style="italic">The privilege and the price</inline>, also paints a bleak picture of the health and wellbeing of the stateâs principals. In the past three years there has been a steady increase in the number of hours worked and 70 per cent of principals said that their workload had increased substantially. The result is that fewer people are applying for the position of principal. This illustrates that across the teaching profession, from young teachers to principals, there is a crisis of morale and commitment. I am not talking about a commitment to teaching but about a commitment in terms of just how far they can go to try to make the system work. But all the Howard government is interested in is blatant inequity. It is supporting the wealthy private schools at double the rate of government schools.</para>
<para>What we need is a government that will invest in teachers, not just in better teacher training but in professional development, improved pay and far less bureaucracy. It is about time we were as passionate about the need to improve the quality of teaching as teachers are about the profession that they pursue. It might also be appropriate for us to start thinking about some of the old ways, where people used to compete for teacher scholarships, where the government paid the HECS fees and actually assisted with the education and the purchase of the books during their training. It worked in those days and we had people wanting to be teachers because it was competitive and interesting.</para>
<para>I simply recommend to the House this evening: letâs start focusing on the need to improve the quality and opportunities of the teaching forces throughout Australia at a state and territory level by a new partnership agreement between the Commonwealth government and the state and territory governments to teach our community that teachers are part of the leadership and that we are required to create opportunities for the future. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para class="block">No matter how many wind turbines the Bracks Government wants to disfigure the state with, we are still going to require coal-fired power stations to run in spinning reserve.</para>

</quote>
<para class="block">All power to your arm, Craig Falconer from Dollar in South Gippsland. As a response to wind turbines being placed, even on the Molonglo Hills in this region, there is a lot of opposition to them. I am representing the opposition that is coming out of my electorate in South Gippsland. I am concerned for the amenity of the people and the preservation of the landscape. The Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell, has been addressing this issue and he has written to Steve Bracks, and I am sure to the other state and territory leaders, proposing an agreement to develop a national code for the location of wind farms. He says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">A key component of this code should be an agreement that wind farms not be constructed against the wishes of the local community that will be most affected.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He continues:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I am most concerned that members of local communities are often being given only limited involvement in determining if a wind farm is to be established in the area. While wind technology is a part of the portfolio of power sources that the world needs to combat greenhouse gas emissions, it is vital that local communities, including those in often sensitive and scenic coastal areasâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">that is what I am talking aboutâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">do not have wind farms thrust upon them. If such action continues to be taken it will make wind farms increasingly unpopular and this will create animosity towards wind energy and be counterproductive to all our interests. I believe that we need a truly inclusive and consultative local planning process.</para>
<para class="block">As you would be aware, the EPBC Act currently allows me to regulate to define specified actions as requiring referral under the Act. Because I am so concerned about the growth in negative sentiment toward wind energy which is occurring as wind farms are established against the express views of the democratically elected councils, I am considering making a new regulation under the EPBC Act in relation to wind farms. This regulation would require all proposed wind farms to be referred under the EPBC Act.</para>
<para class="block">As you know, economic and social factors such as views of local councils and their communities would be relevant considerations in any decision I make to approve any wind farm following assessment. I would certainly be reluctant to approve a wind farm in the face of clear local opposition expressed through votes of shire councils.</para>
<para class="block">I also intend to examine my programmes to consider future funding arrangements for those wind projects that are clearly against the expressed wishes of the local community.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">There it is. I have called today for the Bracks government to accept the ministerâs opportunity and grab hold of this proposal for a national code for the location of wind farms.</para>
<para>I do not like wind turbines. I do not like what they do to the landscape and I find that they are an inefficient renewable energy proposal. In fact, I would go so far as to say I will never offer South Gippsland as the sacrificial lamb to the gargantuan appetite of the feckless, burping juggernaut that the wind industry is.</para>

I will not sacrifice the exquisite South Gippsland coastline on the altar of renewable energy. It is becoming a passion for me now that inappropriately placed wind turbine developments are industrial sites that are being placed close to our coastlines. They are not majestic to me; they are ugly. They are not the best form of renewable energy; they are inefficient. They disrupt power systems, as we have seen in New Zealand where they have virtually said, âThis is driving us mad.â We have come to a time now where we have to be very careful about what we put up in this generation, live with for a generation and will take a generation to tear down. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âTonight I wish to raise in the House the case of Mr and Mrs Li, residents of Blacktown, who are facing deportation to China. Mr and Mrs Li escaped China in 2000, fleeing persecution as members of Falun Gong. Their application for asylum in Australia has been rejected. The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Cobb, has declined to intervene in this case and grant them permanent residency.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I want to stress that I have no particular quarrel with Minister Cobb in this regard. He has a very tough job to do. Many people can and do claim that they will be persecuted if they are forced to return to their country of origin. The minister needs to weigh up each of these claims, and this is not an easy task. He needs to sort the wheat from the chaff and sort out which applications are genuine and which are not. As I stress, it is not an easy job. However, I do implore the minister to change the decision to reject this claim and grant Mr and Mrs Li permanent residency. It is not just Mr and Mrs Li who say they will be persecuted if they have to return to China. Various independent, credible groups have outlined the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners in China. These include Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.</para>
<para>There is also a fairly recent example of what can happen in cases very similar to this. Germany recently deported Mr Jiang Renzheng and his wife, Mrs Guo Rui. The German government were of the view that they were not senior enough to be persecuted if they returned to Chinaâthat they were low-level practitioners of Falun Gong and that they would not be likely to be persecuted. So they deported them back to China. On their return to China on 8 April, Mr Renzheng was arrested and sentenced to three years in a labour camp. The German government are now making desperate attempts to get them returned to Germany.</para>
<para>Having seen this example of what can happen in circumstances like this, I would implore the minister to reconsider his decision, to examine this German case and to reflect sympathetically on the request of Mr and Mrs Li to remain in Australia. They have been granted a temporary extension to their visas and they are now due to return to China on 8 January 2006. But time is ticking on. We recently saw, of course, the application for asylum in Australia of the former Chinese diplomat Mr Chen Yonglin. Mr Yonglin, who was granted asylum after some consideration by the government, identified persecution of practitioners of Falun Gong as one of his roles, one of his jobs, as a functionary of the Chinese government. I think this is something which needs to be taken into account by the government. We have Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, various independent assessments of the persecution of practitioners of Falun Gong and now we have Mr Chen Yonglin. Some estimates put the death toll of Falun Gong practitioners as high as 2,780 in China.</para>
<para>I am sure no member of the House would like to see a situation where we had the chance to help Mr and Mrs Li and we sent them back to China and an unfortunate fate awaited them. We have a chance to help them. Minister Cobb needs to reflect on his decision. I recognise this is a complex case. I recognise that Mr and Mrs Li have pursued their opportunities through the courts and have failed, and now their only hope lies with Minister Cobb. Minister Cobb has a very responsible position in this regardâhe is now responsible for deciding whether to return them to China and to leave them in the hands of the Chinese government, with a questionable at best fate, or to grant them permanent residency in Australia. I would implore him to reflect on his decision and grant them permanent residencyâas I think there is eminently justifiable evidence to doâto allow them to live in freedom and not put them at risk of persecution should they be forced to return to China.</para>

<para>âAs the hundreds of school graduates from my electorate in Bowman are currently enjoying the great range of entertainment that is available to students and school leavers along the south-eastern Queensland coast, I know that all of them are thinking about the work, apprenticeship, study, vocational training and travel options available to them. I know that they all have just completed an extremely demanding final year at high school, and I was privileged at each of their speech nights to acknowledge that by inaugurating a Quiet Achiever Award in each of the schools in my electorate. Tonight I would like to acknowledge the fine achievements attributed to those who won the award for the quiet achiever in each of the high schools.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Those winners included Lauren Wuoti of Chisholm Catholic College. The speech night at the Logan Cultural Centre was a wonderful evening, and Lauren was warmly and enthusiastically acknowledged for her achievement. The popular Jason Nankervis from Cleveland District State High School was acknowledged at the Smith Street Community Hall at their speech night, which was a packed-out evening. There was Jacqueline Macedo of Kimberly College, again at the Logan community cultural centre. This was followed by the school musical and, of course, her headmasterâs speech, which proclaimed the virtues of the Finnish education system.</para>
<para>At the Ormiston College graduation night at the Sleeman Centre in the seat of Bonner, my neighbouring seatâacross those soporific undulations which one has to travel to get to the Sleeman CentreâDuncan Fox was acknowledged and given the Quiet Achiever Award, followed by a fantastic graduation address by former Victorian Premier, Jeff Kennett. Claire Marshall of Redlands College was the worthy recipient at the Redlands College speech night at the Christian Outreach Centre main auditorium. Minandi De Wilzem of Victoria Point State High School won the Quiet Achiever Award, and she is a South African permanent resident whose parents are only recent arrivals to Australia. Already Minandi has made an extraordinary contribution to Victoria Point State High School in her final year.</para>
<para>Jonathan McCallum was welcomed with great approbation from parents and students alike when he won the award at Wellington Point State High School. Jessica Ellmers of Alexandra Hills State High School was presented with the schoolâs Volunteer Award by Mr Andrew Trim in my absence while in parliament. Finally, Michelle Day of Faith Lutheran College received the Service and Loyalty Award, presented by Mr Malcolm Cayley, again in my absence due to parliamentary commitments.</para>
<para>Each of these students, among other colleagues as well, have made extraordinary contributions both to their school and to their community. The intention of the Quiet Achiever Award was to recognise more than just conventional achievement in academic, sport and cultural areas and to recognise those that went beyond the school to make contributions to their community. I congratulate all graduating students from the seat of Bowman and particularly the winners of the Quiet Achiever Award. They received, in addition to certificates, leading autobiographies from the year in which those awards were made, and they will enter the community with numerous challenges.</para>
<para>I can never say that I will know the challenges that a 17-year-old faces in entering the community in 2005 and 2006, but I can say that Bowman will be working hard to provide every opportunity available in the community, with things like a tertiary education available in the seat and integrated employment zonesâopportunities for these great young Australians to remain in our seat rather than moving away to get an education in other locations and moving away from the seat forever. The challenge, of course, for these young leadersâand it is indeed a personal challengeâis to continue the great contributions they have made into the future. I congratulate them on, as Robert F Kennedy said, the tiny ripples of hope that they are responsible for, and I hope that they become great achievements in the years that follow.</para>

<para>âAustralia: itâs in our hands. It is crucial that we focus on nurturing and promoting national strengths and help inoculate Australia against terrorism when considering other protective, preventative and responsive measures. No black-letter law will change what is not in peopleâs hearts. We need to celebrate what has made this country great: the allegiance to our nation, its people, the support of our shared democratic beliefs, our belief in the rule of law and our respect for our rights and liberties. They are the foundation pillars that have made Australia a great countryâ</para>

<para>âIt is a great honour for me to be one of the United Nations ambassadors for this yearâs International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. Domestic violence, and violence against women generally, is certainly a serious matter and should not be tolerated now or ever. Gender based violence damages our society as a whole, and I was proud to stand up with other prominent Australian men to make it clear that violence against women and children is simply unacceptable.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Sadly, Australia is not immune from violence against women, and the statistics tell a sorry tale of the prevalence of the problem. One in three women has experienced some form of physical violence in their lifetime, and one in five has experienced sexual violence. Worse still, an international survey recently found that 57 per cent of the Australian women surveyed had experienced some form of physical violence in their lifetime. An Access Economics report released last year estimated the economic cost of domestic violence to be in the order of $8.1 billion per annum, while the Institute of Criminology found that domestic violence accounted for 27 per cent of all homicides in Australia between the years 1989 and 1996. These are chilling statistics, and it is clear that the time for inaction has passed.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As a UNIFEM White Ribbon Day ambassador, I choose to wear a white ribbon to demonstrate my opposition to violence against women and children and to demonstrate my commitment to equality between men and women. It is a personal pledge that means that I do not condone violence against women. I am committed to supporting community groups such as the Green Valley Domestic Violence Service, which is left to pick up the pieces of the shattered lives of victims of domestic violence and gender based violence.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Every single one of us, whether we are in politics, government or business or whether we are general members of the community, has a responsibility to stop violence against women. The government needs to make a real commitment to this issue and to treat it with the seriousness it deserves. The government should provide proper funding and support for initiatives that help women to escape violence. It is simply no longer acceptable that domestic violence support services be funded by volunteers so as to assist women to escape this form of violence. It is no longer acceptable for community workers and community groups to support the victims of these crimes without the support of government. I call on the government to make a real and serious commitment to the proper and adequate funding of support services that help to treat and shelter women who are fleeing any sort of gender based violence. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThis morning I would like to congratulate Mr Jim Bullen, Mr Des LaRance and the members of the Rotary Club of Surfers Sunrise on the tremendous work they have undertaken in sending overseas wheelchairs made from bicycle parts. The club is currently in the process of sending a 20-foot container to Hanoi holding 137 of these wheelchairs. These wheelchairs are destined for children in Hanoi and North Vietnam who have been affected by landmines and Agent Orange. Unfortunately many of these children are very crippled. They are unable to walk and have no way of getting around their local communities. A number of the children who have been affected by Agent Orange do not have any coordination, and they cannot wheel themselves around. Some of the wheelchairs have been fitted with seatbelts and handles to enable the children to be wheeled around by their families.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The wheelchairs are made from bicycle parts, and these are collected from all over the Gold Coast. A great number of people donate unused bikes that have been sitting in backyards and garages. The bikes are brought into the Rotary Club, and that is where the work begins. The work that has been undertaken in the last few years has made it possible to send 48 wheelchairs to Dili, 60 to Vanuatu and approximately 500 to South Vietnam. This is the first time a container load of these bikes has been sent to North Vietnam.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Jim Bullen is a member of the Rotary Club and he has made his own personal contribution to this project: over the last seven years, he has been involved in making 710 wheelchairs. I think that is a tremendous effort on the part of one man, who has been doing this from his own backyard. He is a former pilot with the RAAF, and he has said that making these wheelchairs was one of the most satisfying things he has ever done in his life. He has been to Dili himself and has seen what a difference these wheelchairs make to those young people.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would also like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Mr Bruce Billson, for his support in sending these wheelchairs to Hanoi. Through the Australian government overseas aid branch of AusAID, he was able to arrange assistance in sending this container load of wheelchairs made from bicycles to Hanoi. AusAID have taken on board the transport costs. This has certainly taken a huge burden off the Rotary Club. It means that they can work in the future to continue making their wheelchairs from bicycles to help the young people who so desperately need them in overseas countries. So, to Jim and all those at the Rotary Club of Surfers Sunrise, congratulations, and my sincere thanks to the Hon. Bruce Billson for the part he has played in ensuring that these wheelchairs have made it to Hanoi.</para>

<para>âI want to take the opportunity in the small amount of time available to me this morning to put in a plea to the Minister for Health and Ageing to progress as urgently as he can the application for Herceptin, the cancer drug for breast cancer, to be listed on the PBS for first-stage cancer sufferers. I understand that the drug company has put in an application, and I would just ask that it be progressed as soon as it can be.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The issue is particularly pertinent to some residents of my electorate who wrote to me in August this year and whose concerns I have forwarded to the health minister. Steven and Michelle Radford, who live at Stanwell Park, have five children. Michelle has undergone several operations for her breast cancer. She has had chemotherapy and radiation treatment, and her oncologist now recommends that she undergoes a course of Herceptin. Currently the treatment would cost the family approximately $60,000, and they were faced with the choice of having to sell the family home in order to fund that treatment.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The community has rallied around them in an amazingly supportive way. It is a great commendation to them, their friends and their community. The Illawarra Credit Union has come on board to set up an account and assist with the fundraising. Helensburgh Lions Club, Helensburgh BI-LO, the Rotary Club of Corrimalâall of those organisations have assisted. Indeed, a local year 10 student, Tiffany Blackmore, has started a letter-writing campaign to businesses seeking their support to assist Steven and Michelle. My understanding is that to date, in a short amount of time, they have already raised about $11,000 to assist with the expense of that treatment.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is difficult. We all understand when drugs have to go through a process of being approved for use, but for the families facing this dilemma it is a pretty difficult choice, when you have five kids going through the circumstance of their mum battling breast cancer, to face the potential of losing their home. So I would just make a plea that we ensure that the processing of the application is done as expeditiously as possible and that these families are not always required to go out and ask their communities to fundraise. Steven and Michelle were obviously very reluctant to do that because they are quite proud people, but their friends and family were more than eager, as was the community, to avoid them having to sell their home.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In recent days I have also been contacted by Tam and Mary-Anne McCaffery from Woonona, who are facing the same circumstance. I am sure that all of us in our electorates will find that we have people facing this difficult situation. I do not want to make a political point; I just want to make sure that we try, through the government, as much as possible, to progress the application of Herceptin to be used for patients under these circumstances.</para>

<para>âI rise today to draw your attention to a sporting club within my electorate of La Trobe which provides a wonderful environment for childrenâs sporting activitiesâthat is, the Boronia Cricket Club. Since my election as the representative for La Trobe, I have developed a sound relationship with the extended community of the Boronia Cricket Club.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Boronia Cricket Club traces its history back to the mid-1920s, when it played against local teams and achieved success as a club. In the mid-1970s, the club relocated its home to turf wickets, which are regarded as the place where cricket in its purest form is played. In addition, Boronia Cricket Club switched its affiliation from the Ringwood and District Cricket Association to the Eastern Suburbs Cricket Association, now known as the Eastern Cricket Association.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Playing cricket on turf must have been the change Boronia was looking for, because in 1979-80 the club won the First XI premiership. However, the success was short lived. It was not until the 2004-05 season that the Boronia Cricket Club achieved success once again by winning the First XI premiership. A mixture of youth and experience was considered the winning formula, in addition to a standout performance by batsman Phil Cross, who scored 174. This was a boost to Boroniaâs run chase of 305 required for victory. I now seek leave to table the scoresheet of that match.</para>

<para>âCoach John Blennerhassett successfully guided his team to victoryâa long time coming. I am sure we will soon see another premiership with coach Chris McCartin.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">The club also has a great juniors program. I attended a function at the end of 2004-05 for their presentation march. Their successes were rewarded on the night. The 2004-05 Bluey Paxton award went to Robert Laurence, who also won the under-16s award. The Mark Kowacki trophy for 2004-05 went to Michael Jeffries. Lachlan Begg took home the Wizard Boronia BCC Good Sports award. Connor McIntyre won the best clubman for the under-12s. The best bowler and best batter honours for under-12s went to Jacob Perger.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The club has a terrific administration. I must recognise Jo McIntyre, who has been a strong ambassador for the club and also organised the sportsmenâs night on 5 November 2005, where we had Darren Berry and Rodney Hogg in attendance. I would also like to make special mention of the clubâs junior coordinator, Jim Ahon, president, Daryl Watson, and chairman of selectors, Matthew Crawley, for all their hard work. Again, I wish to acknowledge the great work of the A-grade cricket side for their fantastic win in the premiership match, which is obviously the most important match of the year.</para>

</talker>
<para>âI want to record my concern today about an apparent downgrade in an essential service in my electorate. I am talking about a service provided by the Bureau of Meteorology. Since 1999 there has been a VHF radio service operating on channels 21 and 82, covering the coastline from Townsend Island north of Rockhampton down to 1770 on the Central Queensland coast. Those channels carry a number of live crosses each day from the Bureau of Meteorology in Rockhampton to advise about the current local weather situation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I have been told that as of Saturday there have been cuts to those crosses from the Bureau of Meteorology such that there is no longer a 5.20 am cross from the bureau on those channels. The 5.05 pm cross has also been downgradedâfrom a report by a forecaster to a report by an observer who is simply reading a forecast. It is that information from forecasters that is so vital to boaties, fishermen, farmers and people involved in defence exercises in our region. It is those forecasters who can give the really comprehensive, detailed information that is so vital to people involved in those activities.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As of last Saturday, those services have gone. I understand that this is due to staff cuts at the Rockhampton Bureau of Meteorology. We used to have three forecasters working in Rockhampton, and we are now down to only two forecasters. This has serious implications for people who are reliant on up-to-date, very comprehensive weather information, particularly those people involved in the fishing industry, boatiesâand we have a lot of those enjoying our regionâand also people involved in the farming sector.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Additionally, I have learned that there is going to be a cut in another service provided by the Bureau of Meteorology, and that is a cut in the service provided by the cooperative observer who operates out ofÂ  Thangool. Thangool is in the Callide Valley and is the home of the airport for that region. It is also a significant agricultural region. Neville Wenck, who is a cooperative observer, was conducting six observations a day. They have cut the noon service and the 9 pm service. That 9 pm observation is particularly crucial for the airport. A lot of pilots from the air ambulance or the courier planes that fly into that airport use his observations so they know what is going on there. It is crucial, particularly in storm season, which is upon us now. I would hate to see this go the way of the Launceston bureau which was downgraded in 2004. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThere are some misguided members in this House who believe in destroying our national airline, Qantas. That is why I have moved to this side of the chamber, so as not to be associated with those on that side of the chamber who have these absolutely disgraceful views. I am a strong supporter of our national airline.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I stand today to comment on Jezzine Barracks. When I met with Mayor Tony Mooney at my request in August, we talked about the future of the mall in Jezzine Barracks. The mayor indicated his first preference for Jezzine was to acquire all of the land for community purposes, but he was prepared to accept that not all of the land may be available. I have been advised that the mayor subsequently met with three representatives of Defence in Brisbane recently and expressed the same view to them.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Over the past few months there has been an ongoing community debate led by some stakeholders, including the council. Only the general concept of handing over all of the barracks land has been discussed. I have received no information or representations from anyone with regard to particular ideas. Now that we know the options that Defence is considering, I would appreciate receiving a briefing from the mayor on how he thinks the prime historic land could be enhanced. Does he have any specific ideas? Has he done any costings? Can he provide me with any concept plans so that I might be able to take them to the government? How does he see that a connection can be made between the Strand and Rowes Bay? I would like to make it clear that Defence is selling nothing. The balance of the land not handed over to the community will remain in the ownership of the Department of Defence.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Townsville is set to get a magnificent extension to our famous Strand following hard work to get Defence to agree to give most of the historic and prime land at Jezzine Barracks to the community. The community has been listened to and more than half of the land will go for community purposes. Both the North Queensland Military Heritage Association and the RSL have achieved what they wanted. However, Defence is also a key stakeholder and it will continue to own the balance of the land, to be used for Defence purposes. No land will be sold to developers and there will be no high-rises. This is a good outcome for all key stakeholders. The Defence precinct will only house ADF personnel.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">For my part, I have been working on some very innovative ways to enhance the historic areas and to provide the connection from the Strand to Rowes Bay. I have been particularly impressed with the fully integrated peace park concept I saw on Saipan Island. With the RSL and the new North Queensland Military Museum and the mayor, I reckon we can do the same, if not better. Some great Indigenous ideas have also come forward. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to extend our magnificent Strand and to preserve our military heritage for future generations.</para>

<para>âI rise today to speak on behalf of my constituent Mr Rocco Nuzzo of Oatley. Mr Nuzzo is the victim of what appears to be an inconsistency in the application of the Social Security Act to his personal circumstances. Mr Nuzzo receives a gross fortnightly benefit of $443.50 from the New South Wales Dust Diseases Board. My office has been advised by the Minister for Family and Community Services that this payment is treated as a compensation payment; therefore, he is not entitled to receive a pension, with its corresponding concession card. Mr Nuzzo is diagnosed as 40 per cent impaired by the Dust Diseases Board, so he is unable to work. He has no investments, so has not been able to accumulate funds. The great irony in this is that, if Mr Nuzzo had investments or if he were able to work, he would only be assessed at 40c in the dollar instead of dollar for dollar.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">What type of social security net is this government providing? Here we have a man diagnosed with a 40 per cent disability by the Dust Diseases Board yet, because he is not rich enough to accumulate investments and he is too ill to work, he is seriously disadvantaged. He is unable to access the concession card, which would provide him with discounts on council rates, car registration and so on. Yet he is able to access some PBS prescription items and specified Medicare services at a cheaper rate. He is able to access ancillary benefits to assist with his condition.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">What of the inconsistency in this policy? Why should Mr Nuzzo be so disadvantaged? If he were able to work, he would be assessed at 40c in the dollar, not dollar for dollar. If he had financial investments, he would be assessed at 40c in the dollar, not dollar for dollar. Yet, because he is dependent on benefits, he is assessed at a different rate. Where is the equity in this situation? Mr Nuzzo could access benefits through his wifeâs pension card. However, he is a proud man who would prefer not to do so. That aside, though, how would he manage if his wife did not have a pension card? It does beg the question: what of single people in this equation? Time after time, my office receives calls from people facing such policy inconsistencies. Such people have to deal with the mean spirit of this government.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I asked earlier: where is the fairness and equity in this situation? Obviously this is a rhetorical question. There is no fairness and equity in a system provided by a government which is ideologically driven. People like Mr Nuzzo are the proverbial meat in the sandwich between the federal government and the insurance companies: the government insists that the insurance companies should pay more compensation; the insurance companies insist that they want to keep premiums low. Inevitably it is the individuals who suffer.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Mr Nuzzo believes the government accepts that people cannot live on the pension. Hence, they are allowed to earn up to $220 per fortnight before losing 40c in the dollar for income earned over that amount. Mr Nuzzo, on the other hand, earns an income from his dust diseases payment yet he is unable to claim a pension, which is calculated, because of the type of income, as dollar for dollar. Categorically, this is one further example of an uncaring, inconsistent and unsympathetic government.</para>

<para>âLike other honourable members, I have had the opportunity in recent weeks to attend a number of senior award presentation nights at schools in my electorate situated on Queenslandâs Sunshine Coast. These nights involve the entire school communityâparents, bothers, sisters, grandparents, high school executives and board members, local dignitaries and teachers, of courseâall coming together to celebrate the achievements of the senior students as well as to wish them well as they make the transition into the next stage of their lives.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I have been particularly impressed with the standard of these students, and the award ceremonies have highlighted the dedication and drive that so many young people have in our society today. I am impressed at the way in which, during their period at secondary school, they have been involved in school and community activities and at the way in which they have been determined to be positive role models not only for their schools but also for younger students. I am also impressed by their enthusiasm on the sporting fields and their positive attitudes towards their school work. In Australia we are so quick to criticise, but these young people must be congratulated on being so positive. They are a valued and valuable part of my community in the electorate Fisher on the Sunshine Coast.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">These award ceremonies take place at numbers of schools. In fact, I attended three award ceremonies on one evening, and, with my parliamentary responsibilities here in Canberra, I have also had staff represent me at several school events. It is important to recognise that school students are the potential of this country, and we really ought to do all that we can to support them. Unfortunately, I think in Australia we so often tend to criticise young people and we do not look at the fact that they are offering so much hope and so much opportunity for our nationâs future.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would like to take this opportunity in the Main Committee to encourage Australiaâs youth to believe in themselves, to be dedicated and hardworking, and to understand that they are playing a very important role in our national life. I make these comments somewhat as a rebuttal to some of the negative media coverage we see from time to time about young people.</para>

<para>âYoung people are often easy scapegoats when one is looking for someone to blame when graffiti appears or some other nuisance crime such as vandalism happens to occur. Our youth must be praised for their positive qualities and their enthusiasm and be reminded of their potential, and I thank the member for Bowman for his vocal support. Youth are a demographic that has been affected by increased levels of depression and suicide, and I personally find this is one the greatest worries and one of the greatest challenges that we have as a nation. Michelle Ellis, one of my staff, has read negative reports about our youth, but she thinks it is high time that the positive achievements and potential of young people are given a hearing and that they deserve ongoing encouragement and support. I support Michelleâs view. I think these young people are Australiaâs future. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI rise to speak on an issue that I, like many Australians, feel passionately about: Australian rules football. My office has received an increasing number of calls concerning AFL plans to grant exclusive broadcasting rights to pay TV for home-game AFL football matches played outside Melbourne. Not surprisingly, people are upset and angry at reports that they may be unable to access Adelaide Crows and Port Power home game football matches on free-to-air TV. Today I would like to take this opportunity to voice my constituentsâ opposition to this matter, to remind the government of the antisiphoning laws currently in place and to insist that the government ensure that the AFL stays within those laws.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Sport is part of Australian culture and, frankly, having to pay $50 each month to be able to watch the mighty Adelaide Crows or, if people so choose, Port Power play on TV is unacceptable. More than a decade ago the previous Labor government established an antisiphoning regime aimed at ensuring that rights to certain events were not sold to pay TV until free-to-air networks were given reasonable opportunity to purchase those rights. This regime has never prevented events being shown on pay TV and does not guarantee free-to-air broadcasters exclusive rights. Rather, the antisiphoning regime is about ensuring that major sporting events are available to all Australians on free-to-air television.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Last football season three AFL matches per round were shown by Foxtel, while the rest were aired on free-to-air TV. Yet the AFL seems intent on turning its back on football fans, instead wanting to negotiate an agreement that grants pay TV exclusive broadcasting rights to the home games of the Sydney Swans, the Brisbane Lions, the West Coast Eagles, the Fremantle Dockers and, most importantly, the Adelaide Crows and Port Power.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">South Australian football fans have had it far too hard for too long. Our clubs travelâthey have more away gamesâand, unlike many of those Victorian clubs, do not get the easy run that they are granted. As a Crows supporter, I know that our club is so popular that fans have to go on a waiting list to get membership to the club. Home games are regularly sold out, giving many fans no choice but to watch it on television. I would also not want to forget our country fans, who rely on free-to-air television rights in order to tune into their favourite game.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There has been a lot of talk about the rise of soccer in our communities. I would like to say to the AFL that it is hardly the time for them to be taking footy fans for granted. If the AFL gets its way, football fans will have to pay up to $600 a year to watch their teamâs home game matches. As one of my constituents so rightly pointed out, forcing people to pay any sum to watch their favourite team play at home is unfair, and it is particularly unfair to people who cannot afford to purchase pay TV. Sport should remain accessible to all Australians on free-to-air television. I call on Andrew Demetriou and the AFL commission to value footy supporters, including Adelaide Crows and Port Power supporters, who want nothing more than to be able to watch their teams. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI rise today to praise the wonderful efforts of Australian volunteers, although more particularly those volunteers in my electorate of Stirling. During the course of my duties, I meet with a large number of organisations who have volunteers who, with no expectation of remuneration, give up their time and often raise money to assist a cause that is important to them.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">On 5 December this year organisations such as Volunteering WA will celebrate International Volunteer Day. There are a large number of organisations with whom I have regular contactâthe Balga and the Nollamara-Westminster action groups are examples of groups who contribute to both the social and cultural atmosphere in their areas. Their activities are of great benefit to the community, and I thank all involved for their dedication and constructive activism.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would like to congratulate the city of Stirlingâs Stirling Volunteer Transport, who recently celebrated 25 years of operation. Stirling Volunteer Transport is an important link that provides aged and disabled members of the community with access to services and facilities that they would otherwise be unable to utilise. In numerical terms, this equates to approximately 2,000 trips for 350 people each month within Stirling. Without this valuable service, many aged and infirm people would lose their link to the outside world. I commend all involved for their compassion and contribution to those in the community who require outside assistance.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Stirling Coastcare is also an important volunteer community organisation within my electorate. The beautiful coastline that borders the electorate of Stirling is maintained and rehabilitated by Stirling Coastcare, and many members of my community actively participate in this organisation. Stirling Coastcare is responsible for the wonderful work along the coastline, and I am always grateful for the enthusiasm and strong sense of community of its members. Volunteers are invaluable to our community, yet often they are overlooked.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I am lucky enough to have the opportunity to be regularly assisted in my electorate office by volunteers. The volunteers who assist in my office generally have very inauspicious jobs such as stuffing envelopes, but they enable me to communicate with my electorate about what the Howard government is doing for the people of Australia. More importantly, with volunteers assisting my staff in the collation of surveys and information, I am able to address the issues of real concern to my electors and to work on what the government can do to improve these services. I would like to thank the always dependable Nick and Mona Katavatis, Ian and Val MacLean, Margie Gray, Sally Suba and the always present Liz Needer, who gives so much of her time to assist the people of Stirling. There are many others who have assisted me but time, unfortunately, limits me from listing them today. I commend the activities of volunteers to the House, and I encourage all Australians to reflect on the role of the volunteer. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âIf we reflect on the events of a number of years past up to this present point in time in relation to immigration issues in this country, and if we consider the plethora of inquiriesâand there are two important ones that I will refer to a little later in my speechâmedia coverage of what has happened in relation to the immigration department and a headline such as âSomething rotten in Immigrationâ, which I have in front of me at the moment, picked at random, as it wereâa report by Mike Steketee, the national affairs editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, on the Palmer reportâI think it is fair to say that we have witnessed a particularly difficult and at times disturbing era in the administration of a federal bureaucracy and the appropriate policy settings, governance and leadership that have been put in place by successive ministers of the Howard government.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">There is no doubt that immigration, really, has been the leitmotiv of the Howard era. When the history is written in a detached sense in some years to come, I do not thinkâand I say this with some regretâthat there is any doubt whatsoever that historians will judge the era very harshly. They will judge the department harshly and they will reflect on the leadership of the department. But, most importantlyâand I do not seek to reflect on the current leadership of the department todayâthey will reflect on the leadership that was offered by the government on this issue, particularly by the Prime Minister; the former Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, the now Attorney-General, Mr Ruddock; and the existing minister, Senator Vanstone.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is fair to say that the public has an expectation that government departments would not only observe all the appropriate bureaucratic policy and legislative and other protocols that are within their remit but, at the same time, ensure that the duty of care they owe, particularly in departments like Immigration, to the people over whom they ultimately have some responsibility is exercised prudently and compassionately. In the cases that I will refer to today, it is very clear that that has not happened.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">What is most disturbing about the saga of events that has transpired over the past several years is not that the department has not come to an understanding and an admission that it could do things better. It has, and that is acknowledged by members on this side of the House and by others. It is that the departmentâs political masters, the Prime Minister and now Senator Vanstone, have refused in any way whatsoever to take accountability for what has happened. It is fair to say, particularly in relation to the Palmer report, the Comrie report and the series of events that surrounded both Ms Rau and Ms Solon Alvarez, that the idea of ministerial responsibility literally went out the window altogether.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I do note that the member for Kooyong will speak following me. I want to put on the record my appreciation of the efforts of the member for Kooyong, the member for Pearce and others in the government who have worked assiduously to ensure that the duty of care that I have just referred to, which ought to be exercised as a matter of course by a government department with these responsibilities, has in some ways been enhanced and improved. But, from the record of what the Prime Minister and Minister Vanstone have said, it is very clear that the whole-of-government position has simply been to carry on as though very little has happenedâand no-one, still, has been judged responsible. There will be many speeches, and there probably have been many made that I am not aware of, that go to the heart of this issue. I suspect that there will be many more made, both in this parliament and in the community, until responsibility is acknowledged by those who truly are responsibleâthe ministers in question.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Minister Ruddock made an art form of encouraging people to think poorly either of those who sought to come here as refugees or of those who were in the immigration system. He turned it into an art form, which I think reflects politics at its worst. The legion of claims that he has made, as both minister for immigration and Attorney-General, that are either false, misleading or incorrect, are many. As immigration minister it was not above the ministerâ</para>

<para>âI withdraw that expression, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you suggest. I certainly will retain the expression âmisleadingâ for the moment. I refer to the claim that the minister made when he was the minister for immigration that Australia took its fair share of refugees into the country and compared us to equivalent Western countries where the rate, as memory serves me, was about 26 per cent and Australiaâs rate was about 13 per cent. That claim was actually wrong.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">Politicians and political leaders may have remained indifferent to the levels of concern about the integrity of the processes that were under way, both in respect of immigration and also in its oversight. But the public were not indifferent. One of the things that has been most noticeable to me has been the increasing number of ordinary Australiansâand I think of Rural Australians for Refugeesâwho decided that they had to speak up on this issue, that they had to work with politicians on both sides of the House who had some concerns about this issue and additionally that they would work in the community to ensure that some representation of a public kind in respect of what was going on could take place. I endorse the member for Watsonâs remarks in the debate on the second reading amendment. There is no doubt that both the Palmer report recommendations and the Comrie inquiryâs report showed very clearly that the state of the department was catastrophicâthose were words that were used.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I refer to the Palmer reportâs main findings in respect of Ms Rau, and I will identify a couple of these main findings in my remarks. Main finding No. 4 says:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">There is no automatic process of review sufficient to provide confidence to the Government, to the Secretary of DIMIA or to the public that the power to detain a person on reasonable suspicion of being an unlawful non-citizen under s. 189(1) of the Commonwealthâs Migration Act 1958 is being exercised lawfully, justifiably and with integrity.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">That is an astonishing finding by Mr Palmer. Finding No. 5 says:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The case complexity and workload associated with enforcing and managing immigration detention policy have placed much pressure on DIMIA staff.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The speed of change to the immigration detention environment since 2000 has led to policy, procedures and enabling structures being developed on the run.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">One has to ask the question: what was the minister doing at this point in time when policy changes were putting such pressure and stress on officers within the department? Finding No. 8, which has been extensively remarked on in the press, says:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">There is a serious cultural problem within DIMIAâs immigration compliance and detention areas: urgent reform is necessary.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Finding No. 9 says:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">DIMIA officers are authorised to exercise exceptional, even extraordinary, powers. That they should be permitted and expected to do so without adequate training, without proper management and oversight, with poor information systems, and with no genuine quality assurance and constraints on the exercise of these powers is of concern. The fact that this situation has been allowed to continue unchecked and unreviewed for several years is difficult to understand.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">And so it goes on; the story is well understood. The department and the ministers in question have made their responses. I do not doubt that there is a genuine desire within the department, and from officers within the department, to heed this report and subsequent reports, but when we look at the way in which the responses of ministers and other departments have played out in publicâand we are still left with a feeling of the publicâs expectation of genuine, bona fide sincerityâthere has certainly been no contrition. Genuine, bona fide sincerity in addressing these issues has not yet been made clear to the Australian public, and it certainly has not been felt on this side of the House.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Let me refer to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which I think has been particularly remiss in understanding the necessary cultural and process changes that ought to take place in relation to the Comrie report. As you will know, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, the Comrie reportâs findings about Vivian Alvarez Solon were also damning. The history is a tragic one, made more so by the fact it was clear that the omissions, failures and incapacities of the department increased the misery of this woman and in fact contributed to the situation that she found herself in. She was found injured in a park in Lismore on 30 March 2001. She was first interviewed by DIMIA officers on 3 May. The DIMIA officers did not seek access to hospital records that contained personal information that would have helped to have identified her, and they did not actively pursue a male friend of hers in Lismore who had information that would have helped to identify her. I am picking out some of the aspects of the reportâbecause I know they have been well reportedâbut it does paint the picture of what actually happened.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">DIMIA officers conducted a formal interview with Ms Solon on 13 July. She said she was an Australian citizen at that time, that she wanted to remain in Australia and that she wanted to apply for a visa. Comrie remarks:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Inadequate action was taken by DIMIA to pursue these crucial remarks.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">He points out:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The inquiries made in an attempt to identify Vivian were ad hoc and symptomatic of a situation in which DIMIA officers had been inadequately trained for their role as compliance officers,Â  particularly in relation to the interrogation of IT systems and databases.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Certainly there was a great deal of reportage at the time and a subsequent response by the department about the necessity for the department to have far more rigorous, accountable and transparent processes but particularly to enhance the IT capacity within the department. The report goes on to say:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The management of Vivianâs case was very poor, lacking rigour and accountability</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The reportâs main finding No. 10 states:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The DIMIA officers involved in Vivianâs case had a flawed understanding of the application and implications of s. 189 of the Migration Act 1958.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I think it is very fair to ask in the parliament how it is that immigration officers can have a flawed understanding of the application and implications of their governing act. How is it that officers who have this level of responsibility do not know what is in the law and that the life of this woman, in particular, was jeopardised as a consequence of their ignorance of that? A litany of mistakes, a history of errors goes on in her case. For example, finding No. 15 states:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Although DIMIA officers were presented with a difficult decision about where to detain Vivian before removing herâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">and, as we know, she ended up in the Philippinesâ</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">her detention for one week in a single motel room was inappropriate. Her privacy, dignity and welfare were compromised by the fact that she was guarded in this room at all times by two contracted security guards and had no access to the medical facilities available to people held in immigration detention centres.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">What were people thinking? Did they believe that this woman was a risk to national security? What possible reason was there, I pose the question, as to why she should have been treated in this way?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Finally, once the Philippine embassy had expressed concerns about Vivianâs fitness to travelâand when I say âfinallyâ, there is a significant history there that I do not have the time to go through at this pointâand would not issue a travel document allowing for her removal to the Philippines, there was the use of a locum medical practitioner to certify Vivian as fit to travel, but Mr Comrie finds that this was inappropriate in the circumstances. So the findings go on and on. Frankly, if it were not for the efforts of Robert Young, Ms Solon Alvarezâs former husband, who knows what ultimately would have happened? Finding No. 34 states:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">DIMIAâs overall management of Vivianâs case can only be described as catastrophic.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">However, that finding goes on to say:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... it is important to record that some DIMIA officers performed their duties diligently and professionally ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">And I do not doubt that at all. What I do doubt is that the message has got through to the government and, frankly, to some bureaucrats as well. I referred earlier to DFAT. In the Comrie report we read that, despite being aware on 9 September 2003 that Vivian had been wrongfully deported in 2001, theyâthat is, DFAT officersâtreated the matter as an inquiry for information about a third party and did not create a case file. It really beggars belief. They simply supplied the information to the Missing Persons Bureau and did nothing else. What reason was offered for that? The rules only require a follow-up and creation of a case file if a query comes from a family member. This speaks to me of bureaucracy going terribly wrong.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The communications on Ms Solon Alvarez were by email. The department then said that, if they had been by cable, they would have been noticed. If I did not notice my email communications because I preferred to receive letters and was instructed that I should read only communications that came to me by letter and ignore all the emails of the many millions that fly around the world every second of the dayâcommunications used by every person in this roomâI would be doing my job very poorly. They did their job very poorly. The DFAT line was the classic defence of âdoing it by the bookââthe consular handbook, in that case. No wonder Mr Comrie remarked:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">It might well be that bureaucratic requirements were met in this case, but the Inquiry is of the view that important obligations to an Australian citizen were not met.Â </para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">There were other examples. Despite department assurances that systems will be tightened in the future, you are left with the feeling that the neglect that goes to the heart of how this woman was treated is consistent with the governmentâs political posture and political policy as enunciated at the beginning of the election campaign, when the statement was made by the Prime Minister: âWe decide who comes into the country.â That is very clearly the impression that you get.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In my remarks, I want to say very clearly that we on this side acknowledge the good and hard work that is done by public servants within government departments of the Federation. I personally recognise that people give of themselves in public service. I know that many would be feeling a great sense of regret that the issues that I have travailed very lightly today have reflected so poorly on their department.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">While the former head of the department, Mr Farmer, becoming the ambassador to Indonesia may or may not have been a choice that he made, it was certainly a decision that the Prime Minister made. It was a decision of great eloquence, because it spoke to the heart of how this government sees these particular issues and the way in which it is prepared to either reward or condemn on the basis of not what is happening in terms of substantive policy but what it thinks it can get away with politically.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There has been something rotten in Immigrationâof that there is no doubt. We do, though, support this bill, and we recognise that the government is implementing some measures which we think will improve the administration of immigration policy. The need for there to be more flexibility and fairness and for it to happen in a more timely manner is to be acknowledged. Labor has a more progressive policy, and it has been enumerated by a number of members here, and so I commend that policy. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI wish to speak in support of the <inline ref="R2454">Migration and Ombudsman Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline>. I welcome the support of the Labor Party and the member for Kingsford-Smith for the bill as a whole. In June this year the government resolved to implement a package of reforms for the immigration detention system. These reforms sought to achieve a very substantial improvement to the fairness, transparency and compassion in our immigration detention policy. They also sought to expedite decisions on protection visa applications. This bill is the second legislative component of these reforms. The first component was the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Act, which was enacted in June.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The policy of mandatory detention was introduced by the Labor government in 1992, fearing a flood of unauthorised refugees. Further stringent measures were subsequently adopted by the Howard government to deter people from entering Australia and from seeking asylum here. Thankfully, the atmosphere of crisis surrounding these measures has passed. A combination of factors has seen a sharp fall in the number of asylum seekers and refugees globally, and unauthorised boat arrivals have largely ceasedâthat is, until the start of this month no asylum seekers had been apprehended in Australian waters for over two years. I will say more about these most recent arrivals in a moment, but first I want to return to the impetus for the recent reforms.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There was compelling evidence of the pressing need for reform of the mandatory detention policy. Across the Australian community there were deep concerns that the system had become excessively rigid and harsh and had harmed vulnerable children, women and men. Reforms needed to ensure that, while we effectively protected our borders, we were humane and just to those affected by our policies. Prior to June this year there had been some amelioration of the policy by this government, but further reform is necessary to ensure that, while we protect our borders, we are humane and just to those affected by our policies and those who seek asylum here.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The latest package of reforms seeks to reconcile the governmentâs wish to maintain mandatory detention with the belief that refugees and asylum seekers can and should be treated with greater fairness, humanity, compassion and transparency. The detention arrangements legislation passed in June dealt with two areas of particular concern: the detention of children and families and the indefinite detention of asylum seekers without external scrutiny.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In that legislation, the parliament affirmed the principle that a child shall only be detained as a matter of last resort. It introduced a process to allow all children and their families to live in the community, free to attend school, day care, playgrounds and so on without security supervision. In June there were 59 children in immigration detention centres. All of these children and their families were out by the end of July, and I understand that no more were held in a centre, at least until earlier this month.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">However, seven West Timorese asylum seekers arrived by boat in north-western Australia on 5 November. They were detained originally and flown to Darwin, then to Christmas Island, where they were placed in a detention centre which had been empty, had been closed and was reopened. This raises a number of questions for me, one being: why Christmas Island rather than on the mainland, where they had been initially placed? But, more pertinently here, those asylum seekers include two infant children. I believe one is a one-year-old child and the other is a two-year-old child. I have been advised that the children and their parents have now been placed in a house in the community. On the information provided to me, placing the children and their families in an immigration detention centre, albeit for a brief period of time, was not consistent with the June reforms, and I have conveyed that view to the government.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The second achievement of the June amendments was that the cases of people who have been held in immigration detention for two or more years will be independently scrutinised. The Commonwealth Ombudsman is charged with reviewing the cases of these long-term detainees, and the Secretary to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs must report to the Ombudsman on the status and case management of these people. The Ombudsman, Professor John McMillan, was given extensive powers to facilitate these investigations and the power to make recommendations that he considers appropriate.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The conduct of the immigration detention regime has lacked openness for far too long. One need only reflect briefly on the report by Mick Palmer on the detention of Cornelia Rau or on Neil Comrieâs investigation into the deportation of Vivian Alvarez to appreciate the incontrovertibility of this point. Mr Palmer found:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... a serious cultural problem within DIMIAâs immigration compliance and detention areas ... a culture that is overly self-protective and defensive ... unwilling to challenge organisational norms or to engage in genuine self-criticism or analysis.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">He found âserious problems with the handling of immigration detention casesâ stemming from âdeep-seated cultural and attitudinal problems within DIMIAâ. In discussing the deportation of Vivian Alvarez, the Palmer report found:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... events, practices and actions in 2003 and 2004 ... which strongly corroborate and confirm the systemic nature of the problems identified in the Cornelia Rau inquiry. An initial analysis of other cases ... shows that many of the same causal factors seem to be present.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The strong possibility that the same factors have contributed to the inappropriate detention of a number of other people over an extended period should give rise to serious concern.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Comrie inquiry similarly found:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... a flawed DIMIA cultureâone that pays insufficient attention to detaineesâ welfare and care needs.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">It found:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">DIMIA failed to meet its duty of care obligations to Vivian and unlawfully removed her from Australia.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... The unlawful removal of Vivian was a consequence of systemic failures in DIMIAâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">and that:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">DIMIAâs overall management of Vivianâs case can only be described as catastrophic.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Further, it found:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The most disturbing feature of the culture is that senior officers in DIMIA who became aware that an Australian citizen had been unlawfully removed failed to take any action to redress the situation.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I welcome the steps being taken to change the departmentâs culture, and I welcome the involvement of the Ombudsman in improving the transparency of the regime to the parliament and to the people of Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">A further important measure of the governmentâs package of reforms is embodied in this billâthat is, to finalise expeditiously applications by people who are seeking permanent protection. In June, the government committed DIMIA and the Refugee Review Tribunal to completing the processing of around 4,000 then pending TPV applicants by 31 October.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As I have said previously, given the history of administrative difficulties in the area of mandatory detention, one has to be highly sensitive about issues of implementation. The progress of the implementation of the governmentâs reform has been monitored. It has been assessed by the newly created immigration interdepartmental committee under the chairmanship of the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The committee has met regularly since June, once a fortnight, and will continue to have a role as these reforms continue to be implemented. I, and other interested members of the governmentâin particular, the members for Cook, Pearce and McMillan, and Senator Troethâhave also been monitoring this. As foreshadowed, we have been meeting regularly with the chairman of the immigration interdepartmental committee to ensure that the reforms are being implemented satisfactorily. Generally, I am encouraged by the progress that I am advised has been achieved in the months since these measures were agreed.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As I have mentioned, the government in June committed to having around 4,000 applications for permanent protection by people with temporary protection visas processed by 31 October. The minister for immigration earlier this month announced that, of the actual figure of 3,400 applications in this category, the department had finalised all those within its power to complete. Permanent protection visas have now been issued to 2,871 applicantsâthat is, over 90 per cent of decided cases. Security and certainty have finally been restored to these people and they can begin to plan for family reunion.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There are still some 264 applications that cannot be finalised until security assessments by an outside agency are completed. As I said before, all children formerly in immigration detention and their families are now living in the community. In June this year, 149 detainees had been detained for more than two years. As of 27 October, of these 149 people, 102 have been released from immigration detention centres whether on a permanent or temporary protection visa or pending a bridging visa. Another five are awaiting security or character checks and 30 cases are with the minister or being prepared for submission to the minister. There is no doubt that progress is being made. However, much more remains to be done. The mental health status of many of the remaining detainees at Baxter and Villawood continues to decline, as is confirmed by independent psychiatric assessment. This remains a major concern.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We know what long-term detention means. Members from both sides, including my colleague the member for Canning, have visited immigration detention facilities. We have witnessed the impact of the terrible stress of living in an agony of uncertainty behind razor wire. The process of resolving the future of those who are still held in long-term detentionâfortunately a rapidly diminishing numberâmust continue and be accelerated. The review role of the Commonwealth Ombudsman is, I believe, critical in this process. At 27 October, the cases of 153 long-term detainees have been referred to the Ombudsman. This comprises 40 detainees who have reached the two-year mark since the end of June, as well as 113 of the detainees who already, at the end of June, had been in detention for two years or more.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The cases of all long-term detainees that existed at 17 June this year are to be referred to the Ombudsman before the end of the year. He has indicated that his office is prepared to consider appropriate information, including submissions from detaineesâ advocates and letters of support. The Ombudsman has set a maximum time frame of three months for providing an assessment of the case referred to by DIMIA but he does anticipate that most assessments will be finalised in much less than three months.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The governmentâs reforms are very substantial and further time will be required to implement them in full. I appreciate the efforts by Dr Peter Shergold, the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and the immigration departmentâs secretary, Mr Andrew Metcalfe, in particular. Tribute is due to the non-government organisations that have gone to great lengths in a short time to provide practical requirements for the reforms to be implemented, including the provision of accommodation in the wider community.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As was foreshadowed in June, this bill comprises the second major legislative element in the governmentâs reform package. In addition to the reform measures, there are two further aspects of the bill. One deals with technical amendments. The second is more significant. It relates to an issue arising out of the Palmer report on the circumstances of the detention of Cornelia Rauânamely, the identification of people in immigration detention. Without going into that aspect of this bill in any detail, I will say that events have demonstrated the need for the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to take great care to confirm the identity of people it may subject to detention and to deportation.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This bill introduces time limits concerning decisions on protection visa applications at both the primary decision and at the Refugee Review Tribunal stages. Secondly, it contains measures that give effect to the Commonwealth Ombudsmanâs enhanced role as the Immigration Ombudsman. As a result of these amendments, the minister and the Refugee Review Tribunal will be required to make a decision or complete a review of a decision on a protection visa within 90 days. Any protection visa applications and review applications that take longer than the 90 days must be reported to the minister, and these reports on delayed decisions of reviews must state why the 90-day time limit has not been met. The explanatory memorandum gives examples of reasons why the time limit may not be met, including âcooperation by the applicant, security-checking processes and the provision of information by other governmentsâ. These reports must be tabled both in this place and in the Senate.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Since June, the number of primary protection visa applications on foot has been reduced from 983 to 564 as at the start of November. Of that number, 111 remain unresolved after more than 90 days, down from 402 in June. The number of cases awaiting review by the Refugee Review Tribunal has also declined. In short, progress has been madeâsignificant progress, I believeâbut more needs to be done to ensure that all the requirements of this bill are met. I have been advised that, since the governmentâs reforms were announced, the department has already begun to expedite protection visa applications to ensure that they do not take longer than 90 days to decide. This has lessened long-term cases, particularly those applications by people in detention. Similarly, I have been advised that the Refugee Review Tribunal has already been seeking to operate within the 90-day limit.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The length of time taken to resolve the applications of people seeking protection in Australia not only prolongs the applicantâs emotional and mental distress; it causes extra psychological concerns. One hopes these people get significant psychological relief from the knowledge that there is a limit on the time their application for a protection visa or a Refugee Review Tribunal review of their application will take to be decided and that, if the time is exceeded, their case will be open to external review.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The second element of the reform package contained in this bill is amendments to the Migration Act and to the Ombudsman Act that give effect to the Ombudsmanâs enhanced role as the Immigration Ombudsman. Together, these amendments, which have been outlined in the ministerâs second reading speech, will improve the Ombudsmanâs ability to review immigration and detention complaints and to conduct inquiries quickly and efficiently.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There are a number of other concerns about the fate of asylum seekers in Australia. A particular concernâwhich is arising more oftenâinvolves asylum seekers within the community who are denied access to both work rights and to Medicare or other health care support. Last week, the Minister for Health and Ageing announced a new Medicare item for comprehensive health checks for refugees and other humanitarian entrants within six months of arrival. I believe this is a commendable measure which goes some way towards recognising the particular health needs that asylum seekers and refugees have in addition to suffering the same health problems as the general population. The Australian Medical Association, to its great credit, has recently drawn attention to this. However, there do remain a significant number of asylum seekers living in the community who have no access to Medicare or to other health care supports and who need access to work rights.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Not all the measures that were originally proposed by us have been realised in the governmentâs reforms, and I do appreciate the comments made by the member for Kingsford Smith about the role of some of us on the government side. However, as I have described, substantial strides have been made in ensuring more flexible, humane, compassionate and accountable treatment for asylum seekers and others in the immigration system. The implementation of the reforms agreed by the Prime Minister has been commenced speedily and humanely. We look forward to the continuation and ultimate conclusion of these reforms in the near future. This bill continues the process of ensuring that immigration policies are administered with greater fairness, timeliness and transparency. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>âIt is a pleasure to follow the member for Kooyong. I would like to congratulate him and his small band of colleagues for the work they have done and the role they have played in getting the <inline ref="R2454">Migration and Ombudsman Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline> beforethe House today. This bill amends the Migration Act 1958 to do a number of things: to introduce 90-day processing time limits for the determination of protection visa applications and for the completion of reviews by the Refugee Review Tribunal; to permit disclosure of identifying information to individuals or the public to assist with identifying or locating a person who is otherwise unable to be identified or located; and to enable the Ombudsman to contact an immigration detainee where that person has not made a complaint to the Ombudsman.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The bill also amends the Ombudsman Act 1976 to allow the Ombudsman to use the title âImmigration Ombudsmanâ when performing functions in relation to immigration and detention; to make it explicit that the Ombudsman can perform functions and exercise powers under other Commonwealth or ACT legislation; to enable an agency or person to provide information to the Ombudsman notwithstanding any law that would otherwise prevent them doing so; and to clarify that the actions of contractors and subcontractors in exercising powers or performing functions for or on behalf of Australian government agencies will be taken to be the actions of the relevant agency. This bill also makes some technical amendments to the Migration Act and the Migration Legislation Amendment Act (No. 1) 2001.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This bill is here today because of pressure on this government for changes to how we deal with and treat people who come to Australia seeking asylum from various unbearable or inhumane conditions in their own countries. Let us be very clear about the fact that this bill is not here because the government has any commitment to the principles upon which this bill is based. The bill is here because of community pressure, including pressure from the ALP. The final straw was pressure from a few government backbenchers who took the step of threatening to introduce their own bill to make changes to how we treat asylum seekers. I have already congratulated the member for Kooyong and should place on record my congratulations to him and to the members of that government backbench group.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The government has introduced this bill, has been forced into this action, because it had to do something to quieten down the debate. This bill represents the smallest price the government could pay and get some peace on the issue. But this peace will be short lived, because there is still a lot of work to be done and lots of improvements to be made in this area. Some of the changes still to be made are reflected in the amendments to this bill which were moved by the member for Watson. Those government members who finally threw their weight behind others who have been campaigning on these issues for a very long time should be proud of themselves for taking this action. But I do have to say that they were silent for a very long time and on a number of occasions in the last few years voted against Labor motions trying to do the very things that they eventually put forward. Their action was initiated and was successful because of the sustained campaigning of many people throughout Australia. This is an example of what persistence can achieve. Let us just hope we do not have to wait as long as we have done to get more desperately needed changes made.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The ALP have been arguing for some time now for the removal of children from detention and for a faster and more transparent system of processing protection visas. Laborâs policy at the last election was for a system whereby 90 per cent of protection visa applications would be processed in 90 days. Our policy established an ombudsman to report on people detained for more than 90 days and on a monthly basis thereafter. We have been arguing for an independent inspector-general of detention to monitor conditions and resolve complaints; for a guarantee of independent medical and media access to detention centres; and for detention centres to be managed by Commonwealth officers on Commonwealth territory.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The bill here today and the previous bill go some way towards these policies, but not far enough. In more recent times we have seen a series of incidents which point to appalling incompetence and indifference within the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. We have seen Cornelia Rau, a mentally ill Australian citizen detained for months in a detention centre. We have seen Vivian Alvarez Solon, the victim of a car accident and also an Australian citizen, deported overseasâluckily into the hands of a caring hospice but left there to die by this government. Once she was foundâdue more to the efforts of her former husband than anything elseâshe was subjected to months of negotiations with this government about the conditions of her return to her home country.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Now we see Robert Jovicic, who has lived in Australia for almost all of his life, deported to Serbia because he has committed crimes here in Australia. This deportation took place in June 2004. I understand that Mr Jovicicâs parents are Serbian but Mr Jovicic was not born there, does not speak the language and is now stateless and destitute and sleeping on the steps of the Australian Embassy in Serbia. The minister has the authority to cancel the visa of a noncitizen found guilty of a crime which leads to a lengthy prison sentence. This law has now been used to deport a person who is, in all ways except formally, an Australian.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is just too easy to use this law to remove a problem which is common enough in Australia. There are many people living on our streets who suffer from psychiatric illnesses and who are drug users. Many of these people end up in prison. Deporting one such person, because someone found a means of doing so, does not address this problem in our society.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">All these incidents demonstrate a department which has developed a culture of suspicion and a marked lack of any humanity or regard for people. I put the blame for this development squarely in the lap of this minister and her predecessor. I am sure there are many good and decent public servants in the department, but they are forced to respond to a culture pushed down on them from above.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The shadow minister for immigration, the member for Watson, has moved an amendment to this bill which addresses this point.Â  It reads:</para>

</motion>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I thoroughly support this amendment. Another area that the government continues to ignore is the plight of temporary protection visa and bridging visa holders. Whilst the bill here today addresses the issue of timely processing of claims, it does not help the thousands of TPV and bridging visa holders who are left to drift through our society with no support or certainty of their future.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Asylum Seeker Project, ASP, based at Melbourneâs Hotham Mission has identified countless cases of human beings falling through the enormous cracks in this system. The ASP is one of those groups that have taken up the responsibility of caring for community based asylum seekers while the government turns its back, and those involved in that project know what they are talking about. A study of theirs goes some way to illustrating the huge problems that remain in the system, despite the changes we are examining here.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Asylum Seeker Project study of 200 community based asylum seekers found that 95 per cent had no work rights or Medicare benefits; 68 per cent were homeless or at risk of homelessness; 44 per cent were in debt to friends, lawyers or had outstanding bills or detention costs; and 24 per cent were refused medical treatment because of their asylum seeker status. In light of those facts, can anyone here sincerely claim that the problems of the immigration system are being fixed? The ALP has committed itself to ensuring asylum seekers and refugees in the Australian community have appropriate health and income support.Â  They need to be allowed to work. We need to remove the burden of support for asylum seekers from the states, welfare organisations and churches.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Where is the government on these issuesâwhere is its response to the ongoing suffering and hardship of these human beings? Since July 1997 all asylum seekers who apply for a protection visa after 45 days of arriving are denied the right to work. Those who apply within 45 days lose their work rights if they make a request to the minister to intervene under section 417 of the Migration Act.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Asylum seekers living in the community do not want charity, nor do they want to be reliant on welfare. They simply want the right to earn a living, support their families and contribute to the Australian economy while their application is being processed. Many asylum seekers bring with them skills and experiences that are in short supply in Australia. A recent skills audit of a sample of work rights in eligible asylum seekers in Victoria found that 71 per cent of those surveyed had qualifications or skills that matched those listed on the skills occupations list for the general skills migration scheme. The audit also revealed qualified accountants, auto-electricians, chefs, hairdressers and nurses as well as a number of other professions and trades that are listed on that scheme. This is at a time when the government has increased the skilled migration intake by 20,000 people in an attempt to address Australiaâs skills shortages. TPV and bridging visa holders need to be allowed to work. They need access to good health care and the dignity that goes with all of this.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Finally, I want to talk about how our detention centres are managed.Â  Earlier this year the ANAOâthe Australian National Audit Officeâissued an audit report into the management of detention centres. The ANAO reported that DIMIA had a contract with GSL for the provision of services to people in detention. This contract is worth about $100 million per year. I should precede my remarks by noting that this government sells itself to the electorate as a good economic manager, but that claim is not supported by this report. The ANAO has found that the contracting out of the management of the detention centres is not being well managed. The government, which claims to be a good economic manager, cannot manage to put together a decent contract or establish how the performance of this contract is to be measured. The ANAO reports:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">â¦ the Contract does not establish clear expectations for the level and quality of services to be delivered; mechanisms to protect the Commonwealthâs interests are not clear; and there is insufficient information about the quality of services being delivered and their costs to allow a value-for-money calculation.</para>
</quote>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">DIMIAâs monitoring of GSLâs performance focuses on Incidents (with considerable discretion on reporting and what is an Incident) and, as a consequence, DIMIA is not able to provide assurance that all its standards are being met as expected.</para>

<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">An important element of the accountability framework in managing contracts on behalf of the Commonwealth is to ensure that the interests of the Commonwealth are protected as far as possible. The ANAO concluded that the terms of the liability, indemnity and insurance regime in the Contract are unclear to the point that it is not possible for the Commonwealth to know with any certainty what insurances are effected, what risks are covered, and to what extent the insurance cover that has been obtained is limited or qualified.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The ANAO said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Although DIMIA has publicly stated the need to report on âefficientâ detention, the cost and productivity data available indicate that contract administration costs have risen appreciably over the life of the Contract, against a falling detainee population. However, DIMIA does not have sufficient relevant and credible information about the quality of services being delivered and their costs, to determine whether the delivery of detention services is improving over time, or other factors are resulting in increased costs.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">In other words, the contract with GSL is not clear about how performance is to be measured, it has been left to GSL to determine when an incident should be reported, the protection of Commonwealth assets is not properly managed, and curiously the costs of providing these services has increased despite a falling population in the detention centres and no-one can say why this is so.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In summary, the measures in this bill are welcome, but they do not go anyway near far enough in addressing the endemic problems within the department of immigration or in addressing the shortfalls in the way we process applications from those seeking asylum in this country or how we look after them during that process. The new measures are a step in the right direction, and for that reason I welcome them. But I remind members on both sides of the House that so much more is left to be done. This bill may have silenced some critics for the moment, but decency has not been satisfied and much more work needs to be done.</para>

<para>âI would like to thank the members for their contributions to the <inline ref="S482">Migration and Ombudsman Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline>. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the opposition and the minor parties for supporting it, and I remind the House that this is a necessary step in the continuing development and improvement of migration law and administration in Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The bill will improve the speed and transparency of protection visa decision making by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and the Refugee Review Tribunal. It will ensure a greater level of accountability and explanation of the protection visa determination process, assist the Ombudsman to handle immigration and detention complaints and inquiries swiftly and efficiently, and allow immigration officers to better identify or locate persons in connection with the administration of the act by finetuning important protections given to the release of personal identifiers, which has been something of a problem in recent cases.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The amendments generally build on reforms to immigration detention arrangements announced by the Prime Minister in June this year and other arrangements that the government has introduced in recent times. Specifically, the bill provides a 90-day time limit for decision on all primary protection visa applications and any subsequent Refugee Review Tribunal review of such decisions. This time limit has been introduced in line with the Prime Ministerâs announcement to ensure that applications are finalised in a prompt and transparent manner; however, the time limits will not operate to the disadvantage of applicants.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Departmental officers and RRT members will continue to be obliged to make fair decisions in a manner that gives applicants a clear opportunity to present their case. Where these time limits have not been met, the bill requires that periodic reports will be provided to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs by the secretary and principal members of the RRT on the reasons why these time limits were not met, including factors outside the control of the department and the tribunal. Those reports will be tabled by the minister in parliament. The reports will provide additional assurance to the parliament and the public that protection visa and review applications are dealt with in a timely manner.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On 14 July this year, the government announced that the Ombudsman would be given an enhanced role as the Immigration Ombudsman. The bill will enable the Ombudsman, when investigating matters of immigration and detention, to call himself or herself the Immigration Ombudsman.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The bill contains a range of provisions to support and facilitate the Ombudsman in dealing with immigration and detention complaints and inquiries as expeditiously as possible. For example, the bill will facilitate the early provision of information to the Ombudsman by providing that disclosure of information to the Ombudsman during a preliminary inquiry or investigation will be taken to be authorised by law for the purposes of the Privacy Act and not prevented by any other Commonwealth enactment.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Amendments also provide that action by Commonwealth contractors and subcontractors in the exercise of a power or the performance of a function for or on behalf of an agency will be taken for the purpose of the Ombudsman Act to be action by the agency where the contract is for the provision of goods or services to the public.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The bill repeals the current provision in the Migration Act 1958 that excludes immigration detainees who have not made a complaint to the Ombudsman from the entitlement which would otherwise apply to receive mail from the Ombudsman. This will enable the Ombudsman to contact immigration detainees at his or her own initiative.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The finetuning that has been done in relation to the release of personal identifiers is part of the governmentâs response to the recommendation of the inquiry into the circumstances of the immigration detention of Cornelia Rau. One of the concerns of the inquiry was that DIMIA had been reluctant to publicly release photographs of Ms Rau during the departmentâs efforts to identify her. The bill provides power for this type of disclosure and generally strengthens the ability of migration officers to perform their functions under the Migration Act.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The bill contains proposed technical amendments which are consequential to the commencement of provisions contained in the Legislative Instruments Act 2003, which commenced on 1 January 2005. These technical amendments are necessary to preserve the operation of various migration legislation provisions following the commencement of the Legislative Instruments Act. The provisions have to date been preserved by transitional regulations. As well as preserving the operation of numerous migration legislation provisions, this bill ensures that migration legislation is consistent with the new legal and procedural framework created by the Legislative Instruments Act.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">During the second reading debate some points were raised. The honourable member for Watson referred to a 90-day period and said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">There is a good reason why we want the 90-day rule that is in this bill ... mandatory detention should not mean indefinite detention.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The member appears to have been referring to the oppositionâs policy that immigration detention be reviewed after 90 days. He then went on to attribute the initiatives of the bill to the Labor Party. I draw to the attention of the House and the honourable member to the fact that the amendments in this bill relate to the processing times for protection visa applications. They relate to all protection visa applicants. These amendments are not about detention, nor do they only apply to protection visa applicants in detention. I draw the honourable member for Watsonâs attention to the fact that over 95 per cent of persons currently seeking a primary decision on their protection visa applications are in the community; they are not in immigration detention.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The member for Watson also raised the conclusions of Mr Palmer and Mr Comrie that there have been cultural problems within the immigration department. This government is committing $230 million over the next five years to address many issues raised by the Commonwealth Ombudsmanâs report, including the establishment of a college of immigration, border security and compliance to deliver comprehensive operational training for DIMIA officers; and the establishment of a 12-month pilot program to develop a holistic community care model to improve the health and the wellbeing of detainees.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The government will also be boosting funding to immediately address IT deficiencies identified by Mr Palmer in the areas of border control, compliance and detention management systems; for the establishment of a new client services division within the department to drive a client service culture and systems throughout it; and for the Commonwealth Ombudsman to fulfil his enhanced role as Immigration Ombudsman, as spelt out in this bill, as well as expanding his powers in examining detention and compliance activities.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This bill contains important and necessary initiatives. It is a reflection of our governmentâs commitment to be transparent and accountable. On behalf of the government I thank all those involved in the passage of this bill.</para>

<para>âThe tumbling of the Berlin Wall and the crumbling of the former communist regimes of eastern Europe had enormous consequences for those of us living in Western democracies. New markets were opened up to us and enormous economic opportunities flowed and continue to flow. But those of us living in Western democracies can hope to have only a small idea of the consequences of the lowering of the Iron Curtain for many central eastern Europe states and even some western Asian states. In 1991 the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was established to help these countries through the transition to democracy and the concept of free market economies. The bank uses tools of investment to assist countries, currently numbering 27, from central Europe to parts of Asia. On 30 January 2004 the bankâs board of governors unanimously voted to admit Mongolia into its sphere of operation. The <inline ref="R2467">European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Amendment Bill 2005</inline> amends article 1 of the agreement establishing the bank to allow Mongoliaâs entry. On that basis the opposition supports the bill.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Australiaâs commitment to supporting our European friends, and, indeed, our struggling friends in parts of Asia, is an important one in both moral and economic terms. It is no secret that, taken as a whole, Europe is lagging behind the rest of the world both in unemployment and in the pace of economic growth. There are many challenges for the European Union and the broader international economy in helping to modernise the economies of many of the former Eastern bloc countries, and the bank plays an important role in this regard. The opposition values our economic relations with Europe. Taken as a whole, the EU is Australiaâs largest economic partner when taking into account two-way trade in goods and services, investment and transfers. While Australia runs a considerable trade imbalance with the EUâsomething we all hope will improveâit is nevertheless an important market. Trade is in many ways better balanced than other markets, owing to better diversification of merchandise and service trade. Services trade with the EU is Australiaâs largest export market, an area that is crucial for us to grow further. Also, despite the subsidies of European primary producers, Australian exports of food have grown almost 140 per cent in the last eight years.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Conflict over agricultural subsidies in the EU has dominated market access issues in Australian EU multilateral trade negotiations more generally. Reform of these subsidies and other regulatory issues has been making glacial progress, and few would disagree that reform needs to be hastened. Hastening economic reforms in Europe in developed and developing economies alike will be of mutual benefit to EU and non-EU countries alike. It is a two-way street. We gladly and enthusiastically participate in granting assistance to our friends in other nations, including those in the old Eastern bloc, but as a country we do expect the game to be played very fairly and these forms of assistance to be reciprocated in kind. But this bill is eminently supportableâMongoliaâs entry into the bankâs sphere of influence and operations is obviously important to that countryâand on that basis the opposition is happy to lend its support.</para>

<para>âI rise to support the <inline ref="R2467">European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Amendment Bill 2005</inline> and the provision of the legislative impetus to add Mongolia as the 28th member of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the EBRD. The work of the EBRD obviously has its historic origins in 1991. Many of the Bretton Woods institutions and international bodies were formed out of the optimism of a post-conflict environment, and that was no different with the collapse of the Soviet empire and the many states that had puppet communist governments. There was, of course, a power vacuum and a need to transition rapidly into a more financially liberalised international economy. There was also some belief that the EC were not fully prepared to fill that role, given their strategic and geographic location, and that was why it was important to set up a body like the EBRD.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Looking back now and having the benefit of 15 years to look at their achievements, we can see that it has not been without criticism, and I would like to reflect a little on that but also point out that the addition of Mongolia is an important extension. It geopolitically moves the bankâs role, as we see with the African, Latin American and Asian development banks, right across the Asian region, and there is no more worthy a new entrant to the sphere of influence of the EBRD than Mongolia, given its landlocked location between two great superpowers. Of course, Mongolia itself has an economic history that is of great interest to Australia. Once referred to somewhat disparagingly as the 16th Soviet republic for its strong links to Russia, Mongolia managed to foster very early diplomatic links with about 50 countries, even while it was closely linked to Russia. But I think that what we have seen over the last 20 years has been a real reorientation towards the rest of the world, an effort to open up, and that is what makes Mongolia a perfect additional candidate to join the ranks of the EBRD.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">That history goes back, I think, to the thawing of Sino-Mongolian relationships in the mid-1980s. We see now what have been important trade links, a real reorientation in exportation. Fifty per cent of all Mongoliaâs exports now are to China and only about four per cent are to Russia. We have seen agreements enabling Mongolia to export their produce directly out of a Chinese port. We have seen them turning to international bodies. There were early links with the IMF in 1991 and with the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development, part of the World Bank group, soon after that, in 1996. We saw them joining up with ASEAN, we saw the ascension to the WTO in 1996 and now, obviously, they are looking towards APEC.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In many respects, Mongolia had a faltering beginning. In 1991 it first started to reopen its monasteries and churches. There were over 100 independent newspapers and news outletsâindependent of government. But also there was a sort of re-evolution of the national consciousness in Mongolia. There had almost been a sense that they did not want to talk about their history while they had that relationship with that larger Soviet neighbour to the north.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In Mongolia we have now seen rapid population growth; with that come needs for development. There may well be just one person per 1.6 kilometres. They have many economic virtues that are yet to be fully exploited. Like Australia, in many cases they are quite isolated. They are exporting copper and gold. They have many other minerals yet to be fully assessed. They have a burgeoning but small manufacturing and food processing industry. They are all areas where Australia can make a contribution but, more importantly, and pertinent to this bill, they provide every reason for Mongolia to enjoy the benefits that the EBRD can offer.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Before I talk about some of the criticisms that have been levelled at the EBRD, it is important to note that it has made massive steps in the last few years in response to some of those criticisms. Early on, there was some Anglo-Saxon scepticism about the work of the EBRD and whether it was geographically centred too much on the caucuses and eastern Europe. The bank has answered that criticism. It has spread and it has evolved. Keep in mind that in many cases it picked up its early work from very moribund economies. It was not operating in a monopoly environment; there were other banks competing for that attention as well. It was operating in situations where there were low levels of confidence, certainly in the private sectorâin areas where the private sector was not yet willing to stand alone and take chances on small- to medium-sized enterprises and not willing to take a chance with soft loans. Obviously, as with all international banks, the donor countries to the EBRD have some concerns about returns. Then there is the overhanging concern for any international banking organisation: that their disbursements can keep up with their commitments. Last year there were â¬4.1 billion worth of commitments, and disbursements of about â¬3.4 billion. EBRD has done something about that, and that is not a bad achievement.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">If we look cumulatively at their achievements, $28 billion has been lent over their history. They have managed to attract $US52 billion from other sources, for a total of around $78 billion. That is an impressive achievement itself and it is a sign of the confidence of those private-public relationships.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to say just a few words about what is unique about the EBRD in the context of Mongoliaâs joining. The EBRD was the first of the international institutions to write into its goals a focus on environmental sustainability. That should be recognised. The World Bank group, in its quality assurance group work, was always looking at environmental implications for its lending, but never before had a bank specifically written that into its goals. That should be acknowledged. Also it had a focus on democracy and governance. It had a focus not just on the corporate sector or individual businesses but on moving the country towards a more democratic frontierâand in many cases it has been successful.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is worth noting that in April last year the EBRD took the very bold step of saying, âNo, weâre not going to lend to Uzbekistan. Thereâs been a democratic compact that youâve failed on. Youâve failed to develop civic society. Weâve given you a series of goals in public policy that youâve either flouted or failed to achieve.â For an international bank to say that they are withdrawing from that frontier, after sustained criticism from the NGO sector, is an achievement. I applaud them for that. They did not persist where it was completely impossible in a completely hostile governance arrangement. They said âenough is enoughâ and they withdrew. That was a very important signal to the rest of the world and to other banking institutions that, if countries are not working towards a more democratic system, one that benefits the entire population, they can say no.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Today the EBRDâs work is already well developed in central Europe. They already have substantial loans to and projects in Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. That makes Mongolia a logical extension of, and probably completes the extension towards, the APEC rim. As I say, adding Mongolia is the right step to take. The reason we are proposing the changes in the bill today is that part of the requirement of the EBRD is that a legislative change is made to give that membership the impetus in all of its member nations. I think there are almost 50 of them, plus two intergovernmental groups, that effectively are the creditor nations to the EBRD.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The EBRDâs work has changed over the last few years. These changes will benefit Mongolia. There has been a shift away from the dimeric relationship of merchant banking and development assistance. That was something that was unique about the EBRD. They tried to run a very strong merchant banking arm. I know that the member for Wentworth may touch on that in his contribution. But we have found that the private banking sector can do it better. In response to that, the EBRD has very much downsized and de-emphasised the merchant banking role.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The great benefit of that dimeric relationship when it was conceived was that there would be a real sense of developmental economics woven into the merchant banking work but there would also be a real sense of corporate awareness and a focus on return in their development assistance work, which has often been lacking in some international investment. That was the dream anyway.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The criticism in the 1990s was that information for ordinary citizens about the work of the EBRD in their own country was insufficient. The EBRD responded, in 2000 I think, with their public information policy, their PIP. Some would say that that has not gone far enough. You can see this tension in the work of any funding body or developmental organisation: how do you ensure that the rights and the views of every citizen are considered, particularly when you are a bank working with, say, the corporate sector?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In response to that, moving the corporate sector to a more privatised, entrepreneurial and responsive system to internationalise financial flows was one step in the early 1990s. Now we have seen the shift that I believe the EBRD had to make. It has moved to small to medium enterprises and a real focus on working on the ground, having lots of bankers working in the field rather than in large headquarters. They are all positive indications that the EBRD is evolving, that it is looking to what we call early transition economies, that it is shifting its lending away from some of the recent EU membership and some of the more successful and more completely transitioned economies to the newer, poorer economies. That is also a great sign of responsiveness.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The year 2004 was a tumultuous one for that institution. Look at eastern Europe and central Asia. Never has the connection between politics and economy been more fully exemplified. In early 2004 we saw the early election results in Georgia, where a population stood up and said, âThat is not good enough.â Those people forced a new election.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">At the end of 2004 in the Ukraine we saw the run-off elections that were effectively contaminated by corruption. The standoff between Yanukovich and Yushchenko resulted in the re-run-off election on 26 December. I was privileged enough to be an election observer for that. At that time and during the orange revolution, the huge optimism in that economy for a new, more transparent and more democratic process was held high. I have to make a note that, when we look back over 12 months, it has been a very rocky year for that nation.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Mongolia will now benefit from some of the advantages of the EBRD, but it is important to contain some of the optimism that there will be massive changes. In 2004 we saw a very close fought election in Mongolia and a return to the MPRP, which was the original government during Soviet times. There has been a full circle move there in a political sense and elections will be held again in 2008. While it was a knife-edge result in that election, we hope for four years of stability to start to bed down some of the opportunities in Mongolia. Let us talk about those.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">For Australia, our import-export relationship is, I think it would be fair to say, fairly underdeveloped. We are about 44th in the ranking of trade, in both imports and exports. The main exports to Mongolia have been primarily mining and exploratory equipment to do survey work there. There are enormous opportunities, as there are for many nations in the region. The arrival of the EBRD gives a chance to some projects that are beyond the aid giving of Australiaâwhich, I should note, has increased tenfold in 15 years, from $300,000 to $2.9 million. It gives many opportunities for some of the larger infrastructure work to provide the platform from which Australian aid can benefit. That is important to remember. It is often very difficult for a country to come in with free and stand-alone programs, particularly in a country where we do not have a major international relations focus. With the EBRD arriving as an additional donor and Mongolia being eligible for those funds, our efforts in international aid and development can only benefit.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">A good point to conclude on is that the arrival of Mongolia as a new member of the EBRD may not have enormous strategic significance to Australia, but on the plus side of the equation is the responsiveness of the EBRD. I think it is evolving to meet the needs of the area, as we see the ripple effect from Central Asia and the expansion of the EU. Mongolia is the right country to benefit from it and is possibly, in that sense of geographic expansion, the last of the states to be added to the EBRD.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We see opportunities for Australia to expand its importation and exportation balance. We have already seen a visit in April this year by the Speaker, the members for Herbert and Fisher and a number of others from the other side of the chamberâan important step in our links with Mongolia. We have also seen earlier visits, both from the Mongolian side, which has its diplomatic mission based in Beijing, and from Chris Gallus, the former Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I am optimistic about where we are going with our relationship with Mongolia. Mongolia has certainly been outward focused, and that is a good thing. It has worked very hard on the democratic and participatory, governance based institutions that make it a more promising location to invest. For those reasons, in addition to the presence already of the World Bank Group, which is not insubstantial, I welcome the addition of Mongolia to the EBRD. I support this bill, which gives the legislative impetus. I look forward to a strengthened relationship between Australia and Mongolia in the future.</para>

<para>âMr Deputy Speaker Causley, beyond the normal thanks I thank you for coming up beyond your normal responsibilities to chair the chamber so that I would be free to speak, and I am very grateful for that; thank you very much. I am not sure everybody else will be grateful, but I am! I, of course, will be supporting the <inline ref="R2467">European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Amendment Bill 2005</inline>, because I concur with the view that, if the EBRD wishes to extend its services to Mongolia, we as a participating member should support that. It is a minor issue for the EBRD but a major issue for Mongolia, and there is no reason why we should not be positive about that.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to raise a few queries about the broader question of Australiaâs participation in the EBRD. I do that explicitly accepting that I was one of the ministers who actively advocated Australiaâs original membership. As the trade minister at the time, I examined the question and felt that, although it was a fairly marginal case, on balance Australia should participate. A lot of people have said that Australia should participate in this bank as a good international citizen participating in international institutions doing positive things. I have to say that that is a principle fairly selectively applied, because there are other international development banks in areas of greater need in which Australia does not participate. I do not particularly advocate our participation in those; I simply note that we have to be careful about Eurocentric double standards where we think we should be enthusiastically helping moderately well-off countries in a very important transition to democracyâwhich I absolutely welcome and am happy to give assistance toâbut where we decline to participate in helping the poorest countries try to make their transition out of poverty.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The fact that this is unquestionably, on the part of the international community, an institution set up with good intentions is not of itself sufficient to justify our continuing participation. While it was a part of our original decision, and a welcome partâI certainly do not apologise for it; I think it is a positive elementâwhat tipped the balance, particularly for me then as trade minister but for the government of the day, were the hope and expectation that participation in the EBRD would enhance the possibility of Australian companies participating in the development work that would flow from the re-emerging market economies of Eastern Europe.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I have to say that, while I support this bill and I hope it brings significant assistance to Mongolia, it represents a very substantial eastward creep beyond the original expectation of what the EBRD would cover. Australia is an active participant in the Asian Development Bank, and I am a bit puzzled about why that bank is not actually a significantly more appropriate institution to play a major role in Mongolia. That is no reason for us to quibble about the EBRD wanting to provide assistance there, but I do think it is a little odd. I do not think countries are assisted by a proliferation of institutions assisting within their territory. The World Bank Group is there, and I think the ADB would be more appropriate there than the EBRD.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">But I have no problem with the bill. Mongolia has made this application and the EBRD has given it a positive response, and we should support that. For so long as we are members of the EBRD, we should be responsible members, and a responsible member should support this propositionâand this parliament should pass this legislation. In any event, quite properly, the Treasurer has made a commitment on behalf of Australia that we will do this and the parliament should honour that commitmentâand I actually agree with what the Treasurer has done. Once the bank received the request, it was the appropriate thing to give it a positive response.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">But I do have questions I want to ask. First, has there been a review of the benefits to Australian companies flowing from the decision to participate in the EBRD? I am not aware of one. I have seen no evidence of one, and I see very little evidence that any benefit has flowed. I am not as positive as the member for Bowman about the EBRDâs history and role in the area. There has been a significant economic transformation and a positive, if more modest, political transformation in the countries of the region, and it is probable that the EBRD has made a net positive contribution to that. I am not as sure that the original conception, which I supported at the time, was correct. Nevertheless, the body exists.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would like to see what review has been done of the benefits which have flowed to Australian companies from participation, because, while there is no ongoing annual cost to the Australian budget under the current funding of the EBRDâsomething I want to raise a question about in a momentâAustralia has approximately $90 million of capital tied up in the EBRD. Is that money delivering benefits to Australian companies by facilitating their effective participation in the programs of the EBRD? I am extremely dubious about whether it is but, if there has been a review that says it is, I would like to see the outcome. In the great scheme of the Commonwealth budget $90 million is not very much moneyâand it is not something that could fund ongoing recurrent expenditure, because it is a capital itemâbut I think there is a case for asking whether this $90 million could be better used in the interests of Australian citizens and taxpayers.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would note in passing that our participation in the EBRD has created, to the best of my knowledge, only one job for Australians. That is the job of director, which has been successively held under this government by failed former ministers. One I regard as a very decent human being is Jim Short, a former senator who was very unlucky to lose his portfolio as a result of a technical breachâin the times when there were ministerial standards in this government. He was called upon to resign. I think that was probably a correct decision, but I do not think he did anything major or grievous and I did not really object to his being sent to do the job at the EBRD as a consequence. However, the fact that former Minister Reith has wound up in this cushy sinecure is, in my view, an outrage, although I do not think that that is sufficient reason for us to withdraw from the EBRD. It is what I would call an incidental benefit.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">However, I am seriously concerned as to whether we are appropriately allocating our international effort and interest by continuing to have a full-time director at the EBRD and by continuing to have our capital wrapped up there when we could perhaps use that to make a more effective contribution in the area of our primary interest in the Asia-Pacific region or in areas where need is greater or when we could apply that capital to domestic purposes, for which there are many alternative and better demands.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I do not know who is going to sum up on this bill on behalf of the government, but I noticed earlierâand I still think it is the caseâthat there were no Treasury people here taking notes. That is an inappropriate situation, if that is the case. It is an oversight that should not be allowed to continue. I am advised that the procedure flowing from the passage of the second reading of this bill is that a not uncommon statement will be made that the Governor-General has approved an appropriation for the purpose of this bill and that the financial impact statement in the explanatory memorandum says that this bill will have no significant financial impact. I cannot understand why it will have any, and I would like an explanation of why it will have some. If it is the case that it involves some minor increase in our capital, that would not lead me to oppose the bill, because it will be minor, but I would like to know. There is nothing in the ministerâs speech or in the explanatory memorandum to say so, and there is nothing on the face of my understanding of the nature of our commercial and contractual relationship with the EBRD to explain why there should be any appropriation for the purposes of this bill, and I would like an explanation of why that is so.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Notwithstanding that I have those major queries about our long-term association with the EBRD, so long as we are a member I certainly support the fact that we should be a responsible, positive member and that we should honour the governmentâs commitment and support the introduction of Mongolia. As the member for Bowman said, Mongolia is a participant in our region. It is a country that we have had the honour of effectively representing at the World Bank and the IMF. I have had that honour myself, and I have met with senior officials from Mongolia during the course of that process. We do have a small but positive relationship with Mongolia, which should be enhanced and developed over time. For all those reasons, I support the bill but I do call for a review of our long-term association with the EBRD.</para>

<para>âLike the previous speakers, I, too, support the <inline ref="R2467">European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Amendment Bill 2005</inline>. I think Mongolia is a very appropriate addition to the ranks of countries that the EBRD will support and assist. In effect, Mongolia was a client state of the Soviet Union for most of the last century and, as a consequence, most of its institutions were derived from Soviet models. The experience that the EBRD has had in investing and promoting economic reform in the former Soviet Union and its various satellites will stand it in very good stead with Mongolia. Notwithstanding its proximity to China and its long historical association with China, Mongolia had, in its governmental and political structure prior to its democratisation, much more of a Russian, or Soviet, feel about it than a Chinese one.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The member for Fraser questioned Australiaâs involvement with the EBRD, I think in part because he wondered whether the support that we give the EBRDâwhich is not enormous, as we all knowâwould be better devoted to other, poorer, countries. While there are some relatively prosperous countries in the ranks of the EBRDâs clientsâin particular, I am talking about the eight countries that joined the European Union last year: Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland and Hungary, the so-called EU8âthey, together with Croatia, represent, by any measure, countries that are moving dynamically down the road to prosperity.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The criticismâthis is the most substantive criticism that has been made of the EBRD in recent yearsâhas been that it should cease operating in those countries because its work is done. It should, for example, close its office in Ljubljana in Sloveniaâa country which is prospering so well, in large measure due to the EBRDâs efforts and of course the lure of EU accessionâand take those resources and move them further east. Last year, for example, of the â¬4 billion invested by the EBRD, just under â¬1 billion of thatââ¬960 millionâwas invested in these advanced countries, the EU8 plus Croatia. By comparison, only â¬316 million was invested in central Asia, which is the poorest part of the EBRDâs client base. Of that â¬316 million, â¬246 million was invested in one countryâKazakhstan. I mentioned earlier the differences in terms of poverty across the EBRDâs clients. In Tajikistan for example, 70 per cent of the population is living in poverty. By any measure, that is a very poor country.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The fundamental problem that all of these countries faced when they emerged from communism was a lack of law. As the member for Fraser would recall, in the early 1990s I spent a lot of time working on investment projects, mostly in the mining sector, in emerging post-communist countries, in particular Russia, and also Chinaâif you describe China as a post-communist countryâwhere I recall meeting the member for Fraser at a conference in Dalian more than 10 years ago.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">When I was working in Russia on a large mining project in the early nineties, shortly after the fall of communism, the fundamental legal problem was that there was no legal system. All of these communist countries had on paper very elaborate legal systems, with courts and appeals and constitutions and regulations and so forth, but they had never been applied other than in a theoretical and cosmetic way. All of those countries, the Soviet Union in particular, had been run as command economies, and insofar as there was a legal process or a facsimile of a legal process it was run through the organs of the Communist Party. Once the Communist Party collapsed, there was in effect no legal system left.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The former communist countries in central Europe had a distinct memory of the rule of law and of civil institutions and were able to recreate them much more quickly than the countries further east, many of which had had no experience in their history of democracy or of the rule of law in the way that we understand it. Initially the EBRDâwhile it was set up to achieve political goals; that is to say, the development of democracy, rule of law, free markets and so forthâwas obliged to operate as a commercial bank. Indeed, for most of its life it has been a profitable bank. It had a very bad year following the Russian bond collapse in 1998, but since then it has been doing well. With that requirement that it actually operate commercially and profitably, it was inevitable that the bulk of its investment in the early decades was going to be in those countries that progressed most quickly to legal systems and political systems that were conducive to investment.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Basically what investors needâand this is particularly so in the resources sectorâis the confidence of knowing that the laws will be enforced and upheld, that their investment will not be expropriated and that they will not be stood over and have bribes demanded of them at any point, let alone at some indeterminate point in the future. So certainty, reliability and integrity are absolutely key. That is why, when we talk about foreign aid and the alleviation of poverty around the world, the Australian government is right in focusing its aid efforts on improving governance. Invariably, countries that are well governed and that have a system of democracy that works or a rule of law that is maintained will be able, all other things being equal, to develop a prosperous society where there are opportunities for all.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">But that change of culture is an enormous one, and I will give you an example. I remember that in 1993 or 1994 I met with a senior politician in the Duma in Moscow to talk about some legislation they were passing which would have had an impact on the project with which I was involved.</para>

<para>âThe member for Bowman has asked me whether it was about vodka. It may well have been inspired by some vodka, but it was in fact about natural resources. This senior politician planned to run for president, and he said, âWhen I am president, I will have Yeltsin shot.â I said: âReally? Has it occurred to you that, if you keep expressing this intention of having your political opponent shot, he will make it impossible for you ever to win an election?â We had this long conversation in which I pointed out to him that one of the merits of the Western system of democracy was that, when presidents or prime ministers lost elections, far from being shot, they went off into honoured retirement with a pension and that this, therefore, made them more scrupulous in conducting elections and less likely to take extreme measures to avoid being removed from office.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">I would not say this was a complete revelation to him, but it gave him a lot of food for thought. It occurred to me as I was sitting there that it underlined what a very, very big cultural gap there was. Of course, in a lot of these countriesâand Russia is a very good case in pointâyou had enormous differences in terms of the cultural awareness of how democracies work and how the rule of law works. You had an elite group, many of whom had worked with the foreign ministry, and particularly with the foreign intelligence service, who had quite a bit of experience of the Western world and understood very well how it operated. But there were many others who had no idea at all. One of the interesting contrasts between the Soviet Union and Chinaâa very significant difference in my viewâis that, right up until the fall of communism in the Soviet Union, very few Russians were educated outside the Soviet Union or were educated in the West, unless they had left in an unauthorised way.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">China, on the other hand, from the end of the Cultural Revolution has been exporting thousandsâit must by now be hundreds of thousands if not millionsâof students to the West. When I was doing business at this time, about 10 years ago, in both China and Russia, the thing that struck me was how few Russians spoke English, how few had an understanding of the Western world, and yet I would then flyâgenerally from Irkutsk to Shenyang and then down to Beijingâto China and it was a complete transition. The middle-aged leadership in China invariably spoke English. Some also spoke European languagesâthey had been educated in France or Germanyâand they had a level of worldliness and sophistication that was completely different. They had few counterparts in Russia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">When the member for Fraser and I were in Dalian about a decade ago the mayor of the city at that time was a man called Bo Xilai, who is now I think the Minister for Commerce, the son of a very distinguished revolutionary hero. Bo Xilai spoke English almost unaccented. I went out with him one evening as he was meeting and greeting his constituents and it was like campaigning with a Chinese John F Kennedy. He had so much charisma and style. He represented the complete antithesis of what you would imagine a Communist Party leader would represent. So China, notwithstanding it has remained a communist dictatorship, nonetheless opened itself up to the West and to Western ideas and to education and to trade long before the Soviets did. As a result, these former Soviet countries have had a lot of catching up to do.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The major issue for the EBRD going forward is the one I mentioned earlier, and it is something that the United States representative at their recent annual general meeting, Randall Quarles, the Acting Under Secretary for the Treasury, pointed out very forcefully. He said that the EBRDâs work is basically done in Central Europeâin the EU8 and Croatia. Those countries have transitioned into the European Union. Several of them are wealthier than the countries of old Europe. I think Estonia and Slovenia now are wealthier on a per capita basis than Portugal, for example. So while there is a lot of progress to be had, there are plenty of other agencies and indeed the private sector to help them out. The real challenge nowadays is right in the heart of the CIS. There is a major challenge in Belarus, where there has been no move to democracy comparable to the Ukraine, and there are major challenges in Central AsiaâTajikistan, Turkmenistan and, of course, Uzbekistan. That is where the focus needs to be.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The member for Fraser questioned what Australian firms get out of it. Australians are a very entrepreneurial and globally minded people. Indeed, my old friend John Thornton, together with several colleagues, when he was running Goldman Sachs used to say that he thought that Australians were the ideal global investment bankers because they came from a very ethnically diverse country, a very multicultural country, and did not have the sense of cultural superiority that perhaps some other nations who remain nameless might have. Australians work globally very well. That is why there is a million or so of us living outside Australiaâand many of them are in business.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Australians will do well wherever there is free trade: wherever borders are open, wherever corruption is eliminated or at least reduced, wherever legal systems are straightforward, wherever taxes, dare I say it, are simple and lowâindeed, there is a lot for us to learn from the efforts of countries in Central and Eastern Europe who have moved to simpler and in some cases almost flat taxes. Wherever it is easy for people to do business, trade will follow, prosperity will follow trade and Australians will be in the vanguard because we are an enterprising people and our enterprise will benefit from those countries that open up their markets and reform their legal systems.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Contrary to the member for Fraser, whose efforts in introducing Australia to the EBRD were of course very commendable in the days when he was trade minister, I have no doubt that Australia benefits from the work of the EBRD as we benefit from the march of freedom, both political and economic, and from the development of a greater respect everywhere for the rule of law. We benefit from that as do the countries in which we invest and with whom we trade.</para>

<para>âin replyâI will start my summing up remarks by thanking honourable members for their contributions, particularly the members for Bowman and Wentworth for their very learned and erudite contributions to the debate on this important initiative. The <inline ref="R2467">European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Amendment Bill 2005</inline> implements an important commitment made by Australia to Mongolia to assist in its economic and social development by allowing it access to investment funding from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, otherwise known as âthe bankâ.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Australia does value the friendly relations it shares with Mongolia. Diplomatic relations were established in 1972 and have been recently strengthened by a parliamentary delegation visit to Mongolia earlier this year. Australia and Mongolia also share a common voice as members of the same constituency at both the International Monetary Fund and, of course, the World Bank.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was established in 1991 to support central and eastern European and ex-Soviet countries in the creation of a new private sector in a democratic environment. Today, the bank uses the tools of investment to help build market economies and democracies in some 27 countries from central Europe to central Asia. Mongolia has made significant progress in implementing economic reform and encouraging private sector growth. Australia recognises that the bank is ideally placed to assist in future private sector development. These amendments will greatly encourage such reforms.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Treasurer, as Australiaâs governor on the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, voted in favour of Mongoliaâs membership of the bank, thereby making it eligible to receive development financing. All other governors strongly supported this resolution by unanimously voting in support. The bill implements this commitment by amending article 1 of the agreement establishing the bank to specifically include Mongolia as a country of operations going forward. Importantly, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties has supported this amendment and recommended that binding treaty action be taken. This amendment would allow Mongolia to become the 28th country to receive development financing from the bank. The bill also creates a regulation-making power so that any future amendments to the agreement can be made by regulation going forward.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Mongolia can only be admitted to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development once all member countries have completed their ratification processes. Many other countries have recognised Mongolia as a country of operations of the bank, and this amendment would ensure that Australia is in step with other members of the bank. It is important that the House pass this bill so as to allow Australia to fulfil its international treaty obligations. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">That this bill be now read a second time.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">This <inline ref="R2455">bill</inline> makes various amendments to the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 and Defence Act 1903, including the creation of three new statutory appointments for the Director of Military Prosecutions, Registrar of Military Justice and Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force. The amendments indicate the governmentâs ongoing commitment to ensuring an open, transparent and fair military justice system.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The amendments in the bill are consistent with the governmentâs response to the 2005 Senate report into <inline font-style="italic">The effectiveness of Australiaâs military justice system</inline>. There will be a need for further amendments as additional parts of the governmentâs response to the report are implemented in the near future.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This bill will also give effect to certain recommendations contained in two previous reports made by Brigadier the Hon. Mr Justice Abadee in his study into the judicial system under the Defence Force Discipline Act (the Abadee report) and Mr James Burchett QC in his reportâ<inline font-style="italic">An inquiry into military justice in the Australian Defence Force</inline> (the Burchett report). The proposed amendments contained in the bill will, among other things, eliminate the role of a convening authority and will allocate these prosecution functions to a âDirector of Military Prosecutionsâ and a âRegistrar of Military Justiceâ. The Burchett report recommended the establishment of the Director of Military Prosecutions as an independent prosecutorial authority for the Australian Defence Force (ADF), which would undertake prosecutions of members of the ADF facing trial by either court martial or Defence Force magistrate under the Defence Force Discipline Act.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I turn firstly to the measures amending the Defence Force Discipline Act set out in schedule 1 of the bill.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There are four major measures included in the bill that relate to the Defence Force Discipline Act.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The first relates to the establishment of a statutory position of the Director of Military Prosecutions. As mentioned, these changes will implement recommendations from the June 2005 Senate report and previous reports into the military justice system. The creation of Director of Military Prosecutions will make the prosecution of serious offences under the Defence Force disciplinary system similar to the prosecution procedures used in the civil criminal system.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In addition to creating the position and specifying the required qualifications for the position and the mechanism for the appointment of the Director of Military Prosecutions, the bill makes provision for the determination of the remuneration of, the provision of staffing to and the roles, functions and powers of Director of Military Prosecutions.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Principally, the Director of Military Prosecutions will be responsible for decisions on what charges should be tried before a court martial or Defence Force magistrate, the provision of a prosecutor for those charges and the power to, if required, either initiate charges or direct that charges not be proceeded with.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The second measure creates a statutory position of the Registrar of Military Justice. The creation of the Registrar of Military Justice also implements recommendations from previous reports into the military justice system to again ensure an open, transparent and fair military justice system. The bill makes provision for the required qualifications, mechanism for appointment and determination of the remuneration of the Registrar of Military Justice, along with the roles, functions and powers of the registrar. The registrar will be responsible for the panelling and administration of courts martial and the administration of Defence Force magistrate trials.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The third measure terminates the establishment of convening authorities. Currently a convening authority is a senior commander appointed by a service chief. The convening authority decides whether the prosecution of a service offence should proceed before a court martial or a Defence Force magistrate, or not at all. The roles of a convening authority will predominantly be distributed between the Director of Military Prosecutions and the Registrar of Military Justice. However, to ensure that the Director of Military Prosecutions is aware of the service aspects of offences, the bill creates the concept of a superior authority. The functions of a superior authority will be performed by senior officers, and most likely by the appointments currently performing functions as convening authorities.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Finally, the bill makes provision for the remuneration of the existing statutory position of the Chief Judge Advocate to be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. This is similar to what is proposed for the remuneration of Director of Military Prosecutions and Registrar of Military Justice. It should ensure consistency between the three positions.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The amendments to the Defence Act set out in schedule 2 of this bill relate to the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">An essential feature of an effective armed service is the need for discipline which is, and is seen to be, rigorously enforced. Failures in the military justice system, when they occur, not only soon become publicly known, but, if not properly dealt with, can quickly result in damage to reputation, morale and, ultimately, operational effectiveness. The military justice system must meet its obligations to ensure that ADF members are treated fairly and in accordance with the law.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In the 2001 Burchett report it was recommended that a military inspector-general be appointed to provide the Chief of the Defence Force with constant scrutiny of the military justice system, independent of the ordinary chain of command.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">To give effect to this recommendation, the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force was administratively established with effect from 13 January 2003. The role of the Inspector-General ADF is to provide the Chief of the Defence Force with ongoing review of the military justice system, independent of the ordinary chain of command. This includes both ADF discipline and defence inquiries system.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">To ensure that the position is independent of the normal military chain of command and has the capacity to act impartially and with the appropriate authority, the bill will formalise the position in the Defence Act.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.</para>

</talker>
<para>âThe opposition support the <inline ref="R2455">Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline> in recognition that it represents at least some progress in improving the military justice system. But we do note that this is the first time for many years that the Howard government has done anything about what has been described by a bipartisan Senate committee examining this topic as virtually a dysfunctional military justice system. The Minister for Veteransâ Affairs talked in her contribution about the significance of instances of abuse, which is unquestionably true. She referred to publicity of these events, distress on individuals and the ruining of careers, which are all absolutely true. We see on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> today, for instance, yet a further allegation of what can only be described, if sustained, as sick conductâworse than weirdâin respect of a young female reservist, which must be addressed.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I would go further than the minister went. I would say that allegations of abuse and instances of bastardisation, bullying and abuse have now become a national security issue. There is no question of the perception of its existence. Figures revealed by the minister in answer to a question on notice that I received yesterday reveal that there are extensive instances of abuse. They have, unquestionably, a disincentive effect on recruitment and they also, I believe, necessarily must have an effect on retention rates.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">For instance, the figures show that 2.1 per cent of all naval personnelâthat includes both permanents and reservistsâhave complained about unacceptable behaviour. Last year 12 per cent of our Navy personnel decided to leave the service. How many of these vital sailors are we losing because of sexual harassment, workplace bullying and other forms of unacceptable behaviour? The figures show that five per cent of all Army personnel complained about unacceptable behaviour. Last year 13 per cent of our troops made the decision to leave. Again I ask: how many of these men and women made their decision because of a culture of bullying and abuse, whether that was of themselves or what they witnessed? In the Air Force 0.6 per cent complained about unacceptable behaviour. Last year eight per cent of our Air Force made the decision to leave the services. Again I ask: how many determined to leave because they would not accept inappropriateâindeed, unacceptableâtreatment in their workplace?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">These are not frivolous complaints. Indeed, the figures provided to me yesterday show that some 55 per cent of complaints have been upheld. These are serious issues and have to be addressed seriously. I should say at the outset that, in making those points, the opposition acknowledge that the overwhelming majority of Australiaâs serving men and women are incredibly decent and committed Australians and would never consider engaging in unacceptable behaviour in the course of their duties. We also accept and respect the fact that the current Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Houston, has indicated a policy of zero tolerance for unacceptable behaviour in the Defence Force and we accept the genuineness of his commitment. Nonetheless, there are clearly long-term structural problems that exist in our system of military justice, which on any reasonable assessment contribute to a situation where a culture of bullying, bastardisation and abuse can exist.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As I said yesterday, the figures revealed in response to a questionâNo. 1930, for those who are interestedâin which I asked the minister to break down annual report figures of unacceptable behaviour in terms of complaints under the individual subheadings of âsexual offencesâ, âsexual harassmentâ, âgeneral harassmentâ, âdiscriminationâ, âabuse of powerâ, âworkplace bullyingâ and âinappropriate workplace relationshipsâ, show, significantly, that of 749 complaints of unacceptable behaviour across the entire military, including the civilian Department of Defence, 631 were in our armed forcesâa vastly disproportionate number of complaints.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I have already alluded to the fact that the Navy is by far the most alarming example where, out of a total of just over 13,300 permanent and reserve members, there were 45 complaints of sexual offences, 42 of sexual harassment, 132 of general harassment, 14 of abuse of power and 43 of workplace bullying. As I have said, the figures also show that 55 per cent of those cases have been substantiatedâthat is, the complaint has been upheld as valid. As at 30 June 2005, another 23 per cent of those cases have not been finalised but, on the same percentages, we are entitled to assume that the majority of the cases that have yet to be finalised will also be sustained.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The figures for the Navy, which are approximately 5,000 fewer in number than the civilian staffing of the Department of Defence, showed almost three times as many complaints of unacceptable behaviour and, in some categories, were dramatically higher. For instance, as I have said, there were 45 sexual offences complaints in the Navy, whereas there were only two for the civilian Department of Defence. There were 42 complaints of harassment in the Navy and nine in the Department of Defence. There were 43 complaints of workplace bullying in the Navy and 29 in the Department of Defence.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">A comment reported in the media today that our Defence Force figures replicate what can be expected in a normal workplace is certainly not the case. These figures demonstrate that there is a disproportionate number of complaints in our armed forces and, as I have indicated, a substantial numberâthe majority of 55 per centâof those have been found to have been upheld. On any measure, these figures are totally unacceptable.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The recent Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, in its report, <inline font-style="italic">The effectiveness of Australiaâs military justice system</inline>, considered evidence from a number of personnel and families of previously serving servicemen and women, and they outlined a number of tragediesâseveral suicidesâthat have occurred as a result of this sort of conduct.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In todayâs media we have again seen reports of allegations of completely unacceptable behaviourâas I have said, more than unacceptable, absolutely sick behaviourâif it occurred. These issues are more than concerning; they are now to the point of being a national security issue. As the Chief of the Defence Force has said, the recruitment of talented young Australians into our Defence Force is a pressing priority for the long-term skill base of our military; hence the technological edge that we have in our region. Yet, despite our knowledge of the existence of this culture, as found by that bipartisan committee, this is effectively the first time for 10 years that the Howard government has introduced measures to in some small way at least reform the military justice system. This is despite the fact that over the past 10 years there have been six major reviews of the military justice system, not including the most recent Senate inquiry to which I have referred.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In part, the bill we are considering arose, as the minister indicated, from the Abadee report commissioned by the Department of Defence in 1995 by the then Chief of the Defence Force, General Baker, which was submitted to the general in August 1997. Essentially that report recommended greater autonomy be granted to Defence legal personnel from the normal military chain of command. It is acknowledged that the bill goes some way to achieving that.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The second major report that forms the basis of part of the current legislation is the Burchett report, which was submitted to the then Chief of the Defence Force, Admiral Barrie, in July 2001. Again the motivation for the instigation of that report was numerous complaints of unacceptable and violent behaviour across the Defence Force. In his report Justice Burchett noted an unhealthy culture of âkeeping things in-houseâ. His Honour noted in respect of objectionable practices in training and justice occurring at military institutions:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Under the heading <inline font-style="italic">âKeeping Things âIn-Houseââ</inline>, reference is made to the suggestion, which came up in discussion groups, that COs were tempted to maintain appearances in respect of their commands by keeping matters that ought to be prosecuted â<inline font-style="italic">in-house</inline>â. Sometimes, of course, this may have been the observerâs perception. But sometimes it may really happen.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">That is the finding in the report. We are concerned that this perception that things can still be kept in-house has not been sufficiently addressed by the government. The concept of âCaesar judging Caesarâ is very much a concern that exists in the community and certainly, as indicated by the Senate report, in the majority of parliamentarians.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Burchett report recommended the establishment of an office of Director of Military Prosecutions as an independent prosecutorial authority for the Australian Defence Force. It was recommended that the office take responsibility for prosecutions of members of the Defence Force facing trial by court martial or a Defence Force magistrate under the Defence Force Discipline Act. This aspect of the report is again substantially implemented in the legislation we are considering and is supported by the opposition.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In April 2001, the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade handed down a report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Rough justice? An investigation into allegations of brutality in the Armyâs parachute battalion.</inline> It was Report No. 99, commonly known as the <inline font-style="italic">Rough justice</inline> report. As indicated in the title, that report concerned allegations of misconduct in the 3rd Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment. There have also been several other reports that have either directly or indirectly questioned the effectiveness of Australiaâs military justice system, including the Defence Force Ombudsmanâs report in January 1998.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As I say, the measures contained in the bill in some way reflect the recommendations of those previous reports, as outlined by the minister, but, other than in an extremely limited way, they do not reflect those of the most recent inquiry by the Senate Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade References Committee, to which I have referred. That bipartisan report found:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">After extensive consideration and significant evidence, the committee considers that the ADF has proven itself manifestly incapable of adequately performing its investigatory function.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">It further found:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Evidence to the committee cast considerable doubt over the impartiality of current structures.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Shortcomings identified in the report included: the prevalence of untrained investigators; inordinate delays in the system; a poor quality of investigations; poor evidence gathering; a failure of procedural fairness; a lack of independence; inordinate delays in reviews; a lack of independence in the review process; a lack of impartiality; a failure to act on recommendations; a failure to keep complainants informed and to protect them; breaches of confidence; and abuse of powersâto summarise the more significant of those findings. It is regrettable that the government has decided not to implement the complete recommendations of the Senate committee. We recognise that the government has indicated additional legislation will be introduced, but nonetheless that legislation will not, as we understand it, implement the full recommendations of the committee.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The substance of the current bill has been outlined by the minister in her second reading speech. I will not repeat the substance. Rather, I will restrict my comments to general concerns about the inadequacy that is still there in the operation of these provisions. Firstly, in respect of the establishment of a statutory Director of Military Prosecutions, we welcome the statutory office being a full-time appointment. That will substantially consolidate the directorâs position and functions. However, we note that under the bill the director will be appointed by the minister and the director will also be required to submit an annual report to the minister. The subordination of the director to ministerial authority does not, we believe, sufficiently remove the director from the influence of the military chain of command, which view was expressed in the Senate report to which I have referred.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Senate report expressed concern that internally appointed administrators of military justice might remain subservient to their military superiors and that, at the very least, there might be a perception that those seeking justice would believe that they would have difficulty in receiving a fair and sympathetic hearing in the context of a situation where those administering justice remained subject to a higher military command. We note in particular that while the director will not be appointed internally he or she will nonetheless be appointed from within the military ranks. Indeed, one of the criteria of the appointment is that the director must be either a permanent member of the military or a reservist rendering continuous full-time service. Unquestionably, in that context, the director will remain, we believe, subject to higher military command. In that context, we note, for instance, that, under the bill, the directorâs minimum ranking has been increased to commodore, brigadier or air commodore, which, as I understand it, is the equivalent of a one-star general ranking. That we would concede is consistent with recommendation No. 14 of the Senate committee report. However, the reality remains that the proposed Director of Military Prosecutions, in making the decision to prosecute charges, will take over that decision-making process from some 30 or so officers with a ranking equivalent to one- and two-star general ranking, and it remains the case that, as a statutorily appointed director, he or she may still operate in the shadow of those more senior command officers.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The nature of the appointment is also important, because under the bill the directorâs powers will include powers in respect of civilian, criminal and military discipline offences, not just military discipline offences. The recommendation of the Senate report was to restrict the DMPâs functions to military discipline functionsâspecifically, that the director:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... should only initiate a prosecution in the first instance where there is no equivalent or relevant offence in civilian criminal law.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Generally, the structure of the office is inappropriate to that of an impartial prosecutorial authority. For instance, one of the directorâs functions is to represent the interests of the service chiefs at any hearing before the Defence Force Discipline Appeal Tribunal. Clearly, this function in itself pollutes, at least from the point of view of perception, appropriate lines of separateness, accountability and independence.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">A further recommendation of the Burchett inquiry that is adopted in the bill is the creation of the office of Inspector-General of the ADF. The office was created administratively in January 2003, and under the bill a statutory appointment of Inspector-General of the ADF would be made by the minister. Again, we recognise and welcome the fact of statutory appointment. But, in making that appointmentâin the appointment processâthe minister must have regard to the recommendation of the Chief of the Defence Force. As I have indicated, I have tremendous respect for not only the Chief of the Defence Force but also the current Minister for Defence, but it can be seen that this procedure, which requires the minister to have regard to the CDFâs recommendation, when combined with the requirement for military experience on the part of the candidate, may again, at least from the point of view of perception, bring the independence of the position into question. Despite the sincerity and decency of those involved in the decision-making process, the perception is affected.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Of significance was the fact that the Senate report specifically questioned the need for the inspector-general to have military knowledge, noting:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">...Â  the Defence Force Ombudsman and his staff have performed their administrative review function for many years without this military background.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I note that the government has taken the opposite emphasis with its explanatory memorandum, arguing that the position of Inspector-General ADF can only work successfully if he or she enjoys the confidence of the Chief of Defence Force and is able to work with the Chief of Defence Forceâhence the justification for input by the CDF in the selection process.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">But again this should be looked at in the light of ongoing occurrences of unacceptable behaviour and in the light of a reluctance on the part of young potential recruits to enter the defence forcesâa reluctance that is a result, I believe, of the perception of that culture. On the figures I referred to earlier in this speech, that is probablyâit remains to be researched, but commonsense would suggest thisâa factor in retention rates. Viewed in that light, the first and foremost priority of the Inspector-General ADF should be that he or she enjoy the confidence of the Australian community.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Another concern we have with the office is the fact that, whereas the Burchett inquiry recommended that the inspector-general be given specific power to refer matters to civil police, the bill is quite vague in respect of that particular function of the inspector-general. It merely includes a statement about âreferring matters to other appropriate authorities to be dealt withâ. That matter, we believe, should be clarified specifically. We are also concerned that the inspector-general is only to report to the CDF as directed by the CDF. In particular, that provision suggests a less than complete determination on the part of the government to change the culture that was found by the Senate inquiry to exist within our military. In particular, it shows less than a commitment to what the government claims as its priorityâthe development of a transparent and fair military justice system. Again, in the context of the explanatory memorandum we believe that the inspector-general should have as a significantâif not primaryâpurpose the preparation of reports in order to publicly expose failures in the military justice system so that they can be properly examined and remedial action taken.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to move to another statutory office under the bill. The office of the Registrar of Military Justice will undertake some administrative duties currently undertaken, as the minister indicated, by the convening authorities. Again this is a measure which the opposition welcomes. It will hopefully avoid the potential for conflict that currently exists in the system, where convening authorities undertake both prosecution and administrative duties with respect to the progress of a disciplinary or criminal trial process. Indeed, it is fair to say that the majority of complaints that come across my desk in my capacity as a shadow ministerâand, occasionally, in my capacity as a member of the House of Representativesâin respect of delay and lack of outcome on the part of those seeking review of their treatment within the military relate to that very phenomena of the prosecution being the manager of the actual complaint or disciplinary process.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">However, we believe it would have been desirable for the registrar to be able to make interlocutory and interim orders regarding the progress of litigation, just as a registrar in a civilian court frequently has this power. For instance, in some cases it may be appropriate for orders to be made with respect to discovery of documents. In other cases it may be appropriate for there to be some direction regarding expedition of a case, particularly in circumstances where evidence suggested physical or mental trauma as a result of the circumstances confronting the complainant.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We also expressed concerns that under the bill, as the explanatory memorandum states, superior authorities will be appointed to:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">â¦ represent the Service interest in pursuing a matter at the court martial or Defence Force magistrate level.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">We believe it is unsatisfactory that the bill does not effectively identify and delineate the role of that superior authority or the relevant rank of the superior authority. It is quite possible, for instance, that a superior authority may be a two-star rank or more senior, whereas the Director of Military Prosecutions will in all likelihood be a one-star officer. This is again a clear situation where, if the supervising authority is a more senior officer, there will be enormous pressure on the more junior-ranking officer occupying the position of Director of Military Prosecutions to be at least subconsciously subservient to that superior authority. We believe it is also inappropriate for those superior authorities to be responsible for organising the legal representations of an accused person, given that their primary obligation and role under the legislation is to represent the interests of the ADF. Again, in that context, it is regrettable that the government has not adopted the recommendation of the Senate report to establish an independent position of director of defence counsel service.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In summary, while this bill is welcomed to the extent that it does implement some recommendations of previous inquiries, it does not address those fundamental structural issues to which I have referred. In particular, it does not seek to distinguish between the military justice system and control by the militaryâin other words, the concept of Caesar judging Caesar, which I referred to at the outset of my speech. While this legislation was not available to the Senate inquiry, it is again reflective of a government approach to the military justice system which was described by the Senate committee as being âbroadly reactive and piecemealâ.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In short, this proposed legislative framework does, to a degree, separate the prosecution and administrative functions between the Director of Military Prosecutions and the registrar and does give greater autonomy to the three statutory appointments that have been referred to. However, problems with that appointment process in itself, the qualification for office of those office-holder, and the influence or potential for influence to be brought to bear on those office-holders by more senior officers under the procedures set out in the bill do not significantly change or sufficiently change that dynamic of control of the military justice system by the military hierarchy itself.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">For those reasons, much more needs to be done, and we would again ask the government to consider the recommendations of the Senate committee to which I have referred, which had the philosophy of very much effecting a demarcation of functions between the military and civilian authorities. In conclusion, for the reasons outlined, we support the legislation. I move:</para>

<para>âI listened with interest to the contribution made by the honourable member for Barton to the debate on the <inline ref="R2455">Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline>. It seemed to me that he was damning this bill with faint praise, but I was pleased at the end to hear that the opposition are in fact supporting this bill, although they would have liked the bill to have gone somewhat further. The government clearly is not prepared to accept the second reading amendment moved by the member for Barton, and no doubt the minister at the table will elaborate in detailed form as to why the second reading amendment is not acceptable.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">This bill will continue to enhance the military justice system to bring about improved impartiality, rigour, transparency and even better outcomes. The reforms will help make sure that there is an ongoing maintenance of effective discipline in the Australian Defence Force and will also protect individuals and their rights. I think all of us on both sides of the House are at one insofar as we want to see a military justice system that works, is equitable and is fair, but I believe that the system as it currently exists and as amended by this legislation is a system worthy of high regard. I do not have the concerns expressed by my friend the honourable member for Barton.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This bill makes a number of amendments to the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 and the Defence Act 1903, including the creation of three new statutory appointments for the Director of Military Prosecutions, the Registrar of Military Justice and the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force. This indicates once and for all that we want an open, transparent and fair military justice system. There are many benefits included in this legislation to help achieve that end. The Director of Military Prosecutions will provide an independent prosecuting authority, thus ensuring that decisions on whether or not to prosecute at a Defence Force magistrate and court martial level are made in a fair and unbiased manner. Additionally, the person holding the office of the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force will provide the Chief of the Defence Force with an ongoing review of the military justice system, independent of the ordinary chain of command. This includes both the ADF discipline and defence inquiry systems.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The honourable member for Barton in his speech devoted what I thought was an inordinate amount of time to expressing concerns that military officers who are sitting on courts could in some way, shape or form be directed by even more senior officers. He conceded that only officers of high rank would be able to carry out these judicial functions but somehow thought that the equivalent of a one-star general might be subjected to direction from higher military officers. I am sure the member for Barton did not intend to impugn the character of those higher officers in the Australian Defence Force, but the effect of what he said is that officers carrying out their roles in the defence judicial system could in some way be dictated to by those at a higher level. I do not believe that in 2005, given the transparency that is in the system and also given the fact that we have only senior officers of a very high quality, this is a concern which should have any veracity at all.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The bill is required to ensure that the military justice system meets its obligations to ensure that ADF members are treated fairly and in accordance with the law. This is clearly not the first piece of legislation in this area. Previous legislation has implemented a number of recommendations from previous reviews into the military justice system. The member for Barton spoke at length about the Senate report. Just because the Senate has given a report does not necessarily mean that the government is obligated to implement everything included in that Senate report. What the government does with the report of any parliamentary committee is look at what is included and then decide what is worthy of implementation and what should be either considered further or rejected.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The essential element of this legislation is to ensure that we have appropriate discipline and the ability to enforce discipline in an effective armed service. Failures in the military justice system, when they occur, have become very publicly known and, if not dealt with expeditiously, can in a very fast way result in damage to the way that the Australian public considers the Australian Defence Force. This bill has been subjected to wide consultation. I believe that it is a very effective bill.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The military justice system is integral to military discipline, critical to operational effectiveness and a core responsibility of command. The purpose of the system of military justice is to allow the Australian Defence Force to deal with matters that pertain directly to the effectiveness, efficiency and morale of the military. Effectiveness and efficiency in the challenging environment of military operations require highly disciplined behaviour from our people governed by our system of military justice. It is important that we train at home with the same system that we use on operations to avoid confusion, operational ineffectiveness and unjust treatment.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Perhaps the member for Barton might not concede this, but for most on this side of the House it is obvious that our civil legal system does not have the provisions required to fully support military operations, which do need a very strict maintenance of order, discipline and, quite clearly, teamwork. The military justice system provides a stand-alone code where a civilian jurisdiction may not apply or does not exist. It also provides a means to deal with misconduct that might otherwise be subject to the jurisdiction of foreign countries or the International Criminal Court. That is a very important point. I would much prefer to see our service men and women dealt with under our military justice system than have them carted off before the courts of foreign countries or, for that matter, the International Criminal Court.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I do not know whether the opposition is aware that the Australian Defence Force currently refers serious crimes and crimes where there is no obvious service connection to civilian police for investigation or prosecution in Australia. This has been the case for quite some time and will continue to be the case. I suppose you could say that in a certain way we have our cake and eat it too. Defence will continue work that is under way to improve the management and effectiveness of the relationship between the military and civilian authorities on referral cases. This will include reviewing and clarifying the guidelines and examining the need for and implementing as required formal arrangements with the states and territories for referral of offences.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I do not think that anyone should consider that the Defence Force Discipline Act is a duplication of the criminal system. Jurisdiction under that act for any offence may only be exercised where it can be reasonably regarded as substantially serving the purpose of maintaining or enforcing service discipline, a purpose different from that served by the criminal law.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I said at the outset that I was pleased to see the opposition supporting this bill. Ultimately, I am quite convinced that the second reading amendment will not succeed, that this bill will quite become quickly part of the law of Australia and that, when it does, we will achieve an even better military justice system. I commend the bill to the chamber.</para>

</talker>
<para>âIt is my privilege to attend today to speak about the <inline ref="R2455">Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline>. The process by which we look at the administration of justice within the military in Australia is a very important question. I have to say that I think the Australian military already has a culture that establishes itself head and shoulders above most other equivalent bodies the world over. I think we have real reason to be very proud of the military in Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Their recent history, in particular in their conduct of a wide range of different deployments, has reflected well on the military and on this nation. Their ability to adapt to those different circumstances is now, I think, recognised the world over. It is understood by troops from other nations that they work alongside. I think those troops admire and respect the systems that we have in place for establishing rules of engagement and for establishing the chain of command and ensuring that it is established on firm ground. The rules within which our troops seek to carry out their duties are clear and understood by all and, at the end of the day, if there is a problem, if there is an issue that arises, it can be addressed quickly and in a way that facilitates, rather than impedes, the mission. This is something that I think is now abundantly clear in places as far away as Afghanistan and Iraq but which has also been on display in recent times in places such as Timor and here in Australia itself. You do not have to go to Iraq or to Afghanistan to see displayed before you the tremendous capability and high morale of the Australian defence forces, the tremendous skills they have at their command and the intelligence and capability of their officers and troops in general. We have every reason to be very proud of this great asset of our nation. Such a strong and well-disciplined military is a credit to Australia, and I am immensely proud of it.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Recently I was fortunate, along with other members of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, to visit Iraq to see the troops in that environment. Every time I visit Royal Australian Air Force Base Amberley or other bases in Australia and every time I meet with other groups of service men and women in this country, I always feel very confident about their abilities. Let me say that those abilities were even more on display in Iraq. Our troopsâ strength of character, their purposefulness in the task that they are carrying out and their ability to maintain high morale and execute what is often a very difficult task can never be more adequately displayed than at Al Muthanna in Camp Smitty, where they are based in southern Iraq, or with the security detachment in Baghdad itself, where they are guarding the Australian ambassador and facilitating his activities in Baghdad.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We have people working in those environments who have so many different calls on their talents, so many different competing interests and so many different judgments that they have to makeâon a second-by-second basis at times; they will have something that has to be decided instantly there on their plateâand they do it so very well. I want to report an example of something that reflects very well on the ability of our troops to think on their feetâand on their ability to find effective solutions to what can be the kinds of problems you would never anticipate.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">You have to understand for a start that in Iraq our troops are concerned about roadside bombs in particular. Roadside bombsâin Baghdad and places like that particularly but also in Al Muthannaâhave been quite fiendish weapons in the recent past. They have been devised using extreme high technology and that, coupled with high explosive power, has been used to deadly effect to tear apart life and limb and to create havoc where possible. Wherever the insurgents want to try to destroy the efforts to rebuild Iraq, they can bring in these weapons and establish them by the roadside and cause huge loss of life and limb. It is a credit to our troops that they continue to maintain effective campaigns to fight down those sorts of weapons.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">But the point I want to makeâand I think it is something that needs to be considered in this billâwas that on a patrol in the Al Muthanna area our troops happened upon a group acting in what you could describe as a suspicious manner. They came across a group of civiliansâapparently civiliansâand one of them was carrying a rifle, an AK47, and another was carrying a shovel, and they were walking along near the roadway in an area where there are quite a lot of irrigation bund walls and things like that. If you wanted to jump to the conclusion that those people were probably outâit was the middle of the nightâseeking to place a roadside bomb in that environment, I do not think many people would blame you for leaping to that assumption: there is a group of people, which includes a person with a shovel and somebody else armed with a rifle, and they are going along.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Our troops did not jump to that conclusion. They did not, as perhaps some others might have, immediately leap in and engage those people with fire or take some pre-emptive step like that. Our troops approached them and discovered that what they were actually doing was seeking to steal water from another farm. These people were out merely seeking to divert water from another crop onto their crop in the middle of the night. This was an activity that was frowned upon by their neighbours, but quite obviously they were not engaged in planting a roadside bomb. Our troops were able to identify that, and they acted appropriately. You can see that, in seeking to determine the business of those people in the way that they did, they took risks themselves. They placed themselves at risk when it might have been so much easier just to launch in there. Seeing people armed and acting suspiciously, they could have moved straight in and perhaps been forgiven for making an assumption about what those people were up to.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">That example shows the command system, the rules of engagement and the mind-set of our troops, who are working in a concerted effort to deliver a positive outcome. It is no wonder that our troops have a good rapport with the local community. As I understand it, that incident was widely reported in the Al Muthanna area and people in that area recognised that our troops had acted with great honour and courage in the way that incident was carried out. When news of just that one incident travels around the local community, people say, âThese guys arenât trigger happy and they have a real willingness to understand our local community and to act in its best interests.â Such things work very well, and they then play out in the way our troops are able to carry out their tasks.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">That example shows the wonderful concert of the various forces being exercised by commanders in the field and by ordinary troops in going about a patrol. These are things that I think Australians should be very proud of. It bodes well for our future relations with the emerging nation of Iraq that these are the grounds on which we are building our engagement there.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I give that little example, but I want to go on into this case. Can you imagine, Mr Deputy Speaker, how it would be possible to properly oversee such a set of circumstances as that if we had a military justice system which was being run from outside by some sort of third-party civilian type operation? I just do not think that troops would feel at all confident in such a system. I do not believe they would feel supported. I do not believe they would feel confident about consistency in their orders and the way in which the rules would be applied, particularly after the event. I think that their faith in the system comes from having commanders who are fully informed, commanders who acquaint themselves with the rules of engagement and build those and other factors into the way in which they order their troops into deployment in a way that is consistent.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2005 has taken the direction that the government has laid out. We want a military justice system in Australia that is built on this great military tradition and that recognises this military tradition as being very good. Our military system is sometimes denigrated by people who are really wise in hindsight and who want to present themselves as being experts in this field from outside the system. I think we would be running up a dry gully if we followed their prescriptions as to how military justice should be organised.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This is a system that builds on all the best capabilities and traditions that our Defence Force represents and seeks to provide even more certainty, even more scrutiny and an even more dispassionate and objective analysis of the way in which the law applies. It seeks to establish a body of law that then rolls on from that and can continue to give succour to our military personnel who want to follow those traditions and follow that direction into the future.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This bill creates three new statutory appointments: the Director of Military Prosecutions, the Registrar of Military Justice and the Inspector-General of the ADF. The establishment of the position of Director of Military Prosecutions will make the prosecution of serious offences under the Defence Force disciplinary system similar to those procedures used in the civilian criminal system. The bill deals with the specifications of the role, the required qualifications for the position and the mechanism for the appointment of the director.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The bill also sets out provisions for the determination of remuneration and staffing and the roles, functions and powers of the Director of Military Prosecutions. It sets out the responsibilities of the Director of Military Prosecutions as being decisions on what charges should be tried before a court martial or a Defence Force magistrate, provision of a prosecutor, and initiating charges or directing they not be proceeded with. The position provides an independent prosecuting authority and fair and unbiased decisions on when to proceed and by which avenue to proceed. In creating the position of the Registrar of Military Justice, the bill creates a position that will be responsible for the panelling and administration of courts martial and the administration of Defence Force magistrate trials. The bill again sets out the qualifications, mechanisms and roles.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The establishment of convening authorities will be terminated under this legislation. Currently this authority is a senior commander appointed by a service chief who decides whether the prosecution of a service offence should proceed and, if so, whether it should be before a court martial or a Defence Force magistrate. The roles of the convening authority will be split between the Director of Military Prosecutions and the Registrar of Military Justice, with the creation also of a superior authority made up of senior officers. The remuneration of the chief judge advocate will be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. This will make provisions for the positions consistent.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I turn to the Inspector-General of the ADF. Following a recommendation in the 2001 Burchett report, the bill formalises the appointment of the Inspector-General of the ADF to provide the Chief of the Defence Force with constant scrutiny of the military justice system independent of the ordinary chain of commandâanother check and balance in the system. As I say, the system that is being put in place through this legislation picks up the best traditions and the best of the existing system and builds in even more certainty, more scrutiny. It relates to the way in which the civilian system works but it maintains all the priorities and traditions that are so important in maintaining discipline. I diverged for a minute there. Just to finish off on that theme, the Inspector-General of the ADF is also responsible for both ADF discipline and the defence inquiry system. The position has been administratively effective since 2003, with the bill formalising the position in the Defence Act.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I referred to the value of the traditions that have gone before. Why is it so important that we give such strength to existing traditions when we have pressure outside to completely throw the whole thing over and go in a different direction altogether? It is my belief, absolutely, that it is important to recognise that troops come under immense pressure in an environment which can be incredibly hostile. In any kind of environmentâparticularly in the deployed environment, I am sureâthose troops come under massive pressure. They are there on behalf of all Australians. There is a real need for a system of discipline in order for them to be able to withstand that pressure with the greatest effectiveness.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The consequences of a breakdown in discipline in those circumstances are absolutely dire. A breakdown in discipline creates risks in relation to the objective that the troops are trying to achieve. It creates risks to the troops themselves and it creates risks to civilians whose interests they may be seeking to protect. Those kinds of risks are not to be taken lightly. It is not with any degree of frivolity that we should ever consider a wholesale jump from a system that hasâwe have to say, as things standâprovided us with marvellous service from our defence forces, absolutely top-drawer performances. Worldwide, the reputation of our troops in this regard is second to none.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There are a wide number of rules of engagement that now can be applied to these troops. The complexity of the law by which they must carry out their activity seems to compound every time you open a newspaper. The amount of scrutiny and the amount of wisdom with hindsight that is applied to practically every involvement of troops in every circumstance means that those troops need to be operating on a system that is familiar to them, that they respect, that has outside respect and that has checks and balances to ensure that it is efficacious. In almost every overseas deployment, and also in activities that are carried out within Australia, different rules of engagement apply practically every time. It is just not going to be possible to expect those kinds of changes to be made from outside the military system. They have to be internal. They can be supervised internally. They have to be accounted for internally and, at the end of it all, they have to be answered for internally.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The grounds for these changes are clear-cut. That we have proceeded effectively down this path reflects very well on the minister and on the government. The support that we have for this bill from the defence forces is absolutely strong and it is strong also from members of parliament. I am very pleased to have been able to speak on this issue today. I commend the bill to the House. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>
