<para>âBefore the debate was adjourned last evening I was explaining both my involvement in the process of reform and my involvement in the National Training Authority, both of which are primarily based on increasing the portability of skills between occupations and across industries. In the 1990s I was appointed by the Australian National Training AuthorityâANTA, as it is knownâto a panel to judge the quality of training programs. My role was to identify training initiatives which were best practice, to recognise who was doing things well and to work out ways in which these programs and initiatives may be extendedâin other words, to work out how you could take tried and tested and successful programs and use them to enhance the skills and development of youth and employees to the benefit of themselves and their employers to produce more productive employees.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Later I became the independent chair of Manufacturing Learning Australia. MLA was aimed at enhancing the productivity of Australian manufacturing and the promotion of learning across occupational groups by helping to develop and recognise workplace skills. In this capacity I worked with all groups involved in vocational education, from employers to unions and from individual workers to group training companies, and of course with the government agencies, including ANTA. With the financial support of the Australian National Training Authority my role with Manufacturing Learning Australia included the development of training packages in the hydrocarbon, oil refining and chemical industries as well as plastic, glass and cement manufacturing. The training packages developed were aimed at recognising the skills that were portable across a range of industries, in an effort to reduce duplication in training, and skill development to help achieve some cost savings through economies of scale. Although these industries were across diverse areas it was found that commonality existed and that consistent training packages could be developed and introduced across many of these industries.</para>
<para>Similarly, in my period with the Police Federation of Australia I was involved with a body that established and identified common skills in areas such as public safety. Again, while they were seemingly highly independent industries with often vastly differing skill sets, we were able to identify a number of common skills for police, fire and emergency services as well as the Australian military. As a result, again with the support of ANTA, we saw the introduction of training packages for these common skills across the occupational groups and the formal recognition of these skills.</para>
<para>I mention these experiences not simply to indicate a degree of knowledge of the area but to lend weight to the important work that ANTA was involved in and the initiatives and reforms that it has assisted. The area of training and reform that I have been associated with has had a dual purposeânamely, to increase the quality of training and portability of qualifications while, importantly for business, achieving economies in training costs. This brings some context to the debate and begs the question as to why these bills have been introduced. The Australian National Training Authority has been successful and has achieved significant reforms.</para>
<para>The abolition of ANTA from 1 July is not about skills development, it is not about the government acting decisively in an effort to alleviate pressures on business created by the skills shortage and it is certainly not about a commitment to VET. This is about ministerial control. VET has a history of being the poor cousin in the education family. I know that ANTA has worked tirelessly to raise the profile of VET, and now we have ANTA being subsumed by the Department of Education, Science and Training. I have grave concerns that VET will again be relegated to the status of a second-class citizen in the education and training bureaucracy as the department continues to focus on schools and universities. However, this is not my only concern about these bills. As I said earlier, the devil is in the detail. In this case the detail comes in the form of the statutory conditions which must be complied with before financial grants will be made available.</para>
<para>In my first speech in this place I took the opportunity to outline my concerns about the governmentâs industrial relations agenda. It would ordinarily seem odd, in speaking on bills on vocational education and training, that my mind would turn to industrial relations, but the statutory conditions associated with the <inline ref="R2340">Skilling Australiaâs Workforce Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2332">Skilling Australiaâs Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005</inline> give me that opportunity. Once again the government has sought to piggyback its industrial relations agenda onto unrelated bills. Once again the government could not resist the opportunity of using a carrot and stick approach to force its industrial relations agenda down peopleâs throats. And once again it has attached industrial relations conditions to financial assistance grants. Under the provisions of this legislation a condition which must be complied with for financial assistance is the implementation of workplace reforms. TAFE colleges will be required, under these bills, to introduce more flexible arrangements, including AWAs where constitutionally possible and other forms of individual contracts where TAFE colleges are ineligible for Australian workplace agreements. I strongly support Laborâs amendments to break the connection that these bills seek to create between vocational education and training and the continuation of the governmentâs industrial relations agenda. Let us keep education funding and industrial relations quite separate.</para>
<para>It is interesting that the government has only recently sought to make up for the inadequate response to Australiaâs skills shortage. It is interesting because the skills shortages that we are experiencing are not simply the product of a buoyant economy or low unemployment, as the government would have people believe. The skills shortages that businesses are experiencing are the result of a lack of commitment to vocational education and training by this government over many years and a continual decline in business investment in training. During the election campaign the government set about trying to hide behind economic management and employment growth as reasons that we are experiencing skills shortages. In fact, that was the excuse used in the first line of the Minister for Education, Science and Trainingâs media release on 26 September 2004 entitled âBuilding our tradesâskilling Australiaâs workforce for the futureâ. In that media release the minister claimed that the government had:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... an integrated and comprehensive plan to ensure that the value of the trades is enhanced as a career path.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The document goes on to outline the governmentâs policies on vocational education and training, including such things as the creation of new training colleges, the provision of new learning scholarships, the establishment of a network of industry careers advisers and, of course, the provision of an $800 tool kit for apprentices. At no time did it make mention of the abolition of the Australian National Training Authority and at no time did it make mention of financial assistance being tied to the extension of workplace reforms and the introduction of Australian workplace agreements within the TAFE system. In fact, the first time this plan was mentioned was when the Howard government ministry was sworn in on 22 October 2004. I find it interesting that the plan that the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education in his second reading speech referred to as âthe most significant piece of legislation for vocational and technical education in the past 15 yearsâ did not rate a mention until well after the election. It did not rate a mention until the government realised that the $800 tool kit for apprentices was not going to solve the skills crisis. It did not rate a mention until the government realised that it could attach its industrial relations agenda to yet another bill providing financial assistance in an area that has been overlooked for funding for quite some periodâan area that has been desperately in need of financial assistance.</para>
<para>What is more surprising is that the announcement of such a significant change was made without any consultation. In fact, during Senate estimates hearings last year, the Department of Education, Science and Training even admitted that it did not have a role in the decision to scrap the Australian National Training Authority. As Pat Forward, the Australian Education Unionâs TAFE secretary, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Itâs perplexing that people who have been at the forefront of vocational education for 15 yearsâstate education departments, TAFEs, unions, small businessâwerenât involved in these decisions.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I also find it particularly interesting that, in the most significant change that vocational education and training has seen in 15 years, we now see the needs of students seemingly taking the back seat.</para>
<para>In my experience with the development of training systems, the focus has been on the benefit to those being trained. I do not deny that the initiatives I have personally been associated with have resulted in cost savings, but first and foremost they have resulted in training improvements. They have been driven by a business needâa need to have high-quality training in order to produce better, more adaptable and more productive employees. However, the most significant change in vocational education and training in the last 15 years has turned this approach on its head. I do not deny that the needs of business are an important consideration. Any change and reform to education and training should not be driven solely by a desire for a quick-fix, enterprise-specific solution. The considerations of business should be seen in the light of having well-trained, high-quality and highly skilled employees well into the future.</para>
<para>I absolutely want more training places for young people. In my electorate, the second largest occupational grouping is tradespeople and those in trade related industries. There are thousands of tradespeople in Werriwa. In fact, two of them are my sonsâone an electrician and the other a carpenter. I am completely indebted to those TAFE teachers, themselves highly skilled tradespersons, who have educated and mentored my sons. And there are plenty of other people in Werriwa, both at school and just out of school, who would like nothing more than the opportunity to attend TAFE and gain trade qualifications. They want to become tradespeople. They are among the 270,000 people who have missed out on TAFE positions since 1998. However, there is one thing they do not wantâthat is, to study and work hard to obtain their qualification only to find out in a couple of years time that, because theirs is one of the fast-tracked, enterprise-specific qualifications, it is somehow considered to be of lesser quality than those qualifications obtained in a more staged and traditional manner.</para>
<para>People in my electorate are finding it increasingly difficult to believe that everything is fine on the economic horizon. In the main, they have yet to significantly share in and experience the great job growth that the government trumpets almost daily. The unemployment rate in Werriwa remains just below seven per cent and youth unemployment remains around 24 per cent. My constituents want more training positions, but they do not want to see training places and a curriculum drafted specifically for a quick fix to an immediate enterprise condition. I am sure that all members of this House want an extension of training opportunities. I certainly want them for my constituents. People want the skills shortage addressedâbusinesses want it addressed, the government wants it addressed, and those who have missed out on TAFE places due to funding cuts want it addressed so they can have the opportunity to fully participate in the jobs market.</para>
<para>Let us increase funding to vocational education and training. Let us increase the number of people who will be able to gain skills and qualifications that allow them to seek and find employment. Let us increase the number of people with relevant, high-quality skills that will last them well into the future. Let us not get caught up in the trap of trying to cut corners to overcome an immediate skills shortage. If we are going to do it, let us do it right. Let us build the skilled work force that Australia needs to participate in a global economy, and let us do it without attaching industrial relations reforms to measures in a bid to force an ideologically driven agenda on people.</para>
<para>I support the extension of funding for vocational education and training and my constituents support that extension. But, more importantly, I support Laborâs commitment to remove the connection between education funding and the governmentâs industrial relations agenda. The government should not be seeking every opportunity to hold to ransom key expenditure areas, especially those previously deprived of funding, in a bid to prop up its industrial relations agenda.</para>

</talker>
<para>âThe <inline ref="R2340">Skilling Australiaâs Workforce Bill 2005</inline> brings to a head two of the great debates for our countryâs future: firstly, the future of the Federation and, secondly, whether in fact our national vocational education training system has any future at all. The bill is the latest manifestation of what we should describe as the new centralism of the Howard government. The Hawke and Keating governments believed in cooperative federalism. Labor premiers like Wran, Cain and Goss had no intention of surrendering their legitimate rights to Canberra, nor did federal Labor governments try to bludgeon or blackmail them into doing so. The Hawke and Keating governments worked effectively with them, and also worked wherever possible with conservative state governmentsâor at least the more sensible of them, such as the Greiner and Fahey governments in New South Wales.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In an earlier life I had something to do at an official level with the new federalism project of both the Hawke and Keating governments. For nearly five years I was the Queensland government representative on the national steering committee of the Special Premiers Conference, or what later became known as COAGâthe Council of Australian Governments. During that period officials, premiers and prime ministersâLabor and Liberal; state, territory and Commonwealthâdid some good work collectively for the countryâs future. We agreed on such national projects as the mutual recognition of quality standards for goods, services and professional qualifications across the federation. We agreed on such national projects as national competition policy. We agreed on such national projects as the national Asian languages and studies strategy for Australian schools. None of these agreements were easy. They involved long-term negotiations that were often protracted, often difficult, often acrimoniousâbut all ultimately centred on the states and the territories and the Commonwealthâs views of the national interest. It was cooperative federalism at its best, and those who study the federalism project well in this country would agree that the period in the first half of the nineties represented some of the best achievements we have had in the federationâs history in terms of cooperative federal undertakings in the national interest.</para>
<para>One of the best examples of this approach was the 1992 legislation establishing the Australian National Training Authority, ANTA, as the coordinating body for a national training system: a strong, independent, tripartite body supported by the Commonwealth and state governments, industry and the trade unions and funded to provide broad based advice to the entire sector. The bills were introduced into this House by the current Leader of the Opposition, who was then Minister for Employment, Education and Training. The Labor government saw even then, 13 years ago, that Australia would face an increasing demand for vocational training and education in terms of what sort of work force we would need for the future and that active measures would need to be taken in order to meet that future demandâin cooperation with the states, in cooperation with the private sector, in cooperation with the unions. The result was a legislative package that met the needs of all parties and that, on the whole, has served Australia well.</para>
<para>ANTA came into being as a compromise between the Commonwealth and the states. The Keating government initially proposed a wholesale Commonwealth takeover of TAFE. The states rejected that proposal. Instead, a number of us at officials level were commissioned by the Prime Minister and by premiers to fashion a compromise, to fashion something which would still achieve national outcomes in the national interest but which would not see the surrender of TAFE and training from the states to the Commonwealth. We sought to create a model which would guarantee a minimum maintenance of effort on the part of the states, guarantee some $720 million of Commonwealth growth funding and, through a national policy body comprised of the Commonwealth and the states, set national training priorities, given the countryâs future work force needs. This, again, was cooperative federalism at its best.</para>
<para>This was created 13 years ago because the Keating government, in partnership with the states and territories, and in the midst of difficult economic times, recognised that this nation needed a long-term, genuinely national strategy for meeting the economyâs long-term skills requirements. The model recognised the role of non-TAFE providers. It was not some sort of state-centric monolith; it recognised the multiplicity of service delivery models. But it also recognised that because education, training and skills development is a public goodâeven within the context of classical neoliberal economic frameworksâthere is a core role for government to provide long-term planning, policy direction and, most critically, funding.</para>
<para>This is because we on our side of politics have the audacity to believe in something called nation building, that public goods do not spontaneously combust out of the air, that there is a core continuing role for government and that the role of the state is not just some sort of conservative minimalism which says basically that it all stops and starts with the defence of the state or the maintenance of public order at home. We are proud of the fact that we believe in nation building in which government has a core role to playâgovernment and the robust provision of public goods creating the conditions and circumstances where market forces can then unleash their creativity, enterprise and productive force. That is how you grow a country, not by taking the meat axe to programs like the Australian National Training Authority, as this government has already done in other fields of education endeavour including higher education, first by incrementally and then decisively effectively withdrawing from the field.</para>
<para>Let us face the facts: the core ideology of the government, as demonstrated by what it has done rather than by what it says that it is doing, is the withdrawal of the Commonwealthâs funding role in education and training. This government has never articulated a nation-building role for itself in this sector, and I believe history will damn it for that, as it will damn this Minister for Education, Science and Training as one of the worst in the countryâs history. What we have at present in the approach to this bill is a triumph of conservative ideology over the needs of Australian nation building. Also it is a triumph over the basic dictums of commonsense. Businesses around the country are demanding a greater, not a lesser, role from government when it comes to the planning, funding and delivery of education and training programs. How does this bill in any concrete sense actually respond to the national skills crisis which has been documented by the OECD, the Reserve Bank of Australia and various Australian peak industry bodies? The governmentâs response is simple: vacate the field. That is not a policy; that is an instrument of surrender presided over by a piece of, unfortunately, wasted space when it comes to the level of policy advice which is provided to the government on these matters through the minister and his office.</para>
<para>Unfortunately, when it comes to this debate, the minister has been primarily preoccupied with other matters. Perhaps those other matters include his interest in becoming deputy leader of his party. But while his eye has been off the ballâ</para>

<para>âYou are the junior minister to someone who actually runs the show and whose eye is completely off the ball. In fact, the systemic problem of the government at the moment, Minister, is that so many of you have your eye off the ball. You have got the Minister for Health and Ageing, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the minister for education all wrapped up in the internal leadership brawl of your own party. It is going on around the building all the time. When it comes, however, to core questions of the nationâs long-term policy needs, including those of education, skills and training, what we find is that 50 per cent or more of this governmentâs energies are now dedicated and directed to and distracted by the internal political game, not focused on the core challenges of government: your portfolio responsibilities and the need in particular for nation building in the skills and training sector.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The Prime Minister, in a casual aside in a press release, unilaterally announced the abolition of ANTA and the national system of vocational training which the 1992 legislation established. Unlike Labor in 1992, this government consulted no-one, certainly not the state governments and other stakeholders in the vocational education and training sector who are vitally affected by this legislation. This was apparently because the Prime Minister has decided that, for reasons of administrative convenience, he wants ANTA abolished by 1 July 2005. It is just neater doing it that way, it seems. If this was to be achieved then the legislation had to be drafted and introduced very quickly with no time for consultation. In other words, the primary consideration here has been political, not one related to education or the economic purposes of what should be the case with legislation of this nature. No coherent reason has been given for the abolition of ANTA. There has been no formal critique of its work or analysis of its outcomes. The real reason is simply that ANTA, which was deliberately created to operate on the basis of cooperation between the various sectors, was an impediment to the ministerâs desire to run everything himself and impose an ideological agenda on this area. He has already sought to impose it on schools and universities.</para>
<para>This government thinks it knows best about everything, consistent with its new centralist approach that no-one else has an opinion that is worth listening to, even in areas in which the Constitution clearly places the domain within the states. This bill is typical of the style which this government and the minister responsible to it has demonstrated in its new centralist, not new federalist, approach. The Prime Minister and the minister have made much of the $4.4 billion they say they are putting into training over the 2005-08 triennium. But, in fact, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition pointed out in her speech in the second reading debate, this not only is half a billion less than the Prime Minister promised during the election campaign but is almost entirely made up of existing money rebadged and recycled. There is very little new money on offer here.</para>
<para>A shake-up of the vocational training system might have been justified if its objective was to address Australiaâs looming national skills crisis, but this bill is not based on any acceptance by the government that Australia is facing a critical shortage of skilled labour. The Minister for Vocational and Technical Education assured us in his second reading speech that there is limited evidence of economy-wide skills shortages. In fact, there is plenty of evidence of economy-wide skills shortages: look at the Reserve Bank, the OECD and other authorities. The government has thus achieved the remarkable feat of introducing a major piece of new legislation which demolishes an existing, and on balance successful, system while not addressing the skills crisis confronting the overall economy. This legislation is conceptually bereft.</para>
<para>I turn briefly to some of the more objectionable elements of the legislation. The government is using the bill also as another vehicle for imposing its ideological agenda in industrial relations. The abolition of ANTA means that Commonwealth funding to the states and territories for vocational education or educational facilities such as TAFE colleges will now come directly from the Department of Education, Science and Training and will thus be under the direct supervision of the minister. The bill provides that grants cannot be made to a state unless there is a Commonwealth-state agreement in place and it stipulates that such agreements must be concluded during 2005. Given that it is already June and that this bill has not yet been to the Senate, this means that the Commonwealth will be saying to the states at the end of the year, âSign this agreement now or you get no funding.â This, we think again, is symptomatic of new centralism, not new federalism.</para>
<para>We also see this being used as a vehicle to introduce the governmentâs industrial relations changes into the system as they have sought to do through the university sector as well. Australian workplace agreements have been complete failures in the operation of the industrial relations system more generally beyond the education sector. After nine years of vigorous promotion by this government, only three per cent of Australian workers are on AWAs, not all of them willingly. Furthermore, clause 12 of the bill makes a condition of grant that provides for aâ</para>

<para class="block">The purpose of this amendment is to delete the provision in the legislation that requires that all staff in TAFEs around Australia be offered individual Australian workplace agreements. Labor is of the view that this is not the place for the government to introduce its industrial relations legislation. I want at this point to ask the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education, given that he seems determined to pursue the introduction of the requirement that all staff be offered AWAs, what evidence he has that demonstrates the link between this industrial relations provision and improving student outcomes at TAFE. Is the minister listening?</para>

</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Secondly, I understand that some TAFE colleges in some states are not able constitutionally to offer AWAs. I would like to know how the minister intends that this provision will work in those states and what sorts of alternative individual contracts will satisfy this requirement. It would be helpful if the minister could detail the requirements that he will set out for those relevant states before he imposes those conditions. If the minister could respond to those questions at this stage, I would appreciate it.</para>

<para>âThe government believe very strongly in quality teachers being afforded a quality wage. We are very mindful of the fact that, in order to ensure quality outcomes from the entire vocational and technical education sector, quality teachers need to be a part of that. I do not think it will be very long before the states, philosophically aligned with the member for Jagajaga as they are, will be finding more and more quality teachers leaving their public technical and further education institutions in pursuit of quality wages in the private sector. I think in so many ways that this provision within this legislation is in fact assisting the states in anchoring quality people within the system, which is very good for Australia.</para>

<para class="block">Following the introduction of the <inline ref="R2340">Skilling Australiaâs Workforce Bill 2005</inline> into this House on 11 May this year, this amendment corrects a drafting error in clause 12 of the bill, specifically paragraph 12(1)(f). The Australian government is seeking reforms in TAFE institutions to ensure that they become more entrepreneurial and commercially oriented, but due to a drafting error the paragraph did not properly reflect this governmentâs intention, so this amendment is to correct the record.</para>
<para>The governmentâs commitment to vocational and technical education cannot be questioned. This commitment includes an offer of almost $5 billion to the states and territories for the period July 2005 to December 2008. This is the greatest commitment to vocational and technical education by any government in Australiaâs history, and it represents a substantial injection of funds for the state and territory governments who run the institutions that provide technical and further education around this country. These proposed reforms will not penalise TAFE institutes but they will provide them with greater autonomy so that they can better respond to local industry and business and community training needs. If we are to reform Australiaâs national training system, it is absolutely essential to see the reform of TAFE, which currently delivers 85 per cent of publicly funded training. I submit the amendment to the House.</para>

<para>âThe <inline ref="R2330">Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australiaâs Skills Needs) Bill 2005</inline> provides for the establishment and operation of the governmentâs proposed Australian technical colleges. These were announced during the election campaign. The announcement fed two needs for the Howard government at the time. One was its insatiable desire to attack the state and territory governments, to try and circumvent the state and territory governmentsâ constitutional role. This time the battlefront was education and training. In his announcement, the Prime Minister lauded the system, saying that the colleges would âoperate independently of the State education systemâ. As we now see, with the implementation of this announcement, the reality is somewhat different. The Prime Minister has had to recognise that the states and territories register schools and are responsible for curriculum. We have had to have a big backdown on that ridiculous rhetoric.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The other objective of the government during the election campaign was to finally appear to be doing something about Australiaâs worsening skills crisis. This proposal comes from a government that unfortunately, even in the ministerâs latest comments, still refuses to acknowledge the seriousness of the skills crisis that our country faces. The Prime Minister said that the new colleges were designed to âaccelerate national skills development in traditional tradesâ. The governmentâs definition of accelerated skills development includes waiting until 2010âit is going to take that longâbefore we have a handful of colleges producing their first qualified tradespersons. If that is accelerated development, I would hate to see this government taking its time.</para>

<para>âThe parliamentary secretary at the table says that this is doing something. If this is doing something, it is a disaster. You are right: it is a disaster, and it is a disaster of this governmentâs own making. This government has been here for nine long years. We know what a disaster it is. It is a disaster because this government refuses to properly fund TAFE and refuses to make sure that there are enough opportunities for young people to get apprenticeships.</para>

<para>âLabor does talk to businesses. It is this government that has created this skills crisis, created the problems that business confronts today. As a result of this legislation which is in the parliament right now, there will not be an additional tradesperson for businessâfor business, Parliamentary Secretaryâuntil 2010. That is how long business is going to have to wait for this government to actually do something.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Our position on these technical colleges has been very clear. We believe that they duplicate existing world-class programs and infrastructure in our TAFEs and schools. We believe that the government should invest in what is already in place, what is already workingâbuilding on what we have rather than reinventing the wheel. We will not stand in the way of the technical colleges, because any actionâany final action after nine long yearsâis better than the Howard government continuing to do nothing. We will support the bill in the parliament, but our support should not be mistaken for uncritical and unquestioning support of this technical college proposal. We question the motivation for the Australian technical colleges and we still have very many unanswered questions about implementation. We have tried to get answers to questions through Senate estimates. I will ask some of the questions again here today. I hope that when the minister sums up at the end of this debate he will answer some of them.</para>
<para>One of the critical problems is that Australia has a skills crisis. We do have a skills crisis, and we have a skills crisis because this government has stripped our TAFEs of revenue for the last nine years. We need action now, not in 2010.

<para>âAs I say, we need action on this skills crisis now, not in 2010. The lack of skilled workers has emerged as a critical issue for the Australian economy, and it is a crisis of this governmentâs own makingâa crisis born of the fact that it has provided inadequate investment in Australiaâs skills base during its very long time in office.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I will go through a few facts, because I can see that those on the other side are already getting agitated. We have a shortage of skilled people because this government has actually cut education and training investment since coming to office. An OECD report this month foundâpeople should take this into account; it is the OECD saying thisâthat Australia had one of the largest declines in public investment in universities and TAFEs of any OECD country. We dropped by 8.7 per cent while the majority of our competitors increased their investment. That is the reality; that is what this government has done; that is why we have such a serious skills crisis. We are one of only seven OECD nations to actually reduce government funding for tertiary education per student between 1995 and 2001. What an extraordinary achievement by this government. That is what has created the skills crisis. The Howard government missed the opportunity to reform Australiaâs education and training system to address the skills shortage. From the time it was elected, it confused cutting education investment with real reform. It is no wonder we have a serious shortage of skilled workers that is hurting Australian businesses. The parliamentary secretary is right: it is hurting Australian businesses very badly. Who has been in government running this system for the last nine years? None other than the Howard government.</para>
<para>Unfortunately, though, we do have a federal minister who still does not seem to get it. Only a month ago in this House the Minister for Vocational and Technical Educationâhis head always, ever present, in the sandâoutrageously claimed that there is limited evidence of economy wide skills shortages. So maybe the parliamentary secretary should suggest to the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education that he talk to a few businesses and get the picture about how serious the situation is. Obviously the minister has not got the message that the parliamentary secretary has, and the minister also has not heard the warnings being shouted by everyone from the Reserve Bank to the OECD. Our economy needs action now. The Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia personally told the minister that it had $44 billion worth of civil and mining earthworks in the pipeline but had been forced to shelve projects because of the skills shortage. According to the governmentâs own <inline font-style="italic">Skills at work</inline> report released this year, in 2001-02âget this, Mr Deputy Speaker Quickâjust 0.7 per cent of all the Howard governmentâs training expenditure was in the mining area. No wonder they have got serious skills shortages.</para>
<para>What we say is that the government should be training more Australians in areas of need right now. Unfortunately that is not their intention. It certainly has not been their track record. You only have to look at their actions over the last nine years, because they speak for themselves. When the government were first elected they demonstrated their attitude towards skills development, and they have held true to form ever since. These are the facts: the government, this Prime Minister and this Treasurer, slashed $240 million out of the VET sector in its first two budgets in 1996 and 1997. These are the facts. This was swiftly followed by the 1998-2000 ANTA agreement, which abolishedâlet the parliamentary secretary knowâgrowth funding altogether and froze funding to the sector for the next three years. Is it any wonder that we now face a skills shortage? These funding cuts and the subsequent freeze have meant that more and more TAFE colleges have had to close some of their training facilities, putting many teachers and, of course, students in our TAFEs under enormous pressure. They have threatened the quality of training and skills development in this country.</para>
<para>At the same time that we had a federal government cutting funds in 1996-97 and freezing funds for the next three years, we had businesses crying out for skilled staff. We also know that there is a major shortage of TAFE places. This is the direct result of this federal governmentâs education and training policy. This skills shortage has developed under this governmentâs watch. No-one else is to blame. Of course no doubt all the governmentâs speakers will try and blame someone elseâthat is their usual effort. They should look at their history: they cut funding in 1996 and 1997 and they froze funding for the 1998-2000 ANTA agreement. This is what happened. This is why we have a skills crisis. No-one else is to blame. The government has refused to provide any growth funding for more TAFE places through the Commonwealth-state training authority for six of the last nine years. They are the facts. That is why we have a skills crisis. Its current offer for a new Commonwealth-state funding agreementâthe skilling Australiaâs work force agreement, as it will be knownâcontains very little that is new.</para>
<para>So what has been the approach of the government, given they have been cutting funding for training and freezing it? Instead, this government has had the approach of taking an imported skills quick fix. Since 1998 we have had a massive increase in the number of skilled migrants. One hundred and seventy-eight thousand extra skilled migrants have been brought into this country while, at the same time as all those skilled migrants were being brought into Australia, 270,000 Australians were turned away from TAFE.</para>

<para>âSo we have got the reality of this government bringing in lots and lots of extra skilled migrantsâ178,000 extra skilled migrantsâwhile at the same time turning 270,000 Australians away from TAFE. The parliamentary secretary at the table says there is an international skills shortage. If that is the case, we should be pulling our weight. We should not be turning 270,000 Australians away from TAFE, which is exactly what this government has done.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Instead of action over the last nine years, we have now got the government introducing these new technical colleges. We know that they were dreamt up on the run during the last election campaign, announced with very scant detail. Only now is the government actually figuring out how they might be implemented. If we just look at some of the confusions and contradictions, they certainly demonstrate that the government had no idea about how the colleges would work. The government has proposed 24 colleges that apparently will be in operation by 2008. It intends that each college will accommodate up to 300 year 11 and 12 students, so a total of 7,200 when fully operational. Implementation will be phased in from 2006.</para>
<para>The first question everyone would want to know is: how much will it cost? Unfortunately, that seems to depend on who you ask and when. It was estimated that to operate these technical colleges right across Australia it would cost $289 million over four yearsâthat was back in September 2004, when the government announced the policy during the election campaign. But a couple of weeks after that the department of finance obviously had a look at the proposal, and the figure they thought it would cost was $273 million over the same period. So that is two estimates of cost. Part 3 of this bill details the latest figures the government have come up with to fund their technical colleges. The bill reveals that the government will be spending $33 million less over the next three years than they promised during the election. So the figure now is $255 million in the four financial years ending 2007-08.</para>
<para>Far from delivering the skills that Australian businesses need to deal with todayâs crisis, businesses will have to wait until 2010 for the first skilled tradesperson to come out of these technical colleges, and the government will spend $33 million less than it promised during the election campaign. The government is characterising the extra out years included in the budgetâs forward estimates, which were not included in its election policy, as a $343 million initiative. However, it is always very important with this government to compare apples with apples to see whether, in fact, it is keeping its wordâand no-one on this side of the House is surprised that it is not.</para>
<para>Another interesting footnote of detail that the government keeps quiet about is its admission in the budget papers that funding for the technical colleges will more than halve to just over $49 million in 2010-11. So the government will outlay less than it promised during the electionâapparently the colleges will be costing lessâbut what has it said about the cost to students? We have a whole range of different views on that. We on this side of the House certainly know what the governmentâs form is like when it comes to student fees. Certainly, since it came to office, it has nearly doubled fees for university students, and that does not even take into account the latest fee rises facing most university students this year.</para>
<para>What does the government intend for students in these technical colleges? Once again, the answer seems to depend on who you ask and when. Perhaps, you would say, the most authoritative place to start is with the Prime Minister. He promised during the election campaign that no fees would be charged at the technical collegesââno feesâ. That is what he said during the election campaign. The Minister for Education, Science and Training verified it in this chamber on 7 December 2004, when he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... as was stated throughout the election campaign, as has been stated by the Prime Minister, as has been stated by the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education and as has been stated by meâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">that is, the minister for educationâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">there will be no fees applying in the technical colleges.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That seems pretty plain, doesnât it? He says âno feesâ. But that clear statement was subject to immediate and, you would have to say, pretty panicky qualification by the vocational and technical education minister, who began talking about âno additional feesâ being charged at these technical colleges. But what does that mean? To what does âno additional feesâ refer? What reference point should families use to determine whether the fees charged by an Australian technical college are in addition to what it already charges? Certainly, the department has not been able to shed any light on this issue. I would appreciate it if we could get a clear answer from the minister when he sums up at the end of this debate.</para>
<para>Earlier in the year, the department did admit before a Senate estimates committee that fees for technical colleges, as with other non-government schools, could range from nominal levels up to much more expensive levels, depending on the school; nor, again according to the department, is it said or implied that these fees will be charged at the same levels they are charged at TAFE colleges. Therefore, one would need to imply further that that is the case with private training organisations. Once again, if the minister could clarify all of this, it would be helpful.</para>
<para>But none of this touches on the fees that will be charged at greenfield sitesâcolleges that are newly built and not part of any pre-existing fee reference point. We want to know what fees will be charged at these new technical colleges, the ones that do not have any association with existing schools or TAFEs. We have had no guidance whatsoever on the parameters for these colleges or on the levels of fees they can or cannot charge. Two weeks ago in Senate estimates, we were told that the fees would not be capped. We would certainly appreciate the minister, at the end of this debate, clarifying these issues. Unfortunately, he did not clarify them during his second reading speech, so I am sure that the students who are thinking of going to these colleges would appreciate it if he did so.</para>
<para>It would be helpful also if the minister could shed some light on the confusion about whether or not the technical colleges will be able to turn a profit. In his discussion paper earlier in the year, the minister stated that the technical colleges would be required to run on a non-profit basis. But this seemed to be news to the Australian Council for Private Education and Training, which told the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> that any provider, whether private or public, would expect to make a profit from the governmentâs technical colleges. It said:</para>
<quote>
<para>It would need to be a commercial arrangement ... where there needs to be the opportunity to cover costs and have a return for the operator ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So, according to the Australian Council for Private Education and Training, many potential providers will not operate a college unless they can make a profit through student fees. Once again, if that is the realityâif they are to be not for profitâperhaps the minister could clarify it at the end of the debate, because obviously it will cut out many providers.</para>
<para>It looks as though the Howard governmentâs takeover at this stage will make getting a trade much more expensive. We would also like some answers as to where exactly these technical colleges will be located. The minister has indicated that announcements on successful proposals for colleges that will open in 2006 will be made by the end of July, with announcements regarding colleges to open in 2007 and 2008 to be made by the end of this year. But nobody has been able to tell us how many will open in 2006. I cannot see why that should be confidential information. The minister must know how many will open. We are debating this legislation right now and he should inform the parliament how many he expects will open in 2006.</para>
<para>We certainly know that in New South Wales the deadline for the registration of new non-government schools has already passed. So, as I understand it, there will not be any greenfield Australian technical colleges opening in that state in 2006, and I understand that other states are in a similar position. If that is the case, will the minister let us know whether any of these new technical colleges on greenfield sites will be opening in 2006?</para>
<para>The public was also promised an open tender process during the election campaign. This did not eventuate. Instead we have had a request for proposal process. This closed last May. We have asked to look at the proposals. I cannot see why they cannot be made public. As we understand from the ministerâs statements, these are not commercial proposals, so there should not be any commercial-in-confidence concerns. I hope that the proposals will be made public.</para>
<para>The bill provides for funding agreements between the government and the colleges, and we know from the bill that funding will be dependent on many conditions which are not detailed in the legislation. Apparently they are going to be determined on a case-by-case basis. You could contrast that with the approach taken in the Skilling Australiaâs Workforce Bill, which we have just debated. Labor have strongly opposed the inclusion of the requirement to make TAFEs offer all staff Australian workplace agreements. Fortunately that provision is not detailed in the text of this bill, so I hope the government will see sense and not impose that requirement on our technical colleges. We do not think that technical colleges are the place to promote this governmentâs ideological industrial relations crusade. We do not think that vocational education and training should be used as a vehicle with which to drive through an agenda which bears no relation to successful skills training and educational outcomes for students.</para>
<para>The proposed locations are somewhat of a mystery. The government has said that the colleges will be:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... located in regions suffering serious skills shortages and high rates of youth unemployment and which are supported by a significant industry base.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">But we do not know how these factors were weighed up to determine the actual list of 24 locations announced during the election. I think it might have had something to do with an unmentioned factor: marginal seat politics.</para>
<para>One area that is very close to my heart is the northern suburbs of Melbourne. In that area we have very high levels of youth unemployment, serious skills shortages and a very significant industry base. There is a terrific school in those northern suburbs: Northland Secondary College in East Preston. They have recently pioneered Ntec, a new $3Â½ million manufacturing and technology centre. This was developed in response to chronic high levels of youth unemployment in Melbourneâs north and the fact that we have significant skills shortages. There is no question that this area could benefit from the development of a college like Ntec.</para>
<para>Ntec will offer vocational education and training certificate courses in engineering, automotive skills, furnishing and electronics. All this will feed in together with the Victorian Certificate of Education and the Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning. Ntec will also have all of the other things that the technical college proposal is looking for. They have involved local industry, group training organisations, the TAFEs and, very importantly because of the location of this school, Koori organisations as well. So we actually have a government secondary school with an industry advisory committee delivering technical education in areas of skills shortageâexactly what this government should have been doing over the last nine years. But unfortunately the northern suburbs of Melbourne are not among the 24 chosen locations and so, despite fulfilling all of the published criteria, I fear that Northland Secondary College and Ntec are not going to become an Australian technical college and therefore will miss out on the additional resources that the government is providing to support exactly the same proposals elsewhere. That is a great loss for the northern suburbs of Melbourne.</para>
<para>There are other such places around the country tooâCoorparoo Secondary College in Brisbaneâs north, the Oatley campus of the Georges River College in Sydney, Salisbury secondary college in Adelaide and the proposed Manea College in Bunbury in Western Australia, just to name a few. All of these schools are doing a great job delivering technical education as part of their senior curriculum. The Howard government should be investing money in supporting programs in schools like these. Maybe they should take the advice of the member for Page, who was reported in his local paper last year as commenting that the technical colleges should be ditched in favour of pumping desperately needed funding into the local Wollongbar TAFE. I was there on Friday with the Leader of the Opposition. I know that Wollongbar TAFE have put in a proposal, and I certainly hope that they are successful in having a technical college associated with that terrific TAFE.</para>
<para>Unlike this government, we on this side of the House are committed to reforming secondary schooling so that it provides more vocational options as part of school education, in cooperation with the states and territories. We believe that the key to encouraging young people to study traditional trades is supporting schools to expand vocational training opportunities and target training where it is needed most. This is in significant contrast to the Howard governmentâs technical college plan, which is going to duplicate infrastructure and restrict access by hiving off the traditional trades into an alternative stream. We believe it would be much more effective to encourage young people to study traditional trades while they are at school and to have trades as a mainstream part of the curriculum in all of our schools. We have proposed a new trade apprenticeship school incentive scheme, to double the number of school based apprenticeships and give schools the extra funding they need to support them in taking up these school based apprenticeship places.</para>
<para>We think that is the direction our schools should be going in. We believe this government should be training more Australians now through that mechanism, rather than businesses having to wait until 2010. And, of course, there will not be 7,200 extra tradespeople in 2010ânothing like it, because the first technical college is not even going to start until next year. Add four years to that and you have a very long wait for the vast majority of students to come out of these technical colleges and provide qualified tradespeople for business. It is no wonder that business is screaming out now for the government to do more and more. That is why I suggest to the government that they pick up our other proposalâfor a trade completion bonusâto get additional qualified tradespeople into business right now, rather than waiting until 2010. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThere were certainly no surprises in the comments by the member for Jagajagaâtypically strong on rhetoric and negativity, very selective in considering the facts and very short on memory of Laborâs own dismal failure in the area of vocational education and training. Labor had an answer to the skills shortage; there was no doubt about that. Laborâs answer to the skills shortage was to depress demand enough so that no-one wanted skilled labour: keep the economy depressed, keep the level of unemployment high enoughâit averaged 8.5 per cent over Laborâs 13 yearsâand there will be no shortage of skilled labour. That was Laborâs answer. The reason for the current tightening of the labour market is nine years of strong employment growth and the lowest level of unemployment for 28 years.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>One of the hallmarks of this governmentâs approach to education has been a determination to rebuild vocational education and training. We had a period from the early seventies through to perhaps the mid-1990s when the preoccupation in education was with higher education, leading to the neglect of technical education and vocational education and training. The imbalance that we saw for 2Â½ decades brought with it a number of problems. It brought the gradually growing problem of a shortage of skilled labour, with fewer and fewer apprenticesâfewer and fewer people wanting to take on traditional tradesâand fewer qualified tradesmen in the work force. A point that the member for Jagajaga refused to acknowledge was that in the 13 years under Labor apprenticeships fell to their lowest level in 30 years. To now get up and criticise the government for not in the last nine years correcting Laborâs 13 years of neglect is somewhat rich and hypocritical. So the first problem we had because of that trend for perhaps two decades was a growing shortage of skilled labour.</para>
<para>The second problemâone that no-one seems to have mentionedâthat resulted from the preoccupation with higher education was that the needs of the 70 per cent of students who do not go to university were unfairly neglected. The preoccupation with higher educationâwith universitiesâmeant that the majority of kids went through senior secondary school without their real needs being met. The focus on matriculation, on academic studies and on preparing students for university meant that the other 70 per cent of students felt that their needs in senior secondary school were largely overlooked. It meant that many of those kids left school feeling alienated, dissatisfied and that their experience in secondary school had not adequately met their needs.</para>
<para>It also put unfair pressure on those students in senior years to perform. It said to them, âIf you donât reach a standard that gets you into university, if you donât matriculate, you are somehow a failure and a second-rate student.â I think that excessive imbalance, that obsession almostâ<inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline> It is obvious that the opposition is going to play this game all morning because it does not like being reminded of the facts. Its answer to the skills shortage was to keep people in the unemployment queues. If people are looking for work then there is no skills shortage. I remind the members opposite that, during their 13 years, apprenticeships fell to a 30-year low. This government has been rebuilding the level of apprenticeships in this country.</para>
<para>The other point I was making is that our focus on reinvigorating the vocational education sector since we have been in government has corrected that imbalance which put so much pressure on young people by keeping too much focus on higher education. Let me outline the governmentâs record so far in nine years to address the neglect of Labor. We have had a strong focus on vocational education and training in our school system, developed the new framework for vocational education in schools and put substantial funding into it during that timeâ$283 million between 1996-97 and 2000-01. This is much more money than the opposition had even considered or come close to delivering when they were in office. We also incorporated vocational education in the 1999 National Goals for Schooling in the Twenty-First Century, putting vocational education on the agenda for our secondary schools.</para>
<para>The results speak for themselves. The number of students doing vocational education and training in schools has trebled in six years under this government. The number of students doing school based new apprenticeships more than trebled in six years under this government. Earlier, the member for Jagajaga said: âListen to our policies. Weâll double the number of school based apprenticeships.â We have already trebled them in just six years under the policies of this government. The results are there and they are clear for everyone to see. This yearâs budget brings a record amount of $2.5 billion, an increase of $280 million, for vocational education and training. Under this government, we have seen almost a trebling of the number of apprenticeships in this country, from a level of 144,000 in 1996âa 30-year lowâto 394,000 apprenticeships this year.</para>
<para>This bill continues this governmentâs strong record on vocational education and training, its strong record in increasing the level of skill in our work force and its strong commitment to and record in increasing the number of apprenticeships. What does this bill do? It will encourage students to enter traditional trades. By doing so, it will help address the skills shortage, start young people on a path to a worthwhile, satisfying and rewarding career and add to the countryâs productivity and output. How will it do this? Twenty-four Australian technical colleges will be established in regions where there is an identified need. I am pleased to say that Western Sydney will be one of the areas that will get a technical college. Some 7,200 students a year will be able to undertake their senior secondary studies to year 12. They will be able to do it with a focus on vocational education and linked in to a school based new apprenticeship in an area of need. Those students will not have to focus on a university matriculation. They will be able to complete their year 12 studies while focusing on preparing for a career in a traditional trade.</para>
<para>Over the next four years, $343.6 million will be committed in addition to the recurrent funding that would normally go to those schools. We will see a number of colleges commence next year and then the rest building out in 2007 and 2008. Importantly, these colleges will be led by a governing body consisting of local industry and community representatives to make sure they meet community needs in employment, skills et cetera. This will allow the sort of flexibility that has not been there to dateâthe flexibility needed to make sure that we are meeting the needs of young people as well as the needs of local employers and local industry. It will help us to rebuild the skill basis of our work force in traditional trades and provide the quality training for young people to set them on the path of a worthwhile career. Our aim is to see trade qualifications in this country valued as highly as university degrees so that more and more young people can reap the rewards that this offers.</para>
<para>This initiative is not on its own. It is part of a suite of measures that we have seen in this budget to increase the emphasis on vocational education and training. As I have said, there is a record $2.5 billion in this budget for vocational education and training. This is a very positive and worthwhile initiative that will deliver results. It continues this governmentâs fine record on vocational education and training. It will help many young people and help rebuild Australiaâs skilled work force. It goes far further than anything we saw under the 13 years of the Labor government. It had nothing to offer then and it has nothing to offer now except negativity and rhetoric.</para>

</talker>
<para>âThe <inline ref="R2330">Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australiaâs Skills Needs) Bill 2005</inline> represents the governmentâs totally inadequate attempt to address the major skills shortages faced by the Australian community today. It is about time the government understood that investment in Australia in a number of key sectors is currently being held back because of the major skills shortages that exist in the Australian economy. What is the governmentâs solution? The governmentâs solution is this bill. It effectively puts in place the governmentâs inadequate election commitment to establish and operate new technical colleges in competition with existing technical colleges. It also allows the government to appropriate some $340 million over four years and, importantly, to set conditions on the spending of that taxpayersâ money. I am of the very firm view that it is about time the Commonwealth started to cooperate with the state and territory governments on the all-important issue of apprenticeship training. Instead of that, this bill is about the duplication of existing skilling structures which I believe should be based on cooperation between all levels of government rather than on duplicating existing arrangements and establishing new technical colleges.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The government has effectively decided to avoid cooperation and coordination. Instead, rather than putting taxpayersâ money into the training of young Australians, it has decided to invest it in bricks and mortar. Despite demand for skilled labour peaking at this particular point in time, the government has effectively decided that it is better to address the skills shortage by havingâguess whatâsome people graduate from the newly established technical colleges in 2010. With my shadow ministerial responsibilities in the resources sector, I am someone who goes around Australia on a regular basis and let me say this: the demand is there nowânot in 2010. People want the investment to be made now so that we can increase exports todayânot in four years time. The truth of the matter is that the market cannot predict what demand in 2010 is going to be, but it can see what is happening on the ground today, in 2005. Maybe it is about time some members of the government got out and sat down and talked to some of these companies about their immediate demands to overcome the huge skills shortages which are currently holding back investment in Australia, undermining job creation, reducing exports and reducing the size of the potential economic cake that all Australians should benefit from.</para>
<para>The truth of the matter is that serious skills shortages are being experienced by the Australian community. As far as I am concerned, the governmentâs complacency is alarming. One should also not forget that these very serious skills shortages are now having an impact on the wages structure in Australia. Industry is competing, with employers cutting one anotherâs throats to try to attract the available tradespeople in Australia. That clearly has potential inflationary ramifications for the overall management of the Australian economy.</para>
<para>There is no room for complacency, but I think there is an alternative approach. It is about acting now to get people into the necessary skilled occupations, so as to produce the goods, attract investment, increase exports and enlarge our economic cake in 2005 and 2006; it is not about producing new tradespeople in 2010. I want to remind the House of Laborâs commitments at the last election. They were immediate. They were about creating some 36,000 new vocational education and training places each year and also trying to assist young people to stay at school to commence apprenticeships. To address the skills shortage Labor offered to pay TAFE fees for secondary students who wanted to get a vocational qualificationâthat is, those who would commence an apprenticeship at school and partly complete it, so that when they finished school they were not only job ready but also attractive to employers because part of their apprenticeship, the initial year, had been completed at school and they had also completed, appropriately, years 11 and 12.</para>
<para>Further, in recent months the opposition has set out some simple steps that would enable us to go a long way forward in addressing the immediate skills shortages that have resulted from nine years of neglect. The government likes to talk about apprenticeship numbers. We ought to break them down and then go to the hard traditional trades where we need the tradespeople. There we have gone backwards year after year. The apprenticeships the government is talking about are what used to be referred to as traineeships. They are at record numbers in industries such as the retail industry and areas such as the clerical area. Where we need the hard training to occurâin the skilled trades areas, where we need people such as electricians, plumbers, carpenters and bricklayersâwe have gone further backwards in recent years because, rather than being willing to break the figures down trade by trade and show where we were failing as a community, the government simply wanted to play a numbers game and talk about overall figures.</para>
<para>We propose some further alternatives which I think are pretty practical. Firstly, we need to provide a $2,000 trade completion bonus to help cut the 40 per cent drop-out rate in traditional trade apprenticeships. Secondly, we need to provide a large boost to school based apprenticeships. This is something that is very much supported by industry, because they see the benefit of keeping kids at school and getting them job ready by partly completing an apprenticeship. Thirdly, we need to consider the tax structure in Australia and create incentives. Here Labor proposes a practical alternative, providing a welfare to work bonus to increase work force participation by income support recipients. That is about basing our efforts to attract people on a carrot approach, in order to try to get them to face up to their responsibilities and also in order to meet the needs of industry.</para>
<para>The governmentâs approach is to make small changes at the margins and not to confront the real barriers to apprenticeship training in Australia. It likes to talk about new technical colleges. As I have said, these so-called new technical colleges will not produce a single tradesperson in Australia until 2010. Who knows where the Chinese economy, which we live off now, is going to be in 2010? Who knows where the Indian economy, which we hope to live off in the foreseeable future, is going to be in 2010? But we know in 2005 that, if you go to resources areas such as Gove, Groote Eylandt, Mount Isa, Karratha, Paraburdoo or Port Hedland, you find you just cannot get the tradespeople who can actually do the job required to actually expand our export potential. The truth is that industry wants these tradespeople now. All the government can say is, âWeâve got the solution. Weâre going to increase skilled migration.â That is unacceptable. We have got to train Australians now to fill these skilled vacancies and not put off the issue until 2010.</para>
<para>We have to focus on real skills development and get incentives in place to get people into meaningful, secure jobs. This reminds me of the fight about industrial relations. It is a meaningless dispute that will add nothing to increasing productivity in Australia. If you want increased productivity in Australia then skill the Australian work force. Kicking the guts out of child-care workers, hospitality workers or cleaners by trying to reduce the mean wages that they currently receiveâbecause they are at the bottom end of the wages ladderâis going to do nothing to assist the Australian community to increase productivity and exports and, in doing so, to enlarge the economic cake. That is not where our problems are. Our problems are at the higher skilled levels, where we do not have the tradespeople to do the job at the moment. In that area at the moment the industrial relations framework is irrelevant, because bosses are falling over one another to offer the small number of tradespeople that are there higher and higher wages and better conditions of employment, just to try to attract them to their workplaces.</para>
<para>It also means that some of those employers are now fronting up to some of their broader responsibilities, such as family-friendly workplaces, and it means that pressure is on government in some of those communities to front up to their responsibilities. Where is a decent school in Karratha? Where is a decent child-care centre in Paraburdoo? Where is a decent hospital in Groote Eylandt? They are the issues that are meaningful in the minds of workers, firstly, attracting them and, secondly, encouraging them to remain in those isolated communities to do the job. We are not talking about cutting wages and conditions or about new apprentices qualifying in 2010; we are talking about how we immediately solve skills shortages in the foreseeable future in Australia.</para>
<para>That takes me to my portfolio responsibilities of tourism and resources. If you go to the tourism industry at the moment, what do you find employers talking about? They are talking about labour shortages, skills development, vocational education and training and professional career development pathways. They are the biggest issues facing the tourism industry, which is one of the engine rooms of jobs growth in Australia. I refer to a transport and tourism forum which recently provided me with the results of a poll it undertook on the issues of concern to its membership. The survey showed that 75 per cent of respondents said there was one issue that they were concerned about: that was how in their industry they fill shortages of skilled people. Some regional areas are being forced to go through a period of transition to create new opportunities, and tourism is important to some of those regions. While parts of the industry excel in long-term career development in hospitality and tourism, the sector is often also forced to rely on a work force for whom the job is temporary or short termâsomething they do while they study, raise families or wait to take up vocations. This creates continual ongoing costsâthe cost of training and retraining and the cost of recruitmentâwhich further disadvantage this Australian industry because of the failure of this government to do something meaningful for it.</para>
<para>The industry has to work out how this government responds to its need to develop a plan to establish long-term training and career development, and TAFE itself has to be more flexible in responding to the industryâs needs. If we are going to achieve a good response, we have to achieve it through some national coordination and cooperationâstate and territory governments working with the Commonwealth government and with the private sector and local schools and communities to get our training agenda right. In particular, I think the tourism industry, in a cooperative model with state and territory governments and the Commonwealth, has to work out what it needs in order to make progress to produce the skilled people required for the future. The international tourism market is pretty tough and in some ways we are disadvantaged because of distance, so we have to make sure that we produce a quality service for those people who do come to Australia, because we want them to come back and we also want them to encourage others by word of mouthâso that, because of their recommendation, others will want to come to Australia. To produce a quality service, you have to have a skilled work force.</para>
<para>That takes me to the TTF survey. Let us deal with some of the issues that came out of that. Firstly, basic customer services skills were identified as the highest priority for skills training. Secondly, a shortage of chefs and a need for a greater uptake of trade apprenticeships in that area were identified. Why arenât we putting more emphasis on starting those apprenticeships at school? We should encourage people to partly complete their apprenticeships by the end of years 11 and 12. Importantly, they would be attractive to employers, because they would be job ready. We then move to something that is not just a problem for the tourism industry: the shortages of trained electrical and mechanical tradespeople that are being experienced, as I have said, by a range of industries, including the resources sector and the building sector. Finally, the TTF survey identified that trained food and beverage staff are in short supply. I think it is about time the government started talking about those things.</para>
<para>We not only want apprentices to start training for trades; we also want them to complete the training, which is why in the recent budget discussions Labor proposed a further incentive to avoid the drop-out rate. To try to discourage young people from accepting when they are approached by an alternative employer who has no history of training but who says, âDonât finish your apprenticeship; come and work with me and Iâll pay adult rates in the third or the fourth year,â Labor proposed an incentive. Dropping out is no good to them in the long term; they have to finish their trade training. As an incentive, Labor proposed a completion bonus of $2,000âa carrot for young people to complete their trade training. An amount of $1,000 would be paid halfway through their apprenticeship, and a second $1,000 would be paid at the completion of it. That is a real incentive to young kids, and it says: âDonât accept that carrot of a couple of thousand dollars over 12 months and avoid your requirement to finish your apprenticeship. Finish it; pick up the incentives and in the long term youâll be far better off.â That is the message we have to get through to young people.</para>
<para>I now go to the resources sector. In a recent fact-finding mission to major mining and oil and gas operations in areas such as North Queensland, the Northern Territory and the Pilbara in Western Australia, I found that all the industry want to talk about are the skills shortages that exist todayânot what they may be in 2010âand the problems that confront them. If you go to Gove you will find 46 vacancies and if you go to Groote Eylandt you will find 43 vacancies. They want these people now, because they cannot expand their operations and produce products which will gain export earnings for Australia without them. Because of the failure of government to deliver over the last nine years, we have to confront these problems now.</para>
<para>Let us take the resources sector as an example. The sector shows how important this issue is and why we have to solve these problems today. Over the decade to 2003-04 the value of exports from the minerals and energy sector grew by 95 per cent, reflecting just how important it is to Australiaâs export performance. That growth has occurred over a decade so you would think the government would have seen the skills shortages coming, but all of a sudden, in 2004, we heard the suggestion: âWeâre going to create a few new TAFE colleges to solve the problems that exist in 2004 and 2005.â It actually requires a bit of forward thinking and planning.</para>
<para>It also requires working with local communities. I refer, for example, to a local initiative in my own electorateâthe Northland Secondary College, which was referred to by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I have an electorate in which there are still kids who do not even finish years 9 and 10, let alone start an apprenticeship or go to university, because of some of the social problems we have. But I have a local secondary college that is actually trying to do something about this in the existing structure. We have created a skill centre for school students, the manufacturing technology centre. This centre offers years 11 and 12 kids VET certificate courses in engineering, automotive and furnishing in the northern suburbs of Melbourne.</para>
<para>The initiative was made possible by a grant from the Victorian government and also by the support of ANTA, an organisation abolished as a result of a bill passed in this parliament this morning. It is working at a local level, drawing in the national organisation made up of state and territory governments and the Commonwealth, ANTA, and also bringing into play the role of the Victorian government with a grant of $750,000. That school is actually producing young people today, not in 2010.</para>
<para>Similarly, in Queensland, go to the Gladstone Schools Engineering Skills Centre, a major resource and export centre in Australia. See how the private sector and Queensland TAFE, with the local schools, are working together to produce the results: practical, local training. You do not need a new trade centre in that town; they have one that is producing the results. The program itself is based on the ACCI employability skills framework. It is producing the goods. It is avoiding duplication, avoiding inefficiencies and avoiding competition for scarce resources out there in the Australian community.</para>
<para>There are other examples, such as in Tasmania. The coalitionâs election policy on technical colleges was designed on the run, based on a mainland template for a situation that does not exist in Tasmania. Tasmaniaâs emphasis on workplace vocational education and training, as opposed to school based VET, is quite different from that of most mainland states. There is no demand for a greenfield site on which to build a separate college. The reality is that the money allocated to this policy in Tasmania should be spent on adding to and expanding the current VET training system within the existing framework for skills development and training in Tasmania. That is because Tasmania has decent senior secondary colleges, with a number of independent schools also providing relevant VET courses, in addition to TAFE and private providers. Why duplicate it? Why create a mess?</para>
<para>In conclusion, it is about time the government fronted up to the fact that, as a result of its massive funding cuts in 1996, it has progressively and continuously inadequately funded TAFE and VET Australia-wide. In that context, I also urge the community to examine the Queensland governmentâs white paper on vocational education and training that was released last week. It is a practical endeavour to bring to a head some of the challenges that confront us on trade training. I commend the second reading amendment to the House, and I simply say to the government: stop; have a look at the policy; sit down with state and territory governments and the private sector and try and get it right. We all accept that there is a trade shortage in Australia. Try and work out a cooperative model, not a confrontationist model.</para>

</talker>
<para>âI rise to support the <inline ref="R2330">Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australiaâs Skills Needs) Bill 2005</inline>. Firstly, why do we need such a bill? It is because the economy is growing at such a rate that unemployment is going down to record lows. In fact, long-term unemployment was down to around 102,400 in January 2005. Whilst the unemployment figures are terrific, the other result is a huge increase in the demand for labour. The work force requires employees, not only at the skilled end but right through to the unskilled end. This is something that the members opposite do not seem to acknowledgeâthat the demand for labour is not just at the skilled end; it is also at the unskilled and semiskilled end. In the electorate of Wakefield, which I have the honour to represent in this place, I now see road signs appearing on a regular basis calling for workers to come into the poultry industry: âImmediate start. Workers required.â They are looking for people with low-level skills to come in. Why? Because it is not just a skills shortage; it is a labour shortage because of the growth in the economy.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Wakefield, in the northern region of Adelaide, manufactures over 70 per cent of the stateâs output, so the skills shortage and the labour shortage are things that people are talking about frequently and looking for answers to, particularly because in Wakefield there are some pockets of very high youth unemployment. There are a number of barriers which explain why these young people are not completing school, why they are not moving on to further training and why they are not able to move into employment. Some of the solutions that have been identified are a couple of things that come back to culture and a couple of things that come back to mentoring relationships. That is where the technical colleges provide an important solution, because they attempt to link industry and the employers with the young people who need to finish school and move into that training. This is vital.</para>
<para>In the city of Playford, around 25 per cent of the working population is employed in manufacturing industries. What has been happening with apprenticeships there is not a sad story. Despite the comments from those opposite to the effect that the New Apprenticeships scheme has only focused on traineeships, the fact is that in Wakefield traditional trades have risen from around 210 in 1996 to 720 in 2004. That is not traineeships; it is traditional trades. That is an increase of 243 per cent. If we have had that kind of increase, why is there a problem? The problem is that the economy is growing, there are more jobs and, importantly, employers are looking for an outcome. One of the things that the technical colleges are looking to do is to say to the employers, âYou provide the pull factor. You tell us what the training is that you need. You provide the mentoring and the relationships with the students that will encourage them to hang in there with the schooling, to move through the education system and to take up the work.â</para>
<para>The important part is not government rhetoric; the important part is how the community has responded to this. In Wakefield, the community response has been overwhelming. I have had individual parents write to and email me, meet with me and talk to me about how excited they are that finally there will be a recognition of the value of trade training and of the fact that this is not something you do if you cannot make it to universityâthat we are establishing again that this should be a first choice for the 70 per cent of our young people who do not go to university.</para>
<para>Employment groups and groups who look at doing structured placements and training for students have all welcomed this move. More telling, though, is the response of businessâand I am not just talking here about the peak bodies who tend to come to many of the meetings in Canberra with government departments. I have been amazed at the number of individual businessesâemployers who may only have three or four people working for them, through to medium sized businessesâwho have said, âWe cannot wait to be involved.â They have signed up with a number of the bids that have been put forward from Wakefield to say, âWe will support this process because we want to have an input into what is taught and how it is taught, and we want to establish a relationship with these young people to encourage them to continue through their training, to get their qualifications and to come and work in our businesses.â</para>
<para>We have also seen interest from some in the mining sector. They have realised that, in order to attract people to work for them where their mines are, they need to come down and support the bids being raised in Wakefield so that they can have people trained in metropolitan Adelaide and then take them to where they have the work. Importantly, there has also been a lot of positive response from the education sector. Despite the comments from members opposite, even the TAFEs are now realising that this is not a duplication. This is providing the means and the focus for these young people to choose to engage in vocational and trade training. The TAFEs are realising that they have the opportunity to become one of the principal suppliers of the trade training to the technical colleges. This is not about duplication; this is about working with the community and working with existing sources of training, such as RTOs and TAFEs, so that young people have the opportunity to have that mentoring relationship with an employer, to receive the training they need and to move into a job.</para>
<para>I have had a number of meetings with state schools, independent schools and schools in the Catholic sector. They were involved in nearly all of the bids from Wakefield. They are also excited about this. One of the reasons they are excited comes back to this question of culture. Trades should be valued as a first choice. Too often over the last 10 yearsâand, in fact, even before thatâwe have had career counsellors, teachers and other people say to students that if they do not complete year 12 and go to university then they are somehow a second-class citizen. These colleges have been welcomed by many schools, and certainly welcomed by parents, as an attempt to increase the value that our society places on trades.</para>
<para>Another cultural change is that this now has an industry pull factor. Rather than the education system pushing out young people using the syllabus they think is important and with the focus they think is important, we now have the opportunity for industry to become involved and to say, âThese are the skills we need and this is how we need our young people trained.â More importantly, because they have that opportunity now they are getting on board. We have real employers from industry who are signing up to say, âI want to be involved in the board. I want to establish relationships with these young people and bring them into jobs.â</para>
<para>So strong has the support for this been that some of the groups who are working together on the bids in Wakefield have said that, regardless of the outcome of the governmentâs decision on technical colleges, they will move ahead anyway because the model has such benefits for the Wakefield business community and for the young people in Wakefield. At the moment there are at least three bids in Wakefield. Each of those groups has talked to each other and agreed that they will support whoever wins. Whilst there are a variety of ways in which these colleges could be implementedâhence the three bidsâall the groups recognise that there is an incredible need for training and an incredible need, given youth unemployment and disengagement, to provide the opportunity for young people to move through that training. So there is strong support across all sectors of the Wakefield community for this.</para>
<para>I am very happy to support this bill because it provides opportunity for young people. It does not duplicate anything. It involves the community and it involves business in a process that will see good outcomes for our young people. It is the latest in a range of measures that the Howard government has put in place to support vocational training and trade training. The number of new apprentices has actually increased 280 per cent since 1996. As I said before, some of those are traineeships. In the case the Wakefield, there has been a 243 per cent increase in the traditional trades. This government has not been asleep at the wheel; this government has grown the economy to the extent that the demand for labour, skilled and unskilled, is increasing. The technical colleges are the latest round of measures put in place to provide a future for our young people and our industry.</para>

<para>âI appreciate that a quorum had to be called on the member for Macquarie. I was quite surprised, because he often speaks about educational matters. While government members were not too interested in his contribution, I certainly listened to it. He came up with the ludicrous propositionâthe kind of conspiracy theory that one would associate with the John Birch Society or the Citizens Electoral Councilâthat in some way Labor deliberately instigated unemployment in this country so that we would not have a skills shortage. What a preposterous conceptâthat a government of any political stripe would fashion that kind of policy for that kind of outcome. It really does make you wonder about the disrespect for the electorate shown by the member who came forward with that proposition. It is similar to the way in which the current government has, at various stages, ignored interest rates in terms of their relationship with overseas rates and their relativities.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This skills shortage has been quite a while coming. The Australian Industry Group estimated last year that 175,000 people will leave trades over the next five years and only 70,000 will enter them. Similarly, there have been comments by a variety of other organisations, such as the Dusseldorp Skills Forum and the ACTU, about the crisis we face. The Dusseldorp Skills Forum said that the taking on of apprentices had declined by 16 per cent since the early 1990sâthat since 1997 the proportion of teenage starters in traditional apprenticeships fell from 40 per cent to 33 per cent. The ACTU estimates a shortfall of over 130,000 skilled workers over the next five years. As I said earlier, the AiG has been similarly concerned.</para>
<para>The member for Macquarie said that Labor have a âsolutionââthis ridiculous theory that we create unemployment. I say that the current government has a âsolutionâ to our skill shortages; that solution is the importation of labour into this country. We are seeing an attempt to solve these problems through a massive surge in skilled migration. When the Labor government was defeated in 1996, Australiaâs skilled migration intake was 25,000 people a year. The government is proposing that 97,000 people come into the country next year under the skills category. Graeme Hugo, an expert in the population debate and in the broader issue of migration, noted in an article that, in 1995-96, 29 per cent of Australiaâs migration intake was skills related. Next year that figure will be 62.3 per cent. Long gone is the interest in family migration. Long gone is a reasonable level of refugee and humanitarian intake. There is an obsession with solving this countryâs problems in skills creation and skills acquisition through migration.</para>
<para>It is interesting to note that in the middle of last year there were 590,000 visitorsâtemporary entrantsâin this country. Of those, only 170,000 did not have the right to work. In other words, 420,000 visitors had a right to work. This is the reality of what is happening in this country. A government which professes to be hard on refugeesââLock them up, kick their heads in, restrict themââis at the same time undermining the development of skills in our labour market with its obsession with solving these problems through migration and temporary entrants. The member for Macquarie says that the opposition has a solution to these problems. I say that this government has only one solution to our skills crisisâthat is, migration.</para>
<para>In the period since Labor lost office, this government has brought in 440,000 peopleânearly half a million peopleâunder the skills category. Â Employers are told, âDonât worry, mate. Weâll just bring in a few skilled migrants so that you get some plumbers and electricians. You do not need to train anybody. You do not need to have apprentices. We can solve that for you.â These people can come in as skilled migrants and they can bring in their familiesâfrom northern Lebanon or Moldavia, for instance. Which employer is going to be silly enough to train Australians when the government solves these problems through migration? Migration is a crucial ingredient with regard to what is happening in this country.</para>
<para>Contributing factors to this problem are corporatisation, the amalgamation of companies and privatisation levels, along with the fact that large corporations and large public service entities no longer train apprentices. Despite their obsession with migration, the government now have a supposedly new idea to solve this problem. Rather than respecting an internationally renowned institutionâour TAFE systemâthey have decided to set up a competing alternative. After under-resourcing the TAFE system for a decade, they now propose to have a new set of colleges. This skills crisis is supposedly immediate. They are telling us the crisis is happening right now. But under their new proposal nobody will come out of these colleges until 2010. The crisis is so great that they are upping the skilled migration intake from 77,000 last year to 97,000 this year. It is so drastic, immediate and serious that they are further increasing the skilled migration intake. Yet under their proposal we will not get people out of these colleges for another five years. Is the crisis serious? Yes, it is. Is this a solution? No, it is not.</para>
<para>Our TAFE system is internationally renowned. In the past when we took in skilled migrants we could be confident that the systems of a number of other countries in the British Commonwealth were similar to ours. There was a culture that encouraged people to go into the trades, and their skills were internationally recognised. This government does not want to do anything about TAFE; it wants to solve the problem through migration. This governmentâdespite a 16 per cent increase in the number of TAFE studentsâfroze the level of TAFE funding at 1997 levels. During the period of the Howard government, hundreds of thousands of people have been turned away from TAFE. They cannot get in; there are no places. That is the kind of situation we face.</para>
<para>I do not dispute the member for Wakefieldâs contention that part of the problem is a cultural issue: people watch television and see glamour jobs in new fields and say, âWhy would I take up a traditional trade?â There is no doubt that that is happening. However, there are a few other issues. Last year 40 per cent of people who took up apprenticeships did not finish them. Why is that? It could be that they are faced with competing possibilities. Previously everyone thought they would be in the same job for 40 years and that was very comforting. The employment situation for younger people is very insecure. There is casualisation of the work force. People do not know if they will have their jobs in three or four years time. At the same time, I concede that a culture is developing where people become attuned to not staying in the one job for too long. Those are contributing factors, but that 40 per cent drop-out rate is also due to the conditions faced by apprentices. Under this governmentâs new industrial relations proposals, people in the trade sector will have their wages reduced by $100. That is not going to encourage people to stay in the trades. The 40 per cent drop-out rate is very much related to pay rates. In the first three months of their apprenticeship, a building apprentice in Victoria receives $5.24 an hour. For the remainder of their first year they receive $6.74 an hour. Those apprentices would earn far more at a fast food outlet. This government resists the rights of people to negotiate their wages and to have some say in the workplace. Under the governmentâs proposal the starting rate would be $313 a week.</para>
<para>Apprenticeships are not attracting people and, of those they do attract, there is a high drop-out rate. There is insecurity, and the wages are so low that people are leaving. We do not need a new-fangled concept involving a set of colleges which will not produce people for many years henceforth. We do not need to solve this problem through migration. The government says this crisis is immediate. The problem with migration is that processing times are, in general, about a year. Philip Ruddock, the previous minister, said years ago that if you have this level of intake you reduce the skills base and the quality of the people coming in. If you are going to get people here more quickly to solve the problem, you reduce the standard of processing and the level of inquiry into their skills. Solving this problem through skilled migration produces other problems.</para>
<para>There are very few sectors of this economy where barriers have not been established by professional organisations against people coming into this country to work. We all know that in every city in this country there are people who are driving taxis who entered Australia under the skills category but who never again entered their skilled occupation in life. The situation is that employers demand Australian skills before they hire people. The reality is that even when you have an intake of nearly 100,000 peopleâas this government will have next yearâa significant number of those people will not work in the sectors in which they are qualified to work; they will never work in those professions. So it is no solution.</para>
<para>One aspect of this budget that has not been debated very much is a new proposal. It is bad enough that the government have attempted to solve Australiaâs skills shortages by importing 440,000 people in the skills category over the last decade, but they have now come up with an even more ludicrous idea in this budget. They are actually proposing that people come here and take up paid apprenticeships in rural and regional Australia. They are not even interested in Australian youthâto encourage them, give them incentives and involve them in apprenticeships. They are going to go to Budapest, Berlin and Brasilia and try to find people in the streets there to come to Australia to do apprenticeships. That is the kind of solution they are putting forward.</para>
<para>As I said, this proposal, as it is, will not bring the people into the market for another five years. In the interim we will have a continuation of this obsession with skills entry into this country. We will have this obsession with basically doing nothing to try to encourage people into apprenticeships. We will have the hands-in-the-air denial of the fact that we can do it ourselves. We will have the de-skilling of our work force. That is the direction of the government, and the <inline ref="R2330">Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australiaâs Skills Needs) Bill 2005</inline> will do nothing to solve it.</para>

<para>âI have to take on board some of those comments made by my colleague from the opposition and say that I think the announcement of the Australian technical college initiative during the last federal election was indeed welcome and certainly demonstrated the coalition governmentâs continuing support of education pathways for young Australians. The <inline ref="R2330">Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australiaâs Skills Needs) Bill 2005</inline> provides for the establishment of 24 technical colleges in regions identified around Australia as having skill shortages.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>These technical colleges will become centres of excellence in trade training, attracting capable and competent year 11 and 12 students who want to begin training for a career in the trades while also completing their senior secondary education. The colleges will offer both academic and vocational education to students while completing their school studies. In other words, the colleges will offer another career pathway for talented students in years 11 and 12. Apart from undertaking trade courses in skills identified as having shortages in industry, there will also be a common curriculum to incorporate English, science, mathematics, information technology skills, employability skills and small business skills.</para>
<para>Industry has indicated for some time that graduating school students are not work ready and do not have the necessary skills for employment in a number of industry areas. Some of those skill shortages are in engineering and include trades such as metal fitters, machinists, fabricators, toolmakers and welders. Mechanics, auto-electricians and panel beaters are also needed in the vehicle industry. The construction industry, which is particularly important for the Gold Coastâwhere I come fromâis also facing a huge shortage of skilled personnel in areas such as bricklaying, plumbing and carpentry. These areas of skill shortages have been identified by industry, and the coalition government is making a very significant commitment to ensuring those skill shortages are addressed by committing $343.6 million over five years to support this initiative.</para>
<para>For too long in this country vocational education has suffered an identity problem. There has been an attitude in the community that only a university degree will secure employment. In many cases it has become a status symbol, and as a country we have paid a significant economic and social cost for this attitude. One-third of students who commence a university degree do not complete the degree. That is not to say we should undervalue a university education; it is a pathway that many young people aspire to and it is a pathway we should support. But the Australian technical college centres of excellence, providing world-class training and facilities in the trades, will be a valuable addition to the choice of education pathways for young Australians. It gives them a choiceâa strong career choice that will secure employment in the future.</para>
<para>One of the technical colleges will be established on the Gold Coast. This was a welcome announcement and one supported very strongly by both industry and the education sector on the Gold Coast. The Gold Coast region has a total area of 1,404 square kilometres, and, as many of my colleagues have heard time and time again in this place, we are now the sixth largest city in Australia and the fastest growing area in Australia. This rapid growth has certainly posed some challenges. It has created significant economic and infrastructure development requirements for the region, which are further compounded by the thousands of tourists that visit the city each year. The training and skills needs of the Gold Coast region are exacerbated, because it is estimated that at any one time there is an average of 77,000 visitors, including daytrippers, per day in the Gold Coast tourism regionâthat, on top of a population that has now topped the 500,000 mark.</para>
<para>Our region has identified skill shortages in the area of tourism and hospitality, an industry that plays a significant role in the life and economy of Gold Coast City and that continues to be our largest industry. The recent completion of the new convention and exhibition centre has further stimulated the tourism and hospitality industry, with considerable benefits to existing hotels and associated retail and service industries. We have skill shortages in the building and construction industry. With our strong economic growth, this sector continues to be strong due to the large number of residential and commercial projects currently under construction and planned for the Gold Coast region in the future. The retail sector is one of the largest employers in the Gold Coast area and continues to grow in line with population growth. And the aged care industry has been identified as an area of growth, largely because of the ageing population. New aged care facilities are being constructed, and home and community care is also an area of growth as many ageing people stay in their homes for as long as possible.</para>
<para>Other industries are also evolving on the Gold Coastâindustries in areas such as the health and medical area, information and communications technology, the marine industry and education. All these industries will need a skilled work force so that Gold Coast city can continue to grow, prosper and share in the economic wealth of this country.</para>
<para>The blueprint for the Australian technical colleges is visionary. The colleges will be linked to and endorsed by industry. In fact, the colleges must be industry driven. Industry has responded to the concept in a positive way. Industry will have an active role in developing curriculum, meaning that students have the education and skills that industry is looking for. The colleges will have a governing council led by local business and industry which will provide strategic direction and set performance measures. This leadership will ensure that the colleges are able to address directly the need for skilled tradespeople in key industries in regional Australia. Colleges will develop expertise in a range of industries and have the flexibility to adapt their training provisions to meet changing work force and local industry needs.</para>
<para>All the colleges will be run autonomously by their principals, who will also be able to engage teaching staff on a performance pay basis, attracting those with sought-after and up-to-date industry skills and experience. The teaching staff will be drawn from industry as well as from the government and non-government school system and the private and public training system.</para>
<para>It is my view, and that of many industry representatives in my area, that the strength of these technical colleges is the partnership between industry and education providers. It is a positive step, engaging educators with industry leaders. The partnerships can only strengthen the quality of the curriculum, strengthen the teaching of skills and ultimately ensure that young people in Australia, particularly in the trades areas, receive the best training available.</para>
<para>There has been some criticism that the federal government is moving into an area of education that is the domain of state governments and that state governments will not support the concept. It is my understanding that state and territory governments have provided in-principle support for the Australian technical college initiative. This is another example of states working with the federal government to achieve a positive outcome, particularly for young Australians, so that they have very clear, direct pathways through to industry and jobs.</para>
<para>I commend the federal government for this initiative. It is a positive move forward in the area of education and addressing skill shortages in our country. It will be a new career path for around 7,000 students receiving tuition through colleges around Australia. I look forward to working with the winning consortium on the Gold Coast in establishing the Gold Coast technical college. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>âI rise to comment on the <inline ref="R2330">Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australiaâs Skills Needs) Bill 2005</inline> and support the amendment of the shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga. The bill does not satisfy the requirements of this country in providing the skills needed in the workplace. Most independent observers have commented that the governmentâs intentions in this regard have been short-sighted and an example of policy on the run. From the way in which the bill is constructed and from the comments by the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education before the bill was introduced into this place, we can see that very little thought has gone into it.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Some time ago, on 1 March this year, I had the good fortune to meet the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education, Mr Gary Hardgrave, in my own electorate. He attended a public meetingâa meeting of interested parties, if you like. I was not personally invited to that meeting, but I was not excluded from attending. I was happy to arrive. On arriving at Taylors Lakes convention centre and meeting with me, in a very cordial way, the minister seemed entirely shocked and dismayed that I had not been formally invited. Nonetheless, he was happy to see me there.</para>
<para>There were about 30 people at the meetingâpeople who were showing a particular interest. Most were representatives of education institutions, particularly Victoria University, a good university in the western suburbs of Melbourne, and secondary schools. They were looking at how the Commonwealth was going to dispense taxpayersâ money in assisting young peopleâs training needs.</para>
<para>I could probably spend the remainder of my time talking about the philosophical and political problems I have with the bill, but I will not do that. Whilst this is an idea based on a very flimsy premise, I will do my best, subject to the enactment of the bill, to assist in providing young people in the electorate of Gorton with opportunities. Even if the idea is flawed, the process is flawed and much of the bill is motivated by ideological blindness, I will do my best to assist the government, because, in the end, I would like to see young people in my electorate given an opportunity.</para>
<para>But I have to take some time this afternoon to comment on the concerns I have and the obsession that it seems this government has with respect to the industrial relations agenda. I have to do that because the public have to be alerted to the fact that in every portfolio the government seems to be more concerned about smashing collective bargaining than about introducing training, building roads or providing required resources to other areas across this nation.</para>
<para>It is important that I remark upon what is on the government web site with respect to Australian technical colleges. I went to the web site this morning. There is a very neutral explanation of the intention of the government. The Australian government will fund the establishment and operation of 24 Australian technical colleges, providing, it says, high-quality tuition in both academic and vocational education for students in years 11 and 12. It runs through a number of questions and answers. To that extent the format is good. It allows people who may want to be part of a consortium making an application to be involved in running these colleges to understand the governmentâs mind-set with respect to the construction of the colleges and the way they will be administered.</para>
<para>I was then struck by the amount of questions that seem to go not to industrial relations in general but to Australian workplace agreements. It is quite extraordinary. Under âgovernanceââand when I think of governance I think of things far more substantial, comprehensive and important than the particular registered agreement that an employee may be bound toâthere are all sorts of questions on the Commonwealth governmentâs web site that go to the Australian workplace agreements being proposed. Indeed, it makes clear that the college staff that will be employed must be offered Australian workplace agreements.</para>
<para>That is interesting because (1) they have decided to put central to their idea a matter that I would argue, and that I think most commentators in the area of education would argue, is incidental to the providing of training and education to people and (2) it is really at odds with this governmentâs own Workplace Relations Act. The Workplace Relations Act provides a number of instruments that an employer and his, her or its employees may enter into to form an arrangement for their employment conditions. Whether the agreement or award is based on division 3 or division 2âin other words, whether it is a settlement of a dispute or an arrangement based on the corporations powersâthere are myriad options. There are awards, which we know of, which are always at threat under this government but still exist; certified agreements; section 170LK agreements between employees and employers with no other parties, which are perfectly valid; section 170LJ agreements between registered organisations, employees and employers; and AWAs. The Workplace Relations Act does not compel parties to offer a particular instrument under that act. In fact there is no expression or provision in the Workplace Relations Act that would compel an employer to offer a collective agreement over an AWA or vice versaâno compulsion whatsoever.</para>
<para>What we see here, interestingly and most ironically, you could say, is a third party using fundingâin this case the Commonwealth for the establishment of a collegeâto compel an employer to offer a particular instrument, whether that employer wishes to do so or not. To me, that is meddling between the parties. To me, that is a third party intervening between employees and an employer and I guess that is ironic, given the rhetorical commentary from the Prime Minister, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and other ministers which says: âWe need to devolve workplace relations matters. We must allow parties to make decisions.â But the Commonwealthâs web site has question after question and answer after answer about AWAs. Effectively it saysâas I say, contrary to the Workplace Relations Actâthat the employer is to be forced, bludgeoned, coerced or whatever into offering AWAs, which other employers need not do. Interestingly, it even goes furtherâI guess just in case there is some loopholeâand says that any company entering into a contract with that ATC must also offer AWAs.</para>
<para>The conditions that are being placed on establishing Australian technical colleges really do illustrate the absolute obsession this government has about introducing what are very unpopular instruments. Let us be very clear: this option, Australian workplace agreements, has been in place in the country now for more than eight years. Basically, in that time they have managed to achieve about three per cent of the work force. I remind the House that this is when the government is actually pushing public servants, Commonwealth departments and agencies to enter into these arrangements. It is assisting workplaces, particularly those that are not organised, to go on to AWAs. But, after nearly nine years, three per cent of the total work force are currently employed under AWAs. So really what we have here is the government asking itself: âHow do we change that? I guess what we start to do is use the Commonwealth largesse, we use the taxpayersâ own money, to force certain employers to enter into arrangements or offer arrangements to employees.â This distraction, this sidelining of the substantial matter before us because of the Howard governmentâs obsession with the industrial relations agenda of the seventies, does not help explain or help the government suggest that it cares about this area of public policy.</para>
<para>As we know, it now seems to be unarguable that there is a skills shortage crisis. I mentioned yesterday in debate on another bill that the Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation unanimously agreed there was a skills shortage crisis; that is, 10 members in total, including six government members, agreed that there was a crisis in this country and it had to be addressed. So no-one is suggesting that we should not be spending more of our resources to do something about it. But it seems to me that this proposal is based on a false premise. This policy was made on the run and is distracted by industrial relations matters. It is about perhaps taking over parts of the statesâ jurisdiction and not about focusing on training for young people.</para>
<para>Notwithstanding all those reservations, I have had, and still have, one pleasant surprise, and that is the government has proposed that a college be located in Sunshine.</para>

<para>âNo, not Ballarat. That area is also in dire need of training, and I am sure that you will hear a lot about that very soon from the member for Ballarat. Sunshine is an area with a real skills need. Many young people there do not have many opportunities to acquire particular training and skills for them to be gainfully employed. So I am very happy about this decision. That is one area I will not argue about with the government. I have said that the government quite often seems not to place the resources where they count or are needed but instead places them in areas that may assist incumbent government marginal seat holders. I still hold to that in the main. Looking at the sporting grants, you will see that the member for McEwen got 16 of the 27 grants for the whole nation. Looking at some of the regional grants, you will see that the member for Wentworth got oneâand I did not know that he was anywhere near a region. I do not want to disabuse anyone of the notion that there is a real problem. Ministers have really big whiteboards. Talk about the whiteboard affair; the whiteboards in those ministersâ offices must be very big.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>However, I do not want to be entirely unfair because on this occasion, notwithstanding the problems that are associated with the inception of the ATCs, there is a proposal that a college be located in Sunshineâa region that covers my electorate and the electorates of the members for Maribyrnong, Gellibrand, Lalor and those in that area. This will provide an opportunity for possibly up to 300 young people. I have said to the ministerâand I have not changed my view on thisâthat, notwithstanding all those reservations, I want to see places for young people in this region. I will do everything I can to involve the industry in the area, along with educational institutions that are looking to involve themselves in consortia to take the lead in relation to the ATC that is proposed.</para>
<para>I am happy to see that Victoria University has decided to take a proactive role in seeking to involve itself in establishing a so-called ATC. Indeed, I would also thank Sunshine Secondary College, which, subject to its application being accepted, will play a very important role. I know it has a very strong interest in this and I understand it is genuine about what it is seeking to do. Along with other bodies, such as the AiG, and local businesses, it may have a chance to get something off the ground that might work. I believe that, notwithstanding the problems associated with this construction, we have to make good with what we have. In seeking to do that, I support the parties involved. However, there is no final position on that.</para>
<para>It is important that I explain also that, when we talk about ATCs, no bricks and mortar are involved. The view held by many in the local media was that somehow there would be the construction of a site. Certainly, the students will have to be housed in current arrangements, in either TAFE colleges, secondary colleges or the Victoria University. There is nothing wrong with that, but I think it is an important point to raise. It is important to alert the local community to that so that they do not have the misconception that the Commonwealth is somehow spending a significant sum of money to build a college. Indeed, it appears that the government is interested more in having a say over IR matters than it is in constructing discrete colleges.</para>
<para>I have had conversations with a myriad of people who have shown an interest in the ATC proposal for Sunshine. I suppose that the money will go there and they will work in with it. But they told me that this is a waste of money. They told me that, in many respects, if the money were just given to TAFE colleges, a second level of bureaucracy would be cut out and we would have a better chance to deal with industry and supply apprenticeships at the workplace. Indeed, we would be more effective in doing that.</para>
<para>My other concern is that, even if someone succeeds in finishing one of these so-called apprenticeships, it will not necessarily mean that they have a job. They will not be tied to employers and, therefore, will still be seeking work after the completion of their course. So I am concerned about how, with their level of competencies and qualifications after course completion, they will be accepted by industry.</para>
<para>In the end, if this bill is enacted and the funding comes on stream allowing young people in my region to avail themselves of the opportunity to get further training, I will be assisting those industries and educational institutions that have shown an interestâand, indeed, those young people who are in real need of opportunities. If you measure the suburbs I represent in the electorate of Gorton, you will see that their opportunities, when compared with those in many other parts of Melbourne and other parts of the country, are indeed wanting. This is a flawed option. This is a fly-by-night arrangement. But I will seek any opportunity, if ever I get it, to assist local young people to acquire the skills they need and hopefully the job they need.</para>

<para>âI am pleased to be able to associate myself with this important legislation, the <inline ref="R2330">Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australiaâs Skills Needs) Bill 2005</inline>, an initiative of the Howard government. I think it will bring great benefits to our national economy and also to local areas of need. The member for Gorton said that this was a flawed bill and that he did not really support it, but he was grateful that the area he represents had been determined as one of the 24 areas in need of a college.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I appeal to those opposite to leave petty politics aside on this fundamental issue of relevance to all Australians. This bill, for the first time in a major way, places a national focus on the importance of trades. It sets a pathway for dealing with the skill shortages that are a feature of our success in getting unemployment down. I will remind those opposite, who automatically think they have to oppose everything the government puts forward, of a couple of things. The member for Gorton said that this was something thought up at the last minute. Nothing is further from the truth. Policy consideration took place over many months and was taken to the last election, an election where we had ideas on a range of frontsâand this is one of themâand those opposite opposed them. They know in their own heads and hearts, and from their own electorates, that this policy was welcomed by the Australian people. It was one of the things that resonated with the public, who want to see a greater focus on trades and a greater recognition for the value of trades.</para>
<para>The message I got in my electorate of Casey, the message the member for Gorton got in his electorateâwhich explains his on the one hand, on the other hand 20-minute contributionâand the message the member for Ballarat would have got in her electorate was that the public were grateful, relieved and fully supported the fact that the federal government, at a national level, was going to commit to Australian technical colleges. This is the result of governments at state and federal levels neglecting to see the value of trades 20 or 30 years ago, in the eighties. The message that we sent to school-aged kids was that the most important thing was a university education. The message that we sent in Australia was that, if you did not go on to university, somehow you had not succeededâas if you could ever have a situation where every single student could go to university and do a degree.</para>
<para>What happened, at the state level particularly, was that trade schools were seen as places for second-class students, the value of apprenticeships declined and we ended up with a problem that requires resolution. The member for Gorton says that we should just give the money to the states. That is what we have been doing, but if that were to work it would have worked by now. That is the absolute bottom line. The states have more access to resources and have had massive increases in direct funding in this area. If giving the money to the states were to work it would have worked a long time ago. This is not just about money; it is, very importantly, about symbols, about ensuring that students who choose that pathway when they are 14, 15 and 16 know that it is a pathway of equal value: a pathway to a university or into a trade and an apprenticeshipâa pathway that 70 per cent of young Australians, which is the number that do not go on to university, take.</para>
<para>In local areas, particularly in my electorate of Casey, we need it. We do not just have the traditional tradesâI will come back to this in due courseâbut we have new and emerging, technical and highly paid trades that require great skill and training. Some local industries, not just in Victoria but across Australia, are at the export frontier. The outer east and the Yarra Valley areas have the highest proportions of people working in trades. The demand for trade skills and vocational education is high.</para>
<para>I appeal to those opposite to leave petty politics aside and concentrate on the big issue. We went to the last election with this policy. It received great support from the public and we are legislating it. The best thing opposition members could do for their communities is to support it. When this bill is passed by this House and the other place, it will inject $343 million over the forward four years into Australian technical colleges. It will establish over that period 24 technical colleges in areas of need. When they are all up and running it will see more than 7,000 young people every year going through those Australian technical colleges.</para>
<para>What is wrong with having Australian technical colleges and state based technical colleges? What is wrong with having choice, a bit of competition, extra options and extra resources? What is wrong with the Australian government at a national level having a national focus on trades, in the same way that we have a national focus on universities? Nothing is wrong with it, which is precisely why the policy measure which was announced by the Prime Minister received such wide support throughout the election campaign in the great electorates of Casey, Deakin and Aston, where there is a need for this program. That is why it received support.</para>
<para>Now that the election is over, of all the things that were said during the campaign, nothing resonated more strongly than the Prime Ministerâs statementâwhich he made when he announced this policyâthat he wanted to see an Australia where someone was as proud of a trade qualification as they were of a university degree. Nothing resonated more strongly than that. Those opposite know that, because they went through the campaign trying to explain why they were opposed to the Australian technical colleges that people wanted. The election is over. The Leader of the Opposition from that time, who set them on that course, has departed and they have a wonderful opportunity to move forward, get out of the quicksand and try to support policy in an important area that will make a real difference.</para>
<para>I want to briefly talk about the benefit that this bill will have in the electorates of Casey, Deakin and Astonâsome of those 24 areas of need where there will be technical colleges. I alluded earlier to the fact that Casey has one of the highest proportions of people working in trades. It is a diverse electorate. It includes outer suburbs of Melbourne, part of the Yarra Valley and part of the Dandenong Ranges. By virtue of that, it has a mix of traditional trades in the automotive area, with great companies like Australian Automotive Air that are at the cutting edge of automotive technology and exporting right around the globe. As well, as you move into the Yarra Valley, you find the horticultural industry, which is increasingly becoming one of the major export success stories for Victoria and Australia.</para>
<para>Minister De-Anne Kelly, who is sitting at the table, would be very familiar with the transformation that has happened in agribusiness in parts of the Yarra Valley and in parts of her electorate, where, over 20 years, trades that were once quite straightforward have become very technical. There is a great desire for people to do apprenticeships in the new and emerging areas of horticulture, viticulture and tourism, just to name a few. Those are industries that were not even thought of 20 or 50 years ago. Policy needs to change to reflect that and to fill the demand that is very much part of the outer suburban story in all our capital cities.</para>
<para>At 5.1 per cent the unemployment rate nationally is a great success story. Casey is under the national average, at 4.1 per cent. The flipside of that is that the demand for skilled tradesmen is very high indeed.</para>
<para>This bill is a major step forward. It is welcomed by the community. I particularly welcome the fact that community representatives and local businesses are involved at every stage. I think that is important for all of those 24 areas, so that those local businesses and local concerns very much help in the moulding of the trades and the vocational education that is offered in each particular area. It means that there will not be a one-size-fits-all approach and that in each of those 24 areas there will be some local recognition and involvement, which is critical on the ground. This is an important bill and one that should have the support of all members of this House and the other place. I commend it to the House.</para>

<para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2330">Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australiaâs Skills Needs) Bill 2005</inline>, which introduces the governmentâs election commitment to establish 24 technical colleges for year 11 and 12 students. I also want to signal my support for the second reading amendments to be moved by the shadow minister for education and training, which highlight the absolute failure of this government to address Australiaâs skills needs. I am supporting the bill because, frankly, any action to improve the current situation is better than nothing. However, I hold serious concerns and reservations in relation to the lack of thought that has gone into this policy and the proposed establishment and operation of these Australian technical colleges. It is incumbent upon us in opposition to point out to the government where it has got policy wrong.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This policy initiative has been a classic case of policy on the run. It seems that the policy was cobbled together at the last minute, to be dished up to the Australian public in the context of last yearâs election. It fails to seriously address Australiaâs skills crisis and falls well short of what you would have hoped for in a nationally coordinated approach to addressing our skills needs. The lack of transparency surrounding the selection of areas to be targeted by this policy is a case in point. What criteria were used to determine the areas with the highest skills shortages? There are many questions hanging over the locations of the colleges, and it looks to me as though pork-barrelling has again come to the fore. There appears to be a strong correlation between coalition seats and marginal Labor held seats and proposed regions where the Australian technical colleges will be located. In fact, one of the only exceptions seems to be in Sunshine, and I share the surprise of the member for Gorton that there will be one located there at all.</para>
<para>In addition, this bill duplicates many existing TAFE and secondary school structures, not only making an already complex system more difficult to manage and navigate for young people and employers but also wasting valuable resources by duplicating existing administrative systems and infrastructure.</para>
<para>If you cast your mind back to the context in which this policy emerged, you would have hoped that the government had some clue about what it was actually trying to do. It had years in government with unions, employer groups and the media warning of a looming skills crisis. But instead of responding to this crisis the government is so ideologically opposed to the TAFE sector that it has starved it of funds. The government also failed to see the problems that this would create downstream in the declining numbers of Australians in trade apprenticeships.</para>
<para>At the same time as running down the TAFE sector, the government has pursued market driven solutions to training through encouraging a plethora of privately registered training organisations. That is not necessarily a bad thing in itself, but at the same time the government failed to recognise that, by not continuing to collect data on skills needs, it was contributing to a system operating with imperfect information. The system could never meet growing skills demands, because it did not know what they were or where they were.</para>
<para>In a classic example of spin over substance, the government became so obsessed with how apprenticeship numbers were reported in the media and perceived by the public that it created New Apprenticeships. By rolling traditional trade apprenticeships and one-year traineeships together, the new classification hid the fact that trade apprenticeships were declining. The government failed to negotiate with the states and territories to develop a national plan to address training and skills needs. It also cut the training guarantee, which provided a significant incentive to employers to take responsibility for continually upskilling their work force and staying ahead of the problems of the ageing work force.</para>
<para>With all of this, it is no wonder that a skills crisis has emerged. The governmentâs own policies have actively contributed to it. What has been the governmentâs response? Despite all the advanced warning they have had about the looming skills crisis, their response has been a quickly cobbled together announcement on skilled migration and the rushed election announcement of the Australian technical collegesâthe bill we are debating today. This announcement appeals to a popular notion which has no basis in fact: that the decline in trade apprenticeships is the direct result of the closure by state governments of tech schools. There is absolutely no basis in fact for this.</para>
<para>I look at my own electorate and what has happened there. Sebastopol Collegeâwhich used to be Sebastopol Technical Schoolâhad a declining enrolment rate. Within my community, it was seen as the place of last resort for kids who were not going to go anywhere. Sebastopol tech was the place from where you might get into some trade training but it was in real trouble. Now in Sebastopol College you see a school absolutely filled with pride. Whether the kids from there go into university, stream into TAFE, go into arts or into their own businesses, there is room for every one of those kids. It is seen as one of the desirable schools within my electorate which, alongside Mount Clear College, have for some time been offering pathways into trade and vocational education and training. If the government were really serious about assisting industry and employers to do something about the skills crisis, it would have looked at better pathways between those two schools in my electorate and the TAFE college and the registered training organisations, rather than setting up new structures and duplicating existing structures. But no, it needed to try and have some sort of announcement during the context of an election campaign, so it decided to support the popular myth that unless you have a tech school you do not have tradespeople. That is just not true.</para>
<para>Like most things that this government proposes, it sounds good on paper but the substance is lacking. The proposed initiative is scant on detail and appears to have been cobbled together at the last minute to curry favour within certain electorates. Of significant concern are the differing funding figures which are coming out of the government in relation to the colleges. At the time of their announcement in September 2004, it was stated that it would cost $289 million over four years for their creation. However, after looking at the proposal, the Department of Finance and Administration declared that they would now only cost $273 million over four years. This bill shows that the spending will again be reduced to $225 million. It seems pretty clear that the government simply had no idea how much it would actually cost and simply pulled a figure out of the air for the benefit of its election campaign.</para>
<para>There is also the question of the fees that students who attend these Australian technical colleges will pay. It seems that the government has changed its stance on this. The Prime Minister declared that there would be no fees charged at the collegesâafter all, these are for year 11 and year 12 secondary school students. Despite this promise, the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education has since claimed that there will be no additional fees for students attending Australian technical colleges, which is a far cry from there being no fees charged to students attending Australian technical colleges.</para>
<para>Another prime example of the arrogance of this government with this bill is that the governmentâs supporting documentation does not even indicate a possible model as to how these colleges might operate. I understand that different models will need to operate in different locations and that the government is keen to get ideas from local communities as to how these colleges might operate, but I would have hoped that the minister had at least a bit of an idea about how these were going to work and how his policy proposal was going to be implemented. Communities have had to scrabble around desperately trying to develop a model. Many are now calling them âvirtual technical collegesâ because there are no buildings involved in many of the expressions of interest that have been put in. They have really had to struggle to develop a model, with absolutely no guidelines from the government, all because the government did not have a clue. The government made the policy announcement but did not know how it was going to implement it. The departmental officials have had to go around and say: âWhat does this thing actually mean? What is it going to look like?â They are still not really sure.</para>
<para>Although there will be some standard governance and administrative requirements, without strong guidelines for operation they will not be as effective and efficient as they possibly could be. It is simply another example of the government cobbling this policy together at the last minute in the election campaign. Furthermore, the funding arrangements for individual colleges are also extremely vague. Many of the conditions on which funding will be based are not included in this bill that we are debating but have appeared in speeches and public comments by the minister and othersâthey are yet to be formalised.</para>
<para>I am going to support the bill because I think something is better than nothing when trying to assist young people into trades that better match industry needs. But while supporting the bill for this reason, I do not believe that it adequately addresses the chronic skills shortages affecting many communities, including my own. We are currently experiencing a situation where there has been a statistically significant and sustained decline between 1993 and 2001 in the training rates in traditional tradesâa statistically significant decline in trade apprenticeships from 1993 to 2001. The ACTU has estimated that Australia will experience a shortage of around 130,000 skilled workers over the next five years at the current rate of decline. The plan to create 24 Australian technical colleges will not fix this problem. Rather, Australian businesses desperate for skilled workers will have to wait until 2010 to see the first graduates and until 2011 and 2012 before the vast bulk of qualified tradespeople emerge into the work force.</para>
<para>The shortage of skilled workers demands a more broadly based solution attacking the problem on a multitude of fronts. There must be greater investment in existing institutions such as secondary schools and TAFE in order to expand vocational training opportunities within the curriculum. In addition, it is essential that there be incentives for individuals who start trade apprenticeships to actually complete those apprenticeships. In my electorate, there are approximately 580 apprenticeships, and the estimated non-completion rate is 40 per cent. Of those 580 apprentices who start their trade, 230 will drop out of that training. If you do not have some sort of incentive to make sure that they complete that training then you are really not going to do anything about that 40 per cent. With this sort of drop-out rate, the government should be encouraging young people who commence a trade to actually complete the trade.</para>
<para>Within the Howard governmentâs Australian technical colleges policy there are no incentives or assistance for people to actually gain employment afterwards or to complete their trade training. We have come out with our trade completion bonus, a policy to try to build incentives into the system to make sure that apprentices who start their trade apprenticeships actually get to finish them.</para>
<para>One of the other policy announcements that the government has made has been about increasing skilled migration. So you have two policy frontsâskilled migration and the Australian technical colleges. You do not have a broad-based approach to try to increase the number of people who are employed or who are completing trade apprenticeships.</para>
<para>People in this place will be pretty familiar now with the story of MAXITRANS, a well-respected supplier of retail road transport trailing solutions within my electorate. MAXITRANS had to employ labourers from offshore, simply because there had not been enough investment in apprenticeship places, particularly in welding and metal fabrication, over the past five years to enable it to employ local people to meet its contract obligations. This is in an electorate where there is a teenage unemployment rate of 34 per cent. The government does not have a strong vision to fix this skills crisis. The push for increased skilled migration is a short-term solution. They should be looking at what the problems and disincentives are for young people going into trades in the first place and trying to do something about those. I can only imagine how the young unemployed and their parents must feel when, because of a lack of planning and a lack of investment by this government, they see tradespeople from overseas coming to Ballarat to fill vacancies.</para>
<para>Additionally, the government has again brought out the populist myth that kids should leave school early and be discouraged from staying on if they do not intend to further their education beyond year 12, as though somehow schools are forcing them to stay in meaningless education. Many teenagers who believe universities are not the best option for themâand there are many of them, and so there should beâleave school with very little idea of their alternatives. If they are not assisted in that first year of leaving school, they are at high risk of becoming long-term unemployed. The issue is not so much at what year young people leave school; it is what they leave school to go to. I firmly believe that, unless young people either have an apprenticeship or a solid job offer with training prospects or are enrolled in another course, they should be actively encouraged to stay engaged in the education system as long as possible, until they do have those things lined up.</para>
<para>I hear too many stories of young people and older people failing basic year 9 literacy and numeracy tests within my electorate when they go for jobs. With teenage unemployment rates in my electorate at 34 per cent, who does the Prime Minister think these kids are who are unemployed for this length of time? They are, on the whole, early school leavers who now have been unemployed for well over 12 months and have little prospect of finding a job. The Prime Minister is keen to create a further decline in this area in his call for more young people to leave school earlier. This will only lead to there being more young people who have few prospects into the future. Without clear pathways to training and employment, there will be no change to the skills crisis.</para>
<para>I want to return now to the point about the location of these colleges. I think it represents a real problem of credibility for the government. As I mentioned earlier, there is a significant correlation between coalition held seats and the 24 proposed regions for the Australian technical colleges. All, I believe, were announced during the 2004 election campaign. According to the Australian technical colleges web site, Queanbeyan was announced as an area where a college would be built, as decided by the minister. Interestingly, Queanbeyan is in Eden-Monaro, a seat hotly contested by both sides in the last election. Other targets included the region surrounding Bairnsdale and Sale. That region is in another hotly contested seat, which was held by the Nationalsâ Peter McGauran. Corangamite was also targeted, with a technical college being located in Geelong. We have also just heard from the member for Casey that a technical college is going to benefit the members for Deakin, Aston and Casey. That college will be located in an area with an unemployment rate of only 4.1 per cent.</para>
<para>There has been absolutely no transparency about how the locations for these colleges were selected. Were these locations selected on the basis of need in relation to lack of training availability, apprenticeship numbers in a given region, unfilled job vacancies, employment prospects and industry demands? Who would know? This has been a cobbled together policy, with the 24 locations announced in the context of a federal election. The skills crisis is of particular concern in the electorate of Ballarat. There are simply not enough individuals in the traditional trades and there is a high youth unemployment rate. I know that there is a great deal of anger in the region about the fact that Ballarat was overlooked as a location for an Australian technical college by the Howard government, despite the situation facing the region. In fact, the City of Ballarat and BRACE, a registered training organisation, have put in separate proposals to the government and have challenged the government to say how these 24 locations were decided and why it has not decided that there are other areas of need and what it is going to do about those in relation to Ballarat, and they have tried to come up with some solutions for the government about those matters.</para>
<para>Another issue of concern that is highlighted in this bill is the issue of duplication. There are numerous impacts in relation to this that have not been considered. Of concern to some schools is the potential threat that duplication poses to the viability of existing government and non-government schools, TAFE programs and infrastructure. Due to the fact that traditional trades training will be streamed into these Australian technical colleges, there may in some instances be reduced demand for the existing institutions and services and for vocational education and training within those schools. Those are the things that schools have been raising with me.</para>
<para>Similarly, low participation in government funded institutions and services will lead to reduced funding or possibly the removal of funding due to decreased popularity. This can be seen in the fact that there is no significant new funding for the Commonwealth-State Training Funding Agreement, which covers TAFE programs, accompanying this bill. So duplication is another issue.</para>
<para>In the remaining time I have, I want to touch very briefly on the industrial relations agenda contained in the bill. It is also evident that the Howard government is attempting to push through its industrial relations mantra in this Australian technical colleges bill. Here we have a government which spends more time pushing its own political agenda than it does on deciding how much money it is going to spend on implementing its policy proposals. Though not explicit in the bill itselfâbut detailed in statements supporting itâfunding for individual colleges will be influenced by their promotion of Australian workplace agreements. Specifically, this bill has the effect of funding not being available to Australian technical colleges unless Australian workplace agreements are offered to staff. Perhaps of great concern to staff at these Australian technical colleges is the potential autonomy of the principals. They will be free to set performance pay packages, as well as having substantial power in employment. I am also concerned that in smaller communities, as has happened to just about everything controlled by this government, these places will simply become Liberal Party mates clubs, rather than being places that necessarily assist young people into trades. I will be watching with great interest the appointments to the boards of the colleges in the 24 locations.</para>
<para>The government, in pursuing this industrial relations agenda through the Australian technical colleges bill, is not guaranteeing that you will get the best trained, qualified and experienced staff. In fact it is a third-party meddling between employers and employees by dictating that Australian workplace agreements must be offered. I think the member for Gorton made an extremely important point in his contribution to this debate: nowhere does the Workplace Relations Act state that employers must offer enterprise bargaining agreements to employees. Why is the government absolutely determined that individual contracts have to be a condition of funding for Australian technical colleges? You would have to say it is purely driven by ideology, not by a desire for real flexibility in the workplace or by making sure that you get the best possible people in these colleges to train people.</para>
<para>I will be supporting this bill, despite its many weaknesses. The 24 Australian technical colleges are a response to a problem, but it is neither adequate nor timely. One of the major flaws of the policy is that it lacks substance. This policy was cobbled together at the last minute by a government keen to win votes at the last election, and the policy continues to be changed from one day to the next in both the funding allocated to it and what the colleges will actually look like. There is no clear framework. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>âI am very pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the <inline ref="R2330">Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australiaâs Skills Needs) Bill 2005</inline>. I was listening quite carefully to what the member for Ballarat had to say, and I think she made a useful contribution to the debate, but I have to say it does concern me when people start saying that our government has not done anything to address the skills shortage and has created problems in this area. As I hark back to Laborâs administration, it developed a culture which really only valued university education and neglected technical and skills training. And I think the unions also have to take some responsibility for having contributed to ensuring that technical and skills training became a stumbling, lumbering dinosaur and locked into a 1950s mentality.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I remember going just a few years ago to visit a die-making factory. The people there had rung meâI think I was shadow minister for small business at the timeâand they raised the skills training issue with me. This is when Labor were in power. They were saying that they were unable to get the government to consider new technology and new training methods in skilling up die makers. Indeed, they had so much work they were turning it away; it was going to Korea and other countries but coming back to them to do the finishing. They were able to produce the work more competitively, cost-wise, but also at a higher quality. The whole family was engaged in the business working seven days a week. The problem was that die making required somebody to first do an apprenticeship in fitting and turning and then go on to die making. I think, if my recollection is right, it was a six-year program. It meant that by the time somebody was into the second apprenticeship in die making they were adults on adultsâ pay, and it just became uneconomic. But the most important point was: why were we persisting with the 1940s-1950s model of skilling die makers when most of the work was being done by computer aided technology? The whole industry had changed so much we needed a new approach and it was not forthcoming under the previous government. I know that the Australian National Training Authority has done a very good jobâand there was debate on that issue earlierâbut I think governments have a responsibility to modernise their approach to skills training. This government has certainly tried to do that.</para>
<para>I believe deeply in education at all levels. I think we desperately need those people who have great intellectual skills and make a tremendous contribution through our universities. We have produced some brilliant people in all fieldsâscience, medicine, the arts, culture, the social sciencesâand right across the disciplines. Their contribution is tremendous, but if we look at people in any profession, whether they be a brain surgeon, an engineer or an architect, for them to be able to do the work they do there have to be people who are capable of designing and producing the range of equipment and materials needed for them to operate effectively. The Minister for Education, Science and Training, the Hon. Brendan Nelson, has widened the public debate about the whole issue of education, to bring some level of balance back into it and to send out a signal to our young people that says: âWe value you. We value you for whatever talent you can bring to your community.â</para>
<para>Young people have a variety of talents. Not everyone wants to or can pursue the intellectual pursuits required in the discipline of getting a university degree. But that in no way devalues the contribution that many of our young people can and do make to our communities. I see this in our schools. I have to say that I am always very pleased when I go to visit a school in my electorate. It is hard to publicly credit them all, but I took the minister to the Swan View Senior High School recently. They have a large number of Aboriginal students. They have worked so hard in helping these young people discover their talents. They value those talents and the school works hard to make sure those students make the most of whatever abilities they have.</para>
<para>They have a program which has been very successful in encouraging both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal students to complete their schooling; but, more importantly, they value the talent of their students and try to direct them into the areas where they are most suited. I met two students who had come back to the school for the occasion who had graduated from the school in jewellery making and design. They had been invited to work for one of the top jewellers in New York, and today they are working for one of Perthâs top jewellers. They are wonderful young people who are lit and enthusiastic about what they are doing. They feel like they are valued for their talents and the way they contribute to their families and their communities.</para>
<para>I would like to give some credit to the Minister for Education, Science and Training, the Hon. Brendan Nelson because, since he has taken over this portfolio, he has worked extremely hard to bring balance into the policy to ensure that the message about valuing young peopleâs talents and abilities, wherever they are, is recognised. The Motor Trade Association of Western Australia came to me because funding was going to be removed from some very successful pilot projects that were set up by the automotive training industry in WA. At their request, I talked it through with the minister to see if we could make sure the funding for these pilots would be ongoing. These pilots have successfully concluded. They were about making sure that young people understood what the modern motor trade industry is all about and the kinds of skills they need in this day and age to build motor vehicles and all the systems we have come to appreciate in motor vehicles. They had been having trouble recruiting new people into the motor trades, but there are now a number of young people attached to the Swan TAFE college who are doing apprenticeships in the motor trades area.</para>
<para>The program was also about convincing the parents to encourage their young people to look at options other than university. Some people will feel very defeated if a university degree is all that is valued in our communities, and I do not think that is a healthy situation. There are lots of other programs in other schools. Northam and Narrogin have very good programs to recognise and encourage the development of individual skills. They value that and they make sure young people know they are valued for that.</para>
<para>This bill makes sure that we have an investment in education. It is not an expense; it is an investment. Education is an investment in an outcome that is very important not only to our industries and our ongoing national prosperity but also to the development of our young people. It is an investment in making sure our young people feel that they are valued contributors to their community and that they are able to reach their goals and aspirations and make a contribution they can feel proud of. The funding of $343 million over five years is no small commitment to supporting an initiative to locate colleges throughout Australia which, I understand, will provide tuition for 7,200 students, with up to 300 students in each college. The first of these colleges will be operational, I understand, from around 2007. As I said, education is a key element not just for Australiaâs future but for every person to have an opportunity to maximise their abilities and develop themselves as contributing members of their families and the wider community.</para>

<para>âMr Deputy Speaker Scott, as you would know, one of the benefits of being a Deputy Speaker is that you get to listen to other people in the debate. If you are speaking in the debate, it is particularly helpful to get a broad cross-view of what people in both the government and the opposition have been saying. It is also particularly useful if you want to track the âsnail trailsâ given to government membersâthe specific phrases and arguments which they should include in and mould their speeches around. The level of cant, humbug and propaganda at the core of the government speeches on this trade issue is almost unbelievableâexcept when put into a larger context. Throughout this parliament and the last parliament we have had the absurd situation of government minister after ministerâand now member after memberâtalking about the dreadful situation in the 1980s when Labor was in office federally. They have argued that federal Labor in the eighties and nineties was trying to convince everybody in Australia that only a university education was worthwhile. That is cant, humbug and pure propaganda. The people who represent the Labor Party in this House today and the Labor Party governments since Federation have worked with might and main towards the goal of a proper, appropriate and full education for people at all levels of the educational spectrum. The governmentâs argument is inverse snobberyâbut they have been doing this for so long and so insistently, with speaker after speaker parroting the line that has come out from the minister, that it needs a bit of extra time and a bit of extra exposure.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The member for Pearce, in what was otherwise a reasoned speech, pulled out this line and said, âIsnât it terrible that in the eighties people were toldâand young people have been influenced by thisâthat the only real thing is a university education?â Where did I hear that line before today? I heard it from the member for McPherson. You can tell she is a believer by the fervour with which she put this forward. She was talking about an underrating of the trades. She said, âThere is a problem in the electorate in that people underrate the trades.â She then went on and used the same sort of line: âThis is really a problem caused by the previous federal Labor government. People only want to go to university; theyâve been told that that is the only thing to do.â</para>
<para>The reality, from my point of view, is that from 1996 until now this federal government has pulled not only money and resources but also application towards the task away from the whole question of providing education at the trade level in Australia. They have denuded the statesâ capacities to do a proper job at the TAFE level, in exactly the same way as they have denuded the statesâ abilities to properly care for and administer the statesâ hospital systemsâthere has been in the order of a billion dollars pulled out of that. We know what they have done progressively to rip away the very foundation of effective trades training in Australia. We also know that when the former member for Goldstein, Dr Kemp, was Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs in Australia, the government introduced the notion of ânew apprenticeshipsâ and the governmentânot only when he was a minister but through successive ministers and membersâargued the great glories of new apprenticeships.</para>
<para>The reality is that new apprenticeships are traineeships. They are not full, old-style apprenticeships; they are the quick and easy method of trying to get people through as fast as you can in areas that are not hard-core trade areas but are the ones seen as vocationally appropriate because there is an increased demandâfair enoughâand where you could push a lot of people through without putting much money in and say, âGee, havenât we done a terrific job with apprenticeships? See how we have fixed this with all this burgeoning growth in apprenticeships.â You could now argue that there has been a 40-year decline in fundamental apprenticeship training in Australia, but this government has supposedly fixed it by cutting real and significant money from technical and further education institutes Australia wide. At the same time the government has introduced a group of traineeships which were second-order apprenticeships. They required less time, less effort in terms of how they were put together, less application and less intensive approaches in terms of the amount of money that education institutions needed to invested.</para>
<para>So here we have government membersâthe member for Pearce and, previously, the member for McPhersonâarguing this well-worn line that the government tries to get in wherever they can. They say, âLabor are snobs and Labor only want people to be educated at university.â But the best and clearest statement I have heard so far of the governmentâs real argument came from the member for Casey. He said, âOne message sent in the eighties was that you had to go to a university.â He talked about that a little bit and then he went on to talk about what this bill is about and what this debate is about. He said, âIt is not just about whether you go to university or do a trade but it is about symbols.â He said that the pathways should be of equal value, and that there should be an equal value between universities and trades or apprenticeships.</para>
<para>This argument is a bit like that of Mr Blairâin the United Kingdom, where it may have been marginally appropriateâarguing that there was something called New Labour. People were coming to Australia and saying, âWhere there was an old distinction between the hard left and the hard right in Britain, New Labour could come forward as a completely new product.â Some people then took that and said, âWell, letâs place it in Australia.â I have always thought that it was an absurd notion that a new labour party needed to be set up in any context where there was a mixed economy and where there was no real fundamental argument between hard right and hard left, and between capitalism and communism. Equally, to argue here that you need to impose some kind of new realityâa new symbolâto say that there should be equality between the universities and the trades is bordering on the insane. This could only arise out of the cant, humbug and propaganda that the government have been proceeding with for a defined purposeâto try to turn upside down peopleâs normal perceptions of what the Labor Party is about, what this opposition has striven to achieve, and what we fundamentally value as really important foundation stones of the society.</para>
<para>Education, whether it be through trade training or university, is fundamentally important to this economy. This government has walked away from technical and further education for the last 9Â¼ years. This government came up with its own bright idea, just before the last election when the penny was dropping: maybe new apprenticeships were not enough in those soft trade areas. Maybe the fact that the ACTU said that there are 130,000 skilled trades jobs going begging in Australia, because this government has not put the effort in and has not been concerned enough to provide for the future, is finally starting to be realised.</para>
<para>As the member for Reid so cogently argued, in the 9Â¼ years that this government has not done what it should have done in skilled trade provision through our education systemâ(1) because it is too hard, (2) because they do not want to do it, (3) because it would cost too much money and effort, or (4) because they were ideologically against itâit has, instead, substituted skilled people from overseas. They have increased the program from 77,000 to 97,000 skilled migrants per year. They are bringing people into Australia because they are not training young Australian people in trades. The government have the temerity to argue that we on our side do not value trade trading and that we value university education above that. They have deserted the field for 9Â¼ years and deserted the thousands of kids who wanted to get into TAFE places year after year, but now those hundreds of thousands of people who could have gained trade trading over that 9Â¼ years, if there had been proper support from the Commonwealth for the TAFE system, have been utterly placed outside the system.</para>
<para>Instead of providing that supportâit is not well known, but the member for Reid referred to it here this very dayâwe have the other great substitution. It is not the yearly intake; it is the four-year temporary entry visas that have been given to people who are already skilled tradespeople to allow them to come into Australia and to work at their skill and who are then expected to leave. When this was first introduced it was for companies like IBM or Xerox or the other major multinationals who argued a case to government that people with specific trade capacities were not available for their particular industry or that, because of the nature of their multinational organisation, they needed someone from the Singapore office or the Ottawa office to be in Australia for a four-year period in order to let their company run well and profitably. They would be given a four-year temporary entry permit and at the end of those four years they would be off to somewhere else within the companyâs multinational structure. There have been 440,000 people who have come under that scheme during the time that this government has been in office.</para>
<para>Guess what: this is the great hidden migration into Australia. A government that, while it was in opposition, spent more than a decade pillorying our government over the immigration issue has been running a secret immigration program. Apart from the fact that it has dramatically jacked up the level of immigration into Australia under the total program and the skills program, almost half a million people have been brought into this country, and at the end of the four years, guess what: they are not going back to IBM or Xerox or some other multinational. These are tradespeople from Ireland, England and other places in Europe who come into Australia, and at the end of four years they rock up to the immigration department. There are 50,000 or 60,000 people a year who say: âLook, Iâve been working here for four years. Iâd like to apply to stay in Australia. These are my trade skills. This is where Iâve been working. Iâll sign your form. Thank you very much for that reduction in the number of points I need. I am now going to become a proud permanent resident of Australia.â Every one of those 50,000 to 60,000 people is taking a place in the work force from people born in Australia, educated in Australian primary schools and secondary schools and not able to get a place in an Australian technical and further education college.</para>

<para>âYes, it is disgraceful, Member for Moncrieff. It is disgraceful, because for 9Â¼ years this government has presided over a reduction in trade training in this country. This is a government that does not believe in training in hard educational skills areas and that does not believe in all the traditional trades because its costs a lot more money and because the institutions of old that used to provide itâTelstra, the State Rail Authority and othersâhave been so changed in their nature that they are no longer major providers of apprenticeships and training in Australia. But the government has decided that it could not do it or that it did not want to do it, so we have a substitution racket going on.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The government is not providing the real education that is needed but is providing for increased immigration and special programs that have been hidden from public view where you have people substituting for the people that we owe our first loyalty toâAustralians born and bred, who should have the ability to go and do what they want to do. If they want to do trade training, they should be able to get into that trade training and be supported through it by the national government, which should properly support technical and further education, and by the state governments. If they are not working hard enough at those programs, make sure that you take the leaders in national government and get the changes made.</para>
<para>What do we have in this bill? We have another substitution for really tackling the fundamental problems that Australia faces in the trade skills area. We have a substitution of 24 colleges, strategically placed in marginal seatsâexcept, as we have heard, in the case of the member for Gorton and the area of Sunshine in his seat, to his fundamental surprise. We have technical colleges where the fundamental prerequisite is not contained in this bill at all. Go to the web site and you will find it; go to the ministerâs instruction and you will find it. We do not have bricks and mortar technical colleges; these are technical colleges that will exist within existing technical colleges or schools. Or they will be almost virtual technical colleges, because the $343.6 million that is being provided by these bills will go towards people trying to aggregate demand, to put together proposals for trade training in the traditional trades on the fundamental ground that you cannot be in it unless you have Australian workplace agreements. That is a fundamental prerequisite. Those Australian technical colleges, if they are dealing with and taking services from other entities, also have to have Australian workplace agreements in place if they are going to be part of that process.</para>
<para>As the member for Gorton so cogently pointed outâand I would not be aware of it, except that I was in the chair and listened to what he said, and he made a fundamental caseâin 9Â¼ years the government, so utterly wedded to Australian workplace agreements, have achieved a mere three per cent rate of placement. Try as they might throughout the Commonwealth Public Service and everywhere else they could put pressure on, they have not been able to convince people that these things are good. So what are they doing? It is not in this bill; it is outside this bill, but it is still mandated as a fundamental foundation. If you want to put a technical college together, you have to sign up to a mandated Australian workplace agreement. You do not get all the other choices that every other business in Australia gets.</para>
<para>There is the argument that the college will be run by a body overseen by local businesspeople and that it will have a feed from local business in terms of the needs within the area. But I thought that was what we had achieved in technical and further education. That is the way it was grounded. That is the way it has grown. That is why it is a fundamental and vital part of our educational system. What we have in this legislation is a proposal that you can have technical and further education operating as the new ATC model only if you accept the propagandist basis of the governmentâs approach to industrial relations. This is the governmentâs religious basis.</para>
<para>If you look at the policies of John Howard from 1974 on, the member for Bennelong has consistently been about one fundamental thingâthe introduction of an IR system that is his preferred IR system. Come 1 July and after, no doubt we will see more of it. The member for Gorton was right: in this bill and other bills the fundamental religious impulse is evident. I think it is a good thing to have a division between church and state when it comes to running a government in a civil society. I think the religious nature of the Prime Ministerâs attachment to his particular approach to IR beggars that distinction between church and state. It has gone beyond the normal, rational bounds. To have in this bill a fundamental provision that is outside education and training but is a prerequisite for those 24 technical colleges getting a guernseyâthey have to sign up to an exclusive, mandated system of industrial relations, including Australian workplace agreementsâis just beyond belief.</para>
<para>Further, to have the line run by one government member after the otherâand, indeed, argued by the member for McPhersonâthat the Australian Labor Party and the Australian people at large are at fault because they do not value trades training highly enough is an absurd inversion of the truth. It is propaganda over reality. What this government has not gone near, even with the introduction of this proposal, is that, if you do not train people and train them well enough and adequately enough, if you do not have enough skilled workers across all of the fundamental areas in an economyâan economy that is much more complex, much more diversified, much bigger and a much more difficult challenge than before because of all the changes in the 1980s and 1990sâyou will not have future productivity and the future levels of growth that you should have. You will have an economy running into the doldrums, which is what we have now. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI am very pleased to speak to the <inline ref="R2330">Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australiaâs Skills Needs) Bill 2005</inline>. It is an important bill because it firmly delivers on a commitment that I and, more broadly, the coalition made during the last campaign. During the last campaign, it was my pleasure to join with my colleagues on the Gold Coast in announcing to the people of Moncrieff that the Gold Coast would be the location for the establishment of one of 24 Australian technical colleges. I highlight that the establishment of these colleges represents a concrete step forward. More young Australians will have the opportunity to undertake skills based new apprenticeships at a time when Australia certainly needs additional skilled young Australians in traditional trades and vocations.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>From my perspective, this bill is a very real way in which the Howard government once again demonstrates its responsiveness to what is a very serious skills shortage in Australia. It is a skills shortage that is born as a consequence of 14 years of strong economic growth which is, of itself, a by-product of having a government that is able to manage the economy effectively and responsibly and to ensure that all Australians have a higher standard of living and a better chance of securing a job, of obtaining a good education and, more importantly, of living out the rest of their lives in a safe and secure environment, both economically and socially.</para>
<para>That stands in stark contrast to the legacy of the Australian Labor Party and to the diatribe of sorts that I heard from the member for Blaxland when it comes to not only their attack on Australian technical colleges but also the perverse way in which they have got so fundamentally wrong what has occurred in Australia over the last decade and four years. In particular, I am amazed that the Australian Labor Party credit the skills shortage to the Howard government not providing enough skills training. I will turn to that issue in just a moment.</para>
<para>More importantly, the Australian Labor Party talk about how there was no skills crisis while they were in government. There is a simple reason why there was no skills crisis while the Australian Labor Party were in government. It was because there was a jobs crisis when they were in government. When the Australian Labor Party were in government, there was an 11 per cent unemployment rate. There were record interest rates. The overall result was that Australians had very limited opportunity. Young Australians would be going through school uncertain of whether there would even be a job to go into when they graduated. That is the legacy of the Australian Labor Party. That is the reason why there was no skills crisis under the Australian Labor Party. People were in a jobs crisis and were going around trying to secure any form of employment they possibly could at a time when we were apparently having the recession we had to have. It was at a time when Paul Keating and the Australian Labor Party were standing up and boasting about the fact that they had got interest rates up to 18 per cent, they were breaking the back of inflation and what a good message it was for all Australians. They are not sentiments that I subscribe to in the slightest.</para>
<para>I turn very briefly to the accusation that the member for Blaxland made when he said that fewer Australians are in training now than there were when the Australian Labor Party were in power. I heard comments echoed by members opposite to the effect that the member for Blaxland was right. Let us just look at the reality. Let us look at apprentice and trainee participation rates for 15- to 19-year-olds: in 1996, the participation rate was 5.9 per cent; in 2003, the participation rate was 8.3 per cent. What about the training rate? Again, to tackle head-on the erroneous examples that the member for Blaxland gave, the training rate was 11.2 per cent when the Howard government was elected in 1996, and it is now 16.3 per cent. That is a very different story to what members opposite allege. It is an entirely different story to the message that the opposition would like people to believe in this chamberâif they were to sit down and swallow hook, line and sinker the line that the Australian Labor Party are running.</para>
<para>Likewise, there is the line that the Australian Labor Party runs about how these technical training colleges are wrong because they sit outside the TAFE system. Let us look at the TAFE systemâsomething that traditionally was meant to provide for Australiaâs vocational education and training. We see what an abject failure the TAFE system has been, predominantly, I would argue, because state Labor governments give TAFE absolutely no priority at all. It is interesting to compare the cost of education at a TAFE college on the Gold Coast with the cost of education at a university. Not only is there no deferred payment scheme for vocational education and training under TAFE, which sits in contrast to what occurs at universities, but the cost of undertaking a course at TAFE, thanks to the Queensland state government, includes an up-front payment and is also actually more expensive than the cost of doing a university course and paying HECS fees. That shows the perverse way in which state Labor governments continue to ignore the TAFE system and fail to provide TAFE funding which would empower young Australians and provide training opportunities for them into the future.</para>
<para>To get back to the comments that the member for Blaxland made, what most upset me in his contribution was the hoary old chestnut that in some way skilled immigrants coming into this country take away jobs that belong to Australians. I really thought that thinking like that was ejected from this country in the 1940s and 1950s. I really thought that members of the Australian Labor Party would have more moral fibre than to come into this chamber and try to portray immigrants as taking jobs off Australians.</para>
<para>It is an absolute disgrace that the Australian Labor Party would claim that immigrants coming into this country detract from the overall fabric of Australian society and deny young Australians job opportunities. It is an outright lie and we have decades of experience to indicate why that is incorrect. Make no mistake: Australia is a nation built not only by those of us who were born here but, more importantly, by a very significant proportion of immigrants. They add to Australiaâs social fabric in a very meaningful and realistic way. Despite the roly-poly, topsy-turvy economics of the Australia Labor Party, any person with a basic knowledge of economics would be able to explain that immigrants actually help grow the economy, promote job opportunities and promote opportunities for business. And skilled immigrants bring wealth into this nation, which means that all Australians are better off. That is a lesson that the Australian Labor Party obviously need to learn before they make allegations that immigrants take jobs from Australians. It is wrong.</para>
<para>Â Regarding the Australian technical college that will be operating on the Gold Coast, I have been very pleased with the very strong response I have received from industry and stakeholders in training organisations on the Gold Coast. In particular, we have a booming hospitality industry on the Gold Coast, coupled with a booming construction and building industry and a booming marine industry. These three industries represent very great and significant opportunities for young Gold Coasters. These three industries provide career paths and security of employment for young Australians. They also, of course, have an unrelenting demand at this point for new people to move into these industries to acquire skills and ensure that they continue to add value to the activities that industry is undertaking in these three areas of hospitality, marine and construction.</para>
<para>A number of consortia have approached me about putting in bids for the Australian technical college that will be built on the Gold Coast. Whilst I have not attached myself to any particular bid, overall I have been exceptionally impressed by the way in which stakeholders and industry are working collaboratively to ensure the success of the Australian technical college that ultimately will be placed on the Gold Coast. Irrespective of which consortium is successful it demonstrates the way in which you can use collaboration between industry and training organisations to maximum effect. For example, I have had the Australian Institute of Training and Development, the Restaurant and Caterers Association, marine industry representatives, Bond University, Griffith University, Boss Homes, AB Paterson College and other high schools on the Gold Coast all sitting down together to talk about what they need to do hand in hand to provide opportunities for young Australians.</para>
<para>The establishment of the new Australian technical college on the Gold Coast is part of the national framework that this bill provides. Funding of $343.6 million will be provided over the next four years to support infrastructure development and the additional costs associated with the delivery of the specialised programs the Australian technical colleges will provide. I think it is very good that we are encouraging young Australians to undertake their secondary studies in years 11 and 12 and at the same time undertake school based new apprenticeships. The fact that the Gold Coast Australian technical college will specialise in a particular tradeâand we do not know which trade until the successful bidder is announced, but presumably it will be in one of those three industries of hospitality, building and construction or marineâand also provide for at least three additional trades is a positive for young Gold Coasters.</para>
<para>The fact that this bill also has a requirement for colleges to be linked to a registered training organisation and to have a governing body chaired by a local businessperson and consisting of local industry and community representatives, as well as providing flexible employment arrangements through AWAs, means that these Australian technical colleges will not only be flexible but will be practical and, most importantly, will ensure that they are responsive to the needs of industry and can adapt to ensure that the education provided to young people undertaking their studies at these colleges will be the very best and most relevant to their future endeavours.</para>
<para>I will make some concluding remarks about these ATCs. First and foremost, I am very pleased to be able to deliver on a commitment that I and my colleagues on the Gold Coast gave to ensure that there will be a new ATC on the Gold Coast. I am very impressed with the high level of collaboration between industry and training providers. I wish all of them well with their respective bids. I am certainly looking forward to seeing the new ATC on the Gold Coast. Because of industry, government and training providers all working together, young Gold Coasters going forward will have the best opportunity they have had for many years to secure a relevant education and complete their secondary studies. Industry will be provided with young Australians, well trained in specialist skills, who can be sure of a secure job future and be sure that, whatever industry they go into, they can meet employersâ demands. They will have a guaranteeâor as close as one can get to a guaranteeâof ongoing employment. I commend the bill to the House and urge all to support it.</para>

<para>âBefore I comment on the <inline ref="R2330">Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australiaâs Skills Needs) Bill 2005</inline> and the obvious limitations that I see in the governmentâs response to the skills crisis that is facing our nation today I want to respond to a number of remarks made by the member for Moncrieff. I was very disappointed with his response because it typifies the attitude of this government. The government would not acknowledge the crisis in terms of skills shortages across a range of traditional industries. Now even the business lobby has been telling the government that this skills crisis is one of the substantial constraints facing business across our nation. Belatedly, the Howard government have now come to realise that there is such a thing as a genuine skills crisis, but they will not accept any responsibility for the fact that this crisis has developed while they have been asleep on the watch.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There is nobody the government can blame other than itself for allowing this situation to develop. In 2004, according to independent advice by the National Centre for Vocational Education Research, there was a four per cent drop in the number of trainees and apprentices in training nationally in Australia. When the member for Moncrieff and others on the government side come into this House pretending that this crisis does not existâeven though belatedly acknowledging that problems are emerging in a range of industriesâit is always somebody elseâs fault; it is never the governmentâs fault. I can tell the member for Moncrieff and others on the government side that I looked at the figures in my own electorate of Throsby. I asked the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education just what occurred from 1996, when the Howard government was elected, to 2004. On the governmentâs own admission, the number of trades and related workers in trainingâthat is, apprentices in training in the traditional trades areasâfell from a level of 880 in 1996 to 870 people in training in 2004. So in my electorate we are training fewer people in the traditional trades than in the first year of the Howard government. And having 870 people in training in 2004 was a marked improvement on what was happening in the early 2000s. In 2001, the number of people in training had fallen to only 630.</para>
<para>The member for Moncrieff and the government continue to obfuscate the issue. They talk about the huge growth in the training of new apprenticeships, as the member for Moncrieff did, without distinguishing those who are in training as trainees and those who are in training in the traditional trades. It is true to say that in the electorate of Throsby in 2004 there were 2,150 trainees and apprentices engaged in training, a substantial increase over the 1996 figures. But when you break down the figures, you find that there has been a huge decline in the areas of greatest needâthe traditional trades.</para>
<para>I understand that the government went to the last election with a promise to create 24 new technical colleges and that two tenders have been submitted from my region for the creation of such a college. The colleges in themselves are not something that we on this side of the House oppose, but we do oppose what we see as the governmentâs very limited response to the skills crisis that is confronting people today. It is here. It is in front of all of us. It is in front of businesses in my electorate. It is a crisis that is going to grow. At best, the proposals that the government has incorporated into this bill will only see students graduating with an apprenticeship qualification in the year 2010. So this is a very limited response to the major crisis that is confronting our nation and that is acting as a substantial brake on potential employment growth this year and into the future.</para>
<para>It is reasonable for the opposition to query whether this initiative is good public policy. I have come to the conclusion that it is not. I have major reservations about this proposal because it does not deal with the issues that are confronting the people whom I represent, both the young unemployed in my electorate and the businessesâpredominantly small businessesâwho are crying out for skilled labour now. The decision to establish these 24 colleges will barely make a dent in the crisis. At best, we will see 7,200 students go through these colleges when fully operational. That represents only two per cent of all Australian students in years 11 and 12. The overwhelming majority of senior secondary students will have no affinity and no connection with these colleges. That lucky two per cent will be years away from graduating as qualified tradespeople.</para>
<para>Businesses in my electorate cannot afford to wait year after year for action from this government. They are crying out for more skilled workers now, not in four or five years time. As we know, the estimates are that we will have a shortage of over 130,000 skilled workers in the next five years. The 7,200 students who will graduate from these new colleges will be just a drop in the bucket in dealing with this crisis. After eight years of dragging its heels and being asleep on its watch, this government has finally been forced to acknowledge that there is in fact a skills crisis. But its responses to that crisis are far from adequate. I think it is unsatisfactory just to rely on the argument that employment growth and lower unemployment levels are the reasons that this skills crisis has emerged.</para>
<para>Since 1998 this government has turned away 270,000 people from TAFE and created a huge skills deficit by not putting its fair share of funding and investment into our vocational education and training system. How do you justify or explain why this government turns away 40,000 Australians from TAFE each year and fails to meet the unmet demand in that system? If this government invested the funds it is using for these new colleges and put that money into the existing TAFE stream it could, on our reckoning, create more than 45,000 desperately needed new places. Instead of wasting millions of dollars duplicating Australiaâs first-rate TAFE system and limiting this new training initiative to a mere two per cent of senior secondary students, I believe, and I think my community believes, that this government would be well advised to allocate those resources to the system that has historically trained tradespeople and made a significant contribution to economic growth and development in our country.</para>
<para>I fear that the governmentâs response, while being very limited, has got much more to do with its blind pursuit of and zealotry about the IR agenda that we have seen raised in this chamber in a number of debates on legislation that has come before us. I believe the proposals contained in this bill to establish these 24 colleges are really driven by an IR agenda as much as they are driven by the needs to deal with the skills crisis that confronts our nation here and now. I find it very surprising that, although not specifically mentioned in this bill, the government has indicated in both the second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum to the bill that the conditions of funding of these colleges will include industrial requirements, specifically the provision for AWAs, individual contracts of employment, and performance pay.</para>
<para>You might ask: what on earth has this radical industrial relations agenda got to do with the nationâs skills crisis? The more that people out there in the community understand the intent of this government to try and force through an IR agenda that has nothing to do with addressing the real skills crisis, the more they will be horrified to understand the real motivation of this government. As I said earlier, on the time frames outlined by the government, the proposed colleges will not deliver a single additional qualified tradesperson till 2010. That is hardly an adequate response to the needs that confront businesses that I represent in my region. To go back and say to them, âYouâll have to hold your breath and wait till 2010 when the first apprentices graduate from these colleges,â seems to be a totally inadequate response to a crisis that the government should long ago have acknowledged. Given the staggered commencement dates, detailed school registration processes and curriculum approvals that will have to be undergone, there is every likelihood that the colleges will be operational later rather than sooner, with the vast bulk of qualified tradespeople not emerging until the years 2010 to 2012. I again say this is a totally limited and inadequate response to a crisis that is confronting all of us in our electorates.</para>
<para>I am sorry the member for Moncrieff is not here but I just cannot believe that he will not look beyond the figures that are provided. It is very easy to quote the total number of new apprentices without actually looking at the breakdown between those being trained as trainees and those being trained in the traditional trades. If he does not believe me, I suggest the member for Moncrieff have a look at the recent survey conducted by the independent National Centre for Vocational Education Research. It showed that the numbers of apprentices and trainees in training fell four per cent nationally during 2004. Those figures are beyond dispute. The number of apprentices and trainees in training is at the lowest level since December 2002. Very disturbing is the fact that the number of people withdrawing from apprenticeships almost outstripped the number of completions. So we have a huge drop-out rate among apprentices, and the government is not responding to this. It has no positive proposals to address that problem. The number of apprenticeship commencements fell in the 12 months ending in December 2004. It fell to a level equivalent to about a five per cent drop, which is terrible news for businesses crying out for skilled workers, particularly skilled workers in the traditional trades. Regrettably, it has been nine long years that the government has been asleep on its watch. It has not heeded the warnings about the impending skills crisis that have been given out for some time now by industry, employer organisations, the union movement, the TAFE system and the TAFE directors themselves.</para>
<para>Government members would be well advised to have a look at the Senate inquiry report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Bridging the skills divide</inline>, which outlined about a year ago the very serious situation facing Australia. But again, despite the very good, practical and farsighted recommendations contained in that report, nothing was done. At least, finally, we have got to the stage of the government acknowledging that we have a skills crisis. I see even the minister is now saying that perhaps we ought to review the incentives that have been provided to employers to take on and train young people in the traditional trades.</para>
<para>What I find very disturbing in this debate is the attempted portrayal by government members of the Labor Party as, supposedly, having no concern, no involvement and no desire to ensure that our TAFE system keeps on changing so that it keeps up with the demands the economy requires. I for one do not accept that criticism at all of our side in this political debate. The Labor Party has had a long-term interest and involvement in the vocational sector, and I know that in my area we have been working very hard with community members to put in place an apprenticeship pilot program that provides incentives to local small businesses to take on and train young people. In the space of the last year, about 120 young people have been taken on as apprentices by small businesses in the Illawarra, and they are now doing their prevocational training through the Wollongong Institute of TAFE. So there are local responses to this growing problem, but much more needs to be done by this government if we are to continue to have in the TAFE system the levels of investment that will meet the unmet demand and address the obvious skills shortages that are out there in the community.</para>
<para>Also, in terms of this debate, not only has the government been asleep at the watch but it does not really have a coherent strategy or a clear understanding of how to go about dealing with the impact of skills shortages at a regional level. It is fair to say that you can access reasonably reliable data on national and state trends, and the department does that adequately, but when you try to go beyond those global statistics to look at the impact of skills shortages at a regional level, information is sadly wanting. The government needs to develop a clearer picture of the impact of the skills shortages at regional levels, in order to assist businesses in trying to develop a coordinated solution to address the problem. There is no magic bullet, and there is no one solution that in itself is going to solve the crisis. Regional trends may be quite different for a variety of reasons. For example, in the Illawarra our close proximity to the booming Sydney labour market has had a significant impact on the ability of local firms to attract suitable applicants. In 2001, according to the census data, 17 per cent of employed people in the Illawarra region commuted outside our region for work. That had grown from only three per cent in 1981. So regional skills shortage problems have a variety of underlying causes, and a multifaceted strategy is needed to address the specifics of each region and the problems they are contending with.</para>
<para>The problem that we have locally is not just that we do not have enough skilled workers as a result of the general skills crisis but also that we have an inability to recruit skills that are required locally, because the labour market is competitive and more attractive wages and conditions often take labour out of our region. What we have done locally is to create a task force in the Illawarra. That task force is grappling with the identification of current and future skills shortages and trying to tackle those shortages through a variety of responses. Our apprenticeship pilot program is one of those responses. Our local research body, IRIS, has prepared the first part of an Illawarra skills shortage study, which shows that most skilled labour in our area is now in short supply relative to demand. I will list the occupations with the most critical shortages to give you a feel for the problems in our region. Aged care nurses and carers are at the top of the list, which goes through to boilermakers, chefs, electricians, engineers, fitters and turners, registered nurses and truck drivers. So it is not just in the traditional trades areas that there are obvious problems; an acute crisis is also emerging across a range of very important occupations that service the needs of our community.</para>
<para>With regard to the crisis of skills both at the national and regional level, I reiterate that this bill is a very limited response to the crisis that faces us and that will continue to face businesses in my region today, next year and the year after. They are not happy to be sitting around and waiting for a totally inadequate response which will see, at best, 7,200 new students graduating as apprentices some time in the period between 2010 and 2012. The bill before us confirms to me that this government has no coherent strategy or plan to tackle the crisis at either the national or the regional level. The severe skills shortages have developed while this government has been asleep on its watch, and it has only itself to blame. Having 24 new colleges training a maximum of 7,200 students who will not graduate as tradespeople until at least 2010 is, in my view, a totally limited and inadequate response to a crisis which everybody acknowledges is posing severe economic restraints on future capacity in our economy.</para>

<para>âThe <inline ref="R2330">Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australiaâs Skills Needs) Bill 2005</inline> implements the governmentâs election commitment to establish 24 Australian technical colleges in identified regions across Australia. High-quality training and facilities will be offered, which will further increase Australiaâs vocational and technical education system. Today Australian industry faces a shortfall in a number of traditional nation-building trades. If we fail to meet this issue head on, our economy will suffer. Therefore, it is imperative that we encourage more young people to continue with vocational and technical education. During 13 years of Labor government, their answer to skills shortages was to place young Australians on the dole queue, providing Australians with âthe recession we had to haveâ, record interest rates, which resulted in record bankruptcies, high inflation and an economy spiralling downwards. In direct contrast, this Australian government has provided an environment of strong economic growth, featuring record low unemployment, low interest rates and low inflation. Through this bill, the government is encouraging young Australians into trades and to continue on to trade based self-employment or to opening their own small businesses. That is what this government is all about.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Technical colleges will promote a strong career path in trade occupations in key industries as a helpful and satisfying opportunity for young people. This new form of instruction is about taking industry to education, not education dictating to industry, which is the philosophy that Labor favoursâthat is, Labor is all about control, rather than allowing the free market to grow and develop on an international level. That is the major difference.</para>
<para>By providing instruction linked to workplace requirements and offering high-quality training facilities, the colleges will become centres of excellence in trade training, where capable and committed students who are interested in pursuing a rewarding career can start their vocational training. The colleges will play a pivotal role in raising the profile and status of vocational pathways in schools, encouraging more young people to consider a career in the traditional trades and to participate in the training, as a positive development for the training system as a whole.</para>
<para>The passage of this legislation will enshrine the underlying principles of the Australian technical colleges. The principal object, as stated by the minister, is to address the skills needs of the Australian economy through the achievement of a number of key goals. These goals include promoting pride and excellence in trade skills training for young people; providing skills and education in a flexible learning environment to build a solid base for secure and rewarding careers; adopting a new industry-led approach to providing education and training, in partnerships with local communities; meeting regional labour market needs; and establishing an industry-led governing body for each Australian technical college which sets out its strategic directions and performance objectives and selects the college principal. The goals include providing trade training that is relevant to industry and that leads to nationally recognised qualifications through school based new apprenticeships and academic and vocational education which is relevant to trade careers and leads to a year 12 certificate. They also include ensuring the autonomy of the principal in each Australian technical college to manage that college, to select the best staff and suitable education and training partners and to meet the targets and performance measures set by the governing body of the college; and encouraging an environment of freedom and reward for effort for the staff of the colleges through flexible employment arrangements which provide rewards linked to excellent performance. They include providing employability and business skills to young people, recognising that many successful graduates will operate their own businesses, and developing expertise in a range of industries in a region, with the flexibility to meet changing work force and local industry needs.</para>
<para>The passage of this bill will enable up to 7,200 young Australians per year to undertake high-quality education and training at an Australian technical college in an area of need. Students studying at the colleges will be provided with tuition in trade related vocational training, leading to a national training package qualification, and in academic studies which will allow them to complete their senior secondary education. Students will commence a school based new apprenticeship in a trade where there is an identified need. They will have a strong foundation to continue with their preferred trade after they complete year 12, but they will alsoâand this is very importantâkeep open the option of going on to further academic study if they so choose. This is a win-win situation for industry, employees and Australia in general.</para>
<para>The bill will make available some $343.6 million over the period to 2009 to support the establishment and operation of the 24 new colleges. This supplementary funding will support infrastructure development as well as the additional costs associated with the delivery of the specialised services which the colleges will provide. This funding is over and above the general recurrent funding which colleges will be eligible to receive from the Australian government under the Schools Assistance (Learning TogetherâAchievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Act 2004 and the recurrent funding provided by state and territory governments.</para>
<para>This bill will provide for funding agreements between the Australian government and relevant state and territory governments or the Australian Technical College Authority for the colleges over the period 2005 to 2009 for the making of payments to establish and operate such colleges. The bill therefore provides for agreements to be tailored to the needs of each individual region. Each of the 24 regions is different in the challenges that it faces and the skills shortages that are particularly obvious.</para>
<para>The bill does not prescribe any particular model of operation. This is a hallmark of this government, which provides for flexibility and innovation in the marketplace. We as a government respect the ability and the rights of people in each of these regions to shape their own destinies. Each college will be able to operate in a manner which best suits the needs of industry and students in the particular region in which the college is established. The Australian government will consider any model which has the backing of local community, business and industry groups and which meets the broad requirements for the colleges as set out in the discussion paper and request-for-proposal documentation.</para>
<para>This flexibility to accommodate local needs will be especially important in the initial years of each college. Colleges may commence operations by offering training in a specialised tradeâor tradesâthat is of particular relevance to the local region and that is in one of the industry groups which have been identified by the Australian government as a priority. Over time the colleges will be expected to broaden their range of training on offer, based on the needs of the local community, employers and young people.</para>
<para>This bill will ensure that the colleges provide specialist training of the highest quality. It will be a condition of funding that, by the time each college starts providing tuition to students, it meet all relevant state and territory requirements for registration and accreditation so that it can operate as a school and deliver curriculum leading to the achievement of the senior secondary certificate of education relevant in each of the eight states and territories. This, of course, will enable the colleges to qualify for general recurrent funding both from the federal government and, indeed, from the state and territory governments of Australia.</para>
<para>The colleges will be led by a governing body consisting of local industry and community representatives. Industry involvement is critical to the success of the colleges. As a result, the skills taught to students will be directly relevant to the needs of the local industry, enhancing young peopleâs prospects for further training and employment. This in turn supports the long-term prosperity of each of the regions in which the colleges are located and, of course, assists Australian businesses to remain competitive in a global economy.</para>
<para>The college principal will have the autonomy to manage the operations of the college and will be responsible for meeting the targets and performance measures that are set by the governing body and for the employment of staff. To ensure that colleges are able to attract and retain staff of the highest quality, the principal will be able to offer staff the option of an Australian workplace agreementâonce again, flexibility that the Labor Party opposes. Through these agreements, the colleges will be able to offer staff rewards for performance, such as performance pay, and other attractive working conditions.</para>
<para>The 24 regions that the Australian government has identified for the establishment of the colleges all face particular challenges in relation to the availability of trade skills and will clearly benefit from the establishment of such colleges. They were selected by taking into account a number of factors, including the existence of a strong industry base, skills shortages and the level of youth unemployment.</para>
<para>The Australian government is committed to raising the profile of vocational and technical education. For too long the attitude in our secondary education has been to promote tertiary education as the only viable option for young people who wish to be successful in their careers. These new technical colleges will change this attitude and restore to trade qualifications the status that they deserve. Attracting young people to trade related professions is vital for Australiaâs future and is an important step in providing for the long-term skills needs of industry. The Australian technical colleges initiative offers a new approach to achieving this and forms an important part of the Australian governmentâs overall strategy for tackling our skills needs.</para>
<para>I will use my electorate of Braddon as an example. We have had a number of forums of business leaders, community leaders and education leaders from both private and public schools. They have all been enthusiastic and excited about this new change in direction for the delivery of vocational and technical education. The only criticism has come from the Education Union. I suppose one should not be surprised at that. The Australian technical colleges will promote trade qualifications as a highly valued alternative to a university degree and will, to finish with a quote from the minister, âdevelop a reputation that will show students and parents that vocational education and training provides access to careers that are secure, lucrative and rewardingâ. I commend this bill to the House.</para>

<para class="block">That is a very comprehensive second reading amendment that the honourable member has proposed, and I will be speaking to elements of it. We have heard some very interesting points raised in the debate thus far on the government side. I note that the member for Casey exhorted members of the opposition to leave petty politics aside in considering this proposal. His exhortation rings a bit hollow when one examines the contents of this bill. It reeks of political interference and it reeks of political control. That is the nub of this proposal. This is a political bill put forward by a government that cobbled together a proposal in the context of an election and now has to work out how it is going to implement it.</para>
<para>You would go a long way to find a piece of legislation related to education and training which was as dysfunctional as this bill. We are told that the purpose of the bill is to address national skill shortages. I cannot think of a less effective way to do this. The bill is an admission by the government, after nine long years in government, that the coalition have presided over a dramatic increase in the skills shortages in Australia since they came to power. They can find a billion dollars to fight wars; they can find $100 million for useless advertising in the lead-up to an election to get themselves re-elected; yet some 20,000 young Australians cannot get access to the vocational education and training that they require to find secure employment and structure a meaningful life for themselves and their families. This skills shortage must be addressed in order to keep the economy growing and keep the banks from the doors of all those ordinary Australians that the Treasurer has encouraged into such huge debtâwhich stands at $20,000 for every man, woman and child in this country.</para>
<para>The community is always pleading with government, both state and federal, to tackle the duplication that we have in many fields of governmentâsuch as health, education and transport. This government never seriously entertains these concerns; it only pays lip-service to them. Its agenda is to gain more power and more control over the vocational education system of this country as well as the higher education system. What do we get from this particular piece of legislation? We get the establishment of another dual system in this country. We laboured long and hard during the Hawke and Keating years to get a national approach on vocational education and training. The government, in a flight of fantasy to get itself elected, has committed an enormous amount of money to these technical colleges. As we have heard in this debate, most of them are located in marginal coalition electorates.</para>
<para>There is a proposal to locate a college in the Geelong area. I am not so stupid as to think that the government believe that because I am such a good fellow they will locate a technical college in my electorate. In Corio we have the Gordon Institute of TAFE, which is a fine educational institutionâone of the top vocational education and training institutions in this country. Indeed, the honourable member for Denison, who is in the chamber, will note that in 2003 the Gordon tech won the award for being the Victorian training provider of the year. When I saw the proposal to locate one of these new colleges in my electorate, of course I smelt a rat. What was the rat? With due deference to the honourable members who are here today, it was to save the skin of the honourable member for Corangamite, who is now in the chamber. We know that the honourable member was skating very close to the line in an electoral sense. This proposal did not grow out of the Geelong community, it did not grow out of consultation with business or the education sector or the City of Greater Geelong or, indeed, with the member of parliament in whose electorate this facility may be located. No; it grew out of the coalition campaign team sitting down and saying: âWeâve got to save the skin of the member for Corangamite, so weâll give Geelong one. The member for Corio happens to represent most of the Geelong region, so weâll cover it by locating one in Geelong.â</para>

We know that he is one of those Western District graziers; he had a real technical education at Geelong Grammar, with the equestrian centreâor was it the rifle range? Listen, old sport, I learned to shoot out in the paddock, not in a rifle range. I will pit my skills against the Deputy Prime Ministerâs any day. He learnt his skills at the rifle range at the Kingâs College. But you do not need a technical education from Geelong Grammar. You need to expand the resources at the institution that has effectively serviced the Geelong region for the past 150 years.</para>

<para>âI can understand the honourable member opposite. He has his bag of money and he has been re-elected. Of course we will accept the stupidity of the Howard government in our area if it brings a dollar. But the reality isâand the honourable member knows itâthat the Geelong region is well served by an excellent secondary and vocational education system. The only limitation of the Gordon tech is that it has been screwed down financially by the Howard government, as was the case when previous Liberal governments were in power. This has prevented the sons and daughters of working people in the Western District and in the Geelong region from accessing the education that they deserve. That has always been the legacy of those opposite.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>When the Hawke and Keating government came to power, we proudly put $14 million into the Gordon tech to refurbish it. That educational institution had fallen into disarray under state Liberal governments, which had neglected it and, in so doing, had limited the opportunities of young people from the Western District and Geelong to access a decent education. Not only did the Labor government do that; we put between $10 million and $12 million into the James Harrison centre to expand training opportunities for the manufacturing industry.</para>
<para>What do we see in this governmentâs brilliant piece of planning? We see that these colleges will target the automotive and building trades. The Gordon tech has a specialist institution, built by Labor, which provides courses in those trades. Wouldnât you think that a minister with any grasp of the portfolio who wanted to get some efficiency into the allocation of resources would put resources there? That is the logical thing to do. What are they going to do? They are going to build another edifice in the Geelong region to save the skin of the honourable member for Corangamite. I am not so proud that I will not take the gold, but I have to tell you: this is a massive misallocation of resources.</para>
<para>This bill sets up a Commonwealth school VET system alongside an already functioning, nationally coordinated, state--run TAFE system and the existing school education system. Those systems came together under the Australian National Training Authority, which provided a national approach to the provision of vocational education and training in the Geelong region and nationally.</para>
<para>I have always regretted the loss of technical schools and the contribution they made to young peopleâs lives and to the nation. I would fully support the Commonwealth assisting the states through funding the reestablishment of technical schools within each stateâs education system. This would provide hands--on vocational education to a large number of currently disengaged students.</para>
<para>These technical colleges will fail because they are being established by a bureaucracy which has no direct experience in secondary education or TAFE. How does anyone think you can build an effective and efficient secondary program when it is based on all students being involved in the school based New Apprenticeships program? Has a reputable and independent research organisation done a study of the effectiveness of SBNAs in the schools as they now exist? Can the minister identify a single student who has ever completed an SBNA? I bet he cannot. It would take a student 10 years part-time to complete an apprenticeship. Has anyone done a study on the articulation that SBNA students have in full-time apprenticeships? I think the minister should ask a few key questions of his advisers, as they have put him in an embarrassing position with this proposal. It is really doomed to failure. The minister should get out and talk to a few school administrators about the problems that they currently face in making SBNAs workâcoordination issues, timetabling problems, transportation problems, finding willing and able employersâ</para>

Given that the Senate has endorsed doubling tax cuts for seven million Australians, why wonât the government now support Laborâs fairer tax plan?</para>

<para>âOver the past few weeks, on this issue the Leader of the Opposition has really earned the description of the âtwelfth manâ of Australian politicsâthe one who carries the drinks but never gets an innings and never gets to bowl.

<para>âI thank the honourable member for Forrest for his question. This country makes a very significant contribution to the task of dealing with international terrorism. I think we can be proud of the contribution Australia has made in the region and beyond. One component is that we have signed a series of memoranda of understanding on counter-terrorism. We now have signed 11 of those memoranda. Today, it was with great pleasure that I signed, in the presence of our own Prime Minister and President Musharraf of Pakistan, the memorandum of understanding on counter-terrorism with Pakistan.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>These MOUs provide an excellent framework for collaboration with other countriesâin particular, our regional partners such as Indonesia, Malaysia and, importantly, Indiaâin areas such as law enforcement, with collaboration between our police forces, exchanges of intelligence and of course information, and in some cases capacity assistance in defence and border control. These MOUs are making a real contribution to our own security and to the security of our region and the broader international community.</para>
<para>We had today a very good discussion with the President of Pakistan about the war against terrorism. I think it is worth saying yet again, as I said yesterday, that Pakistanâs President and his government have made good progress in dealing with terrorism at a number of different levels. All of us have reflected on the fact that, although the war against terrorism has a long way to go and although there will be setbacks in the futureâand it is important to make that qualificationâand although we should not be complacent, nevertheless a good deal of progress has been made in breaking up the al-Qaeda network and its effectiveness and also, closer to home, in dealing with Jemaah Islamiah and other like organisations. Australia has played a very significant part in this war against terrorism in our region and even beyond our region. The signing today of the memorandum of understanding on counter-terrorism with Pakistan is an illustration of our absolute determination to make sure that terrorism is defeated.</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for Ryan for his question. I can outline to the people of Ryan that information about consumer sentiment as measured by Westpac and the Melbourne Institute was released today. Although it showed that consumer sentiment had fallen by a slight amount, 0.5 per cent, this was following a 9.5 per cent surge in May in response to the budget. Consumer sentiment is still up by nine per cent on where it was at budget time. Sentiment concerning the current state of family finances in the 12-month outlook rose. No doubt that reflects the anticipation of tax cuts which will be implemented in Australia on 1 July.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The economy has moderated somewhat since last year. Rather than looking at an economy with four per cent growth, as we got used to, it is more likely that we will look at an Australian economy going down to be in the three per cent band. As I have said on numbers of occasions, this is not unwelcome. We have been looking for a moderation in the housing cycle for some time. It also looks as if we are now seeing a moderation in relation to consumption.</para>
<para>The Reserve Bank governor, in a speech yesterday, said that he viewed the recent moderation in growth as more likely to prolong the economic expansion than to end it. That is certainly my sentiment. If consumption moderates and the housing cycle moderates, and we get some more sustainable growth in relation to those things, the duration of this current economic expansion should be prolonged.</para>
<para>Notwithstanding that, labour market conditions are the best they have been for 29 years, with unemployment at 5.1 per cent. Our participation rate is at an all-time high. And over the last year 330,000 jobs were created in the Australian economy, with almost 70 per cent of them being full-time.</para>
<para>This does not mean that the government should rest in relation to economic reform. It means that the government should continue and should engage in new areas of economic reform. Let me name labour market reform as the most important micro reform for the Australian economy. If we can put in place real, vibrant labour market reform, this will set Australia up in structural terms for a much more prosperous future, for more jobs and higher wages.</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge his great interest and indeed his past experience as a very effective state minister for water in New South Wales. I am aware that on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> today the attention of the nation has been drawn to the Barton Groupâs work. I take that as another welcome indication of the nationâs very real interest in how we can better manage our national water resources. The report makes it clear that nationally Australia is now on the right trackâas a result, I think I can reasonably say, of the governmentâs key water policies, particularly the National Water Initiative, with the backup mechanisms of the National Water Commission and the Living Murray initiative. These are world-class policy prescriptions. I am thankful that, although it took a long time, most of the states and territories have risen above political point scoring and joined up. We await Western Australia joining with us.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We in this country are now on track in developing nationally compatible access entitlements and nationally functioning water markets and trading. As the OECD has recently acknowledged, in many ways we are showing world leadership in this area of the integrated management of environmental water. We are also now moving in areas of measurement, monitoring and the collection and retaining of information, because they have been surprisingly lacking. We still need a lot of technological development to enable us to accurately measure water usage, particularly in our rivers and ground water systems. A great deal is happening in urban water reform, although some of the states are going to have to lift their game and do a lot more. And we are seeing serious investment in infrastructure through the $2 billion Australian Water Fund.</para>
<para>We are seeking a judicious mix of measures for water savings, greater efficiencies and more water infrastructure so that we can do a better job with our water nationally. Only a couple of weeks ago, the Prime Minister announced a batch of programs out of the Water Smart Australia program for water efficiency and saving projects in Queensland. Last week, he announced a $55 million contributionâa dollar-for-dollar match with an equivalent contribution from New South Walesâfor structural adjustment for six overallocated ground water systems in New South Wales. We have now allocated nearly $90 million to support investments of some $250 million. There is a great driver or multiplier here in Queensland and New South Wales, and there will be more coming shortly.</para>
<para>So, just six months on after the National Water Commission was set up, it is already getting down to the serious business of leadership and implementation of the nationâs water plans. I think all Australians welcome that. I am glad to be able to again respond to community concerns about water and the need for us to do more.</para>
<para>I do want to make this comment: it is sobering that over the last couple of decades expenditure on water infrastructure in Australiaâand I do not want to be overly political, but that has been a state responsibilityâhas fallen way off the pace. In terms of what the OECD averages are, we are way off the mark. We have taken a very strong Commonwealth lead here. So far the $90 million we have invested has generated a further $250 million from the states, the territories and the private sector. We will need a lot more of that and less of what the report infers, and which is reported in the media as state governments having plundered the profits of water utilities and having failed to reinvest in the sector. So we look forward to better outcomes from the states and the territories. We assume they will continue to lift themselves above politics in this area.</para>
<para>I conclude by making this point: the report makes it clear that Australia does not have a shortage of water but, rather, an underinvestment in water systems to meet the needs of future generations and that our systems for sharing and managing the resource have not been strengthened sufficiently in recent decades. We have a way forward. The National Water Initiative is providing that. That is good news. I know it enjoys the very strong support of the Australian people.</para>

But at the end of it they are wondering what the Labor Party are up to, because the biggest backflip this side of the last election has occurred in the last 24 hours in this place. We have got the Labor Party in the Senate actually going against Kim Beazleyâs, the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Brand, own apparent support for the Australian technical colleges.

<para>âI thank the honourable member for Solomon for his question. I can inform the House that 850,000 Australian businesses now have certainty about the tax schedules to apply on 1 July and that every Australian income taxpayer will receive a tax cut on 1 July this year. The Labor Party campaign to defeat tax cuts on 1 July has been defeated. It has been defeated because the Australian Greens announced that they would not disallow the schedule, One Nation announced that it would not disallow the schedule, Senator Shayne Murphy announced that he would not disallow the schedule, the Australian Democrats announced that they would not disallow the schedule and there is only one party that has determined not to determine a position.

<para>âI thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question. I know of her interest, as chair of that committee, in the progress that is being made in this matter. I also know that members opposite from time to time have been interested in the progress that is being made. I certainly thank the honourable member, because I know she has welcomed the innovative family law reform package announced in the recent budget.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I was waiting to hear from the opposition in relation to that matter. I checked very carefully whether or not there had been any observations and I had to go a long way back to find any. It was in November 2004 that I saw a statement from the opposition, which said that the government failed families. It made these points. The first point was that we had failed to provide any funding for proposed new family relationship centres. The second point was that we had failed to provide money for expanding childrenâs contact programs. The third point was that we had done nothing to expedite hearings in the Family Court. The fourth point was that we had provided no money for ongoing relationship counselling or post-decision counselling. A further point was made that there had been no extra funds to fund legal aid or community legal centres for grandparents who were routinely denied support in courts.</para>
<para>For that reason, I had hoped there would be some supporting comments after the budget. I went through each of the items raised and, if you look at the response we gave, we have delivered on each of them. First, we provided $200 million over three years for 65 new family relationship centres, which are the cornerstone of the package. We have delivered 30 new childrenâs contact services across Australia. We are introducing a new single combined registry for providing families with simpler and quicker access to justice. We have delivered more than 100 new early intervention services to help families stay together. We have delivered $1.6 million for grandparents to participate in legal aid family conferences.</para>
<para>So, far from having failed Australian families in relation to the implementation of the committee report, we have responded very fulsomely. Far from failing families in need, we have delivered in full. This is in contrast to the opposition, which clearly has no policy, no ideas and nothing to say about helping families.</para>

<quote>
<para class="block">... industrial relations reform is valuable and it does contribute to higher economic growth.</para>

<para class="block">These seemed like clear and unambiguous comments by Mr Macfarlane. However, the Leader of the Opposition attempted to downplay them on <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> this morning, arguing:</para>

<para class="block">... we donât know what questions the Reserve Bank governor was asked, and we donât know the context in which he gave his answers. Thatâs been beaten up in one newspaper today.</para>

<para class="block">For the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition, I repeat the questionâand the answer which Mr Macfarlane gave. He was asked:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I wonder if you might comment on the quantitative effects on growth of industrial relations reform. If the Government is successful in its industrial reform agenda, would that have an impact on growth of a quarter per cent per annum or half a per cent or whatever?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Mr Macfarlane answered:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I think industrial relations reform is valuable and it does contribute to higher economic growth, and the reform thatâs been undertaken to date, although itâs disappointed a lot of people, has I think had quite a profound effect. Itâs meant that the economy can run faster without generating inflationary influences to the extent that used to be the case. So I think thereâs undoubtedly value in industrial relations reform.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is a clear and unambiguous statement by Mr Macfarlane.</para>

<para class="block">... as far as weâre concerned, the reforms that needed to be there in industrial relations, the enterprise reforms and the flexibility that came with all of that, thatâs been done.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In other words, the Leader of the Opposition says the lemon has been squeezed dry. When the Leader of the Opposition speaks about industrial relations reform, he has a lot to say about the past but he is very coy about what he will do in the future and about what his policy would mean. The <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> had a word for this policy yesterday. The <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> used the dreaded R-word, the word that the Leader of the Opposition will not use.

<para>âI thank the honourable member for Bowman for his question. As members of the House may know, the member for Bowman was an observer of the Bougainville elections recently. I thank him, by the way, for sending in a report that he produced. It is a report that demonstrates how successful these elections have been. Today is a historic day, not just for Papua New Guinea and Bougainville but for Australia. Today is the day of the inauguration of the autonomous Bougainville government. The Australian government, and I am sure the Australian people, warmly welcome this. Let me congratulate the new president of that government, Joseph Kabui, and the other 39 elected representatives. Joseph is a good friend of many of us. I think a lot of members of the House would know Joseph Kabui quite well. The Australian High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea, Michael Potts, is representing us today at this historic event.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The election of the autonomous government in Bougainville very much brings to an end the Bougainville conflict. I remember, and I know that the Prime Minister would remember only too well, the events of early 1997, with the Sandline crisis and the very robust response by the Australian government to an attempt by the then Papua New Guinea government to bring in mercenaries to try and solve the Bougainville conflict. I think our robust response was really the beginning of a process that the Papua New Guinea government pursued to achieve peace in Bougainville. We contributed in many ways to the peace monitoring groups. We provided substantial financial assistance. Something like 3,800 Australian Defence Force and civilian personnel have been involved with those peace monitoring groups. We have also had aid programs on the ground that have helped to deliver what I have often said when I have been in Bougainville is important: a peace dividend to the people of Bougainville.</para>
<para>Let me say in conclusion that there is some debate about the number of people who died either directly or indirectly as a result of the Bougainville conflict, but estimates range from about 10,000 to 18,000. I make the point that three or four times as many people died in the Bougainville conflict as have died, I believe, in the Northern Ireland troubles and conflict since 1969. It is worth remembering that. This has been a very bloody and a very nasty affair.</para>
<para>The previous National Party government of New Zealand, the present government of New Zealand and the Australian government all deserve a tremendous amount of credit for making this peace process possible. The Prime Minister and I have both been so involved in this. To know today that that government is being sworn in in Bougainville is tremendous. It is a great moment for Papua New Guinea and a great moment for Bougainville, but it is also a great moment for Australia.</para>

These are the same programs that they say they are going to withdraw lock, stock and barrelâthat is, of course, except for the five in the member for Brandâs electorate. It is interesting to note that we have been having a bit of a look to see how many Labor Party members actually support regional program funding in their own electorates. We have found quite a few, but the one that particularly interested me today relates to the shadow minister Mr Kelvin Thomson, the member for Wills.

<para>âI thank the member for Forde for her question. I know how important this subject is to her. As the Prime Minister and the state Labor premiers recently unanimously agreed, Australia has a very good health system. It is not perfect, but it is a very good health system by international standards. Our challenge is to make a good system even better. One area where there certainly is room for improvement is organ donation. Australia has the worldâs best organ transplantation success rate but, along with New Zealand, the worldâs worst organ donation rate. Last year, thanks largely to the work of the Hookes Foundation, half a million more people joined the organ donor register and the organ donation rate actually increased by 20 per cent. But there are still nearly 2,000 people on waiting lists, and every year more than 100 people die waiting for an organ transplant.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In conjunction with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the Australian Divisions of General Practice, the government has recently commenced a nationwide mail-out inviting people to register as donors. I am pleased to say that already some 250,000 people have responded to that mail-out, but through you, Mr Speaker, I appeal to our fellow Australians: donât ignore this appeal; donât waste your chance to help save a life. This is important: you canâtâor you shouldnâtâtake them with you, and this is a chance to leave something worthwhile behind. These are the sorts of incremental improvements that the Howard government is putting in place to make a good health system even better.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Barker for his question. The seat of Barker, being a rural seat, has of course benefited from the outcomes of our negotiations of a free trade agreement with the United States. The government prosecuted the case in advance of, during and certainly after the conclusion of negotiations that this agreement would unambiguously benefit the Australian economy, particularly in rural and regional Australia. The Australian Labor Party opposed us when we brought legislation before the parliament. They continued to raise negativities about the benefits for rural and regional Australia but the benefits continued to be delivered day in and day out.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We have seen the benefits for the beef and dairy industries and today we heard about benefits for the citrus industry. In the member for Barkerâs electorate in the Riverland, through the export company Riversun of Renmark, Australian citrus growers have seven ships booked over the next 12 weeks to deliver 1.6 million navel oranges and 500,000 cases of mandarins to the United States. The important point on this is that, yes, our citrus trade has existed in recent years with the US but as a result of the free trade agreement with the United States, the duty on citrus has been dramatically reduced. Before the free trade agreement, the duty was $US21 a pallet. These shipments will be going to the US paying only 30c a pallet dutyâthat is the reduction. It has made our product much more competitive and desirable in the US market. The savings are worth over half a million US dollars to this particular exporter into the US market.</para>
<para>That is not all. We know that the Australian exports of lamb to the US faced some considerable challenges with safeguard measures that the Clinton administration put on our lamb exports to the United States. Prior to the free trade agreement, our maximum amount of tonnage exported to the US was 31,000 tonnes. According to Steve Martin from the Australian Meat Industry Council, this year we are likely to exceed 40,000 tonnes of lamb meat into the United States, which is an extra $65 million to Australiaâs lamb producers in a year when we are suffering from severe drought. It is a very welcome extra income for Australiaâs lamb producers.</para>
<para>Contrary to a lot of the comments made by the Labor Party about the US free trade agreement over the course of this debate that there were no benefits for rural and regional Australia, the facts indicate that there are. Many industries across rural and regional Australia and the people who work within those industries are very appreciative that this government had the backbone to take on the challenge of negotiating this agreement for their benefit and for the benefit of future generations of Australians.</para>

This area of Queensland has been very hard hit by a number of very difficult adjustment issues, including the virtual closing down of the Australian tobacco growing industry. In the face of very real social and economic pressures we have attempted to help the area restructure to develop new industries. An integral part of that has been to try to provide it with the infrastructure that would underpin a viable tourism industry with the jobs that a tourism industry would provide. The guidelines and the framework provided for this particular business enterprise have not, I am advised, been contravened. I just repeat that our objective has been to try to enhance business opportunities in a quite severely affected and depressed area of Queensland.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Wakefield for his questionâand isnât it great to have a Liberal representing Elizabeth in South Australia? It is great news for the people of Elizabeth and South Australia. This government is determined to improve service delivery to all Australians. Australian families are generally fed up with having to fill in government forms, particularly when they claim Medicare, and also going into Centrelink offices in order to claim the benefits that they are entitled to. The financial services industry moved away from banking passbooks and limited trading hours in the 1980s, but the government still pursues a process of asking people to fill out forms and go into offices.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I can advise the House that the government is now developing a detailed proposal for the introduction of a national smartcard and that technology is going to provide easy access to welfare as well as health services. Current legislation ensures vigorous privacy and security standards are part of a citizenâs private information protection. The microchip in a smartcard will add additional security to the protection of individualsâ information. We are going to work closely with the Privacy Commissioner to ensure that any improvement in service delivery using new technology will safeguard every Australianâs legitimate right to privacy.</para>
<para>We are developing this proposal as a whole-of-government proposal. I can advise the House that the Prime Minister raised this with the premiers at COAG two weeks ago and the premiers are right on board and have embraced the Australian governmentâs approach to have a single standard and single protocol for the development of smartcard technology in Australia. I know that the Queensland government is developing a $300 million smartcard for public transport in Queensland. However, there is a danger to all of us that we are going to end up with different ârail gaugeâ technology across Australia during the introduction of the smartcard. We are going to avert that, because we are going to deliver, in partnership with the states and in partnership with the private sector, common standards and common protocols that ensure that Australians are going to receive the sorts of services that they should get in the 21st century with 21st century technology.</para>

<para>âWhat do the cases of Cornelia Rau, Vivian Alvarez and Chen Yonglin have in common? The answer is that between them they are symbolic of the two great hallmarks of the Howard government and all those who sail within it. The two great hallmarks of the Howard government are, firstly, rank incompetence and, secondly, rank arrogance when that incompetence is exposed. Those two, together, are the hallmarks of HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Howard Government</inline>.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Of course, that cocktailâone part incompetence, one part arroganceâis not limited to the matters which are subject to the MPI today. We see its componentsâthe two hallmarks of the Howard governmentâat work in the economy, where we have record foreign debt. We see them in foreign policy more broadly, where, when it comes to the Enhanced Cooperation Program in Papua New Guinea, $800 million has been flushed down the S-bend. We see them in the situation we are in with airport security, where four years after September 11 there is still no effective system for the screening of staff at airports. We see them in the governmentâs response to the effect of the current drought on our primary industriesâin the budget in May there was no mention of the drought, but, whoops, by June, suddenly there is one. We also see them in episodes like that at Anzac Cove, where the government effectively authorised another foreign government to demolish the site. We see incompetence and arrogance time and again from this government.</para>
<para>There is in fact more incompetence in this government than you can poke a stick at, but the real doozey is this: once the incompetence is exposed, the arrogance kicks in. âWho, me, responsible for any of these things which have gone wrong?â âWho, meâmoiâresponsible for wrongly detaining Cornelia Rau, an Australian citizen, for nearly a year?â âWho, me, responsible for deporting an Australian citizen unlawfully for four years?â âWho, me, responsible for not knowing the difference between asylum and a protection visa?â When did we in this parliament ever hear a minister stand at the dispatch box and say, âI am responsible for thisâ? How long has it been since we had a minister stand at the dispatch box and say, âI am accountable to this parliament for this thing which has been so radically stuffed upâ? When did we last have in this parliament a resignation? When did we last have in this parliament a minister taking responsibility for things going radically awry in their portfolio?</para>
<para>The reason none of these things has happened is that the central organising principle of this government is as follows: namely, they believe, arrogantly, that they can now get away with anything. Their view is that, if you have someone locked in the slammer for nine months and you can get away with it, that is terrific. If you have got Vivian Alvarez languishing in a hostel for the dying for four years and you can get away with it, that is terrific. The bottom line is that they are so used to getting away with it that this is their standard way of behaving. When some of those opposite say, âMaybe we could possibly try to change this system which is falling apart at the seamsââwhen some of the backbench over there put an idea upâthey get crushed by the camp commandant, Prime Minister Howard.</para>
<para>By the way, on that question, it is interesting to ask: what is the deputy camp commandantâthe alternative camp commandant, the Treasurerâdoing in this whole debate on immigration on that side of the House? How vocal has he been on these immigration matters? Where has he been in the debate as far as the gang of four on the Liberal Party back bench are concerned? Missing in action. He wants to pretend that he is somehow the softer, kinder, gentler, alternative leader of the Liberal Party. He is MIA, missing in action, when it comes to that debate within their own ranks, and not just MIA but internally taking the club to those who have dared to raise this matter within the Liberal Party backbench.</para>
<para>When it comes to the matters before us in this debate, alive in this debate is a principle which says: if you can get away with it, terrificâarrogance, no accountability; simply pretend it has not happened. If you have been brought up on a discipline which says that you can get away with âkids overboardâ and you can get away with going to war in Iraqâyou can get away with all these sorts of thingsâthen frankly you can understand how this arrogance now becomes part of their day-to-day operations.</para>
<para>That brings us to the case concerning Chen Yonglin. The facts on this case are fascinating when you peel them back. We started with the foreign minister saying that Mr Chen did not apply for asylum, that instead he applied for a protection visa and that, if you wanted to know anything about that, you should go and see the immigration minister. Well, whoops. That is where Alex got it wrong. He forgot to telephone Amanda, because what Amanda said, more or less at the same time, was thisâ</para>

<para>âIn fact, the immigration minister had said that Mr Chen had applied for asylumâwhoopsâand it had been rejected. And, if you wanted to find out why it had been rejected, she said that was a matter for the foreign minister. So the foreign minister was saying that Mr Chen did not apply for asylum. The immigration minister said that he did apply for asylum and, on top of that, that the foreign minister had rejected it. They cannot even get their story straight on something as basic as this, which had been kicking around in the media for some time by that stage.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>So that was plan A. It fell over badly. Plan B was the second cunning plan, when it was starting to go wrong. The second cunning plan was as follows: Mr Chen did not formally apply for protection. Okay, he might have applied for it, but he did not formally apply for protection. I reckon that is terrific! Here we have a letter from Mr Chen which is entitled âRe: Seeking political asylum in Australiaâ, dated 25 May. Our Minister for Foreign Affairs said that that does not constitute a formal application for asylum. There are some on the back bench over there and some on the front bench who sometimes question the ability of the foreign minister. Far be it from us to do that, but, frankly, if the foreign minister is presented with a letter of this type, which says at the top of it âSeeking political asylum in Australiaâ, I would have thought that even the foreign minister, given the severe challenges he faces in terms of his professional development, would have concluded that that equalled an application for asylum.</para>
<para>But, if there is any doubt on that score, it is interestingâand remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, his case is that there has been no formal application for asylum in Australiaâto go to the relevant visa subclass, visa subclass 800. On the question of what constitutes a formal application for asylum, it says, in subsection (1), âForm: Nil.â There is no form to fill out. It is almost unique among all the visa subclasses. There is nothing to fill out. The expectation by this minister in cunning plan No. 2 is as follows: someone out there who is sufficiently desperate to apply for political asylum works their way through the Migration Act and regulationsâwhich are about as long as that document on the table, before you get to the guidelinesâand says, âOh dear, whatâs the relevant form to fill out?â only to discover that there is none. Of course the letter from Mr Chen constituted an application for asylum. He said so at the top of the letter. So alternative plan No. 2 comes crashing down.</para>
<para>There we come to cunning plan No. 3. The first cunning plan was this: Mr Chen did not apply for asylum. Cunning plan No. 2 was that he did not formally apply for asylum. Cunning plan No. 3 is as follows: he really should not have applied for asylum all along. That is where Mr Downer then took the argument. I will quote what Alexander âLordâ Downer had to say.</para>

<para>Cunning plan No. 3 falls over because we have a statement from the foreign minister that Mr Chen should not have applied for asylum all along; he should have done something else.

The foreign minister plainly preferred that they were not used, but they were.</para>
<para>But underneath all of this there is a much deeper problem, and these were the matters that were the subject of questions in this House yesterdayâquestions so effectively answered by the minister sitting at the table!

<para>ârefers to the unauthorised disclosure of identifying information. What is all that about? Basically, if someone walks in the door and applies for protection, it says specifically that you cannot provide confirming information about such a personâs identity to the country or a representative of the country from which that person is seeking protection. You can understand the logic of that. If someone is seeking asylum, the bottom line is that you expect them to have protection from those from whom they are seeking asylum.</para>

<para>This raises a very interesting series of questions in terms of how this government has handled this matter over the last three weeks. That is why you had such an outbreak of anxiety on the front bench over there yesterday when these questions were posed. Let us look at the sequence of what happened. Remember that we have had confirmation already from the immigration minister that her officials, through the Sydney office of the department of immigration, contacted or had contact with the Chinese Consulate-General in Sydney about the Chen Yonglin case. Remember what the provisions of the act say: no unauthorised disclosure concerning identity. I would have thought that this raised very interesting questions about the application of section 336F of the Migration Act on that point. But there is more.</para>
<para>We also had confirmation from the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday that his departmental officials were engaging not the Chinese Consulate-General in Sydney but the Chinese embassy in Canberra on the question of Mr Chenâs case. All of this is before it becomes a matter of public record when it appears on the front page of the newspapers on or about 4 June. This was all happening before that, when it was in the private domain. Then we have something further again. Not only do we have contact between the Sydney office of the department of immigration and the Sydney Chinese Consulate-General and contact between the department of foreign affairs and the Chinese embassy here in Canberra but also, on top of thatâas the minister let slip yesterdayâthe minister personally, on 2 June, had direct contact with the Chinese embassy on this case. I remind the House again of the solemn obligations outlined in the legislation concerning the protection of confidential information for anyone seeking a protection visa. This is why we have not heard any consistent, coherent response from those opposite on these key questions.</para>
<para>We may at last have an answer to the following unanswered conundrum. Honourable members will be aware of the fact that as the Schapelle Corby case unfolded we in the opposition were in regular contact with the government, obtaining public service briefings from the government, on the details of that case. We have done the same in relation to the Douglas Wood matter in Iraq. We have sought to do the same in this case as well. When the matter first hit the airwaves on Sunday of the week before last, we requested briefings. On three occasions we requested briefings from the immigration minister, and those requests were all denied. What do they have to hide? I have grave fears that it may be to do with the application of the provisions of section 336 of the Migration Act on the protection of confidential information.</para>
<para>This is what we end up withâwe have a foreign minister who is too busy to attend to this matter in detail but who delivers the Earle Page lecture. Alexander Downer the Lionheart, defender of tyranny, says that only political conservatives are out there as consistent defenders of freedom. On that basis, Minister, I would have thought that when you were presented with an application for asylumâand taking your own words to heartâyou would have taken action, not dithered and not delayed, to proceed with providing protection to this individual seeking sanctuary in this country. On one hand Alexander Downer says that only political conservatives defend freedom, and on the other hand we see his actions on this matter. He stands condemned as a hypocrite. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âYou have been briefed. That is because the department issued, on 8 June, a media statement headed âSetting the record straightâcontact with the PRC consulateâ. The member continually makes charges against DIMIA to the effect that they are in breach or potentially in breach of the Migration Act on the basis of confidentiality, yet the department issued a statement several days ago outlining the circumstances of Mr Chenâs contact which shows unequivocally that no departmental officer is in breach of the Migration Act and that departmental officers acted dutifully and lawfully at all times. When is the honourable member going to abandon his posturing and grandstanding and address the facts?</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Mr Chen contacted the New South Wales office of the department of immigration, wanting to speak with the state director. He claimed to be a diplomatic official. A DIMIA officer advised him that she proposed to confirm this with the consulate. Mr Chen then gave us the phone numbers for the consulate so that we could check his identityâand that is all we were checking: purely his identity. The DIMIA official did not convey anything other than his name and asked whether he was a consular official. The answer was in the affirmative. It does not matter how many times DIMIA sets out the facts in this case; the member opposite is intent on clouding the issue. By doing so, he casts aspersions on the competence and even the legality of DIMIA officialsâ actions. How many times does the honourable member have to be told? No DIMIA official has broken any immigration law. They are not in breach of section 336F.</para>
<para>Section 336F, for the information of honourable members, limits the circumstances in which personnel can identify those who are applying for a protection visa in terms of passing on information to their home country. Mr Chen was not a protection visa applicant at the time of the phone call from DIMIA to the consulate. He participated in that contact so as to establish his bona fides. Quite frankly, the shadow minister, for his own political purposes, is not interested in the facts. In the unlikely event that the member opposite has not seen the media statement of 8 June, I will table it. One thing is for sure: from this point on, the honourable member has no justification, no excuse and no reason to continually misrepresent the actions of DIMIA officials.</para>
<para>This is a pretty simple matter. Mr Chen has applied for a protection visa. That is being considered in the normal way but with a high priority at present. He was not granted territorial asylum. Again, for the information of honourable members, the grounds on which asylumâsometimes known as political asylumâmay be granted are not governed by any convention or treaty and are the prerogative of each country. There is no agreed definition in international law of territorial or political asylum.</para>
<para>Territorial asylum in Australia has been granted only in the rarest of circumstances, most notablyâas has been replayed in the media at some lengthâin the Petrov case. No application for territorial asylum has been granted in Australia since 1980. Where is the criticism of the foreign minister or of the government in considering Mr Chenâs application, to the extent that there was one, for territorial asylum? Is the honourable member for Griffith suggesting that Mr Chen should have been granted political asylum? If so, he should say exactly that. He obviously wants a bet each way. On the one hand he criticised, by inference, the government for not granting territorial asylum. If it had been granted, it would have been the first time it had been granted since 1980; it has been granted only a handful of times since Federation. On the other hand, if he were in government and in the same positionâin possession of the same facts, policy considerations and public interest matters as the governmentâhe would not have granted an asylum visa. The hypocrisy is staggering.</para>
<para>Mr Chen is being properly assessed for protection, and in that the department has a lot of experience. We receive approximately 1,000 applications for protection visas from the Peopleâs Republic of China nationals each year, although last year that figure was down to 733. On average, approximately six per cent of applicants are granted protection visas, which is not an unsubstantial number or percentage of approvals.</para>
<para>The member for Griffith has a lot of answering to do in his misrepresentationâletâs not overstate itâand even in his denigration of immigration officials in the face of the stated facts. The department made it perfectly clear in its written statement that contact with the consulate confirmed only that Mr Chen worked there; it did not disclose any information about his whereabouts or his intentions. The fact that he wanted to seek a protection visa or asylum was not known to the department at the time of the phone call. Mr Chen lodged his application for a protection visa on Friday, 3 June. DIMIA offered to meet with him early in the following week so that they could conduct an interview for his application. But at his request the interview has been rescheduled for a later date.</para>
<para>I am a little puzzled that this MPI is put forward on the basis of criticising the governmentâs handling of asylum and protection visa obligations. I would have assumed that the shadow minister for immigration would have been participating in this debate, especially given that the member for Griffithâs entire presentation has been on immigration issues. The shadow minister for immigration has been sidelined. He was not in the chamber for the member for Griffithâs presentation, other than for a brief interruption when he put a piece of paper on the dispatch box for the information or edification of the member for Griffith. I think it is a pretty sad sidelining of the member for Reid. He is not even going to second this debate. Where is the shadow minister for immigration? This is a debate not so much about foreign affairs or asylum obligations; it is about immigration, as the shadow minister for foreign affairs has made abundantly clear during his contribution. So the member for Reid is definitely on the outer. He is not being allowed to ask questions on immigration. The two questions on immigration that have come my way since the last election were both asked by the member for Griffith only yesterday. So the member for Reid has been unceremoniously dumped. If that is how the Leader of the Opposition humiliates his shadow ministers, no wonder there are such rumblings about the quality of his leadership.</para>
<para>As I said, on average, we receive 1,000 protection visa applications from PRC nationals each year. In 2003--04 we received a total of 3,500 protection visa applications, of which 733 were from PRC nationals. Australia has a strong record of support for genuine protection visa applicants. We process several thousand applications each year. There are well-defined processes in place to do so as speedily as possible. We have to ensure that all applicants receive a fair hearing. Interestingly, in recent years applicants for protection visas have largely come from China. In 2003--04 they topped the list of the citizenship of the various nationalities of the applicants and they did so again in 2004--05, although the figure was substantially lower, at 382. They have the highest number of applications for protection visas. In 2003--04, protection visas were granted to 77 applicants, which is about 10 per cent of the total number of applicants; in 2004--05, that figure was 57, which was over 10 per cent.</para>
<para>Mr Chen can be assured, as can all members of this House and the general public, that his application is being treated with the utmost seriousness and that it will be very fairly determined. But because the minister for immigration may well be the final arbiter on this issue, I am limited in what I can say. It is prudent to exercise caution in this matter and not to discuss his details at great length and certainly not beyond what he or those acting on his behalf have put into the public arena. The minister may end up being the final decision maker on Mr Chenâs protection application if he is unsuccessful at the primary stage, where the department of immigration makes the decision, and then at the review stages, where the Refugee Review Tribunal and possibly the Federal Court system also make decisions.</para>
<para>Australia has a world-class refugee assessment process. It exceeds all of the expectations of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees in such processes. The high commissioner suggests that refugee determinations be accompanied by at least one review opportunity by the courts or by the merits review process. Australia provides both. In addition, Australia provides an opportunity for the minister to use an intervention power under section 417 of the Migration Act, where a person who is not a refugee is allowed to remain in Australia on broader public interest grounds.</para>
<para>Australia provides a full independent merits review using the specialist tribunal, the Refugee Review Tribunal. That allows the applicant to put forward any new claims or information they wish to submit and to remedy shortcomings in their earlier applications to DIMIA. Judicial review is also available to test whether protection visa decisions were made in accordance with the law. DIMIAâs processing of protection visa applications was recently audited by the Australian National Audit Office and its report was published earlier this year. The decision making was found to be well managed and conducted by well-trained and supported officers.</para>
<para>So what do we have here? We have a shadow minister making a great deal of noise, careless with the facts, and trying to stir up a controversy where none exists. Mr Chen presented at the DIMIA Sydney office. His identity was established without breaching any confidentiality, let alone causing any breach of the Migration Act. He was not successful in being granted territorial asylum, but he has now gone down the route which is well travelled by a great many of his fellow country men and women, a significant proportion of whom, I believe, have been granted protection. He will be dealt with according to the most transparent and best practice in Australia.</para>
<para>The member for Reid is yet to make his appearance in the chamber. The member for Griffith in his anxiety to pursue higher office within the oppositionâit is always fascinating to see members of an opposition fight over the spoils of defeatâis undermining his own colleague. This is an MPI on immigration. Where is the shadow minister for immigration?</para>

<para>âI can tell you one thing: the shadow minister for immigration is always well briefed. I may not always agree with his conclusions, but there is never any doubting the integrity he brings to his portfolio responsibilities. I am sorry we cannot say the same thing about the member for Griffith. The member for Griffith has, with the concurrence of the Leader of the Opposition, humiliated the member for Reid. Who has ever heard of an immigration MPI being conducted by the foreign minister, so much so that the member for Reid has displayed his displeasure by being absent from the chamber? What is so pressing that the member for Reid is not here to support the member for Griffith? It is simply because he does not appreciate the disloyalty being shown by the member for Griffith. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI rise today to speak on this matter of public importanceâthe failure of the government to properly implement Australiaâs asylum and protection obligations. It seems that the member for Gippsland had a degree of difficulty in understanding many of the points that the member for Griffith made earlier, so I will go over a number of those points for his benefit so that we can properly understand all of the relevant points. The Chen Yonglin debacle is yet another example of this governmentâs absolute incompetence in handling issues of asylum. It is now tragically obvious that the government has simply lost control of all matters pertaining to asylum and immigration. Its list of blunders is growing day by day. First of all, look at this absolute tragedy of Cornelia Rau. The details we all know: an Australian citizen thrown into detention because of the ongoing bungling by DIMIAâan outrageous situation compounded by the fact that some of the blame was foisted onto the states. As a former police officer, I can tell you that that is not the case. The blame lies with DIMIA and their actions at the time in the state and Commonwealth jurisdictions and the differentiation between those. In the case of Cornelia Rau, we have a woman locked for months behind the razor wire of a detention centre. A woman suffering mental illness treated in such a way is absolutely horrendous.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Then we have Vivian Solonâs case, and that is even more appallingâan Australian citizen deported to the Philippines and her whereabouts unknown by her family and friends who were distressed for years as to what had become of her. It is an outrageous situation that this has been allowed to happenâan Australian citizen being deported, thrown out of her own country because the minister in charge has taken her eye off the ball. That is what has happened. Her startling incompetence has left the bureaucrats to run the department. If the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs cannot handle the job, then the Prime Minister must replace her with someone who can. These are just the cases we are aware of. We do not know the full extent of the bungling, we do not yet know the full extent of the incompetence and we do not know the depths to which other cases have gone.</para>
<para>The governmentâs behind closed doors inquiry will ultimately reveal an immigration and asylum system in complete and utter disarray. They know they are in trouble, and that is why they have locked the Australian people out of it. That is why they have stopped them from hearing the full details, because they know that when the full details come out people will be outraged at the extent of the incompetence. Make no mistake about it: the responsibility for these monumental stuff-ups lies with the government. It is their responsibility. They will blame the bureaucracy in an attempt to spin themselves out of trouble. We all know that this is this governmentâs modus operandi. This is their agenda. Their arrogance has grown to such a height that they believe now that they do not have to be accountable to the Australian people. They believe that it is not necessary now because of the depth of their arrogance. But the fact remains that the ministers responsible have neglected their responsibilities. We are seeing this time and again on these issues. In this case we are now seeing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs playing pass the parcel with the life of Chen Yonglin.</para>
<para>These government ministers have committed a litany of blunders as they ineptly bungle their way through the immigration system. If we look at the facts clearly and follow the time line, we can see how this has happened. First, on 8 June the foreign minister said in a press conference that Chen had not applied for territorial asylum. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Look, this is quite a semantic point because he certainly applied to stay in Australia and the only semantic and minor point that I would make is that he didnât make a direct application to me as the foreign minister, for political asylum.</para>

<para class="block">And again on 8 June, in an interview on the ABCâs <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> program, the foreign minister said:</para>

<para class="block">The foreign minister has said that Chen made no formal application for territorial asylum, but schedule 1 of the regulations under the Migration Act makes clear that there is no form.

<para class="block">But sections 336 E and F of the Migration Act 1950 make such communication with a foreign government a criminal offence punishable by two years prison. Section 336E(3) of the act specifically states that disclosures of information which would identify an applicant for a protection visa to a foreign country in respect of which the application or claim is made are unauthorised. And Section 336E(1) of the act makes the disclosure of information identifying an applicant for a protection visa a criminal offence punishable by up to two years prison or a fine of $13,500.</para>
<para>Yesterday, in response to opposition questioning, the foreign minister gave an âabsolute assuranceâ that his department had not breached Australian law in its dealings with the Chinese embassy on the Chen case. But the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs in this place refused to give the same assurance when asked an identical question. So which is it? Have government representatives committed an illegal offence in their handling of this matter? The challenge today is now clear. The Howard government must guarantee it has not broken its own law by not protecting Chenâs identity. There is also a challenge for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, arising from his refusal on two occasions to deny that his department had spoken to the Chinese embassy directly about what would happen to Chen if he was returned to China. These three government ministers now have an obligation to immediately set the record straight.</para>
<para>There are chronic problems within the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. Under the current ministerâs watch, DIMIA has spiralled down into absolute chaos. We are seeing that in so many cases now. Confusion and incompetence reign, and that is no way to run an immigration system. The minister has lost controlâit is as simple as thatâand the government has failed to provide our nation with a working and competent immigration system. The Prime Minister has failed to ensure that his ministers are doing the job. It is the Prime Ministerâs responsibility to fix the problems that his neglect and his government have created.</para>

<para>âWhat we have been witnessing here this afternoon in this matter of public importance is simply an attempt at mud slinging. It is a case of: throw enough mud and hopefully some will stick. But even the execution of this strategy has been pathetic. If you sat here and listened to what we have had to put up with for the last three-quarters of an hour, you would have heard psychobabble 101 and 102 and cunning plans 123âsimplistic, extreme, tortured, cute arguments. This has been embarrassing. It was a low point for the opposition here this afternoon. It was like being flogged with a lettuce leaf.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The opposition seek to smear the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and, through it, the government. It is muck raking, plain and simple, in the vain hope of distracting everybody from Laborâs tax debacle. It is an attempt by the member for Griffith to show to his colleagues that when Labor is in a big pickle he has the ability and the ticker to turn things around. The member for Griffith is trailing his leadership coat here today and this afternoon he tripped up on his coat. His was a pathetic argument. In his argument, the member for Griffith has been reckless and a touch desperate. There is a lot at stake hereâpeopleâs reputations. There are solid citizens doing their jobs who have just been trashed here this afternoon for no good reason other than to save the skins of the opposition. It has been reckless and it has been desperate.</para>
<para>The member for Griffith has been saying this afternoon, in here and in other places, that the government should basically do away with due process and give Mr Chen a protection visa. That is what he is saying, that is what he is asserting and that is at the core of his argument. The member for Richmond also supported that line of argument. The member for Griffith, without looking at Mr Chenâs case and without looking at his bona fides, is saying, âLetâs circumvent due process.â But a protection visa without due process basically amounts to political asylum. That is what they are saying: âWhy hasnât the government immediately given him political asylum?â Because political asylum is granted at the total discretion of the government of the day without due process.</para>
<para>But, quite rightly, all Australian governments since Federation have been extremely reluctant to provide political asylumâfor obvious reasons, for responsible reasons, for good governance reasons and for sensible reasons related to our relations with countries all around the world. You do not take that sort of decision lightly. In fact, there has really been only one occasion since Federation when political asylum was granted, and that was in 1954 with the Petrov affairâthe two Russians: Mr Petrov and his wifeâat the height of the Cold War. They were circumstances fundamentally totally different to those we have seen in the last couple of weeks with Mr Chen, yet the opposition blithely stand up and imply that the government should provide a protection visa without due process, which equals political asylum.</para>
<para>Political asylum has only been given on one occasion since Federation, yet before us today the member for Griffith was sayingâdespite not being born when the last example of it was givenâthat he expected the government to bypass due process and in effect provide political asylum. If the government followed the ad hoc process suggested by the member for Griffith, it would result in an immigration system ending in a shambles. The 3,000 people applying for protection visas each year would all be queuing up to go on the <inline font-style="italic">60 Minutes</inline> TV program if the member for Griffith had his way.</para>
<para>The member for Griffith talks about incompetence. The incompetence here today has been demonstrated on the other side of the House, and it stemmed from the decision to oppose the tax cuts a few weeks ago after the budget. That is where the incompetence lies in this place. The member for Griffith has the gall to stand up here and suggest incompetence on the other side of the House. That is why the opposition is desperately looking for a distraction. It has bungled badly by seeking to stop tax cuts for all Australians, so the opposition is on a fishing expedition to detract attention from Laborâs tax embarrassment. We have had assertions and innuendo about Mr Chen Yonglin. We have had assertions and innuendo about 50 immigration detainees being interviewed by Chinese officialsâa perfectly proper practice, if you look into the facts. The member for Griffith and his colleagues do not let facts get in the way, though. We have had assertions and innuendo on Australiaâs position on Chinaâs human rights, Cornelia Rau and Vivian Alvarez.</para>
<para>Let me look at the legitimacy and the appropriateness of actions taken on these issues by the government, starting with the case of Mr Chen Yonglin. Mr Chen sought political territorial asylum in a letter dated 25 May. That is a matter of public record. It was addressed to DIMIA and delivered to DIMIA on Thursday, 26 May. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs decided not to issue an instrument that would have allowed Mr Chen to make a formal application for political asylum. The member for Griffith understands this, surely. Surely he understands that it requires an instrument, yet both members of the opposition stood up here today and carried out this charade, saying that in some way the government could have and should have provided political asylum at short notice on the basis of a letter. It requires a minister to issue an instrument. The opposition must be aware of this requirement. If not, the member is certainly incompetent in his actions.</para>

<para>âI suspect it is incompetence or worse, absolutely. The minister decided not to issue an instrument and, in communicating that decision to Mr Chen, officials also advised that if he wished to stay in Australia he could apply for a visa, including a protection visa, but that he must follow due process and not receive political asylum by default. On Tuesday, 31 May Mr Chen met with DIMIAâs New South Wales deputy state director and a representative from the protocol area of DFAT. At this meeting, DFAT reiterated the advice that he was not receiving territorial or political asylum and was unlikely to be granted a protection visa.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>His visa options, including general migration options, were explained by DIMIA and he was immovable in his request for the protection visa option. He was then handed an application for a protection visa. Mr Chen formally applied for a protection visa on 3 Juneâagain, that is a matter of public record. This will be considered by DIMIA on its merits and in the normal manner. The government regard this approach as appropriate in the circumstances. Nothing we have heard today would suggest that there are any circumstances which would alter this normal due process of assessing a protection visa application. Any other public comment about Mr Chen could prejudice consideration of his application.</para>
<para>Around 1,000 Chinese nationals a year apply for protection visas in this country. Such applications are not unusual, and this application will be treated in the usual way. In fact, 77 of those 1,000 applicants were successful in getting a protection visa last year. Why should Mr Chen be treated any differently to the other 1,000 from China who applied for protection visas last year or the other 2,000 who applied for protection visas from elsewhere around the world? This is a normal case of an application by a Chinese national for a protection visa and due process will be followed.</para>
<para>A number of contacts with DFAT officials were initiated by the Chinese Consulate-General in Sydney and the Chinese embassy in Canberra about Mr Chen. In none of those contacts was anything done improperly to convey information about Mr Chenâs intentions. In fact, in every case, due process has been followed and the letter of the law has been followed by the minister and the department.</para>
<para>This debate is a failed attempt to create a smokescreen for Laborâs embarrassment over their decision to block tax cuts for all Australians. It is grubby politics, because the opposition have been prepared to seek to trash the reputation of fine public servants and responsible government ministers for no other reason than to save their own political skins. The actions of the government in regard to Mr Chen and all others applying for protection visas have been proper and according to due process. We will not be intimidated by the crude and pathetic attacks from the opposition. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThe opposition support the <inline ref="R622">Film Licensed Investment Company Bill 1998</inline> and the <inline ref="R2354">Film Licensed Investment Company (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2005.</inline> It is non-controversial legislation. But, while it is non-controversial, it is nonetheless important. There is a history in modern Australia of, in particular, federal government intervention in, and assistance to, the film industry. That has been very important to the success of our film industry. Certainly it is recognised that the Whitlam government made some tremendous inroads in the film industry. Speaking on my own behalf, when my father was minister for the media he took particular pride in it. But he refers to the contribution made to the film industry by, in particular, John Gorton in the Fraser government. There is certainly a history of the Australian government contributing to, and assisting in, the development of Australiaâs film industry. So, in that context, today we can contribute to the further development of our unfortunately now lagging industry and get it back to the industry that we all had pride in.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Regrettably, the Australian film industry is currently suffering from a low level of local production, while private investment in the sector is also languishing. The share of the Australian box office patronage enjoyed by Australian films is also falling; whereas, paradoxically, foreign films in which Australian actors feature or star are doing exceptionally well in the box office. So clearly ample talent is available to the Australian film industry. What we need to do as a parliament is to encourage that local investment.</para>
<para>Concern about the future viability of the industry as it is currently funded has been expressed in many quarters, but it has received particular attention since the Academy award-winning actress, Cate Blanchett, at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards in London earlier this year, publicly rebuked the government for its inactivity. She said:</para>

<para>âIt is in terms of encouraging the minister for this step in the right direction, but perhaps it is too modest a step in the right direction. Under the current government, the film industry has endured a period of steep decline and the engineering of the <inline ref="R622">Film Licensed Investment Company Bill 1998</inline> reflects the current problems and uncertainties of an industry suffering from government neglect. The bill is something of a bandaid but, as I have said, we acknowledge it as being a step in the right direction. It is essentially a modest proposal that, if fully successful, will result in an injection of approximately $20 million into the Australian film industry over the next two years. That is not going to produce blockbusters, but there have been successes even with modest production budgets in the Australian film industry. Given the current investment malaise in the industry, that is certainly a modest target.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The bill seeks to promote further private investment in the film industry by allowing a 100 per cent up-front tax deduction for taxpayers investing funds in the company licensed to raise the proposed $20 million. While such shares are tradeable, the up-front deduction will be available only to the original investor. These funds will be raised by June 2007 and must be invested by June 2008.</para>
<para>The bill contains a number of welcome provisions that seek to encourage a broader, more diverse film industry. These include limitations on the level of share ownership available to any individual as well on the level of possible foreign ownership, and there are requirements that films funded under the scheme portray Australian perspectives and Australiaâs cultural diversity. That criterion is strongly supported by the opposition.</para>
<para>The bill also ensures the use of a competitive process for the allocation of the licence to raise the funding. Criteria have been established to ensure Australian management and direction of the successful company, which again focuses on creating what is essentially an Australian product, reflecting Australiaâs culture and cultural diversity. That is a goal and an outcome that the government have proposed and, again I note, is supported strongly by the opposition. But there is a long way to go before the Australian film industry is restored to health. Most immediate, perhaps, is the need to complete a review of the tax act in regard to film investment and to ensure that tax rulings do not undermine promises held out to potential investors in Australian films. The <inline ref="R2353">Film Licensed Investment Company Bill 2005</inline> is a modest proposal but, as I have said on several occasions, we recognise it as a step in the right direction. For that reason, Labor supports these measures.</para>
<para>It is generally accepted, as all members would recognise, that going to the movies or hiring a video are very much traditions in themselves and part of the Australian culture. It is relatively cheap and accessible entertainment and certainly something that we all enjoyâeither going as a couple or taking the children along to a film that may interest them. However, it is incumbent upon us that we do not take Australiaâs place in this industry for granted, for in doing this we put at risk not just a pastime that is cherished and enjoyed by Australian families but also Australian jobs and the opportunity to promote Australian culture throughout the world. While we all cherish the Australian cultureâit is a particularly balanced and desirable cultureâI think promoting it throughout our region would assist in taming, if you like, some of the more obsessive and fundamentalist views that tend to be emerging in some countries in our region.</para>
<para>I reiterate two of the very welcome provisions of the bill: that films funded under this scheme âportray Australian perspectives and Australiaâs cultural diversityâ; and that the scheme places limitations on the level of share ownership available to any individual, as well as on the level of possible foreign ownership. It is important to recognise the need to protect the diversity of our industry. Diversity in our mass media is integral to the Australian publicâs ability to communicate with one another and has been recognised over many years by all governments as being fundamental to our democratic system. While the film industry may not necessarily raise political issues, I think its ability to raise and promote issues in various forms in an entertaining way but nonetheless in a thought-provoking way can be important for the stimulation of debate in our community and to enliven interest in various issues among those who go to the movies. Certainly in terms of diversity, we as an Australian culture are a combination of many cultures. In that combination we are uniquely Australian, and this is a particular feature of our community that can be promoted through our film industry.</para>
<para>Unquestionably, media diversity fundamentally enhances the quality of what we consume as publicly available information each day. I think we all have to recognise that globalisation and the forces of economic rationalisation have seen and will continue to see our mass media undergo centralising phenomena. Indeed, the potential is there for our media to be overtaken by foreign interests. It is therefore much more important than ever that government finds the balance between free market forces and the prerogative to assert our own national identity in the media marketplace. In that context, we think the bill strikes the appropriate balance.</para>
<para>Australia has a proud tradition in film-making, and the continuation of this tradition must be assured in the fiercely competitive 21st century global environment to which I have referred. Investment capital has never been more globally mobile. Hence, there is an onus on government to encourage Australian investors to focus on their own backyard. Great Australian films are many, they are unique and they are award winning. Some truly great Australian films go back to the initiatives of the Whitlam governmentâfor example, <inline font-style="italic">Wake in Fright</inline>, which I recall featured Harry Secombe as a teacher in outback Australia. I think the movie <inline font-style="italic">Squeeze a Flower, Squeeze a Grape</inline> featured an Italian migrant making his way in Australia. The movie <inline font-style="italic">The Adventures of Barry McKenzie</inline>â</para>

<para>âI am going back to the 1970s at this stage, but I would recognise the minister going back even earlier than that. At that stage, to give that movie a kick along, I recall that the then Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, and his wife, Margaret, featured in the return of Barry McKenzie to Australia. In 1978, <inline font-style="italic">The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith</inline> was a provocative movie regarding what was unquestionably a violent act. It was based on the book by Thomas Keneally, which many children have studied at high school in recent years. In 1981, <inline font-style="italic">Gallipoli</inline>, while a source of national pride, showed the horror of the historic assault on The Neck in Gallipoli and the loss of literally hundreds of lives in a very short space of time. In less than half an hour, so many Australian lives were lost in that fruitless attack. Then there is <inline font-style="italic">Murielâs Wedding</inline>, written by PJ Hoganâindeed, it launched him to international fame. We are talking about not only actors, producers and directors but also writers obtaining benefit from assistance from the Australian film industry and then going on to benefit Australia as well. In 1990 <inline font-style="italic">Flirting</inline> and in 1994 <inline font-style="italic">The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert</inline> were movies with a more entertaining perspective. In 1999 <inline font-style="italic">Two Hands</inline> was a wry look at the seamier side of some of our capital cities. In 2003 we saw <inline font-style="italic">Japanese Story</inline>. Naming these films is like thanking people at an official function. We have had a vast range of very successful, very entertaining and tremendously creative Australian movies. More recently, we saw <inline font-style="italic">The Castle</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">The Dish</inline>âand the list goes on. Those movies all added in their own way to our understanding, interpretation and promotion of some aspects of Australian culture, if notâin the case of <inline font-style="italic">The Adventures of Barry McKenzie</inline>âperhaps mocking an Australian characteristic.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>These examples of Australian films recognise the benefits that have been achieved and can be achieved through government assistance. It is often forgotten that the Australian film culture is almost as old as Federation. I take the point of the minister in leading me down here, but <inline font-style="italic">The Story of the Kelly Gang</inline> had its world premiere on 26 December 1906, at Melbourneâs Athenaeum Hall. With a running length of just over an hour, it was, at the time, the longest narrative film made in Australia, and possibly the longest in the world. It was only Australiaâs second full-length film and came out six years after <inline font-style="italic">Soldiers of the Cross</inline>, widely regarded as the worldâs first feature film.</para>
<para>As for the actor chosen to play Ned in the film, apparently there were several actors. This came about when the stage actor originally cast to play Ned Kelly complained about his low wages after completing the first few scenes and just walked off the set. Obviously Actors Equity was not around in those days. Unable to afford another professional actor, the producers frantically hauled in some of the extras on the set and shot them either disguised in the traditional Ned Kelly armour or on horseback using long and wide camera shots. With careful editing, the face of the original actor was entirely eliminated. His name did not appear on the credits, and to this day, despite exhaustive research, his identity is a mystery. When the film was reviewed by the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> on 24 January 1907, it was treated very badly. The <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> said:</para>

</quote>
<para class="block">Today we should not fail to take our hats off to what the Australian film industry has offered Australians and what it has achieved for Australia in promoting our culture over what has been an interesting and enjoyable history in the last 100 years.</para>
<para>In that context, it is wholly appropriateâindeed, it is timelyâthat the government recognises the Australian film industry. I am delighted that the government is doing just a bit more than it has done in the past to ensure that Australiaâs national identity continues to be celebrated in feature films. Appropriately implemented and managed, the provisions of the Film Licensed Investment Company Bill 2005 will encourage greater investment in our own film industry; and that is wholeheartedly welcomed by our side of politics. The industry contributes to our entertainment, to the development of talent in Australia, and to the appreciation and understanding of the Australian culture internationally.</para>

<para>âIn speaking on the <inline ref="R2353">Film Licensed Investment Company Bill 2005</inline>, let me begin by saying that it is interesting to follow my colleague the member for Barton, the member on the other side of the river. I think he is preparing for a long-distant future giving after-dinner speeches, imagining that he is going to be the minister for the arts. I do not know if it is ever going to happen, but certainly it was a long and nostalgic review through the annals of time. The member for Barton started off by saying that he was not sure and blaming the government for the film industry having trouble, but he did not commit to any increased funding for it. There was much rhetoric; there were lots of reviews of the halcyon days under Gough. But there was nothing as to substance and increased funding or how to solve the problems of the industry.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>All of us have strong support for the Australian film industry. We have been impressed by the calibre of Australian films. In my own office I have a young actor, Nathan Seidl, who has been in several productions. I know that he is hoping for a strong and vibrant industry to come to the fore.</para>
<para>We want to see a vibrant and strong local film industry in this country for several reasons. One is that it is a significant employment generator. There are currently some 26,000 people who work in the industry overallâin television production, video production and films. We have seen <inline font-style="italic">The</inline> <inline font-style="italic">Matrix</inline> produced here, as well as parts of <inline font-style="italic">Star Wars</inline>. The industry is significant in terms of some recent films such as <inline font-style="italic">Somersault</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">Rabbit Proof Fence</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">Japanese Story</inline> and particularly some films that have been funded under the FLIC scheme. <inline font-style="italic">Crackerjack</inline> is one that was produced that way and has gone on to gain some limited box office success.</para>
<para>In terms of this project, we are gaining the ability to write off 100 per cent of the funds invested. You are allowed to invest up to 50 per cent of the total cost of the production of the film. Some would question why you would put it into the production. Obviously the production is the most expensive part of the film overall. Bruce Davey, who is a partner of Mel Gibson, came to speak to the government committee that I chairâthe committee on small business, tourism, arts and sportsâabout what he saw as some of the issues confronting the industry. His emphasis was that it is still a market driven situation. You cannot expect that, simply because the government puts funding into a film, the film is going to survive. You need to be careful that you do not produce only art house type films with a limited distribution; you have to look at the commercial, bottom line effect.</para>
<para>Under the FLIC scheme, we are encouraging people to put their investment into commercial projects. The opportunity is there. This is a significant amount of funding overall. In the next 12 months we will have some $180 million invested by the government in the film industry. That comes through the Film Finance Corporation and the Film Commission itself. The assistance will represent some $10 million this year.</para>
<para>Around $2.1 billion annually is contributed to our GDP by the film industry as a whole. As I said, close to 26,000 people work in the industry. Australian films have been received well by both local and international audiences. As it stands at the moment, without the support of the government very few Australian films would be made and very few Australian shows would appear on TV. Recently in a visit to New York I was invited by the Consul General, Ken Allen, to attend the Australian short film festival. It had a high level of support and a large number of people in attendance, and it was very positively received by the group. I noticed that most of the films that were reviewed on this particular night were those that did receive some level of government support by the Australian Film Finance Corporation. So it is not only giving commercial benefits but also showing something about Australian culture. <inline font-style="italic">Rabbit Proof Fence</inline> says something about the Indigenous culture in Australia, our own background and the history of the Indigenous people. <inline font-style="italic">Japanese Story</inline> looks at the Australian mining industry and the vastness of the Australian landscape.</para>
<para>The Australian Film Licensed Investment Company Scheme is one part of a picture designed to create larger levels of private finance. It is well regarded that Australiaâs domestically based film and television industry is having issues competing on the world scale. The member for Barton did actually mention that. Although our talentâour writers, directors, actors and crewâare seen as amongst the best in the world, they are forced to move overseas in order to enhance their careers. Australia has a very small box office. As such, for a film to be solely targeted at an Australian audience, the return on investment is automatically limited by the size of our audience or box office. This can help explain the decline in production levels and domestic box office figures for Australian films. Most of Australiaâs key international players have pledged their support to help create a more vibrant domestic industry. I feel it is equally important for the government to step up to the plate to assist them in this task.</para>
<para>The FLIC scheme is part of the governmentâs commitment to enhance the sector. When it was started in 1999, the FLIC scheme was responsible for $63 million worth of domestic film feature production. As I mentioned, <inline font-style="italic">Crackerjack</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">Dirty Deeds</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">The Bank</inline> came out of the program. It is part of a broader program of measures brought down in the 2005-06 budget by the Treasurer. This package is worth $88 million over four years. From this we have seen direct funding for feature films in the forthcoming financial year coming to near the $160 million mark, not $180 million as I previously commented. The package is targeted for a whole-of-industry approach. The package extends to the current 100 per cent deduction for the funds invested. With a sector that is so reliant on government funding, a decrease in this commitment by the government would break the individual projects, not to mention potentially have a devastating impact on the industry as a whole.</para>
<para>What we are trying to achieve in the FLIC scheme is to encourage the private sector to investâto encourage private investors and private individuals to put their funding into the scheme to be able to claim a 100 per cent investment write-off on their taxation. The history of Australian films over recent years has not exactly been one where you could expect huge capital gains or major profits. That is why we need a scheme which is going to have the 100 per cent tax write-off. We have seen the flow-on in our own film production from having films such as <inline font-style="italic">The Matrix</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Star Wars</inline> produced partly in Australia, using our skills in film production and across the board in terms of the film corporationsâso their skills have been developed. We have not only leading Logie winners and film actors but also leading producers, screen directors and make-up artists, right across the board. To encourage the industry on an ongoing basis is significant all the way through.</para>
<para>I encourage more of this type of program for more investment in the film industry in the longer term, because of its benefits for Australian cultural life, for employment creation and generation for many of our young people in the film industry, for the potential for them to be offered overseas jobs and contracts, and for the showing of Australian films internationally. It is a great opportunity. It is one which captures the imaginations of not only Australians but also people around the world. If you mention the Australian film industry to people when you travel internationally, there are many supportive comments. I have been amazed at how many people have seen Australian films. We need to continue this program. It is a good initiative. I am pleased to see the member for Barton has indicated that the opposition support this continued program.</para>
<para>It is clear that the industry is in a dip at the moment. Undoubtedly there are many factors involved in that. But at least we are seeing the government committing to further funding, so that can add to the overall vibrancy of the industry. But we need to monitor it. It is a competitive area. Internationally we see the Canadian film corporation investing major funding. The Singapore peopleâand London, as wellâare developing their own sound studios, film studios and assistance from the government. While this is welcome, we need to make sure that we do not fall behind in this area, that we continue to monitor it and that we encourage all those many talented young peopleâsuch as the young man I have in my officeâto look to a film future in Australia.</para>

Like the member for Barton, I welcome any initiative to provide further funding to the film industry, particularly at this time when it is in crisis. The previous speaker, the member for Cook, said it was suffering a bit of a dip. I think it is actually in a very serious crisis. The percentage of the Australian box office being spent on Australian films is at a record low, and the production slate is very lowâalthough we are seeing some re-emergence of some quality films from Australia, and one welcomes that, and we want to see more of it. I want to say something about the film licensed investment companies, the origin of the proposalâthat is, the 1998 propositionâand this proposal to continue it in a slightly reduced form, and something about more fundamental issues relating to the crisis in film and television production.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Film Licence Investment Company proposition, when originally introduced by legislation in 1998, was based on a report by David Gonski, who is a significant figure in the Australian arts and finance sectors. The original proposition did not pick up all of the Gonski propositions. It was proposed then that there be more than one Film Licence Investment Company, but there was not sufficient market demand for more than one to be successfulâalthough more than one licence was issued. I notice that the proposition now put forward by the government is less ambitious. It has quietly dropped the 1998 proposition for more than one company and, with that exception, I assume they are continuing with their previous initiative. But in 1998 the provisions did allow for more than one and more than one licence was issued, although only one company fund effectively became operational. That company fund did make significant contributions to production finance available in Australia; they were relatively small but, nevertheless, welcome. This being a commercial investment proposition, it was originally envisaged that it would have a greater eye on the commercial reliability and prospects of the productions. But I do not think the evidence backs that up. I do not think there is anything to suggest that the films produced under the Film Licence Investment Company Scheme are more commercially oriented than those funded by the Film Finance Corporationâin fact, they are perhaps less so.</para>
<para>Nevertheless, many doors need to be made available for film financing. It is an area in which investment decisions with a commercial element are also subject to elements of subjectivity and judgment. To be able to go to the Film Finance Corporation and to state film bodies with Film Licence Investment Company propositions for operations under 10BA opens more doors and allows more judgments and a more diverse set of judgments to be made and, therefore, provides a broader range of film opportunities. On the face of it, it looks like a pretty inefficient structure because there are so many different sources of financeâCommonwealth, state, 10BA film licence investment companies, the Film Finance Corporation and the Film Commission. But, as I say, I think the idea of having many different doors is appropriate. This is not an area where you can simply streamline it into one. It would be more efficient administratively and there would be fewer overheads, but there would be a narrower range of judgments being exercised. I do not regard film licensing investment companies as a major contribution to the financing of Australian films; I think their contribution is quite minor, but it is positive and I welcome and support it.</para>
<para>Underpinning the problem that the FLICs are trying to deal with is the crisis in film and television production in Australia and, at an even more basic level, the failure to invest in the fundamentals that create the basis on which a successful film and television industry can be built. Prior to the 1998 election, I attended a function at which Geoffrey Rush spoke; he had just won an Oscar for <inline font-style="italic">Shine</inline>. He said, I think very effectively and accurately: âI could never have become the successful actor I am, were it not for the original government funding of the Queensland Theatre Company that enabled me to develop my craft and skills as an actorââand to develop them to a level where he could transfer them and become the successful film actor that he is. He was making the profound point that, if we do not invest in the underlying fundamentals of the experimental and major theatre companies, we will not produce quality actors. At the moment we are living off the fat of investment in previous years that developed leading Australian figures in global films. World leading Australian actors, directors et cetera are essentially the product of great investment over many years in institutions like NIDA. If we do not continue that investment, we will find that there is a bit of a gap at the top in five, 10 or 15 years time.</para>
<para>The first problem is a failure to invest in the fundamentals. The second problem is a failure to invest at the television production level, where many of the skills are developed and many of the people are kept employed, which enables them to be available, when required, to the film industryâand not just actors, but electricians, carpenters, drivers, caterers and all those who go to making a successful production. I want to refer here particularly to the crisis in drama production at the ABC.</para>
<para>On 19 May, an article by Amanda Mead in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> reported, âThe ABC will stop producing Australian drama altogether if the federal government does not increase its triennial funding this year.â That warning was issued by the managing director, Russell Balding. He went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The ABC is nearing the day when it will not be able to commission any Australian drama at all because of the cost and the funding restraints ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This issue was taken up by John Wood when he received his Logie. He said, âKick some money into the ABC.â If we are not receiving basic quality and cutting-edge production from the ABC, we are not developing the training and skills that will create the potential for a successful film industry in five or 10 years time.</para>
<para>There is something else that we are not doingâand I do not think the FLICs assist in this. This is not a criticism of FLICs; it is not what they are designed to do. This can only be done successfully by bodies like the Film Commission. We are not investing enough in scripts. The success of films essentially revolves around scripts. We do not give enough patient support to enable scripts to be refined and improved and for third, fourth and fifth drafts to be written. Great Australian scriptwriters who have been hired to go to the US are paid more for revising a third draft of a script into a fourth draft than they get for the whole exercise in Australia. We need to be more prepared to invest in scripts if we are to have quality films.</para>
<para>Finally, we are very strong on doing things on the supply side of the film industryâand we have to do thatâbut we have to make sure that we are doing something on the demand side as well. I do not mean âdemand sideâ in terms of Australians getting the opportunity to go and see films; there is plenty of opportunity for that. I mean ensuring that there is ample opportunity for Australians who invest their taxes in Australian films to get a chance to see them. The nature of the distribution system is such that, if you live outside the major capital cities or you do not live in a town that has a multiplex, you will probably not see an Australian film; they will not come to the smaller centres. We need to do something on the demand side, and I will have something to say about that issue on another occasion.</para>
<para>The film industry is one of the ways in which Australians tell our stories to ourselves and to others. I welcome any support that makes it more possible for Australians with creativity, imagination and ideas to turn those into successful films. Film licensed investment companies are one small contribution to that and, small as it is, I welcome it as a small step in the right direction. I support the bill.</para>

<para>âI rise to wrap up the debate on the <inline ref="R2353">Film Licensed Investment Company Bill 2005</inline> and commend the members for Barton, Cook and Fraser for their contributions. The government recognises the importance of a viable local film and television industry and the significant contribution of the sector to our economy and our cultural life. As a whole, the Australian film and television industry contributes some $2.1 billion annually to GDP and employs more than 25,500 people. The government wants the sector to produce increasing numbers of films that appeal to audiences both here at home and abroad. The government provides a range of support to this sector to ensure its long-term sustainability. Without government intervention there would be few local voices on our screens.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Despite that support, the government acknowledges that it has become increasingly difficult for our television and film sector to compete both locally and abroad. The government is aware that the local film sector is in the midst of a difficult period. While key creative Australians attract international accolades, production levels and the box office performance of local films have fallen. In response, the government has introduced a package of measures worth $88 million over four years to strengthen the local film and television sector. The package is aimed at attracting greater levels of private finance, redressing the current downturn in local production and keeping the sector competitive through script and skills development.</para>
<para>The package is a carefully balanced strategic intervention that takes a whole-of-industry approach. It is comprehensive and acknowledges that there is no single quick fix that can address current challenges. The increases in direct funding to Australian government film agencies, recently confirmed in the 2005-06 budget, will bring total direct funding to a high of almost $160 million in 2005-06. The government is also committed to encouraging greater private sector investment in our local product and increases in direct support are complemented by measures to make the film sector more attractive for private investors.</para>
<para>The extension of the Film Licensed Investment Company scheme, known as FLIC, is a key element of the governmentâs film package. The government will soon be calling for submissions to a review of sections 10B and 10BA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and has announced that it will amend the act in regard to the interaction of foreign losses quarantining rules. Both of these measures were sought by the sector.</para>
<para>Private investment is an important complement to direct funding by government. In Australia, film and television financing is usually a combination of investment from the marketplace, government funding and private investors. The extended FLIC scheme seeks to encourage growth in funding from individuals and corporate entities and to restore investor confidence in the local film and television sector.</para>
<para>The pilot FLIC scheme commenced in 1999, attracted around $21 million in investment and triggered $63 million worth of feature film production alone. It produced successful films like <inline font-style="italic">Crackerjack</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">Dirty Deeds</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">The Bank</inline>. The focus of the scheme is on encouraging investment in the production of Australian films. Production is the most costly aspect of film-making. Without adequate funding and appropriate investment levels to improve the quality aspects of production, the chances of success for a film or television program are significantly diminished. The extended FLIC scheme will allow investors a 100 per cent up-front deduction on the purchases of FLIC shares in the year of investment. These funds will immediately flow to the FLIC. Subject to certain licence conditions being met, the FLIC must be an Australian owned and controlled company raising funds primarily from Australian investors in qualifying Australian films. The extended scheme will allow a single FLIC licence to raise up to $20 million over a two-year period at a total cost to revenue of $8 million in 2006-07 and 2007-08.</para>
<para>The issuing of a single licence will minimise the duplication of administrative costs that may result from the issuing of multiple licences. The FLIC licence will be allocated following a competitive process, and applications for the licence will be sought following the passage of this legislation. Funds raised by the FLIC will be invested in a range of film and television productions, thus spreading investor risk across a production slate. Investment in marketing and distribution activities will be permitted under the extended scheme up to a maximum of half of the amount which the FLIC invests in production.</para>
<para>Co-investment from other market players will also be permitted under the extended scheme to maximise the value of productions. The intention is that the FLIC moneys will act as a trigger for other commercial organisations to invest in Australian productions. This will result in films with bigger budgets and quality high-end production values. This, in turn, leads to greater opportunities for commercial success and improved returns for FLIC investors.</para>
<para>The extension of the FLIC scheme has been welcomed by the sector as a timely intervention in a difficult market where investor confidence in Australian films is low. It seeks to revitalise private support and combine with other recently announced taxation measures to restore investor confidence in our Australian industry. I commend the bill to the house.</para>

<para>âThe <inline ref="R2355">Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill 2005</inline> seeks to prevent the unauthorised commercial use of indicia and images associated with the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games and to provide a secure environment to raise revenue through sponsorship. The bill also includes provisions to prevent ambush marketing. Labor supports this bill and will neither seek to amend or oppose its passage through the House or the other place.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>With the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games only eight months away, the bill will seek to provide the necessary support in the lead-up, during and in the immediate aftermath of the games, to protect indicia and images associated with the staging of the games. The main provisions of the bill are to provide an authorisation scheme to restrict the use of key words, phrases and images associated with the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games. The term âindiciaâ refers to these phrases and/or words. The bill also provides a range of potential remedies, including injunctions, damages, corrective advertisements and seizure of goods by the Australian Customs Service. The bill also includes a sunset clause so that the bill will cease to have effect from 30 June 2006.</para>
<para>This bill is complementary legislation to the Commonwealth Games Arrangements Act 2001, enacted by the Victorian government. The Victorian act only applies in Victoria and gives the power to seize goods to the Victorian police. The bill before the House allows the Australian Customs Service to seize goods and conduct similar functions and services to those it provided during the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.</para>
<para>This bill will provide protection for a range of indicia and images associated with the games, including the following expressions: Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games; Melbourne 2006 Games; Melbourne Games; M2006; M06; any other combination of the words âCommonwealth Gamesâ or âGamesâ and the numbers â2006â and â18thâ in numerical, written and roman numeral form; Queenâs Baton Relay; and the words âbronzeâ, âsilverâ and âgoldâ when linked with âCommonwealth Gamesâ or âCommonwealth Games athleteâ. Indicia related to the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games in languages other than English will also be protected.</para>
<para>Whilst protecting particular words and phrases associated with the games, the bill also provides protection for images that could reasonably, when broadcast or presented, allow a person to think that the company or product is associated with the games. This association could be through oral or visual presentations. The bill, however, does not prevent parties providing informationâincluding through reporting by the mediaâwhere the primary purpose is for criticism or review. This includes the use of criticism or review in newspapers, magazines, broadcastsâboth television and radioâand film. The use of indicia and images for this purpose is not deemed to fall within the definition of a use for commercial purposes.</para>
<para>The Victorian government are seeking to raise $130 million in sponsorship revenue from the games. This is an important revenue stream available to the Victorian government to assist them in the hosting of the Commonwealth Games in March next year. In return for sponsorship of the games, sponsors will be allowed to use indicia and images associated with the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games to publicise their support for this sporting event. Under the Victorian act the Melbourne 2006 Corporation has set up an authorisation scheme where approved sponsors will be placed on a register. This register will assist the Australian Customs Service to determine who has the authorisation to use Commonwealth Games indicia and images. It is important to support and protect these revenue streams and in turn protect sponsors from ambush marketing.</para>
<para>Ambush marketing is the unauthorised association of a business with the marketing of an event without paying for marketing rights. This can be through the use of goods that have the indicia and images woven, impressed and affixed on them. In the case of services this would include the use of indicia and images in advertisements or in commercial documentation like catalogues, brochures, business letterheads and invoices. Protecting these indicia and images would also give consumers greater certainty when purchasing officially licensed Melbourne 2006 Games merchandise.</para>
<para>This bill gives powers to the Australian Customs Service CEO to seize goods that have been imported into Australia and have not been authorised and which do not appear on the register. These goods will then be held in a secure location and the owner of these goods will be notified of the decision by Customs to seize them.</para>
<para>The bill also outlines the rights of sponsors to apply for court injunctions from the Federal Court, Federal Magistrates Court or state and territory supreme courts against parties they deem to not have authority to use Melbourne 2006 indicia and images. There are remedies available to these sponsors, including damages and the use of corrective advertisements. At the same time the bill also provides for remedies against groundless threats by authorised users against other parties.</para>
<para>Labor support this bill because we know the importance that revenue will play in the successful financial outcomes of the games. We support it so as to protect the legitimate rights of sponsors and their investment in the games. The Victorian governmentâin particular the Minister for the Commonwealth Games, the Hon. Justin Madden MLCâare undertaking an excellent job in their preparations for the games in March next year. They have undertaken a massive task and I am sure that every member in the House knows that they will deliver an outstanding games that will once again reaffirm Melbourne as the sporting capital of the world.</para>
<para>While I am on my feet, and given the reference to not only the games but also the question of the Queenâs Baton Relay, it is opportune to discuss some of the points about how that relay is operating and what has been occurring with respect to that. The fact is that once again we have seen evidence in recent days of the Commonwealth government seeking to politicise another event or occasion that is really about everybody in the community, not just politicians. We can recall this occurring in recent times around the issue of flagpoles at schools, where the government essentially issued edicts that members of the coalition must be present and must take part and officiate at the functions for the presentation and developmentâthe openingsâof these flagpoles.</para>
<para>That is an example of the government undertaking political activity in respect of national symbols and events. We see that again in what is happening with the Commonwealth Games in relation to the Queenâs Baton Relay, which is mentioned very clearly in the bill as being one of the indicia and images that are under protection. In my view, these are attempts by the government to, in their own way, contravene their own bill. In effect, this is a form of unauthorised usage with respect to the Queenâs baton relay. I would like to make a few points with respect to that particular issue, which relate to an earlier offence to the relay, dating right back to its commencement and opening ceremony. On 10 June, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> reported:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The February unveiling of the Commonwealth Games baton, and the announcement of its year-long relay through more than 70 countries had politicians jostling for position like 1500-metre race runners.</para>
<para>Pushed to the back of the field was Victorian Premier Steve Bracks, who watched from the sidelines as members of the federal Liberal Government enjoyed the frontrunning in the public spotlight. Finally, his turn came to take centre stage.</para>
<para>âGood to see that I got on before the cleaners,â he reportedly muttered as he strode to the microphone at Parliament House in Canberra.</para>
<para>It seems the Melbourne Commonwealth Games motto, âUnited by the Momentâ, is not casting its spell over the state and federal politicians circling the event, like sharks hunting for positive publicity.</para>
<para>According to insiders, tensions have been building since the baton launch within the Bracks Labor Government, over the amount of attention flowing to the federal Liberal Government, in particular, Victorian federal ministers Rod Kemp and Peter Costello.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">If we go to the correspondence that the federal government sent to the state government with respect to this issue, there are a whole range of things that were expected to be allowed to occur for coalition members. I refer to some extracts from a letter quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline>. The first extract states:</para>

But I am pretty sure that my friend, the member for Dunkley, for the moment anyway, would be the Australian government representative. And let us not forget the honourable parliamentary secretary sitting behind him, who would also be seen as an Australian government representative. The next extract from the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> is even better:</para>

<para>âMr Deputy Speaker, you are quite right. I again go back to the bill to note that one of the things this bill is designed to protect is âthe Queenâs Baton Relayâ. This bill is designed to protect this relay. We are seeing attempts by this government to abuse this relay and use it in a manner for which it was never intended. Frankly, there is an argument here that the government could well be prosecuted under their own bill.</para>

<para>âNo, I mean the federal government. We have launches and videos and you have got to ask yourself: do the Australian people really deserve another video of the Prime Minister? The interesting question from that video will be: will the Prime Minister and the Treasurer be in the same shot? Can they do that these days? Or will it be a situation where they are at separate ends? It might be appropriate in relation to a Commonwealth Games to have an event between the two. You could have a run-off for the prime ministership between the two. It would be a fast walk in the case of the Prime Minister; in terms of the Treasurer I am not quite sure how that would workâwe would have to get his mouth shut for a start, otherwise the wind resistance would be too much for him to go very far at all!</para>

<para>âI am very pleased to do that. Of course, as you know, the member for Dunkley has always been a solid supporter of mine over the years.

<para>As I said, this bill, which basically is designed to protect the Commonwealth Games baton relay, amongst a range of other symbols, is in fact being abused by the government itself. Some interesting points were made with respect to this issue in a <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> editorial entitled âThe games pollies play.â It reads:</para>
<quote>
<para>The Howard Government needs to be told that its MPs are not wanted as gladhanding VIPs during the Commonwealth Games baton relay.</para>
<para>The 2006 Commonwealth Games are for the people, not the politicians, and Coalition MPs planning to hog the limelight need to take a step back.</para>
<para>Even more inappropriate is the proposal for videos featuring Prime Minister John Howard and Treasurer Peter Costello to be shown at baton relay ceremonies around the nation.</para>
<para>The Federal Government is under the impression that its money is paying for its share of the 2006 Commonwealth Games.</para>
<para>Wrong. It is taxpayersâ money. They will fund the Federal Government contribution of $103 million to the Games and baton relay, and the State Governmentâs $700 million bill to stage the 12-day international event.</para>

<para class="block">The arrogant list of demands sent to Victoria was approved by federal Sports Minister Rod Kemp.</para>
<para class="block">The Federal Government has already shortchanged the Commonwealth Games by withdrawing $90 million in funding for the redevelopment of the MCG, the main Games venue, over industrial policies.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">On this issue what we see is another example of the Howard government trying to appropriate national symbols and national events in a partisan manner, when they were designed to be bipartisan in the first place. We have seen them use the excuse of some federal funding to provide themselves with an opportunity to try to use the event as a propaganda exercise. It will be interesting to see whether the Prime Minister and the Treasurer will be included in the list of symbols to be protected. Maybe they will be an addition to the act at some stage in the future. One thing is for sure: although we agree and accept and commend the bill to the House and are pleased to support it, we certainly do not commend, support or accept the actions of the government with respect to the way they are handling the Commonwealth Games baton relay.</para>

<para>âIt is particularly interesting to follow the member for Bruce in this debate on the <inline ref="R2355">Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill 2005</inline>. In his speech we had a combination of two things: one was a vague ramble through the notes provided to him by the ministerâs office, in which he showed no interest and which he seemed to have no inclination to readâhis performance was so poor that he could barely read the wordsâand the other was political point scoring.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>One of the things that you need to remember is that people have memories. As somebody who was minister for Sydneyâs Olympic bid, I well remember the requirements that were made by the then Keating government when they provided $5 million for the Sydney bid. They wanted everything. The Prime Minister and his wife had to be there and had to be provided with tickets for all the events. They had to be given appropriate recognition at all the Olympic functions. They had to be included on the bid boardâeverything. The Keating government gave five million bucks and they wanted the world. They wanted to be on the stage, with clear recognition of the Prime Minister and everybody thereâall the ministers had to be up there. You must think that we cannot remember you guys and what you required in return for the extremely modest amount of $5 million. New South Wales had to raise the rest of the bid money, which at that stage was quite substantialâsome $25 million. The federal government provided all of $5 million and it wanted the world.</para>
<para>In relation to the Queenâs Baton Relay, which you have been going on about for some length of time, $15 million is being provided by the federal government. Shouldnât they have some recognition?</para>

<para>âThe same would apply in Victoria when you open roads. Of course the funding comes from taxpayersâ money, but I would have thought that it is appropriate that representatives of the various governments involved have some recognition in the whole process. Of course, the opposition would not want to have any recognition at allâthat is clear! They would want to go absolutely unrecognised and not mentioned! The Keating government wanted to be up front and totally recognised on every occasion.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>This is an extremely modest request, given the very large amount of money that the federal government is providing. They are providing $100 million in direct financial assistance and a further $170 million through the provision of support services. Total federal government funding is close to $280 million. Isnât it appropriate that some recognition be given to the federal government for their involvement in and promotion of this event? I think it is entirely appropriate. It is a bit of a pity that the member for Bruce did not pay a bit more attention to the bill at hand and consider the implications of it. He did not seem to be worried about that. His speech was just a bit of a point-score, which shows where the opposition are all at.</para>
<para>The piece of legislation being brought forward here is quite reasonable. It protects the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. We might remember that no sooner had the logo for the Sydney Games been produced, looking magnificent, than copies started to come in. The legislation was not in place and merchandise came in from Asia in large quantities, so legislation had to be brought in fairly quickly to protect the bid name on a whole range of merchandise: ties, jumpers, logos, brooches, armbands, watches and the whole bit. Of course, as we went into the Olympic Games legislation was enacted which covered the marketing of the games, because protecting these things is important for sponsorship and sponsorship is crucial to games of these kinds. The Sydney Olympic Games was a multibillion-dollar sponsorship event, and that is why it needed to be protected. You spell out what is included; otherwise everyone else will claim credit for promoting your games.</para>
<para>Although a whole range of things are included in this bill, the legislation does provide exemptions for information provision, so, in terms of what the federal government is providing through the Queenâs Baton Relay, that is entirely in keeping with the legislation. The bill protects sponsorship, licensing revenue, indicia and images, particularly for the 2006 period. Anything related to the 2006 Commonwealth Gamesâand all the other things which are listed as part of the programâis protected. So sponsorships can be protected and ambush marketingâwhich is people claiming sponsorship when it does not existâcan be stopped.</para>
<para>A similar approach was taken for the 2000 Olympic Games, and the key factor is the restriction of the use of key words, phrases and images for commercial purposes. All the words are set out in the attachment. It contains exemptions for the purpose of providing information for criticism and review by the media as well as factual reporting of what is happening. It enables the Australian Customs Service to apprehend unauthorised goods which would use such terms as âCommonwealth Gamesâ, âQueenâs Baton Relayâ, âFriendly Gamesâ or âMelbourne 2006 Cultural Programâ. It covers that as well. It contains a sunset clause, which means that the legislation will cease to have effect from 1 July 2006. It complements indicia protection provisions in the Victorian Commonwealth Games Act. At the time of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, the New South Wales government did not have any equivalent of the Victorian actâit was simply up to the federal governmentâbut the Victorian police have the ability to apprehend goods. The Victorian act has an authorisation scheme and a register, a purpose test, and it recognises the Australian Commonwealth Games Association and the Commonwealth Games Federation.</para>
<para>What we have in this bill is protection for the Commonwealth Games, which is going to be a major event watched by many millions of people around the world. The bill will ensure the financial viability of the games by protecting the sponsors, the logos and the words that are associated with the games. I remember that in the Sydney Olympic Games âOllieâ, âMillieâ and âSydâ were protected, and we will also be able to protect the various similar kinds of words associated with the Melbourne games. This is important for commercial sponsorship reasons. It is also important to ensure that the games can operate without being ambushed by all the bogus marketers who might want to climb on board. The protection this bill provides will ensure that goodwill will be associated with the Melbourne Games.</para>
<para>I congratulate the Victorian government on the preparation for these games. I think the games will be a great success and that they will be widely applauded. We certainly hope that, in line with what Juan Antonio Samaranch had to say at the end of the Sydney Olympic Games, the Commonwealth Games in Victoria can be declared the best ever Commonwealth Games. We on this side of the chamber are doing our bit to protect the various logos and indicia for the Commonwealth Games, to ensure that we have a successful commercial enterprise that is appropriately protected. We do not want the political stuntsmanship that is going on on the other side of the chamber. Clearly the opposition spokesman had not read his brief. He picked up the brief from the ministerâs office, but he barely read the words through before he started to get into political punches which were a lot of nonsense. We are providing $260 million for the Commonwealth Games, but the Labor party do not want to see us anywhere. It is a case of âjust send the money and disappearâ. I think the minister had news for them. Yes, it is appropriate that the Victorian government get due recognition, but we would expect some recognition for the very large amount of money provided by this government for the games.</para>

<para>âI too would like to speak on the <inline ref="R2355">Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill 2005</inline> before the House today. When I first heard about this bill, I assumed its purpose was to protect the Australian public from video images of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer which will be screened at community evening celebrations in the lead-up to the Commonwealth Games. Apparently that is not the case but, nevertheless, Labor will support the bill with vigour.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As an Australianâand particularly as a VictorianâI am so proud that my home town will be hosting the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games. The 18th Commonwealth Games will bring together 4,500 athletes from 71 nations. Approximately 40,000 international visitors and 50,000 interstate visitors are expected to travel to Victoria for the event, and we are most welcoming of their patronage of our great town. Regional centres will also play a part in the games celebrations, with Ballarat hosting the basketball and Bendigo, Geelong and the Latrobe Valley hosting parts of the games sport programs, in addition to various cultural activities.</para>
<para>The economic benefits for Victoria are enormous, and we are set to experience significant employment growth as a result of the event. Based on work force demands for the Sydney 2000 Olympics and the Manchester 2002 Commonwealth Games, it is estimated that up to 35,000 jobs are likely to be created in Victoria. Industries expected to benefit include the construction, hospitality and tourism, transport, sport and recreation, and arts and culture sectors. That is why the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill 2005 is so important. The bill is designed to prevent the unauthorised commercial use of certain images associated with the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games. It will also provide a more secure environment in which the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games Corporation can raise revenue through sponsorship and prevent ambush marketing.</para>
<para>The Victorian government is seeking to raise $130 million in sponsorship revenue to assist them in hosting the games next year. Approved sponsors will be given the authority to use images associated with the games to publicise their support of the event. Clearly it is vital to protect these revenue streams and, in turn, protect the sponsors from ambush marketing. Labor supports this bill because we believe it is important to do everything in our power to ensure that the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games live up to the expectations of the Australian people and the mad sports nuts in Victoria and also that they provide the worldâs best to all the international visitors who will be coming to our shores for the games.</para>
<para>I know that the people from Chisholm, especially the children, are excited about the opportunity to watch sporting heroes compete, and the chance for them to participate in games festivities themselves will be the experience of a lifetime. My mother still tells me with delight about her joy in going to the Olympic Games in Melbourne in 1956. She still has her original ticket. So it is wonderful that we can again share that delight and that dream with people in Victoria. That is what the Commonwealth Games should be about: inspiring dreams. It is a message to Australian youth that it is possible to achieve your goals.</para>
<para>So what a pity it is that the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill 2005 does not protect our games from blatant politicisation. First the Howard government tried to politicise the Australian flag through its school flagpole scheme. Now it is politicising the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games. Do members of the coalition have no shame?</para>
<para>It was revealed this week that the Howard government is planning to use the Commonwealth Games as a propaganda exercise. The Minister for the Arts and Sport has written to Victoria demanding that coalition MPs and senators co-chair local planning groups and that the Australian government is acknowledged for its funding contribution. He has also requested that video images of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are shown at the community evening celebrations. Their images are irrelevant to the games, and it is inappropriate to drag politics into a non-political community celebration.</para>

<para>âI do believe that this piece of legislation is quite clearly related to my point, because great political bias has entered into this. I do not dispute that the Commonwealth should be given recognition for its sponsorship of the baton relay, but to take it over from the local community groups, to take it away from the people who are going to be nominated in their local area, is a disgrace. To overshadow it with any politician, be it someone from the government or from the opposition, takes away from the spirit of these games. This bill is here to protect the image of those games. All I am asking is that the Commonwealth and everyone else also protect the image of the great games before us. Certainly the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Science and Training, who is here today, knows about representing his country in sporting endeavours. He would not want someone to take away from his achievements in those areasâto politicise this event. So I think that we need to call upon the government to take back their suggestions and to include everybody, regardless of their political persuasions, in this endeavour.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>In addition, the Commonwealth has asked that runners bringing the baton to the stage at community evening celebrations will have to hand the Commonwealth Games baton to a coalition member or senator. I think that is inappropriate. It should be handed to whoever is the most illustrious person from that area, or it should just be placed up on the stand. I do not think we need to make this a political event. It should be a community event. That is why these games are so great. So it is a disgrace. Rather than having a member of the communityâpossibly an aspiring young athlete or a hardworking volunteer, someone who would love the privilege of being part of the relayâplace the baton, the Howard government is wheeling out members and senators, turning it into a cheesy photo opportunity. So, for the next three years until the federal election, we will be seeing photos of gladhanding politicians waving the baton in Liberal Party campaign brochures across the country. I would prefer to see the photos of fine Australian citizens waving the baton proudly hung up in homes across the country.</para>
<para>The Australian public is incensed at this, but not our blue-collared Treasurer, who is so in touch with the people of this country. He does not have a problem with hijacking the Commonwealth Games, according to a doorstop interview he held this week, because he thinks that if the Howard government paid for the baton relay it can do whatever it likes. I think the Treasurer has been in his post for too long. He has forgotten that it is not his money that is paying for this baton relay; it is the Australian taxpayersâ money. It should be they who are participating in this event. It is they who should be highlighted through this process.</para>
<para>I do want to thank the government for their sponsorship of this event and their support of the games. Up until now, this has been a fine, bipartisan event through the Labor government in Victoria and through the coalition federal government. So it is a pity that it has come to this. I certainly want to place on record my congratulations to the Premier, Steve Bracks, for the fine effort that he has made in this, and also to the Minister for Sport and Recreation, Justin Madden, who has worked very hard to ensure that next year we have a fantastic games.</para>
<para>My message from this debate tonight to the Prime Minister is that when it comes to sportâunlike politicsâit is not about winning or losing; it is about how you play the game. And playing politics with the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games is shameful. We should be seeing more things which the Commonwealth has done to protect the games, like this bill tonight, and not more political bias.</para>

<para>âIn the wrap-up of the <inline ref="R2355">Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill 2005</inline> debate, I would like to thank the members for Chisholm, Cook and Bruce for their support for this bill. This is a very important bill. It recognises that the lessons of life are actually lessons of sport, and that the lessons we learn in sport here in this country are lessons that we can take with us through our business lives, through our political lives and through every aspect of our lives. That is one of the things that makes this country the great country that it is: our love and our passion for sport.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The purpose of this bill is to protect the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games sponsorship and licensing revenue from being undermined by unauthorised use of the games indicia and images by competitors of the official games sponsors. The Australian government enacted similar legislation for the 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games. While Victorian legislation has been in place since 2001 to protect games related words, phrases and images in the state of Victoria, there is a need for complementary Commonwealth legislation to ensure that the government can enforce this in the Commonwealthâs jurisdictionâfor example, so that Customs can seize offending goods at the border in the case of any goods being brought into this country that have been duplicated without authorisation.</para>
<para>The key principle of this bill is to prevent the unauthorised use of games related words, phrases and images for profit, by restricting their use. However, third parties such as the media can use games related words, phrases and images, provided it is for the provision of information or for the purpose of criticism and review. There are no financial implications for the Australian government. The bill has a sunset clause and will cease to have effect from 1 July 2006. In summary, this bill works with the Victorian legislation to help ensure that the exclusive rights being paid for by the games sponsors are protected. This is a sensible bill that protects the business of sport through the Commonwealth Games 2006. I commend it to the House.</para>

<para>âAlthough the <inline ref="R2373">Veteransâ Entitlements Amendment (2005 Budget Measure) Bill 2005</inline> affects some 44,000 veterans and war widows, one would normally have described it as non-controversial. But in fact, as I will point out, this bill corrects a dirty deed of the Howard government. In essence, it gives to self-funded retiree veterans what all other self-funded retirees received last yearânamely a $200-a-year allowance. This is entitled the âseniors concession allowanceâ and is similar to the utilities allowance paid to those in receipt of a pension. These were election promises made by the Prime Minister as he sprayed billions of dollars around like confetti in his bid to win the last election. Basically, the seniors allowance is a non means tested giveaway to assist self-funded retirees to pay their power and gas bills, their car registration and their water bills, as a trade-off for the utilities allowance given to pensioners.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This allowance, which was first introduced in December 2004, is paid in two instalments each year, in June and December. The utilities allowance paid to pensioners is also paid in two instalmentsâin March and September. For veterans with the gold card who are already in receipt of the service pension or the income support supplement, the utilities allowance was paid along with that of the rest of the pensioner population. To be eligible for the seniors concession allowance, a person must hold a Commonwealth seniors health card. Consistent with other veteran entitlements, it is available at age 60, compared with the age limit of 65 for other retirees. But of course, as we know, gold card holders have no need of the Commonwealth seniors health card because all of their health care needs are taken care of.</para>
<para>As a result, those veterans and war widows who are classed as self-funded retireesâthat is, not receiving payment of the service pension or the income support supplementâmissed out. This, it must be said, was either a negligent oversight or a deliberate ploy to save money. Either way, self-funded retiree veterans were denied, without any reason or explanation, what normal self-funded retirees were given. If it was a negligent oversight then the government should be condemned for its carelessness in ignoring 44,000 people, who were effectively discriminated against. If it was deliberate, the same applies. Perhaps some explanation and apology should be given.</para>
<para>The silliness of this situation has been demonstrated by the fact that those veterans and widows eligible in their own right for a CSHC could apply for a CSHC and so become eligible. As I understand it, some in fact have done so. In that way the oversight or omission was circumvented, hence the silliness of this whole issue.</para>
<para>The matter does not end there, though. One would have thought that with an error of this kind, where a sizeable portion of the population has been effectively cheated, payments ought to be made in arrears. Not so in this case; in fact, it is worse. The first payment to self-funded veteran retirees will not be made until December this year. That means a loss of two payments of $100 at least. Of course the gloss put on this is, as usual, one of extreme generosity and kindness. In fact the ministerâs deceptive spin in her budget press release did just thatâit made this measure the centrepiece. Veterans and war widows need to know that this is nothing of the kind. They have in fact been short-changed. This is a benefit that was provided to everyone else late last year.</para>
<para>This is typical of the duplicity and fudging of which this minister is a specialist. Indeed, when we look at the entire veterans budget this year, we see that it is a nonevent. If this bill constitutes the centrepiece and it is effectively a fraud, then the whole budget package is a fraud too. Letâs look at the detail. Putting aside all the spin and rhetoric, the House will notice in the budget papers that there is only $10 million for new budget measures in 2005-06. Against this there are savings of $52 million, which flow on from the health portfolio. Apart from the long overdue increase in dental limits, there is no change in entitlements.</para>
<para>As for the $411 million increase in the Department of Veteransâ Affairs total budget, most of that is due to normal cost increasesâ$393 million, in fact. In the budget papers these are described as âparameter adjustmentsâ, âvariation in rates and feesâ, âgrowth in numbers and/or usage ratesâ or âmovements between low-cost and high-cost servicesâ. The so-called initiatives for anaesthetists and allied health providers are part of those normal increases. To this $393 million you need to add $60 million, which was carried over from the budgets of previous years. So, in these government policy initiatives for veterans, the government has taken the veteran community backwards. The savings exceed new spendingâit is as simple as that.</para>
<para>So that is all there is to this paltry measure. Veterans have been conned again, and many feel cheated. I challenge the minister to show good faith to the veteran community by making this bill retrospective to December 2004. Only in that way can the honourable thing be done. However, having said that, I also say that of course the opposition supports the bill.Â </para>
<para>I want to touch on an issue which has become much more prevalent in recent years and to which much more attention has been given within the veteran community and the broader communityâthat is, the issue of what is loosely termed âwannabesâ. I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, that you have spoken in this place on this issue. The Australasian military imposters web site contains this definition:</para>
<quote>
<para>Often called by the derogatory term âwannabeâ these are men and women who may or may not have served in the armed forces, but who fraudulently misrepresent themselves as having served; often in a theatre of war by their words and actions, and by wearing of medals and other accoutrements to military service to which they have no entitlement.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Bearing that in mind, I want to refer to 2003, when some legislation was introduced into this House to deal with that exact matter. The minister at the time put out a press release on 26 March 2003 headed âIncreased penalties for defence medals fraudâ, which stated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Penalties for fraudulently claiming Defence service will increase 15-fold under legislation introduced into Parliament today by the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, Danna Vale. âOur community holds veterans and serving personnel in the highest regard,â Mrs Vale said.</para>
<para class="block">âTheir service and sacrifice in Defence of our nation deserves protection from those who wrongly seek to claim the same honour and respect.â</para>
<para class="block">Under the Federal Governmentâs proposals, the penalty for wrongly claiming to be returned soldier, sailor or airman, or wearing medals to which an individual is not entitled, will increase from a $200 fine, to a maximum penalty of $3,300 and up to six months imprisonment.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Mrs Vale said the changes were a result of concerns of the Government and the wider community regarding practices that were unlawful, deceitful and disrespectful to veterans and service personnel.</para>
<para class="block">âThe increase in these penalties will enable the Government to better protect the honour of Defence veterans and service personnel,â Mrs Vale said.</para>
<para class="block">âI call on the Opposition parties to support this legislation as soon as possible so that we can provide the increased protection.â</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I will come back to that last sentence shortly. Later in 2003âI do not have the exact dateâthe then minister responsible for medals put out a press release headed âFake veterans to face imprisonmentâ, which read:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">People fraudulently claiming to be returned soldier, sailor or airman could face six months imprisonment under proposed laws passed through the House of Representatives today.</para>
<para class="block">Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence Mal Brough said anyone falsely claiming to be a returned service man or woman should face the force of the law.</para>
<para class="block">âItâs a disgraceful act that warrants a strong penalty,â Mr Brough said.</para>
<para class="block">âMany Australians have served our country proudly and wrongly claiming to be a veteran is an insult to those men and women.â</para>
<para class="block">Along with a maximum prison term of six months, the fine will increase from $200 to a maximum of $3,300.</para>
<para class="block">The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill also increases the penalty for the wearing of medals to which an individual is not entitled.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Both those press releases are fairly strongly worded and both address an issue which the veteran community is very concerned about. The unfortunate thing is that action is not meeting the rhetoric of those press releases. I will give you just one example. I recently received some correspondence from the bloke who is the webmaster for the Australian Special Air Services Association. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Graham,</para>
<para>Below is a copy of an e-mail I sent to the AFP in Perth, regarding one of the many impostors. This chap has claimed to be one of the most respected Sgts in the SAS during Vietnam, and I guess the rest of his lies are in the e-mail below. The text of the reply from the AFP is at the foot of this page.</para>
<para>From the response to my email, I can only assume that it is a budgetary consideration that prevents an investigation taking place. I do appreciate that prioritisation must occur. I also feel that resources must be made available for enforcement of ALL laws, not just those that get the most attention. I ask that you question the minister to consider providing the necessary resources to address this most frustrating situation that the Veterans community is facing.</para>
<para>Regardsâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">and it is not important to know his name. He also sent me part of a letter which he wrote to the AFP in Perth. It said:</para>
<quote>
<para>The veterans community is frustrated with the perceived lack of diligence being applied to such cases, which allows these people to continue living a lie. I also understand that this man ... may in fact be a Veteran, but there is certainly no record of any such person having served in the Australian Special Air Service Regiment.</para>
<para>I would appreciate your consideration of this situation, and I am available to travel to Perth if so needed.</para>

</quote>
<para class="block">I want to read to the House the response that this gentleman from the SAS Association received. A letter dated March this year headed âRe: Wearing of SAS Honours/Awards Whilst Not Entitledâ said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Thank you for your correspondence concerning the above mentioned matter forwarded to our office on 7 March 2005. This matter was presented to the Perth Operations Committee on Monday, 21 March 2005.</para>
<para class="block">The AFP has primary law enforcement responsibility for investigating criminal offences against the Commonwealth. Operational activities and the needs of clients are assessed from a variety of perspectives to ensure that resources are directed towards highest priority activities.</para>
<para class="block">The AFP must therefore ensure that its limited resources are directed to the matters of highest priority and the decision to accept or reject matters for investigation is guided by this principle.</para>
<para class="block">Following the assessment of the information provided, it is with regret that the AFP is not able to accept the referral.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">They then invite the complainant to discuss the matter by further contacting them.</para>
<para>When people choose to impersonate a veteran, in so many circumstances they will choose to impersonate a member of the Special Air Services. They will claim that there is greater secrecy; that they cannot talk about where they served, what they did or when they served. It appears that it is easier to get away with impersonating a member of the SAS than perhaps impersonating someone in other areas of service where records can be more easily kept. This is something that members of the SAS and members of the veteransâ community, regardless of who it is that is being impersonated, are becoming increasingly agitated and concerned about.</para>
<para>When you understand the rhetoric of the press releases to which I referred earlier, you can understand that many in the veteransâ community feel that they have had their expectations raised by rhetoric in press releases but that there is no practical or real enforcement. In the final sentence of her press release at the time, the then Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I call on the Opposition parties to support this legislation as soon as possible so that we can provide that increased protection.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I call on the government to honour its own words and now, having put this legislation through with the support of the opposition, to provide the sort of protection that that legislation was supposedly going to provide. I know that the member for Hughes, the former minister, will be the next speaker from the government side. I invite the member for Hughes to explain to the House and to the veteransâ community the rhetoric of her press release and why she and subsequent ministers with responsibility for this area have not met their needs. I call on her to explain why it is that, on the one hand, government ministers can raise the expectations of the veterans community but, on the other hand, do nothing to meet those expectations. It is a hoax. I hope that the governmentâand, in particular, those people who are responsible for this legislationâwill do something now to defend the governmentâs inaction.</para>
<para>In closing, I want to also call on the minister to rethink a particular piece of policy which I understand she has signed off on. It relates to the access that children of veterans have to the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service. This is an access which is greatly valued by the children of veterans. I understand, however, that the minister has agreed to a proposal to cut off that access at the age of 36. I call on the minister to reconsider that piece of policy if that is indeed the case. I would think that the amount of money involved would be minimal, yet the assistance and help, encouragement and support that these kids of veterans have received through the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service more than warrant their continued access. It should not be a matter of dollars and cents because, as I have said, I think the amount involved would be minimalâindeed, negligibleâso why is it that the minister has agreed to this cut-off age? I know this is something that the Vietnam Veterans Association in Western Australia is going to take up with the broader veteran community, and I would encourage them to do so.</para>
<para>Last week in Perth, I addressed a meeting of Kids of Veterans at Hollywood hospital. It was very well attended. There were about 50 people there. I want to compliment them on the wonderful job that they are doing; I want to compliment the Vietnam Veterans Association in Perth particularly for the wonderful support that they are giving to these kids; and I want to say to Peter Ramsey, the President of the Vietnam Veterans Association, that he and his association should be very proud of the work that they have done in support of these kids over a period of a couple of years. I want to encourage him to keep up that work and that support.</para>
<para>I also briefly want to acknowledge the wonderful work done by some of these Kids of Veterans members. Andrea Willsher, Danielle Garland, Tracey Negus, Angela Blaszkow, Rachel Healy, Meredith Haywood and Natassja Hannay should all be very proud of the leadership that they have shown and the work that they have done in setting up and supporting this Kids of Veterans organisation. They have been a wonderful encouragement to veterans; they have set a great example. These young people, some of whom have done it a bit hard, should be very pleased with all that they have achieved.</para>
<para>In conclusion, I again call on the minister to recognise this group of Kids of Veterans and ask her not to adopt the cut-off of 36 years of age. There are some kids out thereâI do not think a lot of themâwho will benefit greatly from access to the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service, a counselling service which has done a great deal over a long period. I would hate to see that access shut off simply because someone has reached a certain age. I ask the minister to consider the arguments I have put tonight and to consider the views of the broader veteran community, who I know will support continued access to Kids of Veterans regardless of age. The opposition supports the legislation.</para>

<para>The Veteransâ Entitlements Amendment (2005 Budget Measure) Bill 2005 is welcome legislation for our veterans and war widows. I appreciate having the opportunity to speak on the bill, which further strengthens this governmentâs 2004 election commitment to recognise senior Australians, their needs and their carers. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Veteransâ Entitlements Act 1986 to give effect to the 2005 budget measure to extend eligibility for the seniors concession allowance to persons who are gold card holders over veteran pension age and who are not otherwise eligible for the seniors concession allowance or the utilities allowance.</para>
<para>The seniors concession allowance is an ongoing payment of $200 a year paid in two instalments, in June and December, that is indexed twice yearly. This payment is being made because state and territory governments have refused to accept this governmentâs offer to extend important concessions to those Australians we call self-funded retirees.</para>
<para>The seniors concession allowance was introduced for Commonwealth seniors health card holders in December 2004, in line with our governmentâs election commitment to help self-funded retirees maintain the lifestyle for which they have worked all their lives. More than 44,000 veterans and war widows will benefit from the provisions in the 2005-06 federal budget, with this governmentâs welcome initiative to extend the Australian governmentâs seniors concession allowance to older veterans who hold a gold card. This government has committed $27.7 million to this initiative over four years to assist our gold card holders. This is on top of an estimated $282.6 million originally committed for the seniors concession allowance. More than 290,000 Commonwealth senior health card holders have already benefited from this allowance. The new initiative will ensure that an additional 44,000 gold card holders over veteran pension age who do not already receive the seniors concession allowance or the twice-yearly pensioners utility allowance will now get this extra support.</para>
<para>The Howard government has already delivered on a 2001 election promise and has extended the gold card to all veterans over the age of 70 with qualifying service from any conflict, in recognition of their special and unique needs that increase as they grow older. This commitment by our government further recognises the special needs of gold card holders by way of extending the eligibility of those who have already served our nation to the seniors concession allowance. It ensures that all gold card holders over veteran pension age are able to receive some form of payment and/or concession through either the seniors concession allowance or the utilities allowance to assist in meeting their energy, rates and water bills.</para>
<para>The seniors concession allowance is paid at a higher rate than the utilities allowance in recognition that those eligible for utilities allowances also hold a pension concession card and receive concessions from various state, territory and local governments that are not generally available to Commonwealth senior health card holders. This government considers that the hardworking self-funded retirees should not miss out. This budget measure complements a range of other measures in this yearâs budget for veterans, especially in the health care area. The 2005-06 budget increased further funding for the care of veteran and Defence Force communities to more than $10.8 billion, a rise of $278 million on the previous year. I seek leave to continue my remarks on this bill at a later time.</para>

<para>
<inline font-size="8pt">That the amendments be disagreed to.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">I present the reasons for the House disagreeing to the Senate amendments to the <inline ref="R2346">Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005</inline>, and I will take the opportunity to explain, as I have already, why the House should not accept these amendments. These amendments were put to the House of Representatives and have already been defeated. These amendments would significantly change the legislation which the government announced in the budget and which has been passed by this House. Of course we know that this legislation will be passed by the new Senate when it comes into effect on 1 July and that the amendments that have been moved both in this House and in the Senate have been moved particularly as a covering exercise for the Leader of the Opposition, who on budget night said that he was opposed to the governmentâs income tax cuts. He and his shadow Treasurer took every opportunity to say that they would be inflationary and lead to interest rate increases. Two days later, of course, he decided that he could actually support income tax cuts of this dimension or greater dimensionâhe apparently had changed his view in those two days.</para>
<para>We know of course why he changed his view in those two days. The reception that he got from announcing that he would oppose these income tax cutsâas reflected in public opinion, informed opinion and the opinion of his own backbenchâwas a very tepid reaction indeed. Of course it should have been, because these income tax cuts will do a lot to improve the structure of the Australian taxation system. The first thing that they will do is cut the bottom marginal rate from 17c to 15c. That is another reason why we should reject these amendments. If these amendments pass, the bottom marginal rate will not be 15c; it will be 17c. So people on those lower incomes will actually be facing a higher marginal tax rate.</para>
<para>The second reason why the House ought to reject these amendments is that if these amendments pass there will be no tax cuts on 1 July. Carefully hidden in everything that the opposition have so far put is that their policy in fact is for no tax cut on 1 July. These amendments in fact take away the tax cuts which are due on 1 July. We have said in this House repeatedly, âLet Australians have a tax cut on 1 July.â Why are the Labor Party against it?</para>
<para>Third, the amendments would not allow the increase in the threshold for those top marginal rates to take effect from 1 July 2005 and 1 July 2006. The amendments which the government has put in place will ensure that 80 per cent of Australians have a marginal tax rate of 30c or less. That means no bracket creep for 80 per cent of Australians within that wide band. The Australian Labor Party amendments would not allow that. In addition to that, the tax schedule that the government has put forward means that only three per cent of Australians would be on the top marginal tax rate. In other words, 97 per cent of Australians would not be affected by it. This will make our tax system much more competitive. It will mean that our top threshold will be about the 16th lowest in the OECD, which puts us right back in accordance with international practice.</para>
<para>The tax plan which the government has laid down has been passed by this House. It will be passed by the new Senate. The Labor Party has made itself irrelevant to this debate. It cannot tell you today where it stands on the schedules which will implement these tax cuts on 1 July. Its amendments were cobbled together. They make no sense. They do nothing for the tax system. They are a back-covering exercise for a Leader of the Opposition who misjudged budget night and has done nothing to get himself back into this debate. This House must reject these amendments so that all Australians can have a tax cut on 1 July and we can have incentive in our tax system. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

We got the usual smirking, sneering speech from the Treasurer dealing with this today. It was a smirking, sneering address at the Senate. We are so irrelevant that we are all here talking about this! How completely irrelevant we must be that you are all here and we are all here talking about this! What you have done, Mr Treasurer, today is block a decent tax cut for the vast bulk of the Australian people. The reason you rant, the reason you sneer, the reason you catcall and the reason you mock is that you know in your guilty consciences that as you pocket $65 you spit in the face of the seven million Australians who get $6 a week each from this. You know that your sneering, smirking abuse of those seven million Australians is being tumbled by more and more of them the longer that this debate goes on. It is as simple as that. The longer this debate goes on, the more and more they tumble to the fact that you have dudded them. You see, what you have doneâ</para>

<para>âThe simple fact of the matter is this: this package was passed in the Senate with all the Democrats agreeing, all the Independents agreeing bar oneâthat being the One Nation senatorâand the Greens agreeing with us that this, which the government is rejecting, represents a package which does two things. Firstly, it ensures a fair tax cut for the vast bulk of the Australian people and, secondly, it ensures serious tax reform. But what it actually does is encourage participation in the work force by precisely those groups that the Reserve Bank and others identify as needing to participate in it if we are going to start to deal with some of the blockages to growth that are in our economy at the moment. The Labor Partyâs package enhances participation because it starts to deal with the questions that arise from the very heavy effective marginal tax rates on those who are currently out of the work force and wish to enter it but who get massively penalised to the tune of something like 104 per cent. It is something like 104 per cent in the case of the quite substantial number of people who have received that $17 payment rise from the Industrial Relations Commission.</para>

<para>It is very interesting that today the Melbourne Institute has come out with an analysis of these two propositions: the governmentâs and ours. The institute itself has come to the conclusion that the Labor Partyâs package is fairer. It has come to the conclusion too that the Labor Partyâs package would generate more jobs. It has come to the conclusion as well that the Labor Partyâs package reflects genuine tax reform. The point is that we are about serious tax reform and a reasonable tax cut for most Australians; you are about greed and your leadership opportunity. So here is your chance, members of the government. Make a stand now for your ordinary electors. Make a stand for the people who elected you to come here. Make a stand for them and not for yourselves. Step out of the frame and allow your constituents through. Do the decent thing by them for once in your lives. Do what is right for ordinary Australians. Accept the amendments that we have moved and which are accepted by all other political forces in the Senate, bar One Nationâand you can keep them.</para>

<para>âOn behalf of the working men and women of Australia, we will do the right thing: we will deliver a tax cut on 1 July. We will not say to them, âYou will get zero dollars.â We will say to the Australian people, âFrom 1 July you will have lower effective marginal tax rates.â We are not taking the Labor way. Every person who sits here on this side can sense the relief of the Leader of the Opposition as today he has to get up for the very last time to try and explain to the Australian people the impossible: âI donât want you to have a tax cut.â</para>

And who has he been made irrelevant by? He has been made irrelevant by the Greens, the Democrats, One Nation and the Independents. The Leader of the Opposition cannot prevent Australians from getting the tax cuts that they deserve.</para>
<para>All members of the House would be delighted to learn that not only is the Labor Party willing to ensure that Australians do not get tax cuts but also today, in the other place, its members stood up there yet again and denied Australians $2.4 billion worth of relief of tax in the form of the superannuation surcharge; they knocked it on the head again.

<para>Tonight the Leader of the Opposition got up here and, because he had nothing constructive to say and was looking for a way out and was so grateful that his five minutes were expiring, spent three minutes of that time with personal attacks on the Treasurer, the man who has delivered these tax cuts. This is a man with broad shoulders. This is a man who can stand up for Australian workers. This is a man who has said that Australians deserve tax cuts and he will do whatever it takes to ensure that they get them on 1 July. He stood up to the roosters. For the first time in the last nine years we did not get an MPI the day after the budget from the shadow Treasurer and for the first time we did not get a question to the Treasurer from the shadow Treasurer.

<para>âListen to the cacophony of noise and indignation. What they are trying to hide, no matter how many words they use, is that they want to do one fundamental thing: they want to deny every single tax-paying Australian a tax cut from 1 July. Every single person on this side understands that. Every single member of this parliament understands that and quite clearly many of those in the opposition do too, given their comments in the papers of late. In fact, not only those who sit on this side but many on the other side acknowledge that Australians deserve these tax cuts. They acknowledge that the Labor Party has made a futile attempt to prevent them being received and they say it is going to be damn good when people do receive them. Once and for all, the member for Brand can be put out of his misery and will not have to stand up to defend the indefensible. The tax cuts will be delivered because the Howard-Costello government delivers for the working men and women of Australia. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThis side of the House stands for fairness in the tax system. It stands for incentive in the tax system. It stands for rewarding effort in the tax system. It stands for giving all those workers in this community who have worked hard to make our economy strong a fair goânot something they will ever get from the Liberal Party.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Today we have an analysis from the Melbourne Institute of the two packages, and guess who they think has developed the fairest package? The fairest package has come from the Labor Party. But the Treasurer had the hide to talk about his package being a reform package. There is no reform in his package at all; there is absolutely no reform in his package. This is what the Melbourne Institute had to say today: something like 78,000 people in total would move into the work force under the Labor package. That is a much more significant participation rate than anything the government package will produce.</para>
<para>Let us have a look at the Melbourne Institute analysis: 78,609 individuals will be encouraged to enter the labour market under the Labor proposal, 75 per cent more than under the government proposal. And who are they? There are 121 per cent more single males, 81 per cent more sole parents, 76 per cent more females in couple families, 68 per cent more single females and 46 per cent more males in couple families. In the Labor package there is some genuine reformâthe sort of reform that the Reserve Bank has been calling for, the sort of reform that the OECD has been calling for, the sort of reform that can make our economy strong and the sort of reform that can put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. That is because we have produced a tax reform proposal. What the government produced was a Sheriff of Nottingham proposal that would take tax relief from the great bulk of the low- and middle-income earners in this community and give it to a few at the top.</para>
<para>Let us see just how obscene this governmentâs package is. The government thinks it is fair to give 45 per cent of the value of the tax cuts to the top 10 per cent of workers, while 90 per cent of workers share the rest. Shame on the Liberal Party! This package is a slap in the face for those seven million workers who have been left out. It is a skewing of the tax system in a completely disproportionate way. And guess what? It is completely out of whack with traditional Australian notions of a fair go. What all Australians can see tonight and what they could see in the Senate this morning is what the Liberal Party stands for: advantage for the few to the detriment of the many. And that is what we are seeing with its industrial relations package as well.</para>
<para>What the Treasurer, Peter Costelloâthe Sheriff of Nottinghamâhas done is serve a three-course meal to those at the top. They have been given generous tax cuts, generous superannuation and the promise of more to come. What have Labor done? We have stood up and fought for seven million Australians, to double their tax cut from $6 to $12, to give a fair go to all those people who are trying to move from welfare to work and to give them some real incentive. The government does not reward aspiration. The only people the government thinks have aspirations are those on six-figure salaries. That is why those opposite have gorged themselves on the governmentâs $65 tax cut and that is why the government has left seven million workers behind, receiving only $6.</para>
<para>We are going to continue to fight for Australian workers. We are going to continue to fight for the aspirations of low- and middle-income earners, to ensure that over the next three years the government does not use its complete power to rip money away from them without giving them some reward and incentive in the tax system. We are going to ensure that when the next election comes there will be a very clear choice. There will be a clear choice between the Beazley Labor wayâthe way to a fair goâand the unfair world of Peter Costello and John Howard. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

The question is: why does Labor not want Australians to have a tax cut on 1 July? We will not support these amendments, because they leave the bottom marginal tax rate at 17 per cent, when we want to reduce it to 15 per cent. We will not support these amendments, because older Australians will be denied what they deserve.</para>

<para>âThe fact is that the Australian Labor Party has rendered itself completely and utterly irrelevant in this debate. They have done that because of their inexcusable and consistent vacillation on this issue. At the end of the day the best the Australian Labor Party could do following the federal budget was to determine not to determine a position. That was the Labor Partyâs income tax policy. The Labor Party can continually try to mislead the Australian people about these tax cuts, but the fact of the matter is that this government will have these tax cuts passed by the Senate.</para>

<para>What is interesting is this continual argument that the Australian Labor Party puts forward that low-income tax earners are disadvantaged by this governmentâs policies.

People who are earning $25,000 will receive a reduction of 28 per cent in tax.</para>

<para>âIt is an old ploy: when you have no substance to back your case you resort to personal abuse. That is all we got from the three stooges tonight: no substance but plenty of personal abuse. The Treasurer, now almost 10 years into the job, had one basic responsibility tonight: to argue the respective merits of the governmentâs tax cut package, compared with the package that has been delivered back to this place by the Australian Senate. That is why we are having this debate tonight: to determine for the Australian people which is the fairer tax package. But, of course, we got none of that from the Treasurer. We got from him exactly what we got last time this bill was in this place: plenty of personal abuse but no substance whatsoever.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Forget about the elites in this place. Forget about the elites that sit up just above us. It is well known in the Australian community that the Labor Party believes in a tax cut. The Labor Party believes that a government embarrassingly awash with money, having been formally recorded as the highest taxing government in Australian history, should be returning a dividend to the Australian community and to hardworking Australian families. So we set about proving this tax cut could be fairer. We set about doing that by constructing and developing an alternative tax packageâa tax package which this afternoon has been embraced by the Australian Senate.</para>
<para>The reason the Treasurer came in here a couple of weeks ago and did not attempt to argue the merits of those respective tax cuts is that he has no argument. What he did was look for a distraction and a diversion. That distraction and diversion came in the form of his tax schedule stunt. Guess what? The stunt will not work. He did not mind dragging the tax commissioner through the mud along the way. The bad news for the Treasurer tonight is that that tax schedule disallowance debate is now behind us. That is now behind us, Treasurer. You have made that point yourself. Given that it is behind us, it is now up to you to argue the relative merits of these packages. Of course, you have arrogantly tonight avoided any attempt to do so whatsoever.</para>

<para>âby leaveâI am delighted to inform the House that the Australian hostage in Iraq, Mr Douglas Wood, is safe from his captors. Mr Wood was recovered a short while ago in Baghdad in a military operation that I am told was conducted by Iraqi forces in cooperation in a general way with force elements of the United States. He is now under the protection of the Australian emergency response team in Baghdad. I understand that he is well and is undergoing medical checks at the present time. I know that all Australians will be jubilant at this news. This man has suffered immensely and I want on behalf of all of the parliament to pay tribute to the dignity and strength of his family. He comes from a deeply impressive family. The strength, resolve and courage that his brothers and other members of his family have displayed and their understanding of the difficulty of this whole incident for all involved have been, I can only say, very deeply impressive. I want to record that I appreciate very much the cooperation between the government and the members of his family. We have of course focused very much on his wellbeing in returning him to his family. I do not, at this stage, for operational reasons want to comment further on the circumstances of his recovery.</para>

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has displayed superb professionalism throughout this whole incident. The work of Mr Nick Warner, who has been the head of the emergency response team, has been quite exemplary. I want to pay a special tribute to Nick. He is an officer who is known to many of us and he has done great things for Australia, not only in Iraq but also in the Solomon Islands. I want of course to thank the special forces, the other members of the emergency response team that went to Iraq, Brigadier McCabe and all of the units in Iraq that have been associated with this.</para>
<para>Can I also pay special tribute to the contribution of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has had the day-to-day carriage of this on behalf of the government. May I also thank the opposition, the Leader of the Opposition, and the member for Griffith, for their understanding at every stage of the difficulties involved and the need for us to unite to save an Australian. This has brought out some of the best things in our people. I also place on record my appreciation for the efforts of the Australian Islamic community and Sheik Taj al-Hilaly. Many people have tried. We are overwhelmed with reliefânothing compared, of course, with the relief that his family must now feel.</para>
<para>Can I also say that at no stage has a ransom been paid. At no stage has the government compromised its position in relation to our commitment to Iraq, the level of our force commitment. I want to reiterate our commitment to the stability and reconstruction of Iraq and to the Iraqi people who are daily the victims of terrorism and crime. I did endeavour, before making this statement, to contact the Iraqi Prime Minister. I hope I will do so very shortly to express my thanks for the efforts of his forces. May I record again our thanks to our American friends for their constant support, availability and cooperation. It is a wonderful outcome for this man who has suffered so much. It is a tribute to the work of our Iraqi and American friends that this has come about.</para>

<para>âby leaveâThis is a joyful moment for all members of the House. I suspect that in our heart of hearts so many of us felt that this was not a moment we might enjoy and celebrate. I think many of us thought that when this terrible saga began it would not end as it has ended, with the rescue of the Australian hostage. I am of course not across all the detail of the organisation that went into this or how this rescue was effected. The Prime Minister briefed me very briefly before he came to the House. I suspect the Prime Minister has only just found out about it himself and is probably not across absolutely every aspect of the detail in these circumstances.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Nevertheless, my foreign affairs spokesperson and I have been very conscious of the effort that the Australian government made to put in place a mechanism and a group of personnel in Iraq to keep the focus on the effort to liberate Mr Wood at the forefront of our attention, the attention of the authorities in Iraq and the attention of our allies and all our friends in the region. If it transpires to have been effected in the way the Prime Minister has indicated here from his preliminary advice and an Iraqi team did this, that is additional good newsâthat there is now a capability amongst some of the Iraqi personnel to effect the protection of people who go to Iraq to assist Iraq in its development. We welcome that as well.</para>
<para>We join with the Prime Minister in the congratulations and thanks that he extended to various people who played a role in all of this, including the remarks that he made about the efforts of the Australian Islamic community. They recognised immediately this situation developed a fellow feeling with the Wood family and with Mr Wood. They did their very best with the contacts that they had and the angles that they could work to effect to secure the release of the hostage.</para>
<para>From the outset the opposition said that the circumstances of Mr Woodâs capture and imprisonment were such that no government could tolerate or give in to or adjust policy to meet any demands associated with his capture. It is not the right thing to do to negotiate a change in policy on the basis of a terrorist act committed against you. Nor is it appropriate to pay ransom in those circumstances. Whatever the disagreements that the opposition has with government policy with regard to the situation in Iraq, that was firmly our view at the time, and it remains our view. You cannot have your politics in any way shaped by the actions of evil people. It is very important that this outcome has in no way compromised that position.</para>
<para>But I think the lionâs share of the tribute in all of this must go to the Wood family, who really have been extraordinarily resourceful and brave throughout. They have been people who, no doubt, plumbed the depths of despair and desperation as the days and weeks went by. It would have been enormously easy in those circumstances for frustration to in some shape or form break out into disagreement with how affairs were being handled or into condemnation of this or that activityâor perceived inactivityâby government or by any other forces associated with it. But that never happened. In the entire time the family maintained an enormously dignified, disciplined determination that whatever it was that the family could do to provide some form of assistance to secure a successful outcome the family would do. It speaks so well of all of them that they have sustained this. Our hearts went out to them right through this terrible time of trial and our admiration is there now where our hearts areâand our gratitude that this has been brought to a successful conclusion.</para>

<para>âNo member of this place could resent or regret being interrupted by such an unexpected and happy announcement as the one we have just heard from the Prime Minister, but before I was interrupted I was about to make the point that this lazy and cocky Treasurer and this lazy and cocky government underestimated the oppositionâs resolve on this issue. We do believe that a government which, through no credit of its own, is so awash with moneyâoff the back of a minerals boom, off the back of terms of trade which are at a record high and off the back of a GST growing at nine per cent annuallyâshould return a dividend to the Australian people. His test tonight, with the tax schedule debate now behind usâwith his stunt and his distraction and his diversion now behind usâwas to do what the Melbourne Institute did today and argue the case as to which is the fairer tax package.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Once again tonight both the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer failed to do that. But he has not missed his last chance. There is nothing to prevent the Treasurer, after I finish my remarks, from coming back to the dispatch box and doing what he failed to do during the consideration in detail stage of the debate in this place a couple of weeks ago and what he failed to do during the debate on the Senate message here tonight: that is, get to that dispatch box and tell the Australian community why it is so fair for so many peopleâseven million Australiansâto get only a $6 a week tax cut, while those sitting on that side so enthusiastically vote themselves a $64 tax cut each week. That is the case he needs to put. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>âI received leave to continue my remarks on the <inline ref="R2373">Veteransâ Entitlements Amendment (2005 Budget Measure) Bill 2005</inline>. The budget includes $4.6 billion for health care, an increase of $203 million from the 2004-05 budget, and $6.1 billion for compensation and income support, up from $6 billion last financial year. Included in the veteransâ health measures is $30.4 million over four years to increase fees paid to anaesthetists providing services to eligible veterans; $30.5 million over four years to increase fees for dentists providing services to the veteran community and to increase the annual monetary limit for high-cost dental services; and a further $18.2 million over four years to increase fees for a range of allied health professionals providing services to members of the veteran community. Eligible veterans will also continue to benefit from concessional rates on prescription medicines and from the payment of the DVA pharmaceutical allowance. Over the last nine years under this government, more than $86 billion has been committed in recognition of the special needs of veterans and war widows. This funding has risen from $6.5 billion in 1996 to more than $10.8 billion in the last budget, an average annual increase of 5.8 per cent.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is worth while, especially after the comments from the member for Cowan, to have a look at what the government was promising at the last election for our veterans and our war widows. Laborâs plan for veterans offered a paltry range of initiatives, and it continues to reflect their lack of understanding of the real needs of veterans and war widows. Laborâs plan had promised only $17.8 million of new funding over four years, compared to the $82.4 million under the coalition. Labor failed to address the issues of most concern to our older veterans and war widowsânamely, secure health care services and practical help in the home.</para>
<para>Labor failed to make any commitment to maintaining the 15 per cent premium paid to general practitioners to treat the 300,000 eligible white and gold card holders under Veteransâ Affairs arrangements rather than Medicare. Under Laborâs changes to Medicare, general practitioners would have had little financial incentive to maintain separate billing arrangements for white and gold card holders, which was a great concern to members of the veteran community. Labor failed to make any commitment to Veterans Home Care, which could have seen over 60,000 eligible veterans and war widows lose this valuable service. Labor failed and continues to fail to acknowledge the valuable contribution made by ex-service organisations to the welfare of veterans, and offered nothing to assist ex-service organisations with their work. Labor failed to offer anything further to assist the spouses of our most disabled veterans following their deaths. Labor continues to fail our veterans and our war widows.</para>
<para>This bill provides clear evidence that the Howard government continues to deliver to our veterans, our war widows and our ex-service community. The measures in this bill are another strong government achievement. In fact, since this government was returned to office in 1996, there have been a number of very significant measures in support of veterans and war widows. Our veterans with disabilities are financially much better off. Our service pensioners, war widows and war widowers are better off financially. Health care for gold card and white card holders has been expanded. There is provision of extra care for our former prisoners of war, and the government has delivered on practical support for Vietnam veterans and their families, most especially for the children of Vietnam veterans. The government has also provided greater flexibility for younger veterans and our serving personnel.</para>
<para>We have encouraged the respect and reverence due to our veterans and war widows by encouraging the recognition of and pride in Australiaâs military heritage and by providing a further $11 million in the 2004-05 budget to expand the excellent Australian War Memorial. This last point is very significant because this year, during 2005, a number of significant wartime anniversaries have occurred and will continue to occur. There has been the much publicised 90th anniversary of the Gallipoli landing, which occurred, of course, in April. There are also many 60th anniversaries occurring this year, one of which is the anniversary of the landing at Labuan in Borneo, to which we recently sent a commemorative mission of 11 veterans. Significant campaigns in Papua New Guinea will also be commemorated this year by a return of old diggers to pay respects to the mates they left behind in that rugged and unforgiving terrain. Australian veterans and war widows also attended the 60th commemoration in Paris earlier this year to recognise Victory in Europe Day, otherwise known as VE Day.</para>
<para>The government is planning appropriate commemorations here in Australia to recognise the 60th anniversary of the Victory in the Pacific. Such plans will be announced at the appropriate time by the minister. I take this opportunity to congratulate the minister for ensuring that our veterans, war widows and ex-service personnel continue to receive the respect and affection of a grateful nation. I join with them in eagerly awaiting the ministerâs announcement on Australiaâs activities to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Victory in the Pacific.</para>
<para>The 2005-06 budget builds on a lot of hard work by the Howard government to ensure that our veterans, war widows and ex-service community receive the care that they need and the support that is truly important to this group of Australians. I welcome this legislation and commend it to the House.</para>

<para>âI was interested to hear the previous speaker say that the <inline ref="R2373">Veteransâ Entitlements Amendment (2005 Budget Measure) Bill 2005</inline> delivers to veterans. I would have to say that, instead, this bill fixes up a problem that the government made. This bill rights a wrong. This bill covers up the governmentâs ineptitude. This bill makes up for the fact that the government forgot about the veterans when it initially introduced this legislation. This is legislation that, on the face of it, you would assume would be fairly non-controversial. Everybody in this House would agree that self-funded veterans who are independently funded retirees should receive the $200 a year payment that other self-funded retirees receive.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Unfortunately for those self-funded retiree veterans, the government forgot about them when they drafted the legislation. They left them off. They did not give them the same attention that they gave to other self-funded retirees. This is very sad because the government went to the last election promising this $200 to all self-funded retirees. To think that they forgot our veteransâour veterans who fought for us and were prepared to give their lives for Australia. Here we are today, some six months later, discussing legislation to bring the treatment of the veterans into line with that of other self-funded retirees. Basically, the government failed them. The government went to the election with great promises, spraying dollars everywhere like confetti, and now they are finally getting around to delivering to our veterans.</para>
<para>I will go through the details of how the system works. Basically the seniors allowance is a non means tested giveaway to assist self-funded retirees to pay their power, gas and utility bills. This was what the government promised this group of people in the lead-up to the election: help with things like their car registration and water bills. Self-funded retirees were given an extra $100 because the government recognised that, unlike pensioners, they did not get many of the discounts. We believe that that was blatant electioneering by the government. We believe that this was part of the vote-buying spree that the government went on before the election.</para>
<para>This allowance is to be paid in two instalments, one in June and one in December. Because the veterans have missed out, they are not going to receive their allowance until December 2005. We are going to pass this legislation tonight, and then they will become eligibleâbut unfortunately this legislation is not retrospective. This legislation only goes half-way. It does not really recognise that our veterans deserve to be treated with dignity. They are not being treated in the same way as other self-funded retirees. I am afraid that this has really become the way of this governmentâit tends to forget and marginalise certain groups of people. I find it appalling that it has reached the point where it is doing that to veterans. So this rather non-controversial legislation which is going to extend an entitlement to veterans becomes quite controversial because in fact it treats veterans in a different way to other self-funded retireesâit actually treats them as lesser people. It treats them as lesser people and yet they were the people who were prepared to go and fight for Australia.</para>
<para>I have been very disappointed with the governmentâs performance in the area of veterans affairs. There have been a number of issues that have been raised with me by veterans. I think that it is about time that the government started doing more than building monuments and announcing celebrations. I listened to the previous speaker; she spent a great deal of time talking about celebrations. I have news for the government: the kinds of things that veterans need in the area that I representâand it is an area that has a high veteran populationâare services and financial assistance. They need some of the issues that were raised in the Clarke report to be dealt with and they need the government to be honest with them and not to adopt a smoke and mirrors approach to veterans affairs.</para>
<para>If you look at this yearâs budget, you will notice that there is only $10 million for new budget measures in 2005-06. Compare that with the $52 million in savings that are going to be delivered, which come from flow-ons from the health portfolio. Apart from the long overdue increase in dental limits, there are no changes in entitlements whatsoever. There is a $411 million increase in the total budget of the Department of Veteransâ Affairs, but most of thatâ$393 millionâis due to normal cost increases in the delivery of existing services. The so-called initiatives for anaesthetists and allied health providers are part of those normal cost increases. When you add to that $393 million the $60 million that has been carried forward from the budgets of previous years, you will see that the government are giving less money to veterans. Savings have exceeded new spending. The government are trying to cheat, con and use smoke and mirrors to convince the veterans community that they care, that they are delivering to veterans. But that is not the case at all.</para>
<para>The previous speaker raised the issue of children and caring for children. It is an issue I raised earlier tonight in the Main Committee during the consideration in detail of the budget. The government is looking at cutting costs in the services offered by the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service to children of veterans, regardless of their age. The government is thinking of introducing a cut-off point of 36 years of age. All the studies and every report that I have read on this issue show that the government needs to proceed with great caution in this area. As we know, the rate of suicide for sons and daughters of Vietnam veterans is three times the national rate. For that reason alone we need to be very careful about taking away that counselling service for the children of veterans. You might ask why that is being done. The answer is simple: this government is more concerned with saving money than with delivering services to veterans. I need to place that on the record.</para>
<para>The other issue I wish to place on the record in talking about services and benefits to veterans is the failure of the government to reward the selfless care given to disabled veterans by their partners with the $1,000 bonus that was paid to people in receipt of the carers payment. Partners of veterans received the $600 payment, as did those in receipt of the carers allowance. But the partners of veterans do not receive the carers payment, so they are ineligible for that $1,000. These people do the same work as other carers. In some cases they care for the most disabled and sickest people in our communityâpeople with enormous problemsâyet the government has chosen to ignore their needs. Whilst the introduction of this legislation and the extension of the utility payment is very important, many other issues need to be taken up.</para>
<para>For instance, the government has not really dealt with the Clarke report. The Clarke report disappeared without a trace. We are wondering what has happened to the initiatives that were supposed to flow from that report. As I have already mentioned, the veterans that talk to me are concerned that we are having lots of celebrations but the nuts and bolts of the issues affecting their daily lives are not being dealt with. They do not want to see more savings in veterans affairs. They want to see a government that is 100 per cent committed to them. They appreciate the $200 that they will be given. Many of them have said to me that they thought that it was a case of the government trying to buy their vote, and they were very disappointed when they found out that they were not to receive that $200 immediately.</para>
<para>There are many challenges for the government in veterans affairs. There is such a need within the veterans community. People are still having problems with the Veterans Home Care program. They are still not getting the number of hours of care that they believe that they should be receiving. They are very disappointed that the government have chosen to move away from their responsibility in this area. They are waiting to see the outcome of the atomic-testing inquiries. They will accept the money that is being given to them by the government and we will support it. But we would implore the government to take this measure a step further, to reconsider their decision and to backdate this payment to bring these veterans into line with other self-funded retirees.</para>

<para>âI rise tonight to pay my respects to one of my constituents, an elder of the Gunung-Willam-Balluk clan, Norman Hunter, who passed away on 16 May at the age of 61, after a long illness. Norm lived in Coolaroo in my electorate and, as an elder of the Gunung-Willam-Balluk clan of the Wurundjeri community, the traditional custodians of the land where my electorate office is essentially based, Norm was a very proud and respected role model.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Whilst not large in number, the Indigenous community in my electorate remains culturally rich, and they are enormously proud of their heritage. Uncle Norm, as he was known in the community, was committed to his people, to guiding and teaching the young and to recognising and correcting the past wrongs that the Indigenous community endured. Norm gave himself totally to the community, with his lifelong commitment to reconciliation and to Indigenous people and their culture. With his loss, our community has lost a very valuable supporter.</para>
<para>In 2001, Normâs commitments were recognised with the honour of a Centenary Medal for his service as an advocate of reconciliation and as an elder of the Wurrinjeri community. It was with great pleasure that I presented this Centenary award to Norm. He was a much deserving recipient who achieved far more in the community than he was recognised for.</para>
<para>For many years Norm was involved in Hume City Council activities, including his valuable participation on the Indigenous Advisory Committeeâwhich he continued, despite his long illnessâand his contribution most recently to the Weaving Lands Basketry Project in 2004, where Norm was honoured with the naming of the final sculpture, <inline font-style="italic">The Galgignarrak Yirranboi Tree</inline>, which means âthe Backbone of Tomorrowâ, representing the growth and strength of the local community.</para>
<para>Norm also played a prominent role in setting up the Gunung-Willam-Balluk Indigenous Learning Centre at Kangan Batman TAFE in Broadmeadows. This is a state-of-the-art centre where Indigenous students can learn about their culture while completing their TAFE studies. Norm was a part of this project literally from start to finish. At the sod-turning celebrations at commencement of construction in 2003 Norm performed a special fire ceremony to signify the ânew beginningâ represented by this facility and at the launch of the centre in 2004 Norm spoke and performed the welcome to country ceremony. Unfortunately I was unable to attend that launch, but I did visit the centre shortly after and was thoroughly impressedâand continue to be impressedâby the centre, its facilities and the tremendous amount of work that it does locally for Indigenous young people.</para>
<para>With over 400 people attending Normâs funeral service, the extent of our communityâs loss is very clear. In the eulogy given by Terry Kildea, the Koori programs manager at Kangan Batman TAFE, Normâs fighting spirit and commitment to the young were acknowledged. Terry spoke of Normâs passing and noted:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">You have left spiritual footprints for us to follow.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This he has done. Norm has left an exemplary legacy for others to build on and to develop. He has provided an example for the continued promotion of respect for Indigenous cultural heritage and for reconciliation and social justice for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community.</para>
<para>Normâs contribution to the community was commemorated at the Gunung-Willam-Balluk Learning Centre as part of this yearâs Reconciliation Week events, with Normâs daughter, Tammy Hunter-Capocchi, telling the gathering the story of her people and their ties to the land. For the benefit of the House, I would like to quote Tammy. She said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The story of the Gunung-Willam-Balluk people is an epic tale of survival and adaptation. Strip away the present layer of buildings, freeways and suburbs and try to imagine the distant past. You will come across a distant land of meandering waterways and vibrant forests, lagoons and wild grasses, basalt plains and rivers. We have always been here. We have been here since the beginning of time. We come from the land. Our identity is bound up with the land. To understand our aspirations, the land needs to be recognised.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Norm leaves behind Annette, his wife of 38 years, as well as his six children, his seven grandchildren and many members of his wider family and many friends. I express my sympathy to Normâs family and community. He will be remembered fondly and respected for his commitment and wisdom.</para>

<para>âRose Bay Secondary College is the only state high school in the electorate of Wentworth. Its achievements place it among the most accomplished high schools in New South Wales. The school is renowned for its strong creative and technological focus. Rose Bay Secondary College currently operates from two campusesâone in Dover Heights and another in Vaucluse. Four years ago the Carr Labor government in New South Wales decided to consolidate the two high school campuses into one at the Dover Heights campus. This had the advantage of freeing up the extremely valuable Vaucluse High School site for sale for development. An experienced local real estate agent has informed me that if the Vaucluse site of 1.2 hectares were zoned for medium densityâand that is the character of its surrounding developmentâit would be worth more than $25 million.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The deal offered to the community was straightforward: a new building would be erected at Dover Heights and the old building refurbished so that the whole campus would be a state-of-the-art high school for 1,200 students. The state Labor government has now announced in its budget that it will not spend the $7 million needed to refurbish the old premises and finish the capital works at Dover Heights. This is a breach of promise to the students, teachers and parents of Rose Bay Secondary College. It means that the state Labor government can potentially pocket tens of millions from the sale of the Vaucluse site and then short-change the school community by reneging on its promise to complete the development at Dover Heights.</para>
<para>Last night a public meeting was held at the Dover Heights campus, demanding that the state government complete its long promised refurbishment of the Dover Heights premises before the whole school is moved in. Over 400 people attended, including studentsâpast and presentâparents and concerned residents. It was a powerful display of unity, and I commend Julia Meare and her P&amp;C for organising such a successful event. Premier Bob Carr, Treasurer Andrew Refshauge and the state Minister for Education and Training, Carmel Tebbutt, were invited but, predictably, did not show up or send a representative. On 19 May I wrote to Ms Tebbutt expressing my very grave concern at the state governmentâs failure to fund the stage 2 building program of the Rose Bay Secondary College. I have had no response beyond a bare acknowledgment.</para>
<para>The Labor Party complains bitterly about parents choosing non-government schools, especially in the eastern suburbs of Sydney. Yet when there was an opportunity to ensure that our area had a state high school with first-class facilities, the Labor government decided to take the money and run off with it. It claims that it is facing budgetary constraints and cannot afford to complete the project. But the eastern suburbs contribute more state taxes than any other community in Sydney. High property values ensure that our community pays the most in stamp duty and land tax. The sale of the Vaucluse land will reap a multiple of the $7 million needed to complete the work at Dover Heights. Yet it is our community in the eastern suburbs, contributing so much to state revenues, that is being short-changed by Labor.</para>
<para>By way of contrast, the federal government is providing substantial and growing levels of funding to New South Wales state schools. In 2005-06 the federal government will increase funding for New South Wales state schools and students to $998 million. This is an estimated increase of $73 million, nearly eight per cent, over the past year and $469 million, nearly 89 per cent, since 1996.</para>
<para>I urge the Rose Bay Secondary College community to keep up the pressure on the Carr Labor state government. The governmentâs neglect of public education in the eastern suburbs is scandalous and must not be tolerated. I will continue to lobby the state government on behalf of the Rose Bay Secondary College community. The Labor government has shown itself to be either a fool or a knave. If it did not have the money to begin with, it was a fool. But if the truth is that the money was there, as it would appear, and this is just a case of another broken promise, ridicule is not the answer: those in the government are not fools and they deserve public condemnation. I urge the premier and his colleagues to keep their promise to the community and complete Rose Bay Secondary College.</para>

<para>âThe now notorious cases of Cornelia Rau and Vivian Solon have reawakened the general media and community interest in the treatment of asylum seekers more generally in Australia. They have reawakened interest in the system that this parliament ratified. The mistreatment of vulnerable people now has to be squarely faced by all in this place and the wider community. What we know now demands a full judicial inquiry. We know, for example, that at least 13 people have died in detention; as many as fourâprobably moreâhave been killed on return to their countries; and 353 people drowned en route to Australia on board the SIEVX. Perhaps as many as 200âaccording to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairsâhave been wrongfully detained and an unknown number of people have actually been wrongfully deported. These facts alone demand a full judicial inquiry.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>While a lot of people have been content to turn their backs and close their ears, a band of dedicated advocates and supportersâwho I commendâhave provided tangible support to people in detention and those who have been let out on various forms of visa without proper support from the government. They have worked assiduously to try to minimise the damage being done in the governmentâs nameâindeed, in the Australian peopleâs nameâto so many people. They have selflessly sought to wring concessions from successive ministers and to get them to change their minds about various detaineesâsometimes successfully, sometimes not. They have shone a light on the desperate circumstances of the thousands who have had the misfortune to pass through the detention system in Australia and on Manus Island and Nauru. There have, too, been a few determined journalists who have provided the vehicles to tell the stories and highlight the atrocitiesâbecause atrocities they are.</para>
<para>This evening I want to present the outline of a petition which will be tabled in due course calling for a royal commission into the treatment of asylum seekers, refugees and immigration detainees. The petition has been compiled by one of the groups I mentioned, Project Safecom, and a dedicated advocate, Jack Smit. It is in the following terms. Already it has 5,278 signatures, and they are rolling in a couple of hundred at a time. It calls for a royal commission into the treatment of asylum seekers, refugees and immigration detainees, and specifically into:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">conditions, incidents and events, in Australian and âPacific Solutionâ detention centres &amp; all other forms of immigration detention and prisons, police lock-ups, home detention, including how incidents were acted upon and followed up;</para>
<para class="block">engagement and administration of the contract between ACM and the Commonwealth of Australia from 1997-2004 incl., and Group 4Falck from 2003 onwards; and the conduct of ACM and GSL in their operation of IDCs;</para>

<para class="block">the effects of government policies on their physical and mental health and that of their families and dependantsâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">and a number of other matters.</para>
<para>In all of this, it is very important that we do not let the government off the hook. This is not just about the behaviour of DIMIA, DIMIA staff and contracted companies. It is about the systematic abuse of asylum seekers in this country and it deserves a full, open inquiry. Labor has called for it; members of the community are now calling for it. It is time we opened up this hideous Pandoraâs box and examined it in all its grotesqueness.</para>

<para>âTonight I would like to quote from the Autumn 2005 newsletter from the Kurrajong Early Intervention Service, of which I declare I am a patron. Something in this newsletter really struck me: 10 things that every child with autism wishes you would know about them. It starts by saying:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">Some days it seems the only predictable thing about it is the unpredictability. The only consistent attribute, is the inconsistency. There is little argument on any level but that autism is baffling, even to those who spend their lives around it.</para>
<para class="block">The child who lives with autism may look ânormalâ but his or her behaviour can be perplexing and downright difficult. Today, the citadel of autism, once thought an âincurableâ disorder, is cracking around the foundation. Every day, individuals with autism show us they can overcome, compensate for, and otherwise manage many of the conditionâs most challenging aspects. Equipping those around our children with a simple understanding of autismâs most basic elements has a tremendous effect on the childrenâs journey towards productive, independent adulthood. Autism is an extremely complex disorder, but we can distill it to three critical components: sensory processing difficulties, speech/language delays and impairments, and whole child/social interaction issues.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">There are 10 things that every child with autism wishes that we would know about them. I will not be able to go through these 10 things this evening. But No. 1 is that a child says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I am a child with autism. I am not âautisticâ. My autism is one aspect of my total character. It does not define me as a person. Are you a person with thoughts, feelings and many talents, or are you just fat (overweight), myopic (wear glasses) or klutyzy (uncoordinated, not good at sports)?</para>

<para>âI rise this evening to address the emerging debate on uranium mining and nuclear energy. This is a debate of great importance in the context of Australian trade, our future economic growth and our industry competitiveness in an increasingly carbon constrained world. It is also an important debate for Australia in the context of responsible citizenship in the global community. Australia is already a major exporter of uranium, and therefore it is undeniably part of the global nuclear cycle. Thankfully and importantly, Australia is a responsible participant in that cycle. Responsibility in the context of its role in the global nuclear cycle means that Australia cannot withdraw from the international community in terms of the debate about uranium mining, nuclear power and its corollaries: nuclear nonproliferation and the safe and peaceful handling of nuclear waste materials.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Today there are some 440 nuclear power reactors in 31 countries, with a combined capacity of 367 gigawatt equivalents. In 2003 these provided over 16 per cent of the worldâs electricity. Countries with existing nuclear programs have significantly increased their generating capacity, including the United States of America, Belgium, Sweden, Spain, Switzerland and Finland. Rising gas prices and greenhouse constraints on coal have combined to put nuclear power back on the agenda for projected new capacity in both Europe and North America. We await the UK white paper with respect to its future energy capacity. But, interestingly and importantly for Australia, the fastest growth is on Australiaâs doorstep in Asia. About 30 power reactors are currently being constructed in 11 countries, most notably China, South Korea, Japan and Russia, of which we have agreements to export uranium to three, excluding China. Construction is well advanced on many of them. Beyond those under construction, at least eight countries with existing nuclear programs have plans to build further new power stations. They are Finland, France, Russia, China, India, Pakistan, Japan and South Korea.</para>
<para>The International Atomic Energy Agency has significantly increased its projection of world nuclear generating capacity and now anticipates at least 60 new plants in the next 15 years. In addition, there is a program which, whilst currently stalled, will provide North Korea with two South Korean reactors, and Iran is well advanced with the construction of its first nuclear power reactor. It is of concern that a number of countries remain outside the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and equally of concern that some of those within it are not meeting their obligations. Yet there is no doubt that uranium will be supplied to plants in those countries from somewhere in the world, just as it will be supplied to plants in countries complying with non-proliferation obligations.</para>
<para>I therefore believe that every Australian should surely conclude that the best sources of uranium for nuclear power plants are those countries that take nuclear non-proliferation requirements seriously and have strict chain of custody procedures for uranium sales and bilateral agreements that deal with safe, peaceful and proper use of uranium and the disposal of its waste products. The failure of the recent United Nations conference to strengthen the nuclear nonproliferation treaty highlights the danger we face in driving the nuclear cycle underground and removing control of the nuclear materials trade from responsible nations and responsible companies. That is why Australia has an obligation. It must participate in the global debate about uranium mining and nuclear energy; there is no alternative. The risks of not doing so are too great for Australia and the world at large. Australia is fortunate in having abundant and relatively cheap natural gas, coal seam methane and high-quality clean coal resources to meet its domestic power needs today and for decades to come. Australia also has great potential to meet its domestic needs from renewable sources including solar, wind, geothermal and wave technologies.</para>
<para>Unfortunately, many countries are not as fortunate as Australia. This gives Australia an enormous competitive advantage and responsibility as a trading nation providing energy, energy technology and energy services to the global community. We are already a major exporter of clean coal and liquefied natural gas to the world, and we are undeniably a major exporter of uranium. It is clear that, with likely growth in nuclear power capacity around the world, our uranium will be in greater demand as will world uranium. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI would like to take the remaining time to talk about a young woman called Felicidade GutterresâI will call her Dade, for shortâwho stayed with me for 10 days some time ago. She comes from East Timor. Dade was active in East Timor in the period of unrest before the coming of independence. She came to Australia recently to learn about how we govern ourselves. The Friends of Manatuto, an organisation auspiced by the City of Kingston, is a small group of people in Kingston interested in East Timor which is developing a relationship with the village of Manatuto in East Timor. The Friends of Manatuto were approached for assistance for Dade and they were delighted to be able to help.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Dade arrived in Melbourne from Canberra one Saturday evening in April this year and she stayed for about 10 days. She spent some time with officers of the City of Kingston, observing how they provide the services that they do. Chelsea Rotary took Dade out one evening for dinner at the state parliament, where she met some of our local state MPs. Dade also spent some time in Geelong and two days with me, as I moved around my electorate and attended a womenâs health conference held in Melbourne. Dade is trying to find funds to get herself back to Australia to do some postgraduate studies in politics and policy development. Dade is very interested in getting herself involved in government in East Timor in the next elections to be held there.</para>
<para>It was very interesting to listen to Dade talk about her experiences before independence. She told me about hiding in the hills for weeks at a time, whilst Indonesian troops rampaged through the villages below. Dade talked about the day that she went to Dili to observe election proceedings. Her husband and her two sons were hiding. She handed her small daughter to the nuns at a nearby convent, with instructions that, should she not return, the nuns were to find her husband and hand her daughter over to him. I cannot imagine how that must feel when setting out for a dayâs work.</para>
<para>Dade said over and over again that Timor LâEste needs resources in almost every area. She saw the resources around us here in Parliament Houseâour library facilities and everything elseâas way beyond anything available in Timor LâEste. My contribution to Dadeâs stay in Melbourne was to provide her with accommodation in my home and this led us to spending quite some time together. I can only admire Dadeâs determination to learn and to take whatever skills and ideas she could back to Timor LâEste, her ongoing concern over many years for her own country and her determination and perseverance in what must be extremely difficult times.</para>
<para>The stark differences that Dade described brought home to me, once again, just what a lucky country Australia is and how we all should be doing all we can, wherever we are, to assist our neighbours. It also brought home to me the benefit of talking to somebody on a first-hand basis. We can read books and reports and listen to radio programs, but talking to somebody who has been there and experienced things for themselves is truly the best way to learnâshort of actually making a visit.</para>
<para>On a somewhat sadder note, I would like to speak of a problem that was raised with me by a constituent about the tutorial voucher system that exists. This womanâI will call her Ms Lâhas a son who recently did not do particularly well in his grade 3 reading program and is now entitled to a $700 voucher, promised by the government. At the end of April this year, my constituent rang the 1800 number that was advertised, but her call was not answered. She rang the number again; her call was not answered. She tried many times and ended up emailing the agency. She finally made contact with somebody. By then she was very frustrated. At that point she was advised that the computer screens were down, but her details were taken and she was assured that a suitable match would be made in due course. There was silence. There was no response for a long time, despite further attempts to telephone and get hold of an officer.</para>
<para>At the end of May, Ms L became very frustrated and approached me for some assistance. My office, again after lots of difficulty, finally got through and contacted the people running this program, and a gentleman there promised that he would put some priority on her request. But the point I want to make is that this is now two months later and we should not have to put a priority on this particular request. I do not understand why she was not processed properly and helped in the right way initially. Ms L is very concerned about her son and his reading ability and wants to provide him with the best help she can. She is totally frustrated by this seemingly senseless delay. I wonder too what the delay is. Is the scheme not being administered properly, or are there simply not enough tutors in the system to cope with demand? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âIn the remaining minute of the adjournment debate, I will conclude my earlier remarks. It is clear that, with the likely growth in nuclear power capacity around the world, uranium will be in greater and greater demand. This is reflected in the rising price of uranium in the market. Australia is one of the most responsible exporters of uranium in the world, requiring strict adherence to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and bilateral agreements relating to the peaceful and safe use of uranium. Olympic Dam in South Australia is the largest uranium deposit in the world and can be expanded almost limitlessly. Australia will therefore take advantage of the growth in uranium demand, as is the desire of the South Australian Labor government, and do it in a responsible way. It is time for all Australians to engage properly in a constructive and significant debate about the strategic importance of Australiaâs uranium resources not only for our nation but for the global community.</para>

<para>âI speak on behalf of 10 students from year 8 at Strath-field Girls High School who have written to me expressing their sadness and concern that, in the year 2005, the unthinkable ownership and trade of human slaves still exist in the world. National governments in African countries such as Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger either condone or do little to prevent slavery. I want to place on the parliamentary record one of the excellent letters concerning the grave plight of 43,000 slaves in the West African nation of Niger. I believe Miss Kareena Evans represents the concerns of all her classmates when she writes:</para>

We need to lobby the Australian government as well as overseas governments so that these vulnerable people can receive the support they deserve, in order for them to be freed from this harsh existence.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Anti-Slavery International works at local, national and international levels to eliminate slavery throughout the world. Anti-Slavery International was founded in 1839 and is the worldâs oldest international human rights organisation and the only charity in the United Kingdom to work exclusively against slavery and related abuses. In 2003 the excellent work of Anti-Slavery International achieved the first survey of slavery in Niger, which was conducted with its local partner in Niger known as Timidria. This led to the government of Niger introducing in May 2004 a new law against slavery with sentences of 30 years in prison for offenders.</para>

<para>âBefore the suspension I was saying that this led to the government of Niger introducing in May 2004 a new law against slavery, with sentences of 30 years in prison for offenders. According to Anti-Slavery International, over 200 slaves were freed. Tragically, in April this year the antislavery movement in Niger suffered a major setback when Nigerâs leading Timidria activists, Ilguilas Weila and Alassane Biga, were arrested in an effort to silence their fight against slavery. Their continued detention is alarming and raises very serious concerns about human rights in Niger.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">Despite thousands of people being enslaved across Niger, the government denies the existence of slavery in the country, reversing its earlier acceptance that it was a serious problem. This is a complete U-turn from its 2003 position, which has resulted in warnings to those who officially seek to release the slaves and the imprisonment of the key activists. I bring to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs my question No. 1705 on todayâs Notice Paper, and I ask him to explain what the Australian government is doing to raise international awareness of this issue and to assist Anti-Slavery International with its campaign. I congratulate the students and staff at Strathfield Girls High School on bringing this issue to my attention, and I encourage these young Australians to continue to speak out about this issue and support those who cannot help themselves. Well done, Strathfield Girls High School.</para>

<para>âI rise today to speak on the <inline ref="R2335">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006</inline> and related bills and the effects they will have upon the families in the Richmond electorate. The Howard government has failed the families of Richmond over the years on a whole range of different issues. This neglect continues across the board, particularly in the very key areas of health, aged care and training. Many of the welfare reforms are also unfair, creating a two-tiered system and attacking often the most vulnerable in our societyâthose who desperately need the assistance. The governmentâs tax package is very unfair, for the majority of families of Richmond will only get $6 a week while rich Sydney families reap the rewards. In regional areas like Richmond, people are really doing it tough and the government has been failing to provide the services that these people desperately need. This is the situation across the board in regional areas across Australia, but in my electorate particularly people are doing it tough. The government has failed on so many occasions to address those issues and the desperate needs of people.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">One of the major groups affected is elderly people, particularly in relation to their health. Within Richmond 20 per cent of people are aged over 65, one of the highest percentages in electorates throughout the country. Many people move to our area and retire there, so the needs of the elderly are absolutely foremost. The government has really missed an opportunity in this budget to assist many of the struggling pensioners. In fact, many of them will be worse off, for this budget launched the governmentâs attack on free prescription medicines which indeed puts the health of the elderly at risk. This is a major issue within the community, and many elderly people have approached me with their concerns about accessing prescription medicines. Thanks to the Prime Minister, pensioners will now have to wait until they use 54 scripts per year before they are entitled to free medicine. This will be going up to 60 by 2009. For elderly people who are sick and have to access pensions, this is a huge impost upon them and it is going to cause great crisis and havoc in their lives when they already have so many other health concerns.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The budget also breaks the Minister for Health and Ageingâs rock solid, ironclad promise on the Medicare safety net. This, of course, impacts on elderly people so much more because of their increased health needs. In 2004, 2.5 million people benefited from the Medicare safety net. Only 1.5 million people across the nation will reach the new thresholds of $500 for concession card holders and low-income earners and $1,000 for those not on concession cards. When this Medicare safety net promise was broken people across Richmond were outraged, particularly the elderly who desperately need to access the safety net. But whilst the health minister is breaking promises on Medicare he is doing nothing to solve the bulk-billing crisisâand it is a crisis within Richmond. Our bulk-billing rate is at 69.5 per cent, while the state average for New South Wales is 78.1 per centâand if we look at the Prime Ministerâs North Sydney electorate of Bennelong it is 78.4 per cent.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This is a major issue within the community. People constantly tell me about the difficulties of finding and accessing GPs who bulk-bill. They often have to drive long distances, and even if they find a GP there are often long waiting times to get in. People often have to make choices about whether to access health care that they desperately need. I know a lot of families who say that they have to weigh up choices about whether to buy groceries or to go to the doctor. Of course, if they have a young family and one child gets sick then all two, all three or all four of the kids get sick. The cost of having to go to the doctor is often just too much for these families. Instead they wait, and often the kids end up becoming a lot sicker. This is something I hear time and time again. It is just not good enough in these areas where we do have, as I have said, a lot of elderly people as well as a lot of young families.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As I said, the bulk-billing rate being at 69.5 per cent really adds to the financial pressure of families within Richmond. We have 10,000 families in Richmond who earn less than $500 a week. This is one of the lowest income earning areas in the country, and this health issue is causing ongoing strain for so many people. The lack of bulk-billing doctors and the broken promise on the Medicare safety net have hit the families of Richmond very hard, as well as the elderly and those on pensions. We have 13,000 seniors locally who are on fixed pensions. Not being able to access a doctor, apart from obviously affecting their health, affects their emotional wellbeing and causes them a great deal of distress.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">When we stop for a moment to look at the seniors and the elderly in our communityâand with 20 per cent of the Richmond population aged over 65 these are people whom I speak to on a daily basisâwe should realise that, after the lives they have lived, they deserve not only our respect but also the right to proper services. They are people who have worked and contributed to society, and keep contributing in the very valuable community work that they do. But they face so many problems. Many of them move to areas like Richmond, often away from their families. They often suffer a degree of depression and isolation because it is difficult for them sometimes to access community contacts if their families are living in faraway places. If one spouse becomes ill, they are in the situation where they have difficulty in accessing health care. So it was greatly disappointing that there were no measures to improve the provision of bulk-billing, particularly in an area like Richmond.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Another major area of concern is dental health. I am extremely disappointed that there is nothing in the budget for dental health. I am disappointed for a number of reasons. Under section 51 the Constitution it is in fact a Commonwealth responsibility, but the government scrapped the $100 million a year Commonwealth dental scheme in 1997. Just over a month ago, I started a petition calling on the federal government to restore federal funding to dental care because it is a major issue within the community that people approach me about constantly.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">More than 4,000 people in Richmond have signed the petition because they feel so strongly about this issue and they want so much to have federal funding restored to dental health. Recently the Leader of the Opposition was in Richmond where he met with three locals who have been on the waiting list for dental health. He met with Norm Masters, Jill Wainwright and Allan Green. Norm Masters is a lovely fellow. He has been waiting for more than two years to have his dentures repaired. He has been living in pain. He cannot eat properly and he experiences quite severe degrees of pain at times. Often when he is speaking, the dentures that he had put in fall out. Obviously, apart from the pain, there is also embarrassment. As I say, he has been waiting for over two years to have his dentures fixed. It is an outrageous situation when people have to live in pain and with embarrassment and shame.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Jill Wainwright was another whom the Leader of the Opposition met with. Jill has a broken tooth and has basically given up on accessing the public dental scheme after two years on the waiting list. It will cost her about $800 to get her tooth fixed. Jillâs story is a very common one. People do end up just giving up because they cannot wait any longer. In fact, an 80-year-old woman told me recently that she is waiting to get dentures, and she said, âI think Iâll be dead before I get my dentures.â She meant that, and it is an expression I hear from elderly people quite often.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Another person the Leader of the Opposition met with was Allan Green. It has cost Allan Green about $6,000 in dental care because he too gave up after waiting for a long time. These people have been able to afford that care but so many people cannot, and so they have given up and do not get their teeth fixed. When it comes to talking about dental care, it is not just about having your mouth in pain, being unable to eat or being distressed but also about how it affects your overall health. That your dental care does affect your overall health has been acknowledged on many occasions by the medical profession. So it is outrageous that we do not have the federal funding for the dental scheme to ensure that we can prevent a lot of illnesses, in terms of peopleâs overall health, that are caused by decaying teeth.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The minister for health has said in relation to Laborâs dental health scheme:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Keating governmentâs program did reduce waiting times, no doubt about that.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">If he has acknowledged that, why doesnât he restore the funding? Why doesnât he make sure that these elderly people do not have to wait in pain? This is a situation that I am sure exists across Australia. I have heard many people speak about it. It is a major issue in my electorate because of its large number of elderly people. That is the reason why, at this stage, we have had 4,000 people sign the petition, and more people are coming forward every day to sign it.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There are about only 240 public dentists to cater for more than 2.5 million health care card holders, children and the elderly. This compares with more than 3,000 private dentists to treat the rest of the population. I know the federal government will blame the states, but it is time to stop the buck-passing and fix the problem. It is a constitutional responsibility of the federal government; it is obligated to provide the funding for dental care and it is not meeting that obligation. I was very disappointed that dental care was not mentioned at all in the budget because it is a major concern for my electorate, as I am sure it is for all electorates across the country, particularly as our population ages. So I will keep calling upon the minister for health to restore that federal funding.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Another major issue in Richmond is aged care. Because of the large number of elderly people, aged care is a very pressing issue within the community. More funding is needed for aged care, and it needs to be spent in the right places. In the budget, 2,000 EACH packages were delivered Australia-wide for people suffering from dementia. This will barely touch the sides of what is needed to fill the gap, with the huge home-care waiting lists not just in the area of dementia but also in other areas.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Currently in Richmond there is a six- to seven-month waiting list for people to access home care. People have been assessed as needing home care but they have to wait six, seven and sometimes eight months to get it. So what are they doing in the meantime? They are suffering; they are not getting looked after and they are not coping. There are people like Ann from Banora Point who cannot walk, but she is not able to get home care at all. So she is struggling day by day and does not have the resources or family contacts to help her. Another woman from South Tweed, Aileen Cantoni, who is looking after her infirm mother and her disabled daughter, has difficulty accessing enough home care and respite care. She herself is not too well, yet she carries the burden of looking after both her ill mother and her disabled daughter. John, from Ocean Shores, is caring for his very infirm wife. He has just been told that he cannot get home care. He was told: âThere is no federal funding. You cannot get it. Tough. Thatâs the way it is.â</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The people who work in home care are fantastic. They struggle and they do a great deal, but they do not have the federal funding to be able to administer enough packages. The federal government has to provide more. I hear these stories every day. There is just not enough money for home care. Literally, hundreds and thousands of people are left out. They are suffering without the support that they need. I welcome the very limited number of home care places that were recently announced, but it is an exceptionally limited number. The number of places that have been provided in my electorate are far fewer than what is neededâthe need is desperate. More nursing home places are also needed. We have many people who are basically stuck in public hospitals because they cannot get a bed in a nursing home. That, of course, places pressure on the public hospitals.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In April I held an aged care summit and, without a doubt, home care was the major issueâlack of access to home care and the waiting times. So there is no doubt that in Richmond the local aged care system is in crisis, but the government has abandoned our elderly. As I said, 25 per cent of Richmondâs population is aged over 65, and that will be the percentage of over-65s in the national population in 40 years time. So we have to get it right on the ground in Richmond now. If you are looking 40 years into the future to see what the demographic change in the whole country will be, you can see it now in Richmond, where there is already a crisis because the government is not providing for the people living there. The government has missed an opportunity to fix the problems on the ground now in preparation for the future.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In relation to tax cuts, 10,000 families in Richmond earn less than $500 a week, the fourth highest number of any electorate in the country. And we have the fourth lowest median weekly family income, at just $654. But possibly the most shocking statistic is that 15.5 per cent of local children are living in poverty, which is outrageous. Most of the families in my electorate will miss out on a fair tax cut. While rich Sydney families will get $65 under the governmentâs proposal, most people in my electorate will get just $6. Where is the equity in that? Where is the fairness in that? The government will have an opportunity to give families in my electorate a fair go by voting for Laborâs $12 tax cut. I urge government MPs to join Labor in the fight for what is fair for their communities.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This yearâs budget also saw the creation of a two-tiered welfare system. Which side of 1 July 2006 a person with a disability or a single mother goes on to benefits determines the level of government assistance they receive. The government has created a system where people suffering from exactly the same disability will have different work and income obligations, and single mothers with the same needs will receive two different payments. This is an obvious display of the type of inequality we have come to expect from this governmentâsending the disabled and single parents back to work without providing training or child care. There are no jobs for these people to go to.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Local youth unemployment in Richmond is at 30.2 per cent and there were no initiatives from the government to rectify the problem; it is only adding to it. The government missed an opportunity to invest in skills and training. It has ignored the Reserve Bankâs warning about skills shortages, and local young people in Richmond are paying the price. The government is importing labour instead of addressing the skills crisis. We should be training Australians first and training Australians now.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Access to higher education is a major issue within my electorate. The government should not be increasing HECS fees for students. Students at Southern Cross University in my electorate were the first to be slugged with the governmentâs 25 per cent increase. In a regional area it is even harder to get to university than it is in a city area. You have got the added costs of travel, accommodation and relocation, and with a huge increase in HECS fees a lot of families are telling me that university is just not an option. It is not an option at all for their children. It is not even on their radar at all. And that is something that has changed from five years ago when it was an opportunity that people could take. They looked forward to a range of different opportunities they could move towards as they went through school. But, no, people say it is not even on the radar; it is not going to happen.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is a lack of employment and training opportunities for young people across Richmond. It is just outrageous that we are often losing people in regional areas because the government is doing nothing to provide the skills, the support services or the employment or training for these young people. These young people are our future, and in regional areas like Richmond we want to be able to keep them there. It is disappointing that the government has failed to invest in the future of the young people of Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We also have a lot of young families in Richmond, so child care is a very important issue. The government is forcing single parents back to work but not providing anywhere for their children to go. We only have one after school care centre in Tweed Heads. They do a fantastic job, but they just cannot take any more children at this stage because there is not adequate funding for after school care places. We are creating a new generation of latchkey kids, because this government does not value families.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">While the Treasurer attacks Labor for fighting for fairer tax cuts, he forces parents to wait up to two years for a promised 30 per cent rebate on child-care costs. We all know that costs within child-care centres have risen, but parents will not see that benefit for two years and they have got to carry that cost. The government also cannot tell families how they will be able to access the benefit. Despite all the recent advertising we have seen, there is a lot of confusion in the community about this. Will parents have to keep child-care receipts for two years? Will child-care centres have the burden of providing information? It is another case where the government does not value young families with young children.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There was no new money for the Pacific Highway. Twenty per cent of all fatalities on the Pacific Highway happen in Richmond. The highway itself stretches about 800 kilometres from Sydney to Brisbane. It has recorded an appalling 10,000 casualties, including 600 deaths, over the past decade. I believe very strongly in this issue. As a former police officer, I have attended many fatal and serious traffic accidents over the years. I believe it is imperative that the federal government give a lot more funding to roadsâparticularly in my area with the Pacific Highway running right through it. It needs to prioritise roads such as the Pacific Highway in this region.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The government has missed an opportunity to invest in our nationâs future. Locally, it has not provided for our seniors, our families, our children and our young people. It has failed to address the youth unemployment and skills crisis. There is no new money for our Pacific Highway. The inequities in this budget are stark. There is a $6 tax cut for low- and middle-income earners, including 10,000 families in Richmond who earn less than $500 a week. The government has also created a two-tiered welfare system. After nine years, the government is out of ideas on how to fix the problems its neglect has created. I will always be standing up for local families and fighting to make sure they get a better deal from this government because on so many fronts they have been let down.</para>

<para>âToday in the appropriation bills debate I wish to address a matter which has been raised with me by a number of people in my electorate. Perhaps the best way to illustrate it is to describe the experience of one constituent, Cath Green. Cath had her breast cancer detected at an initial free screening by BreastScreen at Kogarah. During the period of her treatment, she was referred to a private radiologist. At the time, Cath did not question this as she assumed there was a specific medical reason to do with the treatment. On making the appointment with the radiologist, she was informed that the mammogram and ultrasound would cost $314. Fortunately, Cath was in a position to meet the cost and later received a Medicare rebate of $164.60. The difference was $149.40, a considerable amount for many women already suffering from breast cancer and facing significant bills.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">There are two levels of screening available to women: initial screening, conducted free through BreastScreen; and diagnostic screening, generally conducted by a private radiologist via a doctorâs referral. Diagnostic mammograms are performed on women like Cath who have breast symptoms that need to be investigated, who have a history of breast cancer in the family or who are currently undergoing treatment. The diagnostic mammogram is performed via a doctorâs referral. I fail to understand why women who have suffered through breast cancer, usually at significant personal and financial cost, should not be able to claim a full Medicare rebate on a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. This is one area where this budget fails. It is a budget for the greedy at the expense of the needy. This is one example I am drawing to the attention of the parliament in this debate on the appropriation bills which I see as a lost opportunity by this government, which is interested not in decent policy but quick fix solutions.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The cost of a private radiologist is significant for many women, especially when the Medicare rebate they receive is slightly less than half the cost. This situation may lead to women choosing not to have a diagnostic mammogram, given that they have to find $300 or so and only receive a portion of that back as a Medicare rebate. At the last election, Labor proposed specialist outpatient clinics attached to public hospitals to help people get timely access to specialist care without expensive out-of-pocket costs. We proposed working in partnership with the states and territories to allocate additional funds to specialties and the hospitals where they are most needed to ensure that these services supplement those already provided. We propose reaching a national agreement on the circumstances under which services in outpatient clinics could be billed to Medicare. This kind of initiative would allow women requiring diagnostic imaging to receive the service under Medicare. This initiative should have been announced in this budget. At the very least, the government should ensure that the gap between the actual cost and the schedule fee does not continue to widen. The so-called solution of the safety net only serves to widen that gap.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is overwhelming clinical and statistical evidence that women who have had breast cancer are at greater risk of the cancer recurring. The BreastScreen New South Wales web site states:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">If a woman has been diagnosed with breast cancer previously, there is a greater risk of the disease recurring or developing in the other breast. Women who have had benign (non-cancerous) breast problems are also at an increased risk but to a lesser extent. It is very important for these women to have regular check ups with their doctor or specialist.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Why are these women being denied the appropriate level of Medicare funding to potentially save their lives? Information on the BreastScreen web sites indicates that women 70 years and over are low priority. This means they cease to receive reminders from BreastScreen New South Wales that they are due for a mammogram. I find it extremely disappointing that this is the case. The cost of a postage stamp could save womenâs livesâand I will come back later in this speech to deal with the priorities of this government. So you cannot get the cost of a postage stamp to help save the lives of women over 70, to give them a reminder, but we can get an increase in our communications allowance, which I will come to.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This matter was originally brought to my attention by my constituents Cath Green and the Mayor of Hurstville, Joanne Morris. Mayor Morris has since established a group of concerned people in the Hurstville City Council area. The mayor has also made representations to Minister Abbott, and the ministerâs response was extremely disappointing. He said, âYour views have been noted and your correspondence has been forwarded to the department.âÂ  We are left to wonder exactly what this may mean in actually doing anything. In her correspondence to me the mayor stated:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Medicare schedule is insufficient for these women [sufferers of breast cancer] to be able to access free mammograms through private providers. Indeed private providers have all but ceased to bulk bill for this service. Some of the larger hospitals in Sydney will do a free mammogram for women in this category with a referral from their doctorâbut this is inaccessible for most women in this state.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">A local petition has been organised and I have already tabled a number of these on behalf of my constituents, and I will continue to act on their behalf to take the matter up to the government. I do not deny the strains on the public purse, and the fact that not everything we want can be funded, but surely here is a case of government savings gone mad. As an additional cost on top of surgery, medicines, a prosthesis and a wig, going through the private system may well not be an option for some people. Even the partial cost of the mammogram can be a burden. If some women simply do not get around to it, then what is the cost to the health system?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This state of affairs is unacceptable. In the recent budget this government proposed funding of a million dollars over four years to support the development of Breast Cancer Network Australia, which aims to assistâand I quote from the budget papersââthe further development and dissemination of resources to help women newly diagnosed with breast cancerâ. This assists those women whose cancer has not been diagnosed early and is laudatory, but surely not enough, and surely a greater focus on the early detection makes more sense economically if from no other perspective.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Let me suggest some ways in which this government could find real money to ensure that women have access to the diagnostic tools they require for the early detection of breast cancer. As I said earlier, the policy at the moment is that the cost of a postage stamp cannot be found to send reminders to women over 70 that they should come back in for a check-upâthey are not in the specifically targeted groupâbut we have just had an announcement by the Special Minister of State, Senator Abetz, of an increase in our postage allowance. The current possible maximum for members of the House of Representatives is $4,171,200 per annum, if all members use their entitlements. That is running in effect for most members at that rate of $27,500 per year per electorate, with a slightly bigger increase to $30,800 for those in larger electorates. But we have now changed the formula so that we now get 50c per elector.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">That will mean that from 1 July 2005 the new maximum possible expenditure will be $6,606,413 per year. Therefore, if you do the mathematics, there is potential greater expenditure of $2,435,213 per annumâit is just red-hotâand over a three-year period in the parliament nearly $20 million for our postage. Is this postage cut off when an election is called? The proposal from this minister and the government is that they are going to cut off the rolls when an election is called, which will disenfranchise 80,000 voters. If they are going to allow the postage allowance to continue until the day before an election for members seeking re-election in the House of Representatives, that will be an absolute rort where basically they would be milking the public purse to help the re-election of government members, who have an overwhelming advantage in incumbency. Meanwhile, you cannot find the money for postage stamps to assist women over the age of 70 to go for a further check-up after the period has elapsed. And you can roll over for one year up to the maximum of your entitlement. I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that that money should not be able to be used when an election is called for the re-election of members of parliament. It is a rort which has been brought in by this government. It is milking the taxpayer. That is one area where you can find savings that could then go to save lives, not the jobs of members of parliament. It should be my job as a member seeking re-election to find my own money. In relation to dirty money, the government wants to raise the threshold of disclosure so that you do not have transparency in relation to donors. That is one area where millions of dollars could be saved.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">At the moment this is $2.4 million extra per year that could go to good policy, not to the policy of re-election of government members. The advantage is about incumbency because in Queensland, for instance, basically it will give the government a huge advantage. Government members will have an advantage of spending an additional amount of something like $947,354 per year compared to members of the opposition, $274,914. They will have their political advantage in Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. Meanwhile, potentially women will die because the government cannot afford the cost of postage to give them a reminder of their mammogram test.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The other rort where money could be saved is the printing allowance, which is now $125,000 per member per year. The government wanted to raise it to $150,000, but we knocked that off in the Senate. They could find all this extra money for a printing allowance, but we do not need $125,000 per year for a printing allowance to communicate with our electors. That is another area where I suggest we, as members of parliament, could take a hit to save lives. Allocate the money to good public policy, not to the re-election of members to this place. Again, if you do the figures, you will see that there is a significant advantage to government over opposition in any financial year when total printing expenditure by all members could come to $18,875,000, with an advantage to the government of $3,375,000. That is their priorityâlurks and perks for their members while members of the public are not able to get proper communication when it comes to procedures that can save their lives. That is another rort where the government could find savings for good public policy.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Then we have the Governor-General and the cost of renovations to Government House and Admiralty House. Budget Paper No. 2, at page 281, states that the government will provide $7.7 million over four years, including $3.4 million in expense funding, to support the implementation of the 10-year heritage property master plan for the repair, maintenance and development of the vice regal properties at Yarralumla and Kirribilli. There is a commitment to additional funding of $7.3 million, including $3.3 million in expense funding, beyond the forward estimates to 2014-15. So we are talking about $15 million.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">But that does not satisfy the Governor-General. The dogs are barking. The Governor-General wants more. He wants to renovate, in effect, the entrance area to Government House. This issue has become such an embarrassment to this government that it was not disclosed during questioning at Senate estimates hearings, despite the fact that it has gone down that pathway. It is too red-hot even for this government and so they are looking for ways to hide it. There is no transparency or accountability in that regard. There was extensive questioning in Senate estimates hearings, but the cost of refurbishing the entrance of Government House did not come up. That additional funding should not be made available.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The other area that is an absolute rortâI do not speak on behalf of my party in this regard but for myselfâis the Life Gold Pass. I believe that the time for the Life Gold Pass is over. It is a rort that is not available to other workplaces. I do not mind it being made available to ex-Prime Ministers who are called upon to go and make speeches and do a whole series of other things. What this is costing the taxpayer every six months is red-hot. I do not have a problem with members of parliament getting a decent pension. My problem is the extension of the Life Gold Pass to those members of parliament who serve the required period. From 1 January to 30 June 2003 it cost $432,071.08. I am not going into matters in relation to the Prime Minister. I have a real problem with the extension of the Life Gold Pass to the widows of Life Gold Pass holders who were not ex-Prime Ministers. My views on this practice are not my partyâs policy, but this practice is bringing the parliament and parliamentarians into disrepute. From July to December 2003 it cost $383,529.39 and from January to June 2004, $341,304.48. With the greatest of respect, it is an entitlement that has had its use-by date.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I know I am not going to make myself popular with members of the government, or some of the members of my own party, but I am not here trying to run a populist campaign. It is a matter of principle. I cannot see why public policy grounds require that we fund ex-members of this place to fly around this country first class, at taxpayersâ expense, for many years beyond their leaving this parliament. I can understand funding them to come to official functions and for limited travel for a certain period, when ministers have to clean up and do certain things. I am not going to go to ex-members of this place and say that ex-members of the government are worse than ex-members of the opposition. They are all the same. They are using legitimate entitlements. On public policy grounds, this entitlement should be sacrificed. It will yield more than half a million dollars on an annual basis for ex-members of parliament that could go to good public policy.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The public purse is not unlimited; there are limited funds around. Since the budget we have been having the debate about tax cuts. I agree with our policy. Why should I get a $65 tax cut when someone more needy only gets $6? We have put up an alternative tax schedule and it is significant that in all the time since the budget was delivered this government has not punched a hole in that schedule. It is deliverable. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will remember that the former Labor government, in its 13 years of office, delivered six tax cuts that saw the top tax rate go from 60c to 47c in the dollar and from 32c to 20c in the dollar at the lower end, so substantial savings were delivered to taxpayers at the higher end of the salary range. But there comes a time in good public policy terms when you have got to share it, and I am saying thatÂ  we as existing and former members of parliament should take a hit in significant areas of the public purse when it comes to finding the money to go to the services and good public policy that is going to save lives. The reason I put the savings up, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that, as you know, if you want to fund a program you must find the savings plus the efficiency dividend. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI look at the federal budget and wonder where the government is living. I do not believe it is really living in reality. When a government so cynically offers a measly $6 tax break to those on low incomes while pocketing a tax break of around $65 per government member, it seems to me to be a poor result for most Australians. There are many other issues in these appropriation bills that make me want to squirm, but the inadequate tax cut is just a nonsense. From my point of view as the member for Lyons, where we have a lot of elderly people who have retired, many young people who are still searching for their first job and many who are single parents, this budget gives absolutely nothing. You cannot get a tax cut if you do not earn anything, so I am not impressed by the so-called windfall for most Australians. It is no more than five litres of petrol anyway and people will need that to struggle off to work. As Centrelink is cutting any help to enable someone to go for a job interview, those that are looking for work will certainly need that to get to an interview.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">This debate also gives me an opportunity to ask a number of reciprocal questions about the sorts of programs that are being funded: who those funds are going to, what the government are trying to achieve and what sort of effect these programs are having on ordinary people. The newsletter of the new member for Bass appeared as part of the <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> newspaper in Tasmania recently, although it did not appear under an âAdvertisementâ headline, so I presume that it is now acceptable, as part of Rural Press policy, for members of parliament to be allowed to use its newspaper as a wrap-around for Liberal propaganda. But then money always talks the loudest and the cost of this would be a mere drop in the ocean compared to the amount of government advertising that went on during the election campaign. The main theme throughout this newsletter is how much money the member for Bass is giving away or, rather, how much the government has handed to him and is continuing to hand to him while he is the new blue-eyed boy. There is nothing on how a particular program is helping to develop a better life for Tasmanians as a whole and nothing on how he is going to assist in providing a decent Medicare system that allows pensioners to get off waiting lists. He does not talk about how we can develop training programs to go with the Work for the Dole scheme that will give people real jobs at the end of their training; nor does he mention the ridiculous shortage of skilled labour and how it has taken nine years to realise that we might have a problem.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Perhaps the main issue that needs to be addressed is that of the program that is going to be set in place after 1 July, when the Senate is going to be on the governmentâs side. We have already had hints about what the government and John Howard have in mind for industrial relations, and it grieves me that there is so little understanding in government circles about why having a healthy trade union sector is so important to the stability of a country. Do we really want to go back to the times when employers and employees were perpetually at loggerheads, when trust and enthusiasm had gone out the window, when the system was adversarial rather than based on consensus and when there was no bottom line? It will lead to massive problems, especially in the lower end of the wage scale. The main plank of the Liberalâs policy is to introduce Australian workplace agreements, the so-called AWAs. The other contentious development will be the removal of small business unfair dismissal laws.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I am going to tell a story now about a real person, but I will not mention the site or the industry. It is the sort of person who will be targeted. He is a man working in an industry covered by the Australian Workers Union, who usually cover lower paid blue-collar workers. He is a 37-year-old father of two and he and his workmates are among 250,000 Australian workers on AWAs. While covering only three per cent of the work force, these agreements have become a defining area of difference between Labor and Liberal in this country. I will call this man Peter, and this is his first experience of the AWA process. When he started his job three years ago his workmates were already covered by AWAs. When the agreements expired last year, management decided to offer new AWAs. Each one was not meant to last more than three years.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The first problem was that management delayed the introduction of the new agreement for months, during which time no-one received a pay rise. They just did not negotiate a new one, and therefore there was no opportunity to negotiate a pay rise or discuss any other issue that they wanted to raise. Although he and his mates made continual requests to do so, nothing was done until finally the staff were taken into a roomâall the workers and the management togetherâand they sat down and went through the agreement with everyone in the room. Despite having tried to negotiate with the company, the individual had no success and was forced into signing an agreement that was patently no different from the last agreement. In fact, it was seeking to trade off other entitlements without any gains to the employees. The work was the same and the hours were the same, yet the cost of living had gone up. These workers were trying to do the right thing, trying to keep their employerâs business improving. Of course, we know that if there is a downturn in the economy in their particular industry these workers will be paid off and sacked.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This is how the government is going to increase productivity in this country. It is going to do it by forcing down peopleâs wages and conditions. It will increase productivity by the lowest common dominator that any country can ever use to try to achieve itâby forcing wages down and making people work for less. It is a pity that while Australia has a good surplus, mostly achieved by measures put into place before 1996âincluding some of the work that you did in your time, Mr Deputy Speaker McMullanâthis budget has missed many opportunities to set up an economy for the next generation and to provide a basis for sustainable growth and shared prosperity.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Instead we have a situation where the majority of the population loses out. But there is an alternative: Labor is a clear alternative. We approach the budget process quite differently. We want to plan for higher productivity and participation, to provide fairness in our approach to all workersâwhether they are low-, medium- or high-income earnersâand we wish to change the direction of leadership to provide our nation with more skills and develop infrastructure for the future. I am inclined to agree with Evan Thornleyâs article in last weekendâs <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> in which he stated:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Labor is the party of investment and the conservatives are the party of consumption. We create the wealth and they spend it.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">When you look at this budget and the surplus that was there and the spending that went on during the last election, you have only got to think about it to see it is a true statement.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Take the difference between the economic picture at the time Keating left office and today. This government is spending money like it is going out of fashion. But what is being achieved with this shopping spree? Labor made all of the changes, as was pointed out by our shadow minister Mr Stephen Smith when he said that it was Labor who floated the dollar and opened Australia up to competition of the global economy by bringing down the tariff levels. We reformed the tax system by cutting high marginal tax rates and corporate tax while closing down loopholes and minimising unfairness and inefficiencies in the tax system. We deregulated communications, aviation and the financial services sector, encouraging competition in those areas. We transformed the Australian industrial relations system from the adversary, inflationary and strike-ridden system in place when the Prime Minister of this country was the Treasurerâthat was what he passed on to the Labor governmentâto one based on enterprise and productivity based gains, cooperation and consultation. Further, Labor introduced an ambitious package of micro-economic reforms through the national competition policy.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Labor in the eighties and early nineties achieved far more than this government has done. Now it wants to spend the results of these hard-won and strategic changes to our economy. Instead, this budget should have seized an historical opportunity given to the government to invest in Australiaâs future and confront the long-term threats to this economy. Australiaâs economic commentators are urging this government to show national leadership on investment and infrastructure. As our leader has so rightly pointed out, that means investing in our economyâs growth capacity, building a highly skilled work force and an advanced competitive economy. Australiaâs greatest asset is not in our mines, our stock markets or our buildings; it is in our peopleâhardworking Australiansâand nothing gives us better prospects for long-term productivity and prosperity than investing in working Australians. We also need to keep the nationâs infrastructure in good repair. Our transport and communications networks must be set up and be up to scratch so that Australiaâs businesses can seize opportunities for growth and investment.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I do not see any evidence of these goals being achieved. Funds are being spent at an alarming rate on the most futile of objectives. Those who have it get more and those who have not got it get bugger-all. Labor believes that a strong economy and a fair society reinforce each other. Our nation has grown on developing its fair society, built from a strong economy. This is what our leader was talking about when he spoke of investing in our people, which is our biggest asset.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Training and employment are the key to maintaining our lead in all sorts of different areas. If we are to continue to develop a fairer and inclusive society, we need to have strong jobs growth. This provides us with a good tax base. It can start with simple things, like providing training with the Work for the Dole payments, at least giving people a chance to participate in the work force in the first place. It is now vital to obtain skills before you even go to an interview. At the moment people spend hours doing meaningless tasks or never going beyond those tasksânever gaining the skills they need to sell to an employer.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">If the government is serious about developing productivity gains rather than just cutting wages and conditions, which is all we see from its present line, the whole country has to be smarter. We need to ensure that all young people have the same chance to succeed. They must have equal access to education, training and skills development. If we are to build on our economic strengths with fairness, we need to invest in our nationâs infrastructure. We need to develop the skills of our work force and we need to encourage the nationâs research and developmentâsomething that was knocked off in 1996 by this government. The government is not doing these things. It is squandering our hard-earned taxes and letting go of the opportunities that have been created in this country.</para>

</talker>
<para>âI am pleased to speak on the appropriation bills. There are a number of issues that I will be raising but, before turning to the substance of my address, I refer to the recent meeting of the Council of Australian Governments. A very important step was taken at that meeting, I believe, by the government and the states in relation to the care of young people with disabilities who are currently housed in what many would consider inappropriate facilitiesâthat is, nursing homes. That was a positive move at the Council of Australian Governments meeting, but I would encourage the government and the states not to leave it at that level.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">This is a critical issue to many people. It is one of those issues that, I am pleased to say, a committee within my electorate has been working on for quite some time. It has been trying to develop a model which is appropriate for those young people who have various forms of disabilities who, because of the accommodation set-up in this country, are being inappropriately housed. I encourage the Prime Minister to move forward on this issue. He has the support of many people. Even though the number of people who are impacted by this circumstance is not large and these people will not determine the outcome of elections, it is an important issue that probably highlights the way in which we judge our societyâhow we handle and care for those who are less fortunate than ourselves, including of course older people in our community.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">An issue I would raise that relates directly to the appropriation bills is the program commonly known as Regional Partnerships and some subsidiary programs that relate to the funding arrangements that the government has put in place. I would like to take the opportunity to bring to the attention of the House some new developments on this issue. Most people are fully aware that the Senate is currently conducting an inquiry into various matters in relation to the Regional Partnerships program: some of the political commentary, the political ties that were made in relation to funding arrangements, the political commitments that were given subject to certain arrangements being undertaken by various groups and, what seems to be a fairly common process now, the breach of process that was set up. There are a number of things I will allude to.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I am not opposed to the Regional Partnerships program. My concern in all of this has been that this program has been set up with a set of guidelines that has not been adhered to from time to time in some projects that have been considered for Regional Partnerships funding. I will mention a few of those a little later in my speech. There are some new developments in the inquiry that is going on. It is appropriate at this time to bring those things to the attention of the House. As most members would be aware, I had a number of meetings with Mr Greg Maguire, a witness at the hearings, about a year ago. There has been much debate on that and I will not go back over all those issues. Mr Maguire did give certain undertakings when he was interviewed by the Senate inquiry that he would return to the inquiry certain matters of evidence that he was unable to provide on that day. I will read some of those matters into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The first matter I refer to relates to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of Thursday, 10 March 2005, page 27. I think it is appropriate that I read a number of exchanges between some of the senators and Mr Maguire because it leads to the integrity and truthfulness of the witness. Part of what the inquiry into Regional Partnerships and associated matters is about is the integrity of process as well as the integrity of the people involved. The <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reads:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Senator CARR</inline>âMr Maguire, in your opening statement you said âMy companies have made substantial financial donationsâ to Mr Windsor. What is the extent of those substantial financial donations?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Mr Maguire</inline>âI believe they are a private matter.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Senator CARR</inline>âUnfortunately, under the laws of this country they are not private.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Mr Maguire</inline>âNo. You can find them. The Electoral Commission will have documentation onâ</para>
<para pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Senator CARR</inline>âI have had a look at the declarations and I do not see a name on them. I am wondering how that might be.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Mr Maguire</inline>âThat is because it would be under a company name.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Senator CARR</inline>âWhich companies?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Mr Maguire</inline>âI do not think it is necessary that I sit here before you telling you that I put money into Tony Windsorâs campaign. I have said in my opening statement that I have done so.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Senator CARR</inline>âMr Maguire, the reason I have asked you this question is thatâ</para>
<para pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Mr Maguire</inline>âYou have the statement. You have the New South Walesâ</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦</para>
<para pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Senator CARR</inline>âYou have raised the question. I am not trying to be difficult with you. You have raised this issue. You have stated bluntly in your evidence that you have made substantial financial donations to Mr Windsor. I cannot find them in the declarations. Any donation over $200 is required by law to be declared. Has there been an error somewhere or have you misled the committee?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Mr Maguire</inline>âI have not misled the committee. You do not have the documents there for the New South Wales government.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Senator CARR</inline>âI see. That helps me further.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Mr Maguire</inline>âLet me have a go. The documents would show that my companies have donated. I also have donated in terms of putting funds into Mr Windsorâs campaign under my companiesâ names. That could be under one of several companiesâ names and I do not believe it is necessary for me to tell you the names of those companies.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Senator CARR</inline>âAre you saying that you gave support to Mr Windsor while he was a member of the New South Wales parliament?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Mr Maguire</inline>âYes. That is correct.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Senator CARR</inline>âSo you have not done so while he is a member of the federal parliament?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Mr Maguire</inline>âHe has only been elected to the federal parliament once whilst I have been supporting him. I did not support him at the last election.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">That last sentence contradicts Mr Maguireâs recent letter back to the inquiry suggesting that he did assist in the 2004 election. So he is saying in evidence that he did not support and he is saying in evidence that he did assist. The fact is that he did not assist at all. There has never been a financial donation from Mr Maguire to any of my campaigns. I would urge the Senate inquiry to look much closer at those particular issues that have been raised.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The second area where I would like to refer to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the Senate inquiry is on page 48 of the hearing on Thursday, 10 March:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Senator OâBRIEN</inline>âI have questions on another matter that I want to pursue. Senator Carr asked about donations to Mr Windsorâs 2001 campaign. You have effectively declined to nominate the companies that made those donations. Can you tell us whether those companies have complied with the law in declaring the donations?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The response is very important:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Mr Maguire</inline>âYes, they would have.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Mr Maguire has responded to the Senate inquiry by way of letter. He has not mentioned the names of those companies. He says in evidence that he has 37 companies and that he would let the inquiry know what those companies were and how those donations were made. The question that needs to be asked is: if those donations were madeâand it is completely news to me if they wereâwhy were they not declared to the Electoral Commission?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In other parts of his evidence Mr Maguire says that over the years he has given something like $3,000 to $5,000 at most of my election campaigns. I was elected in 1991, 1995, 1998, 2001 and 2004. There is no evidence of any contribution under the Electoral Act that has been declared by Mr Maguire. So I call on the Senate inquiry while they are in Tamworth on the 29th of this month to bring Mr Maguire before the inquiry. Many members would not recognise that this is one of the few inquiries where evidence is given under sworn oath, and it is obvious from the evidence that Mr Maguire has givenâhis own evidenceâthat he is contradicting some of his own facts in this inquiry. I would urge the inquiry to look very closely at these matters and to call Mr Maguire.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Mr Maguire challenged this inquiry when he was in Canberra: âBring the inquiry to Tamworth,â he said. Mr Maguire also gave commitments that he would give details of his company names. He has not done that. He would have an opportunity on 29 June to do so. He said he would give documentation of donations that were made to my campaigns. He has not done that. The fact is that there is no evidence of such. Mr Maguire gave me some advice in 2001 about the placement of advertising slots. There has never been a financial contribution made. Mr Maguire has lied under oath before a Senate inquiry. I think that treatment of the Senate, of the inquiry and of the particular nature of this inquiry as one under sworn oath is something that really needs to be investigated.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On the broader issue, in terms of the way in which some of these issues have been played out, I think the Auditor-General should investigate the report that will come out in August from this inquiry as to the money trails, the background of some of these witnesses, the veracity of their evidence and their ability as individuals to give truthful evidenceâand I think some of that has been highlighted today. I have absolutely no problem opening any of my campaign books to the scrutiny of any inquiry that may take place, but I do believe that Mr Maguire needs to back up the statements that he made under oath before the Senate inquiry: that he made donations that would have been under company names. It would also be important for Mr Maguire to shine some illumination on the companies which are owned by Gregory Kevin Maguire, and other companies owned by Gregory Kenneth Maguire, both born on the same day in the same hospital. Are they, as a search that I have done indicates, the same individual? Does that have anything to do with the significance of some of the evidence? Does this person have two names that he is trading under, and is that a way of manoeuvring the truth in relation to which Maguire is answering which questions before the Senate inquiry?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Another matter I would like to raise in relation to the Regional Partnerships program goes to another issue. I think it gets to the heart of some of the issues where the government, particularly the Deputy Prime Minister and the parliamentary secretary, are trying to cover the path in terms of the processes that have been abused in relation to Regional Partnerships. I think the Senate inquiry will be interviewing the Chairman of the New England North West Area Consultative Committee while in Tamworth, and I appreciate that. But I see that the chairman, Kevin Humphriesâand it is no secret that Mr Humphries is to be the successor to Mr Anderson in the seat of Gwydir, so he will be showing great loyalty to Mr Anderson in this particular matterâreplied on 3 February to the committee concerning the area consultative committeeâs role in relation to the University of New England national centre for maths and science. Previously, many in this House would have presumed that the project was funded out of the Regional Partnerships project arrangement. Normally, under the due processes, the area consultative committee would have a role in the process of feeling out the various issues and determining whether it was appropriate that it be funded or not. Mr Humphries said in his letter to the committee:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The project and associated fundingâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">that is, the University of New England maths and science centre, a $4.95 million project, and a good project with which I had some involvementâ</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">is not listed on our website. The projects listed on our website are to demonstrate the project capabilities, achievements and successes of the New England North West Area Consultative Committee. The Maths, Science, ICT project was not a project that we were involved in during its development or any of the funding process, except for comments we were asked to provide as above.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Strange as it may seem, on 29 November 2004, heading up the project archive of this very same area consultative committee under âProjects funded 2003-04â, guess what we see? The National Centre for Science, Information Technology and Maths Education for Rural and Regional Australia has funding of $4.95 million. There is also a project description listed. If we fast forward to 24 January 2005âthat is, after this inquiry was startedâwe suddenly find that âProjects funded 2003-04â is headed up by the CWA Gunnedah Branch Building Extension. The maths and science centre has been airbrushed off the web site of the area consultative committee. I urge the committee to look into the various comments I have made today.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Mr Maguire said in evidence to the Senate inquiry that an inducement was made to me by him. He has admitted that there was the possibility of âjobs for the boysâ or an overseas posting. He suggested that I go and talk to John Anderson. That was within a few days of his having spent, on his admission, an hour and a halfâI believe it was longer than thatâwith the Deputy Prime Minister and Senator Sandy Macdonald discussing, amongst other things, the Regional Partnerships program and the future of the New England electorate. I believe there is evidence of contempt. I think the Senate inquiry, the Auditor-General and the parliament ought to look very closely at it, given the very special nature of the way in which evidence was accepted by the Senate inquiryâunder sworn oath, which is not the normal way that Senate inquiries operate within this particular parliament.</para>

<para>âAs part of this debate on appropriations, I would like to make some comments on some issues within the sport portfolio. I would particularly like to focus on an issue which I think will be of growing importance into the future, and that is the involvement of women in sport. In May 2003, when opening a national forum on the need for more women in sport, Minister Rod Kemp said:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Ensuring optimum involvement of women on and off the field makes good business sense for sport.</para>
</quote>
<para pgwide="yes">â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Sport needs to harness the skills and knowledge of as many women as possible.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">But what has happened since? Last year the government launched its women in sports leadership grants program, with $400,000 going to 192 recipients. That is a welcome initiative, well-received by the community. However, apart from this token action, what else has the government done to promote the greater involvement of women in sport? The situation has not changed. Visit most sporting venues across Australia and you will see on the walls countless photographs of male sporting champions but rarely will you see photographs of the women who have actively supported the club behind the scenes for decades as volunteers, coaches, team managers, scorers, timekeepers, committee members, fundraisers and in many other roles. One could argue that this is not unexpected, as most of the sporting facilities scattered across our nation are largely bastions of male sport.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Of course, this is not universal. There are many tennis, golf, bowls and a wide range of other sports clubs where male and female contributions are recognised. Whether they are recognised equally is another question, but at least in some sporting venues women do get some recognition, even if it is somewhat secondary to the recognition given to their male counterparts. But this secondary treatment of women in sport is not confined to the local level. How many members can remember seeing a review of <inline font-style="italic">Beyond the limits</inline>, Nicole Jefferyâs account of Australian hockey champion Alyson Annanâs remarkable career, when it was released last year? Not too many. To my knowledge, it was only reviewed in one Australian newspaperâand, even then, only in passing. I would like to read from the review because it raises some very interesting questions about the way women in sport are portrayed:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">At a time when lucrative publishing contracts seem standard issue for all new members of the Australian cricket team, you would think a biography of the worldâs greatest player in a sport would attract serious attention.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">You would be rightâunless you were thinking about womenâs hockey, and Alyson Annan.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Some would say cricket is one of the most popular games, to play and to watch, in this country while hockey is played by fewer people and is less watchable. Perhaps, but letâs remember how few countries play Test cricket.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Australian cricket team has been remarkably successful in the past decade, but so have the Hockeyroos, who won Olympic gold in 1988 (Seoul), 1996 (Atlanta) and 2000 (Sydney), the World Cup in 1994 and 1998 and the Champions Trophy in 1993, 1995 1997 and 1999.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Annan was the International Hockey Federationâs player of the year in 1998 and 2000, and has been a finalist in the world sportswoman of the year run by the Womenâs Sports Foundation.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Teammates and opponents say she does things on a hockey field they have never seen from any other player.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Her story has been told recently in <inline font-style="italic">Beyond the Limits</inline> â¦ by Nicole Jeffery, an award-winning sports journalist for <inline font-style="italic">The Australian</inline> who covered the past three Olympic Games.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Despite Annanâs achievements and Jefferyâs pedigree, you are reading the first review of <inline font-style="italic">Beyond the Limits</inline> in an Australian newspaper.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Womenâs sport, it seems, still does not rate as highly as menâs sport. Or, it doesnât without a sex scandal. After the Sydney Olympics, Channel Nineâs <inline font-style="italic">Sixty Minutes</inline> program ignored the world-beating Hockeyroos until they got wind of a story that Annan had left her husband for a woman (Carole Thate, captain of the Dutch hockey team).</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The American journalist Janet Malcolm has written: âThe narratives of journalism, like those of mythology and folklore, derive their power from their firm, undeviating sympathies and antipathies. Cinderella must remain good and the stepsisters bad. âSecond stepsister not so bad after all,â is not a good story.â</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">A gay woman hockey player clicks into the Lego set story kit produced by <inline font-style="italic">Sixty Minutes</inline>. A group of supremely talented, fit women whose ferocity and obsession with their hockey thoroughly unnerved opponents (according to Carole Thate as reported by Jeffery) is not a good story.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Hereâs an even less good story: there is an argument, supported by statistics compiled by Australiaâs doyen of Olympic historians, Harry Gordon, that Australian women have consistently and substantially outperformed Australian men at the Olympics.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The menâs hockey team, while often highly rated, has not won Olympic gold.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">This article was written prior to the last Olympics when, good on them, the men did win gold.</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Imagine that: a nation of sports-mad macho blokes outdone by a bunch of sheilas.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I read that article into the record to make some points about how you can view some of these issues, although I would not necessarily agree with all of what is in the review. It does raise some very interesting points. Jefferyâs book never got the same boost as books about male sports stars such as Mark Waugh or Shane Warne inevitably receive from the media. It never got into the top sellers list, not because Annanâs story was not worth telling but because it did not get the attention it deserved. Why? Because it was about a female champion in a sport which most Australians think about only when the Olympic Games or Commonwealth Games come about.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The profile of womenâs sport in Australia remains a blight on our proud hsitory of sporting achievement. Interestingly, much of our international sports history has been built on the basis of female champions. Most Australians can name female Olympic champions such as Dawn Fraser, Cathy Freeman, Betty Cuthbert, Marjorie Jackson, Jane Flemming, Shane Gould and Tracey Wickham much less Murray Rose or even Kieren Perkins. In sports such as tennis and golf the reverse probably applies, with Greg Norman far better known than Karrie Webb or Pat Cash being remembered more than, say, Yvonne Gooligong.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Irrespective of the sporting context, the fact of the matter is that we have a national sporting tradition built on a concept of masculinity, but in reality women have made an equal if not more important contribution to our international sporting reputation. Given this situation, why is it that womenâs sport is so poorly supported by both the government and the private sector? Womenâs sport cannot attract the same level of sponsorship as menâs sport. It is easy to blame this situation on the media, particularly television and the poor coverage given of womenâs sport, but it is not as simple as this. Some sections of the mediaâmainly the print mediaâare giving more coverage to womenâs sport today than ever before, but more still needs to be done.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The government needs to get more active in supporting womenâs sport and promoting the role women play in sport both on the field and off it. Women need help from the government to get a better go. To give an example, it is estimated that each of the members of the menâs Australian cricket team earns more than $1 million per year. When Australiaâs women cricketers returned to Australia from South Africa in April this year, having cruised undefeated to their fifth World Cup title, it was back to work. The players have real jobs. In fact, it is only since womenâs cricket has been integrated with Cricket Australia that women have had all of their overseas travel expenses covered. While this represents some progress, it is still a very poor situation.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Womenâs sport needs investment in facilities across Australia and more money put into encouraging young women to participate in sport and to continue that participation as they grow older. At the last election, Labor pledged to commit $2.4 million over four years to re-establish a womenâs sports unit within the ASC. We made this commitment because we believe it is essential that something be done to improve equity for women in both community based and elite sport. We are also committed to raising the status and profile of female athletes in the eyes of Australians. If we can achieve this, perhaps some of the financial support that flows from the private sector to male sports can be redirected to womenâs sport.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">While women have made some gains in recent years, they remain underrepresented in most areas of sport. They also remain underrecognised and underresourced. Labor is committed to changing this situation. Labor believes that a dedicated unit that works with industry to break down the barriers and improve access opportunities for women in sport is essential to achieve a genuine acceptance of women in sport, particularly in advanced coaching, administration and officiating roles. A womenâs sport unit could have a significant role to play in creating a safe and supportive environment for all female participants by developing strategies to eliminate all forms of harassment and abuse in sport. In line with its commitment to womenâs sporting opportunities, Labor has also committed to the restoration of the Prime Ministerâs Women in Sport Award, which was scrapped by the Howard government.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">A lot more can be done and a lot more should be done in this area. It makes good sense for governments to look at this and for industry to see what can be done. At a conference in 2003 on this issue, some comments were made about the issue of the good business sense of involving women. An article in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> of 21 May 2003 stated:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">It made smart business sense to have more women involved at all levels of Australian sport, a national forum for the industry heard yesterday.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Speaking at Sport Needs More Women, the Australian Sports Commissionâs chief executive officer Mark Peters said that attention needed to be drawn to womenâs success in general business.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">âResearch shows that businesses owned and operated by women have higher survival rates and tend to make a profit earlier than new businesses started by men,â Peters said.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Much of this had to do with womenâs management styles, he said, citing rugby league as an example of a sport increasingly turning to women coaches at the junior level.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">âThey have a more inclusive style, well-honed negotiating skills, excellent organising and budgeting abilities and a natural gift for communication with both the kids and the parents,â Peters said.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">He said business in general survived and thrived by seeking out new markets and developing strategies for tapping those markets.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">âFor the sports industry, even a rudimentary analysis of the market would tell them that to achieve greater long-term sustainability and viability, they need more women involved at all levels,â he said.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">âNot just in playing, but in administration, marketing, coaching and officiating.â</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Peters said that ASC data for between 1999 to 2000 showed that 24.6 per cent of women over the age of 18 took part in organised sport and physical activities, compared with 33.3 per cent of men.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The data also showed last year that 10 women, compared with 50 men, were at executive director level in national sporting organisations, and the statistics for other senior positions were similarly disproportionate, Peters said.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I think that article makes some very relevant points about the question of why it is important that we try to expand the involvement of women in sport across the board. It goes to the question of not only being able to make those sports run better but also being able to ensure that we get a wider participation in organised sport across genders. There is a range of issues related to this question of what to do to try to make it easier for women to be involved in sport, and there has been quite a bit written about that. An article from a publication citing the <inline font-style="italic">ASC National Policy on Women and Girls in Sport, Recreation and Physical Activity, 1999-2000</inline> states:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">So how do we tailor sports to suit the needs of women and to keep them involved as lifelong participants? As with any particular target group, it is important to investigate what women and girls want from their sporting experience, rather than assuming we already know. If there are certain issues that are preventing females from being involved in sport or physical activity, then naturally these need to be addressed.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The following issues have been identified as limiting female participation in sport and physical activity:</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Lack of childcare facilities</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Uncomfortable or revealing uniforms/clothing</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Amount of time involved</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Too competitive</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Poor perception of their ability</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Poor body image</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">So there is quite a bit that can done and quite a bit that should be done. This is something that we ought to be looking at from the governmental point of view as to what we can achieve in improving the way we manage sport in this country and improving the outcomes we can get in the wider community. When we look at sports like netball and hockey, we can see that our women are up there with the very best in the world. You have only to go along to some of their eventsâand I know from going along to see one of the netball tests some months agoâto see that they work very hard and that they are incredibly professional, given the time they can dedicate to their sport and given what else they have to do to support themselves in the meantime. I would certainly commend any members who get the opportunity to go out there and have a look at what women are doing in these areas and they will see that there is more that we as a parliament should be doing to try and assist them to do the very best they can for our country.</para>

</talker>
<para>âI take this opportunity today to outline some of the failings that I see in the Howard governmentâs 2005 budget, particularly how it is framed in terms of the needs of people in my electorate. A budget tells us a lot about a government. It tells us about a governmentâs priorities, its values and its vision for the country. And so it was with this latest budget. Unfortunately, it told us what we already knew about this government: its priorities are looking after its rich mates and making life harder for those already facing disadvantage, while its vision never goes beyond scoring political points.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">There is nothing in the budget that demonstrates an appreciation of the challenges facing our country or of the investment that is required to set us up for the future. This is a budget which proves again the short-sightedness of the Howard government. Of course, it is a budget which offered middle-income earners a tiny $6 a week tax cut while providing high-income earners with 10 times that amount.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It should be noted that, even with the $22 billion to be spent on personal tax cuts in the budget, the government is still up there as the highest taxing government in Australiaâs history. The average taxpayer now pays $12,000 more annually in taxes than they did prior to the Howard government coming to office. As proof of the unfairness of these latest tax cuts and this governmentâs determination to ensure that the rich get richer, 45 per cent of these tax cuts are going to the top 10 per cent of taxpayers. And the government wonders why the Labor Party is in the Senate today trying to amend those tax cuts to make them much fairer for the vast majority of Australian taxpayers.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">While the 2005 budget may have been received with cheers in electorates like Higgins and Wentworth, this budget was not well received in my electorate of Capricornia. Like the rest of regional Australia, Capricornia has been left out by a government that is too intent on looking after only the big end of town while abandoning the rest of us to the scraps left over, which are usually in the form of politically motivated pork-barrelling, with no serious thought given to the needs and opportunities that exist in our region of Central Queensland.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The budget did not address any of the issues that would make a difference to the lives of the people in Capricornia and to the prospects of our region going into the futureâfrom the need for greater spending on health and education right through to the very great need for improving the roads leading to the Shoalwater Bay military training area. There is nothing in the budget that will deliver better services or help us to build on the opportunities that we have identified as the key to our future success. But this budget has provided the people of Central Queensland with one clear certaintyâthat is, the poor will get poorer under this government.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Capricornia has a poverty rate of 12.6 per cent, which equates to 16,563 people in Central Queensland living below the poverty line. The budget gives no hope to these people. There is no increase in their income and no support for the services that they need to live decent lives and to aspire to a better future. It is obvious that the government are not interested in helping the poorest people in our community. They just want to score some political points off them by reducing their income and making life even harder for them. But those people targeted by the government are not taking the attacks against them lying down. Since the budget was announced in May, my office has been inundated with calls from disability support pensioners and sole parents who have been shocked by the news that their income support benefits from Centrelink could be taken off them. Some of them are also concerned that they will be forced to relocate to other parts of the country to find jobs.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">While the Treasurer stood across the chamber and delivered his budget speech, the people of regional Australia waited to hear a budget of reformâa budget of infrastructure investment and investment in our people through greater spending on education and the delivery of a reasonable health service. But the people of Central Queensland, my electorate of Capricornia, together with the rest of regional Australia were sorely disappointed by this Treasurer.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to draw the Houseâs attention to a couple of key areas where this government has failed to listen to the needs of the people of Central Queensland. These are matters which could and should have been addressed in the budget. On numerous occasions in the recent past I have stood in this chamber to represent those people in my electorate who live near the Shoalwater Bay military training area. Their issues concern the condition of their roads, particularly after a major military training exercise has taken place at Shoalwater Bay. For example, right now there is a joint US-Australian military exercise going on at Shoalwater Bay involving some 17,000 troops, so you can imagine the pressure that is putting on the surrounding infrastructure. While it is true that the Department of Defence does provide some make-good funding to the Livingstone Shire Council to assist with road repairs at Shoalwater Bay, undertaking the required upgrading works will actually result in long-term savings of approximately one-third of the annual maintenance cost of the existing gravel roads.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is estimated that Defence Force exercises at the Shoalwater Bay training area inject $10 million into our regional economy every year. This figure is significantly more when, as we are doing at the moment, we are hosting joint exercises with US defence forces. In addition there are significant multiplier effects for the wider economy of Central Queensland, including an estimated $7 million expended through military tourism in the region every year. So there is quite broad support in the community for these exercises, but there is also a very strong and growing recognition by the community surrounding Shoalwater Bay that the costs of the exercises and the pressure that is placed on the infrastructure should not be borne by them alone and that there should be a fair contribution made by the federal government towards these exercises, which are in the interests of all Australians in terms of building our defence capability. To date, the government has instead chosen to ignore the plight of the people living in the vicinity of Shoalwater Bay. In fact, local residents are now describing themselves as the neglected collateral damage of all the joint US-Singaporean-Australian armed forces exercises.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In the run-up to the last election the Labor Party committed $15.5 million to fixing this problem. We were keen to work with the local government authority to upgrade the roads to a decent standard, to make sure that they are safe and reasonable for both military personnel and local people. At the time of the election we challenged the government to follow suit and match that funding. However, visits by the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anderson, and the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation, Senator Ian Macdonald, saw themâas usualâpromising everything and delivering nothing. The government have still made no commitments to improving this vital military infrastructure. Sadly, they have similarly made no such commitment in this budget. However, I am convinced that even this government must realise the great need for these roadworks and today I am again writing, on behalf of the local residents as well as the Defence Force personnel involved, to the Minister for Defence, urging him to please attend to the Shoalwater Bay roads as a matter of urgency.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Before the last election Labor made a commitment to reintroduce the Commonwealth Dental Health Program and I, along with many other members on this side of the House, have asked the government to reconsider its position on this vital program. This government abolished the Commonwealth Dental Health Program when it came to office in 1996. It thereby condemned many Australians to long periods of misery and poor general health as a consequence of the long delays that are experienced in the now critically underfunded and unsupported state dental health programs. This budget was an opportunity for the government to reintroduce that Commonwealth funding but it appears that once again the opportunity has been missed. As a consequence there are people in my electorateâlike Mrs Johannensen of Rockhamptonâwho are condemned to further suffering. Mrs Johannensen had a tooth pulled in August 2004 and was told she needed a filling in another tooth. She has her name on the waiting list and is still waiting to have that tooth filled. Mrs Johannensen, like so many other people, has nowhere to go; she must just put up with it. She is just another casualty of the governmentâs indifference to people on low incomes.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Of course there are another 500,000 Australians like Mrs Johannensen on waiting lists for dental care. Apart from causing those individuals unnecessary pain and suffering, it is just plain bad health policy. Dr David Curnow from the Victorian branch of the Australian Dental Association recently stated:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">â¦ even waiting one year for dental treatment is likely to lead to unacceptable oral and general health outcomes.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Laborâs plan would have seen $300 million being injected into a Commonwealth dental plan in a positive attempt to clear the backlog of patients waiting to see a dentist. This plan would have been a return to the highly successful program initiated by the Keating government that even the current Minister for Health and Ageing has deemed a success.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Compounding the problem in dental health is the steady decline in the number of dentists in Australia, and particularly the difficulties in getting dentists to regional parts. It is now predicted that there will be a shortage of 1,500 dental workers by 2010. It is the height of social irresponsibility that this government, crowing about the budget surplus on one hand, could not find $300 million in this budget to reintroduce the Commonwealth Dental Health Program, which would make such a difference to so many people in my electorate.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The other great concern for people in Central Queensland is the shortage of doctors in our regional communities. There is certainly nothing in the budget to improve access to health services for the people living in my electorate. In fact, affordable health care is getting further out of reach. On budget night the Treasurer put the final nail in the coffin of the health ministerâs rock solid, ironclad guarantee about the Medicare safety net. The governmentâs safety net is now in tatters and people face even higher costs to see a GP if, indeed, there is a doctor to see in their town.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is obvious that this government simply does not understand what it means to live in a regional town without a doctor. In my electorate, the mining town of Blackwater has just been through that situation and, even now, has less than adequate services. Blackwater is the service town for major coalmining operations in the Bowen Basin. The permanent population of Blackwater is 5Â½ thousand people, with a construction work force of 1,000 people. The majority of the working population is associated with high-risk coalmining operations. Blackwater has been without a permanent doctor for several weeks now. By a twist of fate, a Blackwater mine worker sustained severe head injuries at work on the very first day that the Blackwater hospital was left without a doctor. The miner was taken to Blackwater hospital, where there was no doctor to assess him; he was assessed by the nurses. He was transferred by ambulance to the Emerald hospital, which is 75 kilometres from Blackwater, where he was then assessed by a doctor. After this assessment, he was flown to the Royal Brisbane Hospital. The miner was conscious throughout this ordeal, despite being very badly hurt.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Obviously, if a doctor had been on duty in Blackwater this injured worker would have been flown directly from Blackwater to Brisbane rather than having his treatment delayed by having to go to Emerald first for a doctorâs assessment. Coalmining is a very dangerous occupation, and we have every reason to be concerned about medical services available to our miners. In the district of Blackwater there are many other people involved in rural industry on farms which, of course, also have very high rates of injuryâoften very serious injuries. So it is not only the miners but also the local farmers and their families who are at risk. I will quote from a letter I have received from Mrs Harris of Blackwater, who writes:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">On the 13 May 2004 my son Mitchell was hospitalised with severe respiratory failure. He was stabilized by the medical staff in Blackwater before being transported to Rockhampton base hospitalâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Rockhampton Base Hospital is almost 200 kilometres east of Blackwaterâ</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">He spent 6 and a half weeks in hospital between Rockhampton and the Royal Brisbane 4 of those weeks in the Intensive care unit on life support.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">He was critically ill. My concerns are this â¦ if this happened today my son would be dead. The initial care he received kept him going, if there had not been a doctor available I wouldnât like to imagine what would have happened. Donât the ordinary people of Blackwater deserve to have decent medical care?</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">My sonâs condition was of rapid onset. He was well on Sunday but on life support by Thursday. It is not fair to expect nurses to cope with the pressure of this, they are not doctors. If there is anything to be done to rectify this situation could you please do so?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">In support of Mrs Harris, today I wrote to the health minister inviting him to the mining town of Blackwater and asking for his assistance to help find a permanent doctor for this mining town.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Other sections of our community are also in great need of assistance with doctors. The Bidgerdii Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Community Health Service was established in Rockhampton in 1995 to service the Central Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. It does a fantastic job. Over the years it has broadened its services to much needed areas such as nutrition and eye health. Bidgerdii recently established a new clinic in the central highlands in an effort to better address the health needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people throughout Central Queensland. However, in its 10 years of excellent service it has never received funding to cover the salary of its general practitioner in Rockhampton. This is unlike other similar Aboriginal health services that do receive money for GP salaries, and this assists their ability to attract and retain GPs to work not only in the area of patient illnesses but also in the much needed areas of preventative health programs and other health related promotions such as substance abuse, domestic violence and prenatal and antenatal care.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Bidgerdii understands the need for it to deliver such services to its community and it is an absolute credit to the management committee and staff at Bidgerdii that they have been providing this service without proper funding for 10 years. But it is being unfairly prevented from doing the extra work it has identified and knows needs to be done for the Indigenous community in Central Queensland because it has simply never been given appropriate funding. It has never been given funding for GP salaries in the same way that other Aboriginal health services have. The staff at Bidgerdii are working very hard to provide a high-quality service and it is high time the government gave Bidgerdii the support it deserves to meet the enormous need for affordable and appropriate health care for the Indigenous community in Central Queensland.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In coming back to the neglect of regional Australia by this government, I have to say it has tried to act like a friend to the regions by rolling out its pork-barrel political slush fund called Regional Partnerships. We have seen very clearly the partnership involved in this funding scamâit is the partnership between money and votes. This government was more than happy to throw around money to regional areas prior to last yearâs election, providing of course that the electorates that received money were marginal seats. This budget represents a wasted opportunity for this government to do something positive in regional Australia and give a little back to the areas that make Australia the wealthy country that it is. This government had the opportunity to put forward a real plan for infrastructure development in the regions, a plan to end the bottlenecks in our transport sectors and to commit to road projects of significance. The government has once again failed to address regional Australiaâs development needs.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The one thing this government can claim as a success for this budget is that it will continue to gradually increase the inequality now so obvious in all parts of the country. Under the Howard government, the contrast between rich and poor grows each year, and this year will be no exception. As it happens, just as I was heading out of my office to give this speech I noticed I had received in the mail the <inline font-style="italic">Comet</inline>, which is the newsletter of the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants League in Queensland. I turned to the regular column put in by the President, Yvonne Zardani, who does great work as an advocate for pensioners and superannuants in our state. I would like to finish by reading out some of the observations that Mrs Zardani made on the budget. We are in here debating Laborâs view of the budget and the coalitionâs view of the budget, and it all gets very predictable and almost a bit artificial, although there are very strongly held views. But here is someone who is out there working in the community every day and who is speaking directly from the real world. This is what Mrs Zardani had to say about the budget:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The budget was not a surprise for most people, we all realise that lower income people are not on the agenda for this Federal Government. I felt there was real contempt in Mr Costelloâs voice in delivering the changes to the welfare benefits.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">She goes on to say:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Most sole parents are people who have been divorcedâvery few keep having children to collect a pension. I know of a young family, with both parents working and 2 children. The mother is a nurse, which as you know, means shiftwork. Up until now the children have been going to after-school and holiday care, but they just canât afford it any longer. The children are now coming home on the bus to an empty home and will be spending the next school holidays at home alone for the first time. If this is happening in a middle-income family, please tell me how a sole parent will cope?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Maybe Mr Costello would like to answer that question. Mrs Zardani goes on:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">There are thousands of children whoâve grown up in a jobless family, but their parents have the same aspirations that we all have for our children. Simple things like feeding and clothing them, giving them an education and seeing them do better than themselves. Itâs not much to ask.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">She finishes by saying:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The divide between the rich and poor is now even wider. There is nothing for schools or university students.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Medicare did not get any help. God help anyone who canât afford health care cover, and even with health care you still pay more. There is nothing for oral health. Nothing for housing. Not a very bright future for those who are on limited funds.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Good on you, Mrs Zardani, for speaking out. Those of us on this side of the House are right in there with you advocating on behalf of the low-income earners in this community. As for me, I am advocating for the people of regional Australia like those in Central Queensland in my electorate. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI want to begin this contribution to the debate on <inline ref="R2335">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006</inline> and related bills by referring to the so-called âdemocratic processesâ seen in the House today. If they are a portent of what we can expect post July, when the government controls both houses, then pity help us. If there is to be no debate in the House on top of no amendments, and the same in the Senate, then we have a one-party state. The skills crisis in this country has been one of the most talked about issues over the past 18 months, but now we have seen the government shut down debate on its so-called solution, denying many members the opportunity to contribute. I was one of those. My staff have worked long and hard researching this issue. Not only was my contribution to this important debate stymied by a gag but, when I attempted to speak to an amendment moved by the minister to correct a major drafting blunder in the explanatory memorandum, I was again denied a chance to speak even though I had received the call from the Deputy Speaker, notwithstanding the fact that the process involved the minister coming first.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Fortuitously, because this debate was happening at the time, I can record some of my observations on those bills here. Under the <inline ref="R2340">Skilling Australiaâs Workforce Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2332">Skilling Australiaâs Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005</inline>, the government will dismantle the very successful and independent Australian National Training Authority, which has developed a consistent vocational education and training system across the country. ANTA worked because it included all playersâindustry, government, unions and trainersâand distributed funding where it was needed. The government itself acknowledged that ANTAâs success had been established by publicly announcing that it was âa truly national vocational education and training system with industry leadershipâ.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The bills on which debate was truncated in the House today give the Commonwealth direct control over where VET funding goes and attach a raft of conditions, such as forcing its workplace agenda on TAFE and channelling public money to private training providers. It is an ideological straitjacket for the states and territories if they do not want to lose what amounts to a third of their total funding needs for VET and TAFE. So much for cooperative federalism! ANTA is not responsible for the skills shortage in this country. That results from government and industry reluctance to invest in real apprenticeshipsânot short-term training with dubious qualifications, at worst exploited as a means of low-income employees. The honest and realistic sectors of industry now admit they have been selfish and short-sighted when it comes to real investment in real skills for our young. The government is refusing to recognise the impact globalisation and international competition are having on our training programs and skilling.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There have been huge shifts from government to private ownership in the running of utilities. Electricity, transport, roads and defence manufacturing are just some of the areas, particularly so in my electorate, where apprenticeships traditionally provided thousands of young people with opportunities over the years. Indeed, the former apprenticeship school at Wallerawang power station was one of the largest in the country. As with Telecom, now Telstra, so much of the work of formerly public utilities is now contracted out, with a sensational associated drop in the level of commitment to training young people. Global competition has seen the bottom line become all important and cost cuts have included apprenticeship training. Industry, by and large, has preferred to subcontract specific units of work to smaller business, which results in more subcontractors who simply cannot afford to take on apprentices.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I see nothing in the governmentâs proposals for skilling the work force that addresses this reality in any real and sensible way, apart perhaps from the bonus being offered to existing apprentices to stay on. We need more real apprenticeships and real training wages, not labour imported just in time, and we need to allocate scarce training resources by the fairest possible means. ANTA provided that; the governmentâs approach in the gagged bills does not. The structure to combat the skills shortage by way of an independent ANTA process is now being dismantled to suit short-term political objectives rather than the long-term skilling needs of the country.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I have spoken elsewhere in another debate about the inequity of the tax cuts delivered in this budget. However, I want to add a few words following the release of the St Vincent de Paul social issues paper on the reality of income inequality in Australia. Amid new reports of a $37 million retirement package for a bank managerâfor that is what he isâand an $11 million package for Telstraâs new CEO and amid other signs of the rapidly escalating gap between the haves and have-nots of this country, our Prime Minister continues, along with other government ministers, to spin the myth that we are still the egalitarian country, the fair country of the fair go.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Vinnies report is a thorough examination of the real maths, not the selective quoting of data that is used when we are told that low-income households have enjoyed the strongest growth in private incomes over the period 1997-98 to 2004-05. The St Vincent de Paul report states:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Assertions that income inequality is moderating are based on the use of averages and percentages, which disguise an unequal growth in income reflected in absolute terms, especially at the lowest levels.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">In concentrating solely on income inequality, St Vinnies lays aside other significant factors of inequality, such as health services, housing, education, child and aged care services, transport and communications, and social exclusion.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The St Vincent de Paul report suggests that Australian high-income households enjoy lifestyles at unbelievable levels above the norm, while low-income households are deprived of opportunities to break free from their disadvantage. Using data from the Bureau of Statistics, the report highlights how eight million Australians, or 42 per cent of the population, have equivalised disposable incomes of less than $21,000 per annum. Of these eight million Australians, 4Â½ million are in households with an aggregate income of less than $400 a week. Again the report shows that the ratio of top incomes to low incomes has consistently worsened over the past nine years. The report also says:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Confirmation of the ABS data can be found in the Gini coefficient, used internationally to measure income equality â¦</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">For Australia, the Gini coefficient has deteriorated from 0.296 in 1996/7 to 0.309 in 2002/3 ... a strong shift to greater inequality.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">There was not one question from the opposition the day this report was released. There was no story on the national Channel 9 news and no report on ABC television. A large slice of the media should be ashamed. They swallow the government misinformation and do not even report this most basic and objective counterargument which is so important to understanding what is occurring in Australiaâthat is, the fostering of privilege over need.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Let me relate just one story from a constituent that highlights the impact on sole parent payments of changes announced in the budget. Cheryl from Lithgow says that looking after school-age kids requires a lot of time for a single parent, quite apart from the days children are sick or on school vacation. In Lithgow and other parts of the central west there is simply not enough paid part-time work to go around, quite apart from transport difficulties should a position become available, perhaps in Bathurst 50 kilometres down the road. The unavailability and expense of child care is also a major hurdle.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Cheryl says many single parents already do a lot of unpaid work in various capacities, especially relating to school, with tuckshop work, reading assistance programs and other community activities. It should be remembered by Treasurers wanting to get single mothers back to work that volunteers, who are often single mothers, save the Australian taxpayers about $40 billion a yearâmore than our GST receipts. How, one might ask, will those voluntary hours be filled?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Indeed, the member for Ryan made this very point in the adjournment debate a few weeks ago in underlining the unsung contribution volunteers make to our economyâa greater contribution, I might say, than the misguided attempts to force volunteers among the ranks of single mothers onto the job market and the social costs that may incur. Cheryl says that if the new legislation does not recognise all forms of voluntary work and assumes every single mum can get a friend or a relative to look after an unwell child, or a latchkey kid for that matter, then the emotional burden placed on sole parents will be huge.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Why canât this policy account at least for volunteer work as being equivalent to the activities test in the same way as it is applied to senior job seekers who do not qualify for the pension or access to retirement accounts? Why canât a continued parenting payment rather than so-called enhanced, but in fact lower paying, Newstart be retained for those demonstrating the commitment to voluntary effort that Cheryl demonstrates? Quite apart from that, why this punishment for those whose sole role is parenting? Is that regarded as some sort of voluntary activity? We hear so much about family dysfunction and about the need for family values, yet here we see a government undertaking a bit of political wedging, of social engineering, based largely on the prejudice of those in the community who regard single mothers as welfare bludgers.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Apart from that, we are driving those who manage to find work into financial difficulties. According to opposition figures, which I presume are reasonably accurate, a single parent with two children working 15 hours a week will be approximately $70 a week worse off, while a single parent with two children working 20 hours a week will be $90 a week worse off and with four children, $120 a week worse off. I realise the Jobs, Education and Training child-care provisions are designed to assist low-income families meet any gap in child-care fees, and they are obviously welcome, but I want to comment on other child-care changes. While 84,300 additional outside school hours places are welcome, where are the during school hours places and where are the jobs between 10 o clock and two oâclock for mums who need to pick up and deliver their kids? It is a nonsense that the part-time work that many mothers may getâand that is at best, in my electorateâwill somehow magically lead to full-time work, as one minister has suggested. The child-care infrastructure is just not available to cater for extra places, even if parents could afford it. As in aged care, the guarantee of funding is no guarantee the physical accommodation can or will be provided.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to also say that there is major concern within the community over the continued failure of state and federal governments to adequately fund public dental services, as the previous speaker mentioned. The Rural Dental Action Group formed in the central west wants to work in a constructive way with government to ensure one of our health black holesâdental care for lower income earnersâis addressed to overcome a crisis that has developed since the end of the federally funded scheme in 1996. I appreciate one of the major concerns is the training of dentists and the cost of getting professors of dentistry at universities at only a fraction of the price they could obtain in private practice. It is a huge problem and it goes to the nub of the difficulty in supplying enough dentists to the system. I understand that. But, despite its denials over the years since 1996, the government does have constitutional authorityâI would say responsibilityâunder section 51(xxiiiA) of the Constitution to provide adequate dental care. This power was specifically given to the Commonwealth in a 1946 referendum. The Medicare concession for urgent cases, granted last year, is a start but represents a drop in the ocean compared with the need.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The federal governmentâs drought package will certainly ease some of the pain of what has been described as the worst drought in a century. Hopefully the rain of recent days is a portent of the many inches yet required to go anywhere near restoring hope for some better seasons and replenishing critical town water supplies, particularly along the Lachlan River in my electorate. The definition of exceptional circumstances needs urgent attention to ensure a fair application of assistance. While farm organisations have been calling for a cash grant process, a fairer and more affordable scheme all aroundâand one more acceptable to the taxpayer, I suggestâwould be an interest-free âpay back in good timesâ arrangement like HECS, as some independent commentators have suggested.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">While our overseas competitors like Japan, the United States and Europe continue to support their farmers in good timesâEuropeans could only have nightmares about the drought that we are experiencingâsupport for efficient farm families is totally justified. Efficiency and sustainabilityâecological as well as economic sustainabilityâare the keys. If farmers do not pass that test, they should not be entrusted with our fragile and drought prone land. It is as simple as that.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I am in the process of again surveying my electorate on their views on the full sale of Telstra and their views on the adequacy or not of the network. I will not prejudge the outcome, but I suspect there has been a hardening of opposition to the full sale. Things are nowhere near up to scratch, whatever that means. Even those close to the telecommunications coalface suggest that we are way off any sort of measurement of anything that may mean up to scratch. Shortcomings in mobile services and installations, lousy internet connection with expensive options as the only solution and nowhere near an adequate exchange network to provide ADSLâthe stories keep coming into my office from all over the state. New Telstra CEO Trujilloâs suggestion of local government-Telstra partnerships is code for getting rid of the difficult solutions. People want continued regulation across the board, and I suspect that 90 per cent or thereabouts of my electorate will again say they want continued public oversight and government control.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Treasurerâs forecast that the federal government will be close to debt free by next June contradicts his stated position that Telstra should be sold and the proceeds used to retire government debt. Country people have consistently refused to countenance the sale of an infrastructure and service they regard as vital to their long-term communication requirements and those of their childrenâquite apart from the several billion dollars in dividends their telco can deliver to the public purse from a public asset. Nothing they have heard from the government and its allies at the top end of townâthe infrastructure piratesâwill convince most country folk otherwise. So let it be known to all government membersâI know the member for Hinkler, who is at the table, is very committed to our telecommunications needs and aware of their shortcomingsâthat they dare sell Telstra only in the face of overwhelming public opposition.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As for the Future Fund established by budget initiatives, the feedback I get is that, while provision for future infrastructure needs is wise, the risking of billions of dollars of public money, especially the proceeds of a Telstra sale, is unacceptable. A likely correction in the US economy could well wipe several billion dollars off that fund in one fell swoop. I am one of those who see no economic danger in sensible public borrowings for essential infrastructure.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Finally, I wish to acknowledge the recent Reconciliation Australia Conference here in Canberra and its focus on the way forward in achieving a just outcome for our Indigenous people. I quote the words of Pat Dodson at one forum session I attended:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Efforts that were made by decent people in 1967 to gain a fair and just position for us in this nation have not resulted in any meaningful negotiation or resolution of our place in this nation.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">A few days before hearing Pat Dodson, I had the pleasure of launching <inline font-style="italic">Treaty</inline>, a serious study of the treaty processes in Canada, the US and New Zealand and whether such a process is a way forward in this country. It is written by highly respected authors Larissa Behrendt; Sean Brennan, previously of the Parliamentary Library here; Lisa Strelein; and George Williams. I commend it to all who are or should be interested in this issue. At the launch I said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">We have towns competing for the economic benefits of new jailsâencouraged by law and order Premiers and politiciansâjails to house the overwhelming number of Indigenous inmates; jails designed to be closer to Indigenous communitiesâa tragic twist on âbringing them homeâ.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I also said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Unless modern Australia forges a treaty with its original custodians, we have no claim to moral or legal legitimacy.

<para>âThe Liberal government came to power riding on the debt truck. Their major promotion in the election campaign was the debt truckâa quite valid comment. The Labor government came in when the debt was some $25,000 million and the debt in their nine or 10 years or whatever it was in office rolled up to $186,000 million. So it was quite a valid comment, because that money has to be repaidâAustralians have to repay the principal and the interest. Having said that, I note we do not hear anything about the debt truck today. I am a public admirer of the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and remain so, but I must say that, unfortunately for him, the history books are not going to treat very kindly the performance of this government. They are not going to treat it very well because it was really under this regime that we had an explosion in our balance of payments. Unfortunately for this government, they are reaping the results of the handiwork of Mr Keating in deregulating the economy. But, quite justifiably, the criticism will fall upon the shoulders of this government and upon the head of this government because they continued those policies. There was no amelioration, there was no pull-back and there was no vision of the impending disaster with the current account and our balance of payments.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">All of these are high-flying and high-sounding words with macro figures that we do not understand, but what we do understand is that this government remains committed to bringing in bananas from overseas. The minister has been tenacious in his commitment to destroying an industry worth $350 million to the Australian economy. Mr Deputy Speaker Baldwin, you would recall the announcements that chicken meat was coming into this country and, quite frankly, chicken meat would have come into this country except for your endeavours. If it had, we would have had the aviary diseaseâbird flu, as it is calledâand almost certainly we would have also had an outbreak of Newcastle disease, based on the scientific information that you placed at the time before the Prime Minister and other parties involved. But the announcement had already been made by the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anderson, that the chicken meat was coming in. I understand this issue because 150 jobs in my electorate depended upon that announcement. We had already seen 2,000 jobs removed with the deregulation of tobaccoâpeople in Australia still smoke and the difference now is that they smoke overseas tobaccoâand another 150 jobs were to go from that same town. Now another 5,000 jobs will go from the coastal areas of my electorate, but the government does not seem to get the message.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Larry Anthony, an excellent member of parliament in every wayâa very humane, decent and intelligent personâlost his seat to the Labor Party partially because it was in what was historically a banana-growing area. Everyone knew that the governmentâparticularly the National Party, which held the relevant portfoliosâwas determined to see that those bananas were going to come in, even though their own assessment tribunal said, no, the bananas should not come in. Then forces were brought to bear and the decision was reversed. An all-party committeeâall parties in the Senate were represented on the committeeâhas condemned stridently the incompetence of and the mistakes made by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, and the courts of Australia condemned AQIS again, on the issue of the pork, last week or the week before. We have government ministers who are determined to wreck the economy of Australia. There is issue after issue on which these people are determined that imports will be given a rails ride and that exports, when you try to get something out of this country, will be a nightmare. They put up a barbed wire entanglement which does not allow anything to go out, but then they pull the barbed wire entanglement away when anything is to come into this country.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Agricultural industries have to compete against an average support level in subsidy tariffs of 49 per cent. These are OECD figures. The support level in Australia is six per cent. And that is with the milk levy, which vanishes over the next two or three yearsâso it will be down around three per cent. Our farmers are expected to be 45 per cent better than their international competitors. They are better, but the sad thing is that they are not 45 per cent better. They cannot compete and they will not compete. We simply see great industries, such as the wool industry, collapsing. Half of the sheep population in Australia has gone. Twenty-five per cent of the cattle population has gone. Last time I looked, dairying was down about 10 per centâand it is early years yet as far as deregulation of the dairying industry goes. The sugar industry is in a state of freefall, and that is no secret to anyone in Australia. Industry after industry is collapsing simply because they cannot compete against a 45 per cent advantage.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Let me not pass judgment upon the performance of the government. Let me mention Mr Keating, who was Treasurer for the best part of a decade or more and the Prime Minister of Australia. When the current account hit $15,000 million Mr Keating said that Australia was in danger of becoming a banana republic. He was condemning himself. He was the Treasurer. He was most unapologetic when Labor were in power and he appeared on television saying: âI would say it again because this country needs a wake-up call. You cannot continue to run a country with a current account deficit of $15,000 million a year.â That is what the former Prime Minister and Treasurer said.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The current Prime Minister, who was also Treasurer for a number of years, so he knows a lot about Treasury, reminded Mr Keating back in 1993âwhen he made a statement during a Perth radio interviewâthat we were going to be a banana republic when the current account deficit was $15,000 million and said: âIt is now $26,000 million. What are you going to do about it, Mr Keating?â Quite rightly so. The Prime Minister observed that this is the problem above all elseâit is the overwhelming problem. Those are the words used by the Prime Minister in the Perth radio interview. The Prime Minister was right. The former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, was right. But it is now not a $15,000 million banana republic statement; it not a $26,000 million overwhelming problem statement by Mr Howard. The figure is now $61,000 million.Â  And why? Because our manufacturing industry have simply ceased to exist. Their situation is actually worse than that of agriculture.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I do not have the time, nor do I have the intention, to do the necessary research, but I do not think anyone would question for a moment that the situation of manufacturing is infinitely more hopeless than that of agriculture. Mr Vaile is a very nice and decent man. I think he tries to do the right thingâand I think everyone here would agree with thatâbut the Minister for Trade will go down in the history books as the minister that introduced the free trade agreement with the United States. Minister, do you seriously believe that our motor vehicle production plants, supplying to a market of 20 million people, are going to compete favourably against the Americans? That place is supplying a market of 400 million people and they are all moving to the border down Mexico way where they can get people to work for nothing.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The cattle industry, a giant industry that I have the pleasure of representing the major part of in Australia, is in fact a secondary industry. I was speaking to the principal of one of the biggest beef producers in Australia and he said, âDo you know where all the meat processing is?â I said, âYep, right in the centre of the United States, in Kansas City and Omaha.â He said, âNo, no, itâs moved.â I said, âDonât tell meâdown south?â He said, âYes, itâs all on the Mexican border now,â where they can access people who work for virtually nothingâthe Mexican wetbacks who come across the border.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">So our situation is really desperate. Do you think you can just get in there and keep rolling up debt indefinitely? No. At some stage the banks will say, âYou canât have any more money.â We have the lowest savings level in Australian history; at the present moment Australia has negative savings. For the first time in our history, the average Australian is spending more money than he is earning, dramatically so. We are one of the very few countries on earth in that invidious situation.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Let me be very specific about how you turn this around. I am holding up a document here. I am on the natural resources committeeâthe House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry and Resourcesâand we were handed this document prepared by ABARE and Geoscience Australia, which is the old Bureau of Mineral Resources. This document shows a graph of petrol consumption and of petrol production in this countryâoil, if you like. The graph shows the levels to be about the same up to about 2002-03; it looks to be the same graph. But from then on they rapidly divide, with demand increasing and production decreasing dramatically, so that by 2009 more than half of this nationâs oil will have to come from overseas. By 2020, almost all of this nationâs oil will have to come from overseas.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Americans are moving. They have closed down all of their marginal oilwells and they maintain a reserve in those marginal oilwells that can be opened in times of emergency. The US Senate has passed legislation to introduce what is effectively a 10 per cent ethanol blend in oil in the United States. They are already moving on this in a number of states, including New York and Californiaâand if people think this is some sort of sneaky way of helping their farmers, there is no grain or sugar cane in New York State or in the state of California. Neither of them broadacre farm, yet they are the great consumers. America is projected this year to be on three per cent ethanol.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This country, which is absolutely screaming out for an ethanol initiative, is on nil. All we get from the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Leader of the National Party, is: âIâm opposed to mandating, but Iâm going to give you all of these great handouts if you want to go and build a plant.â No-one is going to build a plant. There has not been one single action taken in Australia to build a plant, in spite of all the government incentives. But you cannot build a plant to sell petrol to people who will not buy itâand people will not buy it because the people who own the bowsers are the oil companies. They make an awful lot of money. They do not buy their oil at spot prices. They buy their oil at wellhead prices from wellheads that they in the main own. When we moved from wellhead pricing in Australia the price went from 3c a litre to about 10c a litre. When Doug Anthony lifted it, I thought it was a good move. But I was wrong and Doug Anthony was wrongâone of the very few times that he was wrong. I backed him strongly because I thought it was a good idea, but it was a very bad idea because the world price, the spot price, is infinitely higher than the price of production at the wellhead, which is what Shell, Mobil, Exxon and all these companies produce for. Here is an industry that was 10 per cent dieselâthere is $3,000 million, so five per cent of your problems have been overcome in one hit. You have only to do another 19 things of that size and you will have solved our problem in Australia. We will be making money instead of losing money.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The answers are there. But what are we doing instead of opening up our great resources that God has given us? The Good Book talks about talents. It talks about the man who had five talents and went out and traded and got his master another five talents, and it talks about the bloke who had two talents and got his master another two. The Lord said to each of them, âGood and faithful servant, come into your rich reward.â And there was a bloke who was given one talent, and he went and hid it under rock because he thought he might lose it. Mr Deputy Speaker, the vast resources of water that this nation has are in the Gulf of Carpentaria, which the Australian people have given me the privilege to represent. Over a third of Australiaâs water is in the Gulf of Carpentaria but, as I speak, the brainless government of Queensland is passing legislation to ban the usage of any of that water. If that is not a classic case of burying the talent under a rock because it might get lost I do not know what is.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Gulf Country by itself can support a population of 100 million. You have a thousand kilometres of rolling black soilâand what is it doing? Seven million hectares of it has been taken over by the dirty, filthy Acacia nilotica tree that some bird has brought in from Asia or somewhere else. These are not my figures; they are figures from the agriculture department of Queensland. That land is disintegrating right now. We have not looked after it. We have not hidden it under a rock. It is falling to piecesâand though it is falling to pieces we are going to keep it the way it is.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Sometimes I think we go out of our way to antagonise Indonesia, our nearest neighbour. It seems that we just do thing after thing to antagonise our nearest neighbour. We should be friends with our neighbours but we should have good fences. Good fences make good neighbours, which is an old saying from the country I come from, and a very true saying. In another place we are debating about those fences at the present moment. One hundred million people in Indonesia go to bed hungry every night. Do you think it is a fair world when we sit on those resources and say that no-one is allowed to touch them, when we say that no graziers are allowed to take a single litre of that water out of those giant rivers? People say that it upsets the balance of nature. You can build all the dams you like but you will not be able to stop the flow of those giant rivers during our three-month wet season. Later in the year, again, you can build all the dams you like but you will never be able to make them run all year round. They are dry beds at the start of the year and they are huge rivers in the wet season.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We plead with this government to realise that you cannot get coal out of this country in a multiuser facility when you are saying, âIt should be a matter for the market to look after.â The market has had its chance at Dalrymple Bay and there are 52 ships going around in circles. I represent the greatest mineral province on earth, with $4,000 million or $5,000 million worth of minerals coming out of it. Up until about seven or eight years ago we processed all of those minerals. Half of the value is in processing and we processed those minerals. Three of our latest mines are Indian companies and they are exporting minerals as concentratesâthey are not processing them at all. The zinc refinery in Townsville have said on numerous occasions that they want to double production but they cannot.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Why are we suddenly sending all our stuff out? Because we have a national competition policy, that is why. There is no-one to build a baseload power station to provide us with the power to process it. The Treasurer says that if the project wants it, the project will build it. But we are talking about 10, 12, 20, 30 projects here. If that argument were used, there would be no coal industry in Queensland. And guess what the Australian economy is riding on? Something like 20 per cent of its income this year is coal. It would not be there if the government had not gone and built the infrastructure. There was not a single coalmine to feed Gladstone, not oneâUtah said it was going to build one at Blackwater. It is a similar case in Western Australia with the iron ore. So two of the countryâs biggest export earning items would not be there today if we applied the principles of national competition policy.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Thousands of millions of dollars from my electorate are being lost now because metals are going out unprocessed because we do not have a baseload power station. Under national competition policy we cannot have a baseload power stationâit will never happen. So, please, will the government realise that the country is going broke. It screams out for action and there is no action coming. Infrastructure must be supplied to enable us to grow. That is the great lesson of history for Australia. The wheat industry came out of silos built by the Theodore government in Queensland. The sugar industry came out of sugar mills built by the government in Queensland. The coal industry came out of the infrastructureâthe ports and railway linesâbuilt by the government in Queensland. Who runs them afterwards is not important, but the risk up front when you have a multiuser facility must be taken by government. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I would like to thank all those members who have contributed to the debate. The discussion has focused on a broad range of issues, from the general state of the economy to issues emerging in membersâ electorates, specific funding proposals and the oppositionâs suggestion that the government has somehow failed to provide for the delivery of important services. Of course, we are all interested in what the opposition speakers have had to say about these bills and the broader budget but, not surprisingly, I and my colleagues in government do not agree with most of the oppositionâs sentiments. That is what they have to do in opposition.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would like to take this opportunity to once again provide an overview of the package of appropriation bills. I will start with the budget bills. These bills provide for substantial funding totalling approximately $55.3 billion. They reflect the governmentâs broad objective to maintain a strong economy and are framed for the future, in particular the future opportunities of our young people, the future care of our aged, the future health services needs and demands of our citizens, the security of our nation and the future growth of the Australian economy.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The initiatives provided in the budget bills include funding of $45 billion for health and aged care, $5 billion investment through vocational education and training agreements, $12 billion commitment to transport infrastructure between 2004-05 and 2008-09, abolition of the three per cent tariff on imported business inputs, cuts to personal income tax worth $21.7 billion over four years and $522 million for national security. In addition to these initiatives, the budget bills provide record levels of funding to ensure that the Australian community has access to child care, education and training opportunities and that carers are recognised for their efforts. This is consistent with the priority the government places on these fundamental support services.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Also included in the package of five appropriation bills are two supplementary additional estimates bills for this financial year, 2004-05. These bills propose expenditure of $314.3 million for important initiatives that can be accommodated this financial year because of the strength of our fiscal position and the Australian economy generally. The funding in the supplementary additional estimates bills provides, amongst other things: $160 million for transitional grants to compensate eligible entities for loss of access to a fringe benefits tax exemption; $28 million and $17.3 million from appropriation bills Nos 5 and 6 respectively for expenses associated with the Australian Defence Force deployment in Iraq; $23 million for Australiaâs increased financial contributions to the United Nationâs peacekeeping operations; and $4 million to reimburse the states for the cost of providing medical teams under the AUSASSIST arrangements during the tsunami relief effort. I wish to emphasise that the significant level of expenditure proposed in the package of bills is only possible because of the governmentâs continued strong management of the economy.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Let me talk about our emphasis on the future. The members for Swan and Lilley commented on the Future Fund. Through the Future Fund the government will accumulate and quarantine assets now to meet future superannuation benefit payments that its employees are entitled to. This will free up resources from the budget at a time when growing demographic pressures in areas like health and aged care spending are expected to emerge. The superannuation entitlements of Australian government employees, which include defence personnel and members of parliament as well as public servants, are part of the costs of providing government services. The Future Fund will enhance intergenerational equity by ensuring that the current generation of taxpayers meet their share of these costs rather than adding to the burden of future generations.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Through its commitment to sound financial management, the government has put the budget in surplus, making funds available to retire debt and now, through the Future Fund, to commence savings for its future obligations. The government will make transfers to this fund from realised cash surpluses and other financial assets, as it is able to do so given its spending priorities. The government will reinvest fund earnings, demonstrating its commitment to growing the fund. The Future Fund will be a financial asset fund that will not invest directly in infrastructure; the governmentâs investment mandate will allow the fund to invest in infrastructure trusts in companies that build and manage infrastructure and in property trusts. In this way, the government can ensure that the Future Fund can invest in infrastructure projects with a strong business case and the ability to produce commercial returns.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The establishment of the Future Fund will increase the pool of funds available for investment in the Australian economy, and the more vibrant economy will benefit all Australians. If the government is looking to invest in infrastructure that has broader economic and community benefits, such as roads, the appropriate source of funding is general revenue, not the Future Fund. For instance, our record spending on roads through Auslink is funded from the budget.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">At the commencement of the debate, the honourable member for Lilley moved an amendment to the second reading motion on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006. The government does not support the proposed amendment. The reasons for this should be clear. I have already addressed many of the specific issues that we are funding and that were raised in the amendment. I record my disappointment at the cynicism expressed in the proposed amendment. The budget bills and the supplementary additional estimates bills proposed by the government support reforms that are required to address the significant changes currently faced by the Australian economy. Only through these reforms can we ensure that the economy will continue to grow to its maximum potential.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I also emphasise that the government is not spending money that it does not have. The substantial expenditure provided for in these bills is a dividend of the governmentâs strong and responsible management of the Australian economy and fiscal policy.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In conclusion, the three budget bills for 2005-06 and the two supplementary additional estimates bills for 2004-05 are important pieces of legislation underpinning the governmentâs activities and reforms to be introduced over the next 12 months or so. I commend the budget bills and the supplementary additional estimates to the House.</para>

<para>âI have a question for the Parliamentary Secretary for Children and Youth Affairs which relates to the Family and Community Services portfolio and the measures that the Department of Family and Community Services uses for unmet demand for child care. Could you give us some information identifying the various measures used by the Department of Family and Community Services to identify unmet needâwhether the department uses the measure of the number of places requested by services or the number of children on waiting lists or some other source? Could you describe the methodology used by the department and specify whether different measures are used for different types of child care?</para>

<para>âThe member for Shortland also wishes to ask questions. Could the parliamentary secretary tell us how often unmet demand is measured by the Department of Family and Community Services? We hear a great deal of anecdotal evidence about unmet demand in child care. We have been told that anecdotal evidence is not satisfactory in this area. However, without knowing the measures that the Department of Family and Community Services uses it is impossible for us to use other measures. In deciding to allocate in this budget 84,300 places to out of school hours care and 1,500 to family day care, how were those figures arrived at? Could the parliamentary secretary tell us whether there has been a measurement of the unmet demand in out of school hours care and family day care by the Department of Family and Community Services and whether the figures arrived at, which were included in the budget, relate to some calculation done by the Department of Family and Community Services?</para>

<para>âI wish to use this opportunity to highlight what appears to be a significant campaign being run by the St Vincent de Paul Society in its efforts to respond to some of the governmentâs policy around family and community services. Anthony Dalton commented in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 13 June that we have in this country a system where no money means no access. That is an affront to the work that is done in community services in this country. I use this opportunity to highlight a long campaignâand certainly a very active media adviser scurrying between media outlets around this countryâto sell a line that is far from the reality of community services in this country.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">We saw this begin as far back as 11 June with an editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend</inline> <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> which referred to the St Vincent de Paul Societyâs âSeinfeld stoushâan argument over nothingâ and said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">The societyâs is a sad statement, but not for the reasons its researchers think. It demonstrates why welfare lobbyists should abandon assumptions that more public money can save people from being poor.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Following on from that editorial was a piece on the radio by Terry McCarthy and then a piece by John Wicks in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and thenâand this does disappoint meâthe <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> actually printed, reprinted and reprinted again the same old story with the same old figures. I have taken the liberty of highlighting the repetition unfortunately running through this major daily of the same information appearing in a different part of the newspaper each week. The usual suspects appear to be John Fowles, Terry McCarthy, Anthony Dalton and then Gavin Duffyâon the bottom of the press releaseâwho are simply running the same line. Let us see what it is, and it is not a new one.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As long as there have been welfare economics and tax policy there has been an argument about whether we have a âmoreâ or âlessâ progressive tax policy. In family and community service there is the argument about whether we can increase levels of welfare to those that need it the most. No matter how much evidence is provided that is in fact what is happening with our current family and community policy, we see a continual attack using tax policy as an excuse to criticise what is happening in family and community services. What we need in this debate, as we have already seen, is some coherent, rational and considered argument. When an organisation like the St Vincent de Paul Society, with their clearly described mission, begin to take a policy approach to criticising family and community service policy in this country by having a shot at tax policy, they move themselves away from what they should be doing, which is sticking to their mission. It is not a complex one; it is, in fact, not a very detailed one. It is quite simple: it is to deepen the Catholic faith of its members, to heighten the awareness of Jesus Christ and, of course, to help those in most need to take control of their destiny.</para>

<para>âThank you, Madam Acting Deputy Speaker. I will just ask my questions in a much more longwinded fashion then, shall I? I asked the parliamentary secretary about the data collected by the Department of Family and Community Services that was used to determine the number of places allocated to out of school hours care and to family day care in the most recent budget. The data collected by the Department of Family and Community Services that I hope the parliamentary secretary will get back to us with is mostly not made public by the Department of Family and Community Services. Every two years there is what is called the Census of Child Care Services, and we are still waiting on the results of the 2004 child-care census. I hope those figures will be released some time in 2005, although at this stage it looks as though it is more likely to be 2006, which is when the next census data will be collected.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The data collected by the Department of Family and Community Services would be incredibly useful to private child-care operators who are considering setting up child care in areas where they are not sure of what the Department of Family and Community Services estimates will be in relation to the demand into the future. What I would like to hear from the parliamentary secretary is when the information that the Department of Family and Community Services uses, presumably to have an input on the number of out of school hours care places or the number of family day care places that are required, will be made public. How can we be certain that private sector child-care operators who are risking a great deal of money to set up child-care centresâbetween $1 million and $2 million for a centreâcan have access to that information on an equal basis?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Child-care operators, in the long day care sector in particular, tell me they are concerned that some child-care operators do have access to this information. They believe that it is an unfair competitive advantage if people do have information about likely demand into the future. I would like the parliamentary secretary to tell us: is any of the information collected about undersupply and oversupply made public? Is it likely to be made public in the near future? Can she give us a guarantee that there is no unequal access, by some operators compared with other operators, to information that the Department of Family and Community Services collects in order to make its own assessments about need in this area?</para>

<para>âI will continue with my analysis of what has become over the last month or so a de facto media campaign. I draw attention both to radio interviews by Terry McCarthy and to a series of articles in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 30 May. What I felt was quite incisive was the 8 June press release that referred to some statements by the CIS and suggested that the CIS should âtake a Bex and have a good lie downâ.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Running in predominantly the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper we are seeing the St Vincent de Paul Society engaging in this perennial debate about progressiveness of tax relief. In essence, I think they are confusing the fact that we have welfare policy and tax policy, and they are taking the chance to attack tax policy in the hope that that might in some way improve the lot of those who are on low incomes. What they do not tell us, of course, is that when it comes to payment of tax as a share of the total net amount, the lowest decile of Australians are payingâand I apologise that these are the next to most recent figuresâonly 0.7 per cent of the total tax bill. So tax policy is not a terribly effective way of addressing poverty, particularly in the areas where St Vincent de Paul is working.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Even if we take the bottom 20 per cent of Australians, you are still dealing with 2.3 per cent, and once again these are figures from late last decade. That is an incredibly tiny proportion of tax that is paid by that fraction of Australians. I do not have a problem with that as an amount. My question is that if you really want to address the needs of those who live particularly in the desperate poverty with which St Vincent de Paul works then we have to be looking at areas of welfare to improve that. That does not mean that your job is to keep people on welfare. It does not mean that you need to have a deep ideological hostility to providing people with opportunity.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The mission of St Vincent de Paul is to help their clients to take control of their destinies. Can you see a better way of doing that than by providing a strong economy with opportunities, like an opportunity for a job? That is an opportunity that we are seeing right now in OECD figures and comparisons, but one that seems to be being ignored in what I see from St Vincent de Paul as a de facto political campaign in making a criticism of coalition policy at the moment without any valid comparison of alternatives, without providing any form of alternative vision and certainly without providing a comparison with what happened 10 years ago and the lot of the poor in the period 1983 to 1996?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">If we are going to be returning tax in the form of a tax break, I believe it stands to reason to do it progressively. If we are seeing higher income earners paying a larger proportion of tax, then it also stands to reason that they will get more of a tax break than those who have paid lower amounts. Once again, we have seen St Vincent de Paul fluctuating or even oscillating in relative comparisons, talking about their position relative to other Australians, and then taking absolute figures and talking about $6 or $200. I think that demeans the debate. I think they are taking one side, and a predominantly envy based approach at times, but more importantly they move into the sphere of taking a political view. There is nothing wrong with anyone having a political view. My problem is that when that academic, and sometimes intellectual, posturing is being done you have to be willing to step into the ring and engage in political debate, but not then pop your glasses on and say, âBut donât hit me back because Iâm doing important work in the non-profit sectorâ. They have to be one or the other.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is a certain intellectual debate in talking about the progressiveness of tax policy: how we collect it, use it and refund it. There is perhaps some limited value in a moral and ethical discourse about tax policy and welfare policy, but I do not think they do themselves any service whatsoever. In fact, there is really no value at all in having them running around the major dailies presenting their selected figures and then criticising other people for simply using other selected figures.Â </para>
<para pgwide="yes">I refer to an interview with Terry McCarthy where he says that the current debate on NATSEM research that we have been having for some years now, and in particular referring to the Prime Minister, is making:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">â¦ a spurious assertion that the poor in Australia are growing rich at a faster rate than the rich are.</para>

<para>âI find it rather amazing that here we are in consideration in detail and a member of the government is verballing St Vincent de Paul, saying that their sole and only role is to administer in a religious fashion. I can say to the member for Bowman opposite that St Vincent de Paul play a very vital role within the community that I represent. They look after the people that are disadvantaged by this government. They look after the people who are done over by the policies that are introduced into this House by you and your colleagues. They provide a vital service to the most disadvantaged people in the community. The social research that has been conducted by St Vincent de Paul over the years has been invaluable. On many occasions I have used it as the basis for assisting people within the community that I represent. I know that my colleagues on this side of the House value the work of St Vincent de Paul and, in addition to that, value the research that they do. We do not have to turn our minds back too far to remember when the government was trying to quieten charitable organisations by refusing to fund them properly if they spoke out and made political comment on issues like this. I find it absolutely appalling and disgraceful to hear in consideration in detail a member of the government rip into St Vincent de Paul the way the member for Bowman has.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I will turn very quickly to another issue, an area in which I think the government has been quite deficient in this budget. I congratulate the government on introducing the carers paymentâthe payment of $1,000 and $600 to people who are in receipt of the carers payment and the carers allowance. The measure was greatly welcomed by these people. I must say, though, that I believe there is a better way to deliver these payments and services to people. It should be on a more ongoing basis rather than an ad hoc, one-off approach. One group that has missed out and been ignored by the government is the partners of veterans. Women who look after a partner who is on the veterans disability pensionâthese are the partners of disabled veteransâhave been deemed by the government to be unworthy of receiving the same bonus as the partners of other people who are on the disability support pension.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I know that many of these carers are eligible for carers allowance but they have been denied the $1,000 carers payment; they will get the $600 carers allowance. Their veteran partner is on the veterans disability pension but, unlike someone else whose partner is in receipt of a disability support pension, they miss out on the $1,000. Some of these partners of veterans live horrendous lives. They provide the strongest support that anyone can give, and I believe the government has slapped them in the face by ignoring and forgetting them. I call on the government to revisit the carers payment and to look at introducing a bonus of $1,000 to the partners of veteransâpeople who are in receipt of carers allowance but not in receipt of carers payment because they are the partner of a disabled veteran.</para>

<para>â I had not intended to enter discussions at the consideration in detail stage except I wish to make a few points. Firstly, my colleague who spoke earlier was not launching an attack on St Vincent de Paul. I for one have a strong and abiding respect for St Vincent de Paul and the work they do. I know the work they do in my own community, especially in Bundaberg. They run a menâs shelter and two different shops that I am aware of. They do marvellous work in caring for people in the community and I like to see them supported with government grants for that work. I think the point that the previous speaker was making was that when any organisationâbe it St Vincent de Paul, Blue Care, Anglicare or any of those organisationsâsteps into the policy area the government has a right to answer that point of view. That is not to in any way impugn the reputation of St Vincent de Paul but to put the governmentâs case.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">If you take the recent budget in isolation and say, âAll these concessions have favoured the high-income earners,â you possibly need to look at that continuum since 1969. Let us take the lower end of the category, the one that my friend the member for Shortland just referred to. If you consider the continuum of tax cuts, you will find that even since the year 2000 people on the basic wage have had their tax reduced from 20 per cent to 17 per cent and to 15 per cent. So they are now paying 15c in the dollar. Not only that but the disregarded amount has been raised from $5,400 to $6,000 andâcorrect me if I am wrongâthat lower tax scale now applies up to $21,600. There has been a considerable reduction in taxation for the basic income earner. In addition, there has been an increase in the family tax benefit A and B. If you take that in net terms against the net financial position of low-income earners, many of them are paying no net tax at all. If you are going to have this debate, you have to put it into the context of the various factors that are affecting it. Fifteen cents in the dollar must be one of the lowest tax rates in the world for low-income earners.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I make another point, and it is in the wider context of what we were talking about before, in the general welfare policy area. If I read the budget papers right, we are now spending 61 per cent of the national income on health, aged care and welfare. By any standardsâand I think one of the replies to the St Vincent de Paul article made this pointâAustraliaâs care in that area is second to none in the world. By all means let us have this debate and flesh out areas of weaknessâthe government is not perfect; it makes mistakes like everyone elseâbut let us not have a carping debate that just finds a lot of little titbits and says that this is a general reflection on the care of lower income earners. Clearly it is not. The governmentâs care of lower income earners is equal to, if not better than, the previous government. I do not say that in the context of us and you but, rather, to let us have a more mature debate on how we might do a better job for these people and then let the parliamentary secretary respond to that.</para>

<para>âI want to raise the question of housing in the context of this portfolioâs estimates. If there is an area of criticismâand I hope that the honourable member for Hinkler would not think that it is just carpingâI think that housing is an area where this government, at the federal level, has tended to say, âNo, it is a state responsibility; we do not want to get involved.â Shelter is very important to Australians, especially those who are on lower incomes. There can be no sector of Australian society where it is more important than it is for Indigenous Australians. In any inquiry, whether it is on Indigenous health or Indigenous education, a holistic approach has to be taken to enable and ensure that Indigenous Australians are able to fulfil the capacities that they have. And shelter is one of those areas.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Regrettably, over time both sides of politics have made mistakes, but there is a tendency to blame the Indigenous communities themselves. The Indigenous communities say, âGive us the support, give us the environment, that enables us to go forward; give us a say in the type of housing that we want to see put in place.â Thank goodness the days of inappropriate housing design in eastern capital cities that went into the Northern Territory and the far-flung areas of this continent are over, but there should be more authority given to, and more activity in the decision making of, Indigenous communities to put in place appropriate housing for those communities.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">If I look at an electorate like mine where there is high private dwelling ownershipâpeople either buying or owning outrightâeven though it seems to be a small sector of the shelter that is provided to the community that I represent, one of the things that is neglected is access to rental accommodation. There are issues in the private market that go against the ability of low-income earners to be able to go into the private market. There is a role for public and community housing and there are certain reasons why I believe that the federal government should take a greater role in partnership with the state.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">One of the great crises to confront my local communities is that new arrivals through the refugee and humanitarian program are coming into our communities and because they have no credit reference behind themâin fact the whole culture is alien to them in the relationshipâthey miss out on access to the private market. We need to ensure that support is given to community efforts to ensure that shelter is put in place that is accessible to refugees and people coming in under the humanitarian program. That is at least one area where I implore the government to ensure that it works to a greater extent with their state colleagues.</para>

<para>âMadam Deputy Speaker, I appreciate your indulgence in explaining how the consideration in detail phase of this debate works. I am obviously new to it myself and, as the member for Hinkler reminds us, it only happens once a year. I will endeavour to address some of the points raised by members opposite. Unfortunately, I need to say to the member for Sydney that in response to her question about the data collected and used to determine out of school hours placesâshe asked about the unmet demand for child care, how we as a government calculate that, how the department calculates it and how often it is measuredâI am unable to go into that level of detail here. I felt that that was a bit of a Senate estimates process question and was surprised to hear it. I am not aware of any unequal access to child-care data amongst providers. Obviously in a marketplace there is speculation and rumour but I do not believe that you can trace any of that to information that is released by the department. The department acts in an accountable way in these things and whatever principles of corporate governance apply to the private sector would apply similarly to the public sector in dealing with this information.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I would also like to mention that the number of outside school hours places offered in the budget is 84,300. Family day care places were increased by 2,500, in-home care places were increased by 1,000, and the government is providing an extra 52,000 low-income families with additional assistance for the cost of child care. It is true that in making choices as families, child care is an important option and opportunity that needs to be made available and we as a government are doing that.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The member for Shortland, if I can move to her pointâand she has now left the chamberâdealt with the carer bonuses announced in the budget. Recipients of carers payment receive an ex gratia payment of $1,000 and carers allowance of $600. They have the carers payment and the carers allowance around the wrong way there, but those were tax-free payments which followed on from the previous undertaking last year. It is the second time we have made such payments. The member for Shortland speaks up for the veterans in her community, as she has on other occasions in the House, and I commend her for her commitment to the veterans that she represents.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">However, the governmentâs decision to provide the carer bonus is directed and targeted at those persons who qualify for both carer payment and carer allowance. These are people who have limited income and who require constant care and daily care and attention. That is a factor that the legislation highlights and I think that the member for Shortland mentioned that in her remarks as well. For us to say that those requirements of limited income and constant daily care and attention apply to the veteran community as a whole is obviously not the case. The Department of Veteransâ Affairs looks after and cares for our veterans very well I think. I am sure the member for Shortland will appreciate the point that I am making, that you cannot group veterans as a whole into specific targeted areas of people who would require daily constant care and attention and therefore would be targeted for these precise payments of carer payment and carer allowance.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I believe that the member for Hinkler has addressed the issue of the debate surrounding St Vincent de Paul. I want to place on record, as parliamentary secretary dealing in avenues of children at risk and youth homelessness, that I do appreciate the work that St Vincent de Paul does. We all know of the programs in our own electorates and the good work that they carry out in the community. But, like the member for Bowman and the member for Hinkler, I have been a little disappointed at the overtly political stand that I have seen some members of the organisationâI do not think this covers allâtake in the current debate.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The centrepiece of this budget and the issue that it hinges on is the Welfare to Work policy of this government. I do not feel that there is any better illustration of the need for the government to take serious Welfare to Work measures than an article attributed to todayâs <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>. The article concerned 30-year-old Sevasti Kelepesis and her three children. Her life came to a shattering halt four years ago when her husband died in a motorbike crash, metres from her home. She describes the experience as a living death and she describes how it affected her children. She had married at 19, she had done a dressmaking course, she had stayed home to have children, she had no skills and she was facing a time of serious emotional agony. I will continue my remarks shortly.</para>

<para>âIn this consideration in detail debate I want to ask some questions of the parliamentary secretary about the Daylesford multifunctional child-care centre in my electorate. That centre is the only child-care centre in Hepburn Shire and it provides occasional care, family day care, long day care and out of school hours care all from the one site. As part of the broadband review, the government has determined that this centre no longer quite fits the guidelines. In fact, it has been told that, unless it becomes either a long day care centre or an occasional place child-care centre, it cannot operate in any other way. If it does either of those things, the best case scenario is that it is facing a cut of $87,000, as well as losing out of school hours care places. It would no longer be able to provide that service and it would have to increase its fees in order to continue operating.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">There has been a fair bit of media attention about this. I think the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> did a very good piece outlining the concerns of parents, but we have now seen the government defer its decision on what it is going to do with this child-care centre for three months. I specifically want to ask the parliamentary secretary what the department is proposing to do in the three months. What information do you currently not have that you will have in three months time to enable you to make a decision about what to do with the funding of this centre? I would also like to know whether there are any other centres which have been part of the broadband review, not just multifunctional centres, that have had this decision deferred for three months and why. I would also like to know whether you intend, as part of that review, to consider reversing the decision.</para>

<para>âThe matter of public housing that was raised by the Deputy Speaker and the member for Scullin when he was in the chamber is, I think, an important one. I for one would take on board his appeal that the Commonwealth gets more involved, but what I have found, in the debates that I have in my own area with the state minister Rob Schwarten, who is the member for Rockhampton, is that he totally denies the amount of money that has gone into rental support. That is a very important component of the governmentâs agenda. You can argue of course that if that money had all gone into public housing then we would have a lot more housing commission homes and high-rise properties, as we have seen in Melbourne, with their own inherent social problems.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">What is important with public housing is to get a balance between high-rise, cluster developments and individual houses, and we should not see people in welfare housing put out on the edge of town in a distant suburb where there is no transport. There has to be a strategy to put welfare housing in among other housing. People should enjoy the same access to transport and civic services. We should never go back to the suburbs around Australia which became notorious in their day, although, I must admit, in recent years they have developed new imagesâElizabeth in Adelaide and Inala in Brisbane where welfare housing was done to such an extent that that became the image of the district.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We also need to recognise in QueenslandâI can speak only for the Queensland experienceâthat, while the Commonwealth component of welfare housing has been increasing, the proportionate amount of state housing has been decreasing. You really have to ask yourself whether the states are fair dinkum in their attack on the Commonwealth if they themselves are not prepared to at least match in percentage terms the Commonwealth contribution. I too am a great supporter of SAAP schemes because they provide housing for the most seriously disadvantaged. Again, Queensland for many years not only did not increase their contribution in line with the Commonwealth; worse than that, they capped the amount of housing going into that particular field. That is regrettable because there is a whole range of housing measures: the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, where there is a direct contribution from the Commonwealth to low-cost housing; the Commonwealth contribution through the rent assistance schemeâand I cannot remember the dollars but in Queensland it is something like $540 million a year; the SAAP scheme; and in some states the Commonwealth cooperates with local authorities to provide retirement units. When you take the whole range of those housing measures, you get a more holistic picture of welfare housing. I know the member for Ballarat is passionate about welfare housing and in no way do I criticise her, but let us look at the holistic picture and not just at one narrow segment.</para>

<para>âI have just heard the Parliamentary Secretary for Children and Youth Affairs say that part of the main agenda for this budget was Welfare to Work. Given that this budget will tighten the conditions for people gaining disability pensions, I would be very interested to know what the government will be doing. Will they be introducing any programs to make sure that people with disabilities are employed by Commonwealth departments? In my electorate, which has the second-highest take-up of disability pensions in the state, the Commonwealth employ only about 50 people. I would hope that they match their words with some actions to assist the employment of people with disabilities in their own departments.</para>

<para>âI will move to the remarks made by the member for Newcastle in a moment, but I want to finish my previous remarks. Yes, Welfare to Work is a centrepiece of the budget. I was talking about 30-year-old Sevasti KelepesisâI apologise for mispronouncing her name. I made the point that after a disastrous accident in which she lost her husband, this young woman was home with three small children, her husband having been the breadwinner. He had worked in the building industry and the family had depended totally on him. She was left surviving on the pension and child benefit. After 18 months of struggle, she wanted to start afresh, so she contacted Centrelink. She said: âIt changed my life. I joined their Jobs, Education and Training programâârecently moved from the Department of Family and Community Services to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relationsââthat assists customers in removing barriers in returning to work or study.â She said that she is completing her certificate II beauty course at Gymea TAFE and that she is going to pursue certificate III.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">So for many single mothers like the woman in this article retraining and re-entering the work force have brought confidence and hope. She says that she is beginning to enjoy life. That reminds me of something I have said to the member for Sydney before: you make a living by what you get, but you make a life by what you give. This is a perfect case study of that. This highlights the governmentâs Welfare to Work, and by enabling a woman like this to move from welfare to work we are making a real difference in her life. As she says, she has found happiness.</para>

<para>âI am delighted that we can agree on that. Can I address the issue of housing assistance, which was raised by the member for Scullin, I think. I remind members opposite that the government is committed to providing housing assistance. Through the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement we will provide $4.75 billion over five years, which commenced in July 2003. That is about $930 million each year. So the federal government is providing the states with funding, allowing the states to use it as they best see fit to target the appropriate people who need public housing. To say that is not happening is simply not correct.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">The member for Scullin also raised the issue of Indigenous housing in particular. I remind him that in the budget we released a new Indigenous housing package that encourages shared responsibility; it is the sum of $112.8 million. This is a package funded over four years which focuses on three key strategic initiatives. It continues a program of involving Indigenous households and communities in assessing and repairing up to 500 houses a year in about 15 communities. It will focus on encouraging the reform of Indigenous community housing through improved governance and asset and tenancy management practices. This government has also made a commitment to continue the delivery of the Army Aboriginal Community Assistance Program in at least one community a year, which is a positive demonstration of practical reconciliation. The package bolsters the joint federal and Territory governmentsâ efforts to improve the viability and sustainability of Indigenous community organisations and to improve the quality of Indigenous housing. So I hope that satisfactorily answers the questions of the member for Scullin, who is no longer in the chamber.</para>

<para>âI want to respond to put on the record that the parliamentary secretaryâs comments about the Jobs, Education and Training program are an excellent example of just what this government should be doing when it comes to moving people from welfare to work. It was an excellent program introduced by the last Labor government. But it has been consistently underspent by this government with $15 million a year allocated to Jobs, Education and Trainingâconsistently underspentâand in this very budget a limit has been put on the JET program so that if you are undertaking a course that lasts for more than a year you do not have access to JET. What an extraordinary situation! If you are undertaking training in an area of skills shortage, for exampleâif you are going to train to be a hairdresser or you want to train to be nurseâthen you are not going to have access to JET funding. Extraordinary!</para>

<para pgwide="yes">What Labor has consistently said about helping people move from welfare to work is that it is very important. We accept that most sole parents, most recipients of parenting payment, whether they are on their own or in a relationship, and most disability support pensioners would love to be in the work force if they could be. They would love to be in the work force if they had adequate education and training for the jobs that are out there and if they had adequate child care, and in the case of people on the disability support pension if they can find employers who are prepared to employ someone with a disability.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This government has turned away 20,000 young people from TAFE and 20,000 young people from university every year, and we are wondering why these young people are not moving into the work force. There are many sole parents, many people on parenting payment and many disability support pensioners whose dearest dream is to be in the work force. When this government helps them instead of blaming them for their situation, then I am sure we will see them moving into the work force.</para>

<para>âWe need to move the debate on and I am keen to assist in that process, so I just want to make a couple of brief responses. The member for Newcastle talked about help for people moving off the disability support pension. I remind her of the $80 million prevocational participation account, which supports people with disabilities by providing services to make them job ready. That is a budget announcement specifically aimed at the people you have talked about. I say to the member for Sydney that I was not trying to play petty politics over whose program is whose; I was simply saying it demonstrates that when you get out of a life of welfare and into a life of work you find success and happiness in your contribution. You and I would both agree on that.</para>

<para>âThe 2005-06 budget appropriations for sport and associated recreation activities can only be described as a cobbled together mess. Setting aside the governmentâs assistance to athletes competing in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and money to assist with the staging of the 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games, the only initiative in this budget is the funding of a number of local sporting facilities. Even if a generous view is taken of the larger of these projects by ascribing some possible regional relevance to themâsuch as the works at Kogarah and Brookvale ovals in New South Wales, and Skilled Stadium and Whitten Oval in Victoriaâthe same cannot be said for the 16 projects funded in the seat of McEwen and the five projects funded in the seat of Makin. The McEwen and Makin projects are for minor capital works at local cricket clubs, football clubs and soccer clubs. These may well be worthwhile projects but, at best, they should be the responsibility of local communities and local governments, not the federal government. There can be no possible connection between the upgrade of facilities for the Macedon and Pooraka football clubs and a national sports facilities policy. When asked to explain how decisions to fund these facilities were made, the Minister for the Arts and Sport acknowledged there was no policy framework or strategic plan. He said:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">We make decisions on the basis of advice we receive from people in various electorates.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Very selective electorates, it seems. When you add these funding decisions to those made last year as part of the Regional Partnerships program you have to ask why the government bothers to appoint a sports minister. Other ministers and even backbenchers clearly not only have the authority to make decisions on the funding of sports facilities but can invent a new sports facility funding program when they need it. This is all done with no apparent consultation with the sports minister. All this highlights is the lack of any policy work in the sports portfolio. The 2005-06 budget reflects the situation. There is no strategy for sport in the budget.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Elite athletes may feel they have been looked after, but even they should feel uneasy. Where is the strategic investment in developing the next generation of elite athletes? Where is the strategic investment in upgrading national sports facilities to ensure Australia remains competitive? The answer to both questions is that it is not there. There is no national sports development strategy. There is no national plan about anything to do with sport. The only national plan we can see in this budget is for the federal government to become involved in funding local sporting facilities at the whim of ministers, an approach that the Victorian sports minister Justin Madden has said is the opposite to the response received to previous requests for federal government assistance for the funding of sporting facilities. Minister Madden is reported as saying:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Where state sports ministers have raised the issue about facilities funding, the Federal Government said look, they will only fund international and national facilities. Local facilities are for local communities to fund.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Prime Minister has also been a bit vague on the matter. His response to a journalistâs question about possible funding for a football stadium in Newcastle was:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Well, Iâve had that proposition put to me, itâs not normally the role of a Federal Government to fund individual stadiums. But weâre considering it, I donât want to rule it out completely but itâs not the sort of thing that normally a Commonwealth Government does. But we have had a submission put to us and weâll consider it.</para>

<para>âI will turn to another issue, Madam Deputy Speaker. Even where there are important matters to be addressed, this budget ignores them. For example, the government received a report last year on the need for a new body to investigate allegations of doping in sport. Following receipt of the report, a discussion paper was produced by the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. In November last year the minister indicated in Senate estimates hearings that the government would announce a policy on this important matter as soon as possible. To this minister âas soon as possibleâ obviously does not mean this year as there is no mention of any funding for this new initiative in the 2005-06 budget. Even at the recent Senate estimates hearing the minister was unwilling to give a commitment on a timetable. This is demonstrated by his response to a series of questions from Senator Lundy on the matter. I quote:</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Senator LUNDY</inline>âMinister, it is five months since submissions closed on the DCITA discussion paper prepared in response to the Anderson inquiry. In February, you advised the committee that an announcement would be made before the budget.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kemp</inline>âI will be taking a proposal to the government in the very near future. Once that has gone through the proper governmental processes, an announcement will be made.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Senator LUNDY</inline>âGiven you made that statement in February, it implied that an announcement would be before the budget, so why has it taken so long?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kemp</inline>âIt is quite a complex issue. This issue was originally raised in 1990, I think. It seems to have gone through very many sports ministers. I have to say that this will happen on my watch. But there has been extensive consultation, which is appropriate because this is a very important initiative. As I said, I expect to be taking a proposal to the government in the very near future. Once that proposal has been ticked off by the government or modified or changed, an announcement will be made.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Senator LUNDY</inline>âSo you are taking a proposal to the next cabinet meeting. Is that what you mean?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kemp</inline>âNo, I said in the near future.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Senator LUNDY</inline>âWhy did you miss out on this budget round?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kemp</inline>âAs I said, it is quite a complex issue. It is one which we are very concerned to get right. Rather than meeting a timetable of a budget, it is best to get it right, to be quite frank.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">When asked by Senator Lundy how any new initiative in this area would be funded the minister responded as follows:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Let me say on the issue of funding that if additional funding is required, I am sure we will get that approved as part of the cabinet decision.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">This is not good government; it is not even arrogance. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> It is just further evidence of the governmentâs lack of serious intent when it comes to funding sport. As I have said in the House previously, perhaps we need another major doping scandal to force the government to act. I just hope this will not happen at the Commonwealth Games. If it does, this government will be to blame.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On the matter of drugs in sport, it is also interesting to note that, if the additional allocation made to the Australian Sports Drug Agency for testing associated with the Commonwealth Games is discounted from their 2005-06 allocation, there does not seem to be any new funding for the research or development of new testing techniques. I hope this is not the case, as we all know how quickly new drugs and new drug screening agents can be developed. If Australia is to remain a leader in this area we need to invest in research and the development of new screening techniques. This is certainly an area I will be pressing the minister on over the course of the next 12 months.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">You can see my dilemma with this budget. Not only is there apparently no sports strategy, but there is also strong evidence of a cavalier attitude to the whole question of funding. The only conclusion I can draw from the budget papers is that, like much else in the sports portfolio, 2005-06 sports budget decisions were all made by someone other than the minister. I would love to be able to wait and hear the ministerâs response but, unfortunately, I am needed in the other chamber.</para>

<para>âI presume it is not meant to be a repeat of the estimates hearing. The honourable member has just read out at some length an exchange in the Senate estimates between the Minister for the Arts and Sport and his inquisitors. I can hardly add to that. I do not know what I am supposed to reveal to the Main Committee that the minister was not able to reveal in the Senate estimates. However, we will of course refer the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to him for further consideration. As I listened to it, it seemed very foreign to my understanding and notions of the governmentâs tough on drugs in sport policies.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">We are funding all aspects of detection and oversight in a way that has not been done before. We had a 2004 election commitment to Building Australian Communities Through Sport, which outlined a number of measures to strengthen our drugs in sport policy by committing a further $13.5 million over the next four years for improved drug testing, advocacy, education and research initiatives. Under that policy the Australian Sports Drug Agency will receive $9.2 million. This includes $6.4 million for its drug testing program and $2.7 million for its education, communication and advocacy services. The honourable member made special mention of a lack of research funding, whereas I understand that we have set aside nearly $2 million for anti-doping research and to meet Australiaâs financial commitment to the World Anti-Doping Agency of about $350,000.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I refer to one other matter, and I was slow to rise to my feet. The honourable member asked me about Newcastle stadium or oval, which I am not personally familiar with. What I want to know is this: where are the local members? Why do we have the shadow minister for sport posing these questions when the people of Newcastle and the Hunter region should be able to depend on their Labor members? I would suggest that the Labor members pursue this matter a little bit more vigorously than by mere grandstanding in the Main Committee room. I know that the Penrith stadium received some $10 million and that Whitten Oval in Melbourneâa Labor held electorateâreceived $8 million. It is true, as the Prime Minister said, that the Commonwealth infrequentlyâeven rarelyâgets involved with capital expenditure of this kind, but as to the particular progress of anything to do with the Newcastle oval or stadium I suggest that the local members earn their keep.</para>

<para>âI wish to pursue the issue raised by the member for Bruce with the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, who is at the table, concerning the allocation of money described in the budget paper <inline font-style="italic">Making Australia stronger: delivering our commitments 2005-06</inline> on pages 41 and 42, where there is a list of grants to go to sporting and recreational organisations. That list comprises some 27 grants. The astonishing thing about it is that 16 of the 27 projects which have been approved under this list of successful grants go to just one single federal electorateâthe electorate of McEwen. That means that the rest of us in the other 149 electorates around the country got just 11 successful project grants under this particular set of grants which were made during the election period. I would like the minister to explain how any kind of grants program could involve 16 projects going to one electorate and 11 projects going to the whole of the rest of the 149 electorates around Australia and what process the government went throughâso what process the minister went throughâto produce such an astonishingly skewed outcome.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The second thing I would like the minister to explain to us is how, of these 16 projects which went to the electorate of McEwen, 12 of them happened to be for the same amountâ$10,000. This is truly an astonishing coincidence that someone in each of the clubsâthe Broadford Bowling Club, the Gisborne Netball Club, the Kilmore Bowling Club, the Macedon Football Club, the Wallan Football Club, the Warburton cricket and football clubs, the Yarra Glen Cricket Club et ceteraâwoke up one day and said, âYou know what we really need is $10,000 from the federal government.â That is astonishing. It is not to be believed that that could have happened. What is clearly the case is that the member for McEwen went around and offered these groups $10,000 a pop. What I want to know and what the people of Australia are entitled to know is on what basis the member for McEwen was able to do this so that the government saw fit to make 12 of these 27 project grants, each of $10,000, go to these particular sporting clubs during an election period.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">My further questions are: did the member for McEwen obtain authority from the sports minister before going around and offering $10,000 amounts to each of these groups, because this is clearly what occurred, and when did she obtain this authority? I cannot imagine other government members just walking around promising $10,000 to sporting clubs without having cleared it with the sports minister, so the question is: did she obtain this authority from the sports minister and clear it with the sports minister before she did it? The second thing is: were any other government members of the parliament given this same authority? As the member for Bruce noted, of the remaining 11 projects about six of them were in the electorate of Makin, so it would appear that the member for Makin was in on the deal as well. But the question is: were any other government members given the same authority to go around offering $10,000 amounts to these groups?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This is a very serious matter. It is no way to allocate taxpayersâ money. There appears to meâand I will be happy to be corrected by the ministerâto be absolutely no process of advertisement, application or assessment. If this sort of thing were going on in Papua New Guinea or the Solomons, you would have the World Bank or the IMF crying âGraftâ and giving them a lecture on governance standards. The idea was to hand out grants to groups during an election campaign with no process, no advertisement, no applications and no assessment on merit. It is astonishing that the Howard governmentâs standards have sunk so low that it apparently allows one of its members of parliament, and a minister at that, to go around handing out what have all the hallmarks of election bribes, and we are entitled to hear from the minister how it is that she had this authority to hand out these amounts and on what basis the electorate of McEwen got more than half the grants allocated around the whole of Australia.</para>

<para>âI raise an issue relating to the ownership of radio licences in this country. A certain company has gone around Australia and, in a number of licence areas, purchased all of the available commercial radio licences. The current act says that a commercial operator can own only two licences in a broadcast market. In Townsville, for example, there are four commercial licences and the current owner owns all four licences. That particular company is required under a special dispensation given by the ABA to divest itself of two of those four licences by September this year. I understand that many people in the radio industry are looking to see what will happen. I have been approached on a number of occasions by people who are concerned that that licensee will not be required to divest itself of two of the four licences. I have sought assurances from the government that the government will stand by the current legal position and that the company will be required by the ABA to divest itself of those two licences by September. It is important that the government upholds that, because we need to have choice and competition in the radio licence market, and it is important from the listenersâ point of view that they do have that choice.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">In relation to the introduction of digital radio in this country, it is pretty well settled that we will have the Eureka system when we do move to digital, but it is not quite settled as to who will have access in the first five years, while there is a moratorium, to those digital broadcasts. All of the current commercial operators, and the ABC of course, will have access, but it is in doubt whether a class of commercial operator operating lawfully in the AM band above 1600 kilohertz will have the option of being able to transfer to digital at the same time as the mainstream commercial broadcasters. As a matter of good public policy, that broadcaster should be able to transfer at the same time as others transfer to begin digital broadcasting.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is also interesting that we are going to face a debate as to how the digital broadcasts are actually broadcast. It would seem to me efficient if there were to be one provider of the transmission equipment who then multiplexes everybodyâs signal into the one broadcast signal so it all goes out from the one tower and that broadcasters do not have to provide all of the engineering infrastructure individually to make all of the broadcasts. I think it is very important that the government consider that, and I hope that commonsense prevails and we are able to produce an economic and efficient system.</para>

<para>âI want to draw attention to a situation that has been ongoing for four years in Newcastle, in a suburb called Stockton, since the privatisation of the mail service. In that time there have been numerous representations to the various ministers. There have been community forums and I have had at least four meetings with the regional manager trying to effect change and improvements. There has been no result in spite of every effort. There have been changes in management and changes in personnel and a new contract has been drawn up and we are still being overwhelmed with complaints from the residents.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">I would also like to ask directly to Australia Post: what has been done in response to that? And why hasnât the Postal Industry Ombudsman Bill 2005 been brought forward? It has been sitting in the pile for some time. The postal ombudsman bill would perhaps be of some comfort to my constituents, who are having no satisfaction with the delivery of mail service. The problems have included things like medical bracelets being lost and 200 items of mail being dumped on the side of a road. It has been an extreme situation that has gone on far too long with no satisfactory response from the government. One would have hoped that the postal ombudsman bill would have provided some recourse to dissatisfied customers when a private contractor is employed, but that has not been the case, because in the last parliament and in this parliament the bill has sat in a pile and has not come forward. So I would like to ask: when is that legislation going to come forward? And what has been done or will be done to support the residents of Stockton with their ongoing mail problems?</para>

She should be out there with Australia Post like all of the rest of us. I have got dozens of licensed post offices and dozens of private contractors delivering mail. Occasionally there are problemsâsometimes they are personality problems and sometimes they are performance issuesâand I take them up with Australia Post. We resolve it on the ground to the satisfaction of our constituents. It is a bit like the Newcastle Oval issue. The member for Newcastle thinks that merely by raising these issues in the Main Committee room, dumping them at the governmentâs feet, somehow she is absolved of her responsibilities as a local member of parliament.

We have had two question times, we have had two MPIs and it has not been raised. It has not been raised because it is an absurdity. The words of the budget measures paper that the member for Wills seeks to rely on reveal the absurdity of his claims. The paper stated:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Government will provide $2 million in 2004-05 to contribute to sporting and recreational organisations and facilities to give effect to election commitments.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The projects the members for Wills mentioned were in the context of an election. An election was held and now we are honouring the election promises. The amazing thing is that the member for Wills makes the greatest charges against the electorate of McEwen. I happen to have with me an extract from the Kilmore newspaper called the <inline font-style="italic">Free Press</inline> and the headline is âMoney thrown aroundâ. This is a report at the height of the recent election. It says: âMajor pre-election promises for projects in Wallan and Kilmore have been made in the lead up to Saturdayâs federal election. Labor candidate for McEwen, Jenny Beales, set the ball rolling last Thursday with a $1 million commitment towards the proposed multipurpose Wallan community centre. Then Jenny Macklin turns up to the Kilmore primary school, $1.6 million.â Further on in the article it says: âThere was plenty of enthusiasm on site at Wallan on Thursday as Ms Beales held centre stage on land where the multipurpose community centre will eventually be built.â It goes on and on.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Interestingly, a commitment is given by the Labor candidate to match the sporting clubs pledges made by the sitting member, Ms Fran Bailey. It is quite remarkable. Then we had Senator Jacinta Collins: âLabor child-care promisesââthat is from the <inline font-style="italic">Mail</inline> of 5 October. We had advertisements from Jenny Beales, the Labor candidate, about her grants and the like. Then we had the member for Wills himself. He happened to be in McEwen during the election making election promises. But from what program? There he is making promises to the honeyeatersâa lovely photo of Kelvin with the Friends of the Helmeted Honeyeater. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> The headline is: âLabor commits to honeyeater fundsâ. It says, âShadow federal environment minister, Kelvin Thomasââoops, sorry, got the name wrong; it should be Thomsonââcommitted the Labor Party to providing the Friends of the Helmeted Honeyeater with $174,000 of funding during a visit to Yellingbo on 8 September.â</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Come on! These were election commitments of the normal kind that the Labor Party matched. If you want an election commitmentâand the member for McMillan will know this wellâhow about $160 million? You want a doozey of an election commitment? We border the Latrobe Valley in Victoria. Out of the blue, the then shadow minister for resources, the member for Hunter, turned up with the Labor candidates for Gippsland and McMillan and promisedâwait for itânot $174,000 for the honeyeaters, not $1.6 million for the Ballan Primary School, not $500,000 to renovate a new long day care child-care centre. They promised a new power station in the Latrobe Valley for $160 million. The journalists said: âWhereâs the money coming from? What program?â The answer was: âNo, we donât know what technology. We donât know where the money will come from but weâre promising $160 million.â The people judged that in the same way they judge all election commitments. What credibility does the person making the promise bring to the pledge? Who will honour them? Are they worth while? Consequently, the reason that this matter has not had a hearing in the House of Representatives is that it is nonsensical and the Labor Party knows that.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We spent $38 million on the sporting commitments over the election period and $19 million went to the Labor Party. Over half the $38 million of sporting grants went to the Labor Party. What about Corio? The member for McMillan will know that $2 million went to the Skilled Stadium upgrade and Kardinia Park. The member for Gellibrand will know of the $8 million for the Whitten Oval. The member for Franklin is here. He will know about the $1 million that went to the Kingborough Sports Centre. The member for Barton will know about the $8 million for the upgrade of the Kogarah Oval. They are just some of the Labor grants under this programâthe same program that the member for Wills is attempting to discredit. It was a program that spent $38 million on honouring election commitments and slightly more than half of it went to Labor Party seats.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In the seat of McEwen, sporting commitments were given by the member and they were endorsed by the Labor candidate. Then you had a succession of shadow ministers coming and promising millions of dollarsâ$3.5 million was promised by shadow ministers for the Labor Party on behalf of the Labor candidate during the election. Quite frankly, I challenge the member for Wills to bring this issue to the House of Representatives where we can deal with it with a wider audience observing it.</para>

<para>âUnfortunately, the ministerâs reply does not go to the questions which he was asked concerning the list of grants contained in the budget paper at pages 41 and 42. For the minister to talk about election promises around the country fails to deal with the issue before him, which is that 16 of the 27 grants for the whole of Australia went to a single electorate and that 12 of those grants were for amounts of $10,000. In other words, they were not applications which came up from the organisations themselves. I can inform the minister that applications like that from the Friends of the Helmeted Honeyeater did come from the organisations themselves. But it is clearly evident that this particular member went around promising those amounts.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">My questions to him are: firstly, did the member for McEwen obtain authority from the sports minister before going around and offering $10,000 amounts and, secondly, who else was given a similar authority? Were other government members given a similar authority? I repeat to the minister that this is no way to allocate taxpayersâ money. There was no advertising, no application and no assessment. The people of this country are entitled to know on what basis this money was handed out and what authority the minister had before she went around offering these amounts to those organisations.</para>

<para>âI wish to raise the issue of Anzac Cove and the governmentâs role in the desecration of Anzac Cove in requesting road works. We all know that way back on 18 December 2003 the Prime Minister gave an unequivocal commitment. He said then:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Anzac Cove is listed. We know that still has not occurred. Not only has that not occurred but, as a result of a request from the former Minister for Veteransâ Affairs, roadworks took place at Anzac Cove that have desecrated and changed the character of the site forever. We know from historians such as Les Carlyon that this was one of the worldâs great preserved World War I battlefields, and it has been desecrated as a result of the request by the government.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We in the opposition have been determined to get to the heart of how this desecration could occur, who funded it and what the process of accountability was. From go to whoa this has been a debacle on behalf of the government. Perhaps the final insult was the decision by the minister sitting opposite in the chamber, the Minister for Veteransâ Affairs, to approve the playing of Bee Gees songs, including <inline font-style="italic">Stayinâ Alive</inline>, on the morning of the 90th commemoration of the landing. The government does not seem to understand the difference between a commemoration and a celebration, and what is appropriate.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As the shadow minister for heritage, I made a number of freedom of information requests in April going to the heart of the matter, including the funding. That has been rejected by the Department of Veteransâ Affairs. I put on the record for the parliament the extraordinary decision by Helen Brinsmead, the FOI Privacy Assistant, Legal Services Group, who wrote to me and indicated the following:</para>

Neither is the proposal for Heritage Listing.</para>

I note that some people may be forced to take the blame for this debacle, with at least one person in the department making a decision to move on or to be moved on. But the accountability stops at the top. It stops with the Prime Minister who, when we first raised questions about this in parliament, said it was âregrettableâ that the questions had even been asked.

<para>âI want to raise a couple of issues today while the Minister for Veteransâ Affairs is present. The first issue is: why has the government not honoured the service of European POWs? We have paid $25,000 to Japanese POWs or their relatives; we have paid $25,000 to the 13 Korean POWs; and we have had one former minister go to Crete to unveil a monolith there celebrating the wonderful efforts at the Battle of Crete. Many of those veterans were made POWs in Europe and underwent enormous deprivation, torture and punishment, yet none of the European POWs or their relatives have been blessed by the Commonwealth government with the $25,000 payment. This is an absolute shame. It makes a mockery of sending our troops away saying, âWeâre going to look after youâ if, when they come back, a section of them are neglected.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">My second issue is travel documentationâan absolute fiasco. I have a Cabcharge card. I imagine every member of the Public Service has a Cabcharge card. Yet veterans, many in their nineties, had to go through the humiliating experience of having to make repeat trips to their doctors because, in their haste, their doctors failed to date or sign documents, or veterans have not filled out the right little thing. So the form goes to DVA and DVA sends it back and the veteran has to make another taxi trip. We have our Cabcharge card. It is reconciled at the end of the month. Why not stop all this paperwork shuffling and reshuffling? I have spoken to DVA in Tasmania and they acknowledge that thousands of travel forms have to go back to veterans, back to the doctor and then back to DVA. For goodness sake! Give them a Cabcharge card. There is monthly reconciliation. It would solve a hell of a lot of angst being experienced by these veterans.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Another issue is the bloody-mindedness of the department. I will cite you an example. Because we have a shortage of orthopaedic and urology specialists in Tasmaniaâwe have only half a million people, not a whole stack of themâthere is no opportunity to go doctor shopping. We have a case where, because of $1,500, the Department of Veteransâ Affairs is sending a veteran to Albury where the department has found a surgeon who will charge the normal fee accepted by DVA. He has to make multiple trips to Albury for rehabilitation. His family have been sent from Hobart because the department is so bloody-minded about $1,500 and arguing about MBS Nos 48660 and 48669 in association with 48684. With a total bill in excess of $30,000, the department is arguing the toss about $1,500 and subjecting this veteran, who is going through extreme pain, to fly in a small aircraft from Melbourne to Albury, and sending his family and children over. I think this is absolutely disgraceful.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We have another example of the gold card fiasco where a veteran went to one of our private hospitals, Calvary Hospital, and needed a urologist. He was there for two hours and when the urologist was called he could not admit him because he is a gold card patient, a veteran.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">These are some of the examples I would like to highlight today: the Cabcharge and travel fiasco, the European POWs and, finally, the bloody-mindedness of arguing the toss about $1,500 and subjecting veterans to further stress and anxiety after they have done the hard yards of serving the country overseas. We send them away with great fanfare, we welcome them back with great fanfare, we commemorateâas you and I did, Minister, at Gallipoliâtheir wonderful service and courage, yet some of them are still falling through the gaps.</para>

<para>âI have a number of issues that I would like to raise with the Minister for Veteransâ Affairs. The first issue I will touch on is one that I mentioned when we considered in detail the Family and Community Services portfolio. Carers of disabled veterans who are on a supporting benefit do not receive the $1,000 carer bonus that the government allocated in the budget. The bonus is to go to carers of people on disability pensions and to carers of people on aged care pensions but, because of the different benefit, carers of disabled veterans are not entitled to that payment. I think it is a pretty shabby act that the government is not extending the $1,000 payment to these people. They are in receipt of carers allowance and will receive $600. I felt I needed to bring that to the ministerâs attention as well as bringing it to the attention of the parliamentary secretary earlier. That is something which you, as Minister for Veteransâ Affairs, need to act on. Partners of veterans look after some of the most disabled people in our community, who are really being disadvantaged by the governmentâs inaction. I trust that the minister will take that away and work on doing something to help those people.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Another issue that I want to raise relates to the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service. Through this service counselling is provided to all sons and daughters of Vietnam vets and they are eligible to seek treatment from the service regardless of their age. It is my understanding that there is a change in the pipeline. This agreement is due to expire at the end of June 2006. I believe that it was extended for a five-year period only when Bruce Scott was the Minister for Veteransâ Affairs. It is well documented that the sons and daughters of Vietnam veterans have three times the national rate of suicide. For this reason alone, it is essential that the age limit not be reintroduced. What I am putting to you, Minister, is that, no matter what age the child of a Vietnam veteran, they suffer from significant and severe psychological problems in many cases. I believe that it is very important for the department and for you as the minister to ensure that that age limit is not reintroduced. I would like you to take that away and do something about that if you could. They are two little things to start with that I would like you to look at.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I believe there are still a number of issues that were raised in the Clarke report that have not been dealt with. I would like to see some of those outstanding issues dealt with and some of the benefits that should be coming the way of veterans actually being directed there. One area that I have been very concerned about for a long timeâand I admit that it has been driven by constituents in my electorateâis the fate of veterans of atomic testing. I notice that some work has been done, such as the review, the mortality study and a cancer incidence study, but the bottom line is that we have veterans in our communities who are dying from these diseases. On a number of occasions I have shared with the parliament the fate of one of the veterans within my electorate who was exposed to radiation at Maralinga. He is one of the few surviving members of the unit he was with. He has been through a horrendous time and has had horrendous treatments, and at the same time he has had to fight to get his entitlements. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> I think it is time that the government looked at this very seriously.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the minister has put to the House that this budget is good news for veterans. In fact, this budget delivers savings; there are cutbacks in the area of veteransâ affairs. Savings in the Veteransâ Affairs portfolio exceed new budget measures. Savings total $82.3 million and the new budget measures are only $10 million. Veterans in my electorate are pretty disappointed about that and they have asked me to direct to the minister their concerns that they are not being considered in the governmentâs policies. Rather, it has become a portfolio that deals with commemoration and monuments at the expense of delivering the services and the benefits that veterans needâpeople who have gone out there for their country and had their lives disrupted in many varied ways. Minister, I would like you to look at that.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I have raised in the House in a private memberâs motion the prospect of an Australian Victoria Cross for John Simpson Kirkpatrick. The issue has enormous support within the community. The cost to the department would be minimal. There are arguments against it, but the arguments for it far outweigh any argument against it. I have already submitted to this parliament petitions containing something like 6,000 signatures. Every schoolchild learns about John Simpson and his donkey. The donkey has received his award; it is time that Simpson received his. It is time the government got behind it rather than obstructing it. Prime Minister Holt could see the virtue of it; I think it is time that the minister and the Prime Minister joined the fight.</para>

<para>âThe first issue I want to touch on deals with those ex-service personnel who were exposed to beryllium and the ongoing assessment of those people. I am concerned at the way the government is handling this matter. This has existed for a long time; I do not think any particular government or minister is responsible for the circumstances of the exposure as the dangers were not known at that time. However, we have known of the problem and the dangers for the last year or so and at every turn it seems as though the government is doing its best to keep the public, the parliament and the potential victims in the dark. We were told at first that this was an issue on board a couple of shipsâthe aircraft carrier <inline font-style="italic">Melbourne</inline> and a couple of supply ships. It then became apparent that it was more widespread and on other vessels in the Navy. It then became apparent it was also within the Air Force. We now know that the exposure to beryllium, not necessarily the illness derived from it, is widespread throughout the defence forces. At each point the government seems to have done its best to contain information rather than provide information, and that is alarming.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">In Senate estimates on 16 February this year we found out under questioning of the departmental officials that there had been eight claims for exposure to beryllium, including one death claim, and three claims under the VEA, one of which had been accepted. The officer at the Senate estimates added:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... this is the information we have been able to get from our system by doing some searching under beryllium and looking at notes. There may be some other cases which, because it was recorded as a disease that they had, we have not been able to find.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">In other words, the department had in its database at least eight claims, one of which was a death claim, plus three under the VEA, and acknowledged there may well be more. All the while the governmentâthe same officialsâwere doing their best to prevent the public knowing what was happening and that the information was in the database.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">That of itself is concerning, but what is more concerning is that this appears to be not a matter of malaise but a matter of public policy of the government. I am delighted the Minister for Veteranâs Affairs is in the chamber. I hope that she can correct the situation, because I have before me a defence minute setting out her instructions as minister. Amongst other things, it says:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Senior output executives will be asked at your direction not to communicate, in any form, with those potentially exposed, unless cleared to do so by the beryllium authorisation group to ensure a clear and considered flow of information.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">On one reading of that you might think that is a fair enough approach to ensure that alarm is not raised unnecessarily. At this point I am not being that generous, I have to say, partly because of what follows. It says:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Communication with those potentially exposed will (1) provide assurances that work is progressing on obtaining factual information.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">That is fine. But it goes on, and this is the instruction from the minister:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">(2) if requestedâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">note âif requestedâ: you do not provide the information of your own volition; you provide it only if someone is smart enough to ask you the question about something they do not know, so if they ask you the questionâ</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">furnish information related to beryllium, including use, application on items and health impact, provided that this information is already in the public domain.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">In other words, only if they ask can you tell them what is already out there, what they already know. The instruction from the minister is: âYou canât actually tell them what we know as a department or a government. You can only tell them what is already on the public record.â This has all the hallmarks of an effort by the government to cover upâand why, I do not know. I am the first to accept on the facts I have available to me that this government is not responsible. No individual minister is responsible.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">These diseases in veterans have been from their exposure to a compound over a long period of time. It is not as though anyone is trying to apportion guilt or blame for this. What we should be doing is trying to look after those veterans who have been exposed to a potentially life-threatening disease and to give them assurance and support. Why does the government want to go through this cover-up process? Extracting teeth is easier than getting information from the government on these matters, as veterans affected by this have commented to my office. I invite the minister to give a commitment, hopefully, about that and about a more open approach to dealing with beryllium and ensuring that potential victimsâthose who have been exposedâare readily identified and provided with the support and assistance that they should have, rather than putting this issue under some cone of silence.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The two other issues that I hope to comment on quickly are in relation to veterans of the Battle of Long Tan that I have raised these previously. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> I will endeavour to be very brief. One of those issues relates to the citations and Australian awards that were given to those involved. A long series of questions have been on notice that I and other members on this side of the parliament have raised. I assume that the minister is well briefed on them. Those questions deal with the fact that Colonel Smithâs recommendations for awards for those people who were in the middle of the battle were seriously downgraded.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I remind people that this was a conflict in which about 100 Australian soldiers were ambushed by about 2,500 Vietnamese. We suffered our heaviest casualties in the Vietnam War on that day. Eighteen Australian troops and 245 Vietnamese died in that conflict. Great valour was demonstrated by the people on the battlefield. People who demonstrated that great valour on the battlefield were mentioned in dispatches. In the same gazette that mentioned those heroes in dispatches, the postal clerk in Vung Tau got mentioned in dispatches. I am quite sure the postal clerk in Vung Tau did a good job, but to tell me that he deserved the same recognition as the bravest people in that battle is an insult. The government has refused to do anything about it since these documents were released in 1996. It should do something to correct that.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The second issue in relation to those people at the Battle of Long Tan relates to a matter that I asked the minister on notice on 9 February. It concerns the wearing of the individual citations awarded to those people by the then government of the Republic of Vietnam. I invite the minister to make a clear, unequivocal and unambiguous statement about the situation with respect to those veterans who were awarded individual citations by the then government of the Republic of Vietnam as a result of the Long Tan battle. My question at the time was whether all of those people had been granted approval to wear that citation. The ministerâs cute answer was that she could not say whether all of them had, but she did not actually say whether any had.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">So I invite the minister now to tell us whether or not any of those people who have been given individual citations by the then government of the Republic of Vietnam have in fact been authorised to wear the medals, in what circumstances and what are the criteria. The least this government can do now is make sure that those veterans, who are getting on in age, have the opportunity to proudly wear the citations they received for a battle which, under any circumstances, was one of the most horrific that Australians were involved in during the Vietnam War. I look forward to the ministerâs commitments to those things.</para>

<para>âI thank people for their contributions to the debate. I will start with the comments by the member for Grayndler. He said that there was desecration and that we had requested roadworks. He is plainly misinformed. The road that was requested by the previous minister went from Lone Pine to Chunuk Bair and back to Kemalyeri.</para>

The member for Grayndler then went on to the Bee Gees, having completely made a hash of his claims about battlefield desecration and so on, which were contradicted by two respected historians. With regard to the Bee Gees, I would like to explain to the House that they did not form part of the formal commemorative service, nor the prelude. The prelude was to be played at 11 oâclock. Of course, the dawn service started with a prelude and the formal service. There were thousands of people at choke points trying to enter the site. Others had been there for many hours and had set up their rucksacks, sleeping-bags and so on. People were being trodden on. The crowd control advisers employed by the Department of Veteransâ Affairs to ensure that people were safe advised that everybody had to be sitting or standing or there would beâ</para>

<para>âYes, it is the member for Grayndler. Well, I will give it one last go. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> The expert crowd control advice was that people should be sitting or standing so that others could enter the commemorative site. That resulted in the need, for some four to six hours in the dark and in the extreme cold, to give people some form of diversion. You cannot ask people to stand in the dark in the cold for four to six hours without some form of diversion. So it was decided, against the plan which was that there would only be the prelude and the commemorative service, that there would be some form of diversionâmusic. The music that was to hand that was a form of entertainment was by the Bee Gees. We will in future have a better choice of music but it will still be entertainment, because people cannot stand in the dark for four hours in the freezing cold and not have some form of entertainment. This was certainly on the front of every newspaper in Australia and, for the edification of the member for Grayndler, I would like to read some of the comments that those present made about the road. We had quite a range of people attending. The Chief of the Defence Force, General Cosgrove, said:</para>

<para pgwide="yes">The member for Franklin has raised the concern of prisoners of war who were incarcerated in Europe. The payment of $25,000 was to Japanese and Korean POWs, as he rightly said, in recognition of the unique circumstances of their incarceration. That is not to say that POWs elsewhere did not suffer. They did indeed; there is no doubt about that. Every POW deserves our greatest respect for what they went through. However, it has always been emphasised that prisoners of war of the Japanese had virtually no protection under international law. They suffered extreme cruelty in inhumane conditions. As I said, that is not to make any comparison amongst POWs. To do so would be quite unacceptable. Having just led a veterans group to Borneo, I know it is quite something to hear of the Sandakan marches, for instance. I know the member for Franklin, with his interest in military history, would be aware that of some 2,000 Australians who were transported to Sandakan only six survived. I think that is silent testimony to the absolute cruelty, deprivation and starvation that those POWs were subjected to. For that reason it was decided to make the payment available to those who had been subjected to Japanese incarceration. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline>
</para>
<para pgwide="yes">With regard to travel documentation, I will look again at the points that the member for Franklin has made. I certainly agree that we want to make things as streamlined as possible, particularly for elderly veterans. I will look again at what can be done and I will come back directly to the memberâs office, if I may.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Access for veterans in Tasmania is certainly difficult. The member for Franklin is obviously as concerned about the veteran community there as we are. Of the approximately 10,000 medical specialists around Australia there are 383 that we are aware of who will not accept the gold card, and there are some 21 in Tasmania. We recently increased fees for medical specialists; we allocated $157 million over four years. That is a 15 per cent increase on the Medicare scheduled fee for consultations and 20 per cent for procedures. Our general feedback is that most medical specialists see that as a fair outcome. However, there are special workplace issues in Tasmania that overlay that. I am not seeking in any way to blame anybody else; it is a shared responsibility. Recently in the state budget the state government announcedâcorrect me if I am wrongâ$1.2 billion in additional health funding, of which there is a significant amount to attract 25 additional specialists. They will not focus entirely on the veterans communityâobviously notâbut we believe that in the short to medium term that will improve the situation not only for veterans but also for everybody in Tasmania.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As the member for Franklin will be aware, under the Veteransâ Entitlements Act 1986 the department cannot allow veterans to pay a gap, so the medical specialist needs to accept the gold card or make some other arrangement. What we will do, though, is fly every veteranâI realise that it might not always be convenientâto expert medical care. Of the 77 patients who were flown out of Tasmania in 2004 some 67 were flown out because there was no medical specialist available in Tasmania, not because there was a lack of acceptance of the gold card. Ten of those flights certainly were as a result of a lack of acceptance of the gold card but the overwhelming majority were because of the work force situation in Tasmania.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would like to assure the member for Franklin, who I know cares greatly about his veterans community, that we will continue to work with the state government down there. We will continue to explore every way in which we can do so but we will not allow veterans to suffer in any way. It may mean that on occasions we have to transport them by air. There are many other regional and rural centres around Australia where not only veterans have to be transported but also others have to drive considerable distances. I know that that is not necessarily a consolation but the problem is not necessarily unique to Tasmania. We will try to work with the ex-service community, the state government and medical specialists to improve the situation. I thank the member for Franklin for that question.</para>

We have agreed that we will follow the advice of experts on that particular issue, but I hear the member for Shortlandâs comment.</para>

<para>âThe study in the United Kingdom by the National Radiological Protection Board of cancer incidents amongst British nuclear test participants found that they did not face a greater risk of cancer. That UK study found that a slightly increased risk of leukaemia could not be ruled out. We are obviously pursuing our own study but I want to reassure the member for Shortland that there have been studies done in other areas of large populations, and that was the outcome. But the commitment from the government, made through the Clarke report, is that when the study is completed we will respond positively to the outcome.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">In terms of the overall budget figures, the member for Shortland claims that the savings have exceeded expenditure. I did maths and I know that you cannot get a bigger amount unless expenditure is greater than savings. This is the greatest amount ever spent on veterans in Australia. The budget for this year is $10.8 billionâan increase of $278 million over last year. There is no way we could do that if the savings were greater than the expenditure. The reality is that we are spending record amounts on veterans and I am sure that the member for Shortland would be heartened by that. She would like to know that we are spending $4.6 billion on health care and $6.1 billion on compensation and income support across a whole range of portfolios. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline>
</para>
<para pgwide="yes">So there is no doubt that this budget expands the expenditure for veterans. One of the comments that the member for Shortland made was that too much was spent on monuments and not enough on veteransâ health care, income support and so on. Let me share with the member for Shortland the total amount for commemoration, which includes the maintenance of war graves around the world through the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, which I am sure members on the other side are very supportive of. The whole of that budget comes to $31 million. The overall budget is $10.8 billion. This is not a government that has an emphasis on commemoration, appropriate as it is to pay tribute to the sacrifice of our veterans in all conflicts, but it is a very small part of the $10.8 billion budget.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">With regard to Simpson, like the member for Shortland I share a great regard for Simpson and believe that were it possible he should be honoured further. However, the honours and awards list for the First World War closed some 80 years ago, and there is no capacity to reopen it. Having said that, there have been many governments in the interim who have faced this very question and found it equally difficult. That is not to say that we do not have regard for Simpson; he has been honoured in many other ways. There is a statue of him outside the War Memorial. He is almost part of Australian myth now because of his courageous exploits, so he is honoured in many other aspects.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would like to move now to the questions about beryllium by the member for Brisbane. Firstly, I reassure the member for Brisbane that serious illness from beryllium is very rare. On the Workers Compensation Dust Diseases Board of New South Wales list of those affected there is only one. So beryllium related illness is, thankfully, very rare. We have had a number of claims, and we have made no secret about those. I have given those in the House under the two acts, the Safety, Rehabilitation Compensation Act and the Veteransâ Entitlements Act. I would add that none of those five claims where beryllium was a clear factor related to Navy, but there are certainly other claims under the Safety, Rehabilitation Compensation Act that relate to the Royal Australian Navy. I would just like to correct that.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The member for Brisbane claimed that there has been a cover-up. There has been no cover-up at all about this issue, quite the reverse. We have set up a beryllium information service. The member for Brisbane said that we should not furnish information that is only in the public domain. Why wouldnât you? Are we to alarm people with unpublished studies and conjecture? The information must be accurate to give people the opportunity to make decisions about their future care if need be. The information must be accurate, not the wild accusations that we sawâand I am sure the member for Brisbane would agree with meâwhich caused great alarm. Figures such as a six per cent death rate were quoted. That was very old, historical data that was not appropriate to the current situation. So we established the beryllium information service whereby all members who rang or registered received one-on-one information as appropriate. If all they wanted was some general information about beryllium they were given that, and certainly it was information that was on the public record. If, however, they said they believed they had an illness or an injury related to their service, they were immediately directed to the Department of Veteransâ Affairs to make a claim. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline>
</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Since then 21 individuals have made claims with the Department of Veteransâ Affairs as a result of contact with the beryllium information service. So there is no cover-up. We want to give people concise, accurate information, depending on whether they are making a general inquiry or whether they believe they have a serious health impact, such that they are not, as somebody we discovered, going to a doctor to have whatever testsâand many of the physicians were not as well informed as others about a very rare and unusual illness, which is to be expected. Perhaps one could understand that. The beryllium information service was set up to give people accurate, sound information and to reduce their level of anxiety. All of those who have contacted it have been advised, if they have a health impact as a result of their Defence Force service, to make a claim with the Department of Veteransâ Affairs. Obviously, while I do not have access to those names, and nor should I, the department does and there is ongoing contact with those who have registered.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Following the Battle of Long Tan in August 1966, the South Vietnamese government indicated its intent to recognise 22 Australian veterans in the battle for gallantry and distinguished service. However, as the member highlighted, due to a strict foreign awards acceptance and wearing policy, those awards were never made. Australian governments since that timeâthat covers all governmentsâhave had difficulty resolving this issue, particularly with the government of the day having changed significantly in South Vietnam. In June 2004 the government agreed that a rare discretion in the principle of the honours and awards system could be employed to allow these medals to be worn. A list of intended awards established following the battle was also identified. The Governor-Generalâs approval was gained to allow these veterans to wear the awards offered by the South Vietnamese government at the time. I will investigate further the concerns raised by the member for Brisbane with regard to Long Tan. I know that next year is the 30th anniversary, and obviously we want to try to recognise that and satisfy concerns to the extent that we can. So I will report back to the member for Brisbane in due course.</para>

<para>âI can certainly look at it again, but in 1996 the government established an End of War List for Vietnam, as the member for Brisbane would know, to review at the highest level the awards that were subsequently downgraded in Australia. The awards in question apparently did not fit into that category. The decisions taken with regard to the appropriate level of award for Colonel Smith and his colleagues were made by the chain of command well before final recommendations reached Australia. During the preparation of the End of War List, advice was received from the Queenâs private secretary that imperial awards recommended at the time of the Vietnam War could not be used. The Order of the British Empire statutes have been amended since 1992 to exclude Australians, and this also applied to bravery and gallantry awards. Consequently, Australian awards were used, and the End of War List for Vietnam was approved by the Governor-General in June 1998, identifying 81 individuals who met the policy. There was an independent review panel established in 1999 to further review the list. Amongst other findings and recommendations, the review satisfied itself that the possibility of using imperial awards was no longer open and the End of War List for Vietnam was closed. However, I will look at the matter again.</para>

<para>âI want to start in the area of vocational education and training. First of all, I would appreciate it if the minister could explain some discrepancies in figures that have been put out by his junior minister, Minister Hardgrave. In a press release on 11 May he said that the government will contribute $4.4 billion to the states and territories for vocational education and training. But most recently the same minister put out a press release on 10 Juneâjust last Fridayâsaying that the Australian governmentâs offer is worth $4.97 billion. Where did the extra $572 million come from, given that the appropriation in the bill that has gone through the House today was $4.4 billion? Can the minister explain where that $572 million discrepancy comes from? Are we actually talking about $4.4 billion? I think we probably are.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">On a related issue in the same area, Minister Nelson in his own budget press release on 10 May said that this is an annual average real increase in funding of 4.1 per cent over the quadrennium compared to 2004. However, once again, the figures detailed in the bill that went through the House this morning only represent an average annual nominal increase of 3.3 per cent over the same period. Could the minister explain how he gets an average real increase of 4.1 per cent when the numbers presented in the bill give us a nominal increase of 3.3 per cent? At this stage we would appreciate the minister clarifying those different claims.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On the related issue of the offer made to the states and territories, in the letter that Minister Nelson wrote to the state ministers it was said that 128,000 new training places would be funded as a result of the offer being made to the states and territories. Are the 71,000 training places which were offered in 2003 andâhe would rememberâsubsequently withdrawn counted in the 128,000? Can you clarify that for me as well?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I will finish up on the skills side. You would also be aware that we have some concerns about the discrepancy in the funding for the technical colleges. In the promise that was made during the election campaign the government committed to spending $289 million over the four financial years ending 2007-08. The current budget has spending of a bit over $33 million less than the government promised during the election campaign. I would appreciate it if the minister could explain how that discrepancy has arisen. It is one of the things that we as yet have not been unable to get any clarity on.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In case the advice from the department is to compare four years with the five years in the budget figures, I am comparing two lots of four years, not the five years in the budget papers. When the minister gives us an explanation for that downward revision, he might also explain how the government has determined the budget figure. Was there a per student cost arrived at in making the estimate of what the technical colleges would eventually cost? If so, what is the actual funding for each student going to be? Can the minister explain what the government has decided to pay per student for the technical colleges? Can the minister also explain whether any component of this includes the general recurrent funding under the SES system for non-government schools? Finally, in relation to the technical college costs, how much of the budget expenditure is likely or is estimated to be on capital expenditure? I would appreciate a breakdown of capital and recurrent expenditure for the technical colleges.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I have a couple of final questions on the technical colleges. We have had a number of answers about the fees able to be charged by the Australian technical colleges, but I am particularly interested in the rules that the government is going to set for technical college student fees on greenfield sitesâplaces where there is not an existing TAFE or school but where it is a whole new facility. What will be the rules that the government sets for fees at those technical colleges? A subsidiary question to that is: how will the fees for the training componentâthat is, for certificate II or IIIâthat the student will undertake be determined? Will they just pay whatever fees are charged by the partner registered training organisation? Is that what the government has agreed to do? If the minister could provide an explanation about these details on the funding of the technical colleges, it would be appreciated.</para>

<para>âFirstly, in relation to the ANTA offer, the Australian National Training Authority agreement traditionally has run for a three-year period. We had to roll the agreement over because of failure by the states to sign in December 2003. We are in a situation at the moment where we have to roll it over, essentially for 12 months. The $4.4 billion figure was indeed accurate for three years, but, of course, we are required to fund for the second half of this calendar year and then for three further years. So the total offer for the period of the agreement, which will extend from 1 July 2005 to 31 December 2008, will be $4.97 billion. The $527 million includes half of one full calendar year and also $39.2 million, which is of the $42 million committed in the Welfare to Work programs specifically targeting training.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I really do not understand the basis upon which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition puts the assertions in relation to nominal increases, but for the life of the agreement the real increases in the offer are 2.3 per cent for this year, 4.3 per cent for 2006, 4.5 per cent for 2007 and 4.7 per cent for 2008. We are of course requiring the states to match what is being offered by the Commonwealth.</para>

<para>âI just want to get this clear, because we have in front of us the amounts that were in the legislation that we debated this morning which do not provide those sorts of percentage increases. So where else is the money coming from if it is not related to the amounts that were in the bill this morning? It also goes to the pointâand maybe the member for Hasluck got it wrongâthat yesterday in the debate he said that the extra $570 million was actually covered off by the first six months of 2005. Is that where the minister gets the extra $570 million from? Otherwise I cannot see where that money is. Has the member for Hasluck got it right? Has that money already been spent?</para>

It includes additional funding of $176 million and the states and territories will be required to match the $170 million of additional funding. These additional places will be targeted as priority places such as traditional trades, areas of skill shortages, people with disabilities, Indigenous Australians and mature age people. It also includes $38.9 million over the period of the agreement for the Welfare to Work program. So in total that is for all of 2005, the first and then the second six months of course.

<para>âA number of the 71,000 places which were offered in 2003 have already been committed. Some of the 71,000 are rolled over to continue for this offering in the 128,200. It is worth noting that, when the states and territories refused to sign the agreement in December 2003, to ensure that not a single place was lost from the Commonwealth funding at least, we went directly to tender to the market, which is something we may well revisit if we reach an intransigent position with the states and territories.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">Funding for Australian technical colleges was announced during the election campaign in 2004 as $289.1 million over the period 2005-06 to 2007-08. Naturally, we had to make a number of assumptions around the implementation of the tech colleges and some of those have changed since that time, which impacts on the estimates provided both in the 2004-05 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook released in December last year and subsequently in the budget documents.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Over the next five years, we are budgeting $351 million, which represents the amount agreed on with the Department of Finance and Administration. There are a number of assumptions which we make in terms of this figuring. I think it needs to be understood that we are proposing to establish 24 technical colleges and, until all of the proposals are received and carefully evaluated, it is difficult to be precise to the last dollar as to exactly how much each of themâand, indeed, collectivelyâwill cost, particularly in terms of the phasing in and their establishment. The election costing assumed all 24 colleges would commence in 2006, while the mid-year economic forecast costing provides for a more realistic staggered start. Perhaps six colleges will be established in 2006. It may well be more than that.</para>

<para>âThe costings are essentially based on the assumption that about six will be established in 2006 and then other colleges will subsequently be established in 2007 and 2008. Clearly, some will be established more quickly than others. In particular, the greenfield site colleges will take longer than those that use established schools and training facilities. The costings reflect the full complement of 300 students. We have said publicly that between 300 and 350 students will attend the colleges from their second year of operation. In the first year of intake, you will have about half that number.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">There will also be a variation to the type of college that will be established. The election costing assumed that, of the 24 established, half would be primarily government schools and half would be non-government. Until we have formally evaluated the proposals that have been received, it will not be absolutely clear what the make-up will be in terms of government versus non-government schools. There may need to be a revision to the amount of capital funding that could be required for individual colleges depending on whether the colleges operate from established facilities, as I said, or whether they are established at a greenfield site.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In the election costing, it was assumed that $10 million would be required for new colleges and $8 million for already established ones, with an expenditure spread of 50 per cent, 25 per cent, 12.5 per cent and 12.5 per cent respectively over each of the four years. In the final costing, it was assumed that $15 million would be required for new colleges and $5 million for already established colleges spread evenly over four years to reflect the build-up of students and implementation.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The change to costings will have absolutely no impact on the number of students who will be assisted by the colleges. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> I would not be surprised over the next two to three years if the costings move, depending on the nature of the proposals which are finally accepted and supported by the government. I can assure the opposition that the government will deliver on these 24 technical colleges. As you can see, at this stage we have budgeted for $351 million over five years.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Where there are non-government schools involved they will attract the non-government funding, as they normally do. I will have to take on notice the question of the funding per student. You can expect that the total funding per student will be precisely that which generally would apply in any other school setting, although, given the capital intensive nature of a technical college, the capital component would be higherâbut I will take that on notice.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">With respect to the fees at greenfield sites versus the fees at established sites, as I have said publicly, the fees will generally be those that would apply in a public school setting. If there is involved in the consortium a non-government schoolâwhether it be a Catholic or an independent schoolâwhich normally charges a fee, we will expect that they will charge the usual fees; certainly no more. Where a non-government school is involved and it is the principal school, we will require those who put proposals to us to let us know the precise equity measures they intend to implement to ensure that students are not precluded from attending a technical college because of financial circumstances. The fees for regional training organisations, RTOs, involved in the technical colleges, I presume, would be the same as would normally apply.</para>

We also expect that the states and territories will ensure that they make an appropriate contribution to the funding arrangements for the education of students for which they have primary responsibility. In other words, we are not prepared to accept that a student will move from being 88 per cent funded in a traditional government school setting to a technical college and that the state will not, in some way, continue to make a contribution to support the education of that child.</para>

<para>âThe issue I wish to raise with the minister comes from an email that I have received from a constituent within my electorate. He graduated from University of Newcastle and worked for 25 years in the business and law faculty there. His children attended that universityâas did I and many other members in this House, and our children as well. He raised with me his concern that one-quarter of the staff of his old faculty of business and law are to leave. He is very concerned about this and makes the point that this department has always operated at a very high level. The courses have been in great demand and he sees it as a substantial loss because 25 per cent of the academics, through no fault of their own, will lose their jobs. He is very concerned about the quality of education and the impact that this will have on people attending the university. I share his concern.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Newcastle and the Central Coastâbecause, as you are aware, there are two campusesâis an area that has a significant population. The University of Newcastle has a reputation of being one of the finest non-metropolitan universitiesâa point that Duncan Macdonald raises in the email that he sent me. The Central Coast in particular is an area with very low participation in tertiary education and here we have a university that is being gutted. Minister, I understand that some of the issues do not relate to your actions. There is the issue of regional funding for the University of Newcastle. People in the Hunter, Central Coast and North Coast areas, which I represent, feel that you have let them down. They are the people who access that university. We would argue strongly that you really do need to revisit that matter.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The reason I am concentrating on this email is that this particular constituent, Duncan Macdonald, believes that there should be a real inquiry into the background of the situation and that you should not just allow the university to be decimated in this way. He feels that, if there are people who are responsible, they should be identified and the surrounding circumstances should be revealed publicly. He questions why you did not have your eye on the ball and why you let this happen. He believes that your role as the federal minister is to oversee universities. He calls for government assistance to overcome the problem. I support that view 100 per cent. I do not see why people living in the region I representâpeople who are already quite disadvantaged from an educational point of viewâshould be further disadvantaged. You are the Minister for Education, Science and Training, the minister for all students in all areas in Australia. If you are concerned for the future of education in this country, you will step in and deal with the issue of funding the University of Newcastle. There should be no buck passing, no smart, clever words and no sweeping issues under the carpet. There should be action. That is what we wantâaction. We want you to do something. We do not want rhetoric.</para>

<para>âThe member for Shortland in this regard is a layperson, but the financial auditing and responsibility for the University of Newcastle and universities throughout the country, with the exception of the ANU and the Australian Maritime College, lie with state governments. At this very moment I am in the process of trying to drive a reform which transfers the governance, management, auditing and financial responsibility across to the tier of government which actually drives the policy and delivers 98 per cent of the public fundingâthat is, the Commonwealth government. The New South Wales government, to its credit, has already agreed to transfer its universities in that sense, not its real estate but responsibility for financial auditing, across to the Commonwealth government.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The second point is that the editorial view of the <inline font-style="italic">Newcastle Herald</inline>, which I support, is that the university cannot expect that any other organisation is responsible for the circumstances in which it finds itself. John Price, one of the state Labor members, is on the council of the University of Newcastle. He and the other members of the council and the previous vice-chancellor need to takeâin my view, and in fact under the reforms that we have just managed to get through, particularly with the governance reforms in the new regimeâresponsibility for the circumstances. But there needs to be recognition that a university cannot simply get revenue from a whole variety of sources, mismanage those resources and then expect the everyday Australian taxpayer to give them more money. Further to that, at the University of Newcastle, staffing costs are 60 to 65 per cent. The national standard is 50 to 60 per cent, which has been recognised by the Vice-Chancellor, Professor Saunders, and indeed again by the <inline font-style="italic">Newcastle Herald</inline> in its editorials.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The other thing in terms of staffing at Newcastle University is that the university will receive $190 million from the Commonwealth governmentâthe Australian governmentâthis year. It received $168 million last year. It will receive an additional $52 million in increased Commonwealth Grants Scheme payments and increased HECS payments over the next three years, which were not universally supported here in the parliament. I might also add that when I made the decision to allocate the additional places as a product of the higher education reforms, whilst Newcastle University then had only seven per cent of all of the government supported places in the state of New South Wales, it was allocated 13 per cent of all of the new placesâ1,266 places. As you know, most of those placesâin fact, almost a thousand of themâwent to the Ourimbah campus. In terms of regional loading, one of the many features of the reforms was that we recognised that regional universities face quite different challenges from those of larger, frequently research intensive universities in suburban and built-up settings. So, using the statistical dataâcensus collection data and other thingsâwe came up with a definition, in terms of distance from a population centre and the size of that population centre, to define a regional university for the purpose of regional loading.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Wollongong University receives the smallest amount, which is 1Â½ per cent of its Commonwealth Grants Scheme funding. The reason it does is that it services 257,000 people. The Sydney statistical district for Newcastle Universityâs Callaghan campus is half a million people and for the Ourimbah campus, which is in Wyong-Gosford, it is 297,000 people. Even if Newcastle University were to get 1.25 per cent or 1.5 per cent of Commonwealth Grants Scheme funding as regional loading, it would receive an additional $1.3 million a year. It has a deficit at the moment of $25 million, $18 million of which relates to unfunded superannuation liabilities and long service leave entitlements, and it has more than another $7 million related to noncompliance with the financial management act.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I might also point out that with Newcastle University it was not until the external auditors came and had a look at the place that the university even realised that they had the financial problems that they have. Of the things that are being scrapped in terms of staffing, 148 of the subjects that are being scrapped have not even been taught for the last three years, even though there are people employed to teach them; 120 of the subjects that are being scrapped have fewer than 16 students enrolled in them. The reality is I have given them a $25 million advance which will help them and I am prepared to assist the university in any reasonable way I possibly can, but the average shop assistant, truck driver, teacher or policemanâthe average personâworking in the Hunter region needs to be reassured their money is being wisely and efficiently spent. I have got to say that, according to the vice-chancellor, it has not been. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI have a couple of questions on higher education. The minister would know the response of the universities to his decision not to proceed with indexation of our universities and he has been recently quoted in the media as saying that he has ruled out any further HECS increases, so I wonder if he would confirm here tonight that he will not agree to any further HECS increase above that which the parliament agreed to in 2003. On a related matter, because it also goes to the financing of universities, I wonder whether the minister will also rule out any increase in the current 35 per cent cap on Australian full fee paying undergraduate students, because obviously that is another avenue of revenue for our universities. Perhaps the minister would respond to those questions on two areas of university finance.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Another major issue that goes to the services provided at our university campuses is, of course, the governmentâs proposal in the voluntary student unionism legislation to do away with the compulsory fee that students pay. The minister would have seen comments made by one of his colleagues, the member for Kingston, who said:</para>

<para pgwide="yes">I realise that time is getting away from us, but the issue of nuclear waste dumps is a very important area of public discussion at the moment. I am sure the minister will remember back in January when he said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">It will be our determination to see that the waste will be stored at that off shore site, but to ensure that we donât fall behind the deadlines we will also be examining a Commonwealth owned remote on shore site as a fallback option, just in case for some reason the off shore site is not suitable.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I would appreciate it if the minister would tell us what has happened since January, given we are now up to June. As I am sure he is very well aware, the Prime Minister has announced that there will be no offshore sites. Could he explain how he and the government have come to the position that there will be no offshore sites? Is it because the offshore sites would not agree to it, because the government could not find any that were suitable or because of some other reason?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On another question related to nuclear waste dumps, the minister would be aware that several states have passed legislation opposing nuclear waste dumps and the transportation of nuclear waste in their states. As I understand it, the minister is saying that the government intend to find an onshore site. How do the government intend dealing with the state legislation? Are they going to overrule state or territory legislation? I would appreciate it if the minister couldâ</para>

<para>âBefore the suspension I was asking whether the minister anticipates having to introduce legislation that will somehow override state legislation and how he intends to get around state and territory legislation if the nuclear waste dump is to be located in one of the states or territories where they have legislation that rules out a dump or transportation of nuclear waste. The final issue on nuclear waste about which I want to ask relates once again to the ministerâs 24 January press conference, when he said that he intended to make an announcement âas soon as practicableâ. He went on to say:</para>

<para pgwide="yes">I have a couple of final issues on schools and literacy vouchers. The minister would understand that we have had a bit of a debate about the rules the government has put in place requiring that a member of the government attend flagpole opening services. I wonder why the government changed the conditions. As the minister would know, originally the rules said that a federal member of parliament needed to attend the opening ceremony. But someone in the government, and the minister might like to say who, decided that the rules would be changed to a member of the government having to attend. I wonder whether the minister would consider introducing a pro forma, allowing non-government members and senators to conduct ceremonies similar to those that apply to the National Service Medal. I think that, when we are talking about national symbols such as the flag and the National Service Medal, it might assist in the process of making sure that we do not politicise the flag.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">One of the practical problems that exists at the moment with the governmentâs requirement that a member of the government must attend these flag-raising ceremonies is that often schools are not reimbursed for the cost of the flagpole until a member of the government can be found. I wonder whether the minister would take this suggestion, which is being put forward in good faith, and consider it.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The final question I want to ask is on literacy vouchers. Could the minister tell us how many parents of eligible children have made contact with the brokers that have been chosen to access literacy vouchers in each state and territory? Could you let us know those figures? How many children in each state and territory have so far received any tutoring?</para>

<para>âThe government certainly has no intention of proposing to increase HECS above and beyond the changes that were introduced and agreed to late in 2003. I repeat what I have said publicly, and that is that it has been difficult enoughâit has been opposed by everybody on the other side, although I notice now it is Labor policy to accept the 25 per cent increase where it has been appliedâand we will not be moving to increase HECS.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">The full fee cap is currently that no more than 35 per cent of the students enrolled in a particular course should be full fee paying Australian students. We will not be increasing that cap. There are some issues with some universities that are running colleges of one sort or another on campuses. They are currently trying to get higher education provider status so they can get access to fee help. They are encouraging me to shift that cap, and I am refusing to do so.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On voluntary student unionism, all I can say to the opposition is: do not believe everything you read in the papers. The only concern being put to me about VSU is that it may not be implemented fully given the strident opposition of the Australian Labor Party and others to it. In fact, the government will not be entertaining any amendments to the voluntary student unionism legislation.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On nuclear waste, the governmentâs position is as I have stated and as was accurately repeated by the member for Jagajaga. The governmentâs clear preference, which we have been closely examining, is for the disposal of low-level and intermediate-level waste at an offshore facility. We have concurrently been examining possible onshore sites so that if a suitable onshore site was not able to be accessed for the disposal of this waste then we will not be behind schedule.

<para>âThe problem that the member for Jagajaga has is that she believes what she reads in the newspapers. There was a newspaper report which purported a particular position on nuclear waste to the Prime Minister. As far as I am concerned, and so far as I know, there is no substance to that at all. The government will make a decision very shortly. When the government has made a decision I will be making an announcement as to precisely what that is. I can only restate that the government has ruled out Woomera in South Australia. Having said that, we have been examining appropriate offshore sites and concurrently looking at possible onshore sites just in case it is not feasible, for a variety of reasons, to use an offshore facility.</para>

</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">It is the governmentâs policy, given the parochial intransigence and stubborn nature of a number of the state and territory leaders, that the states and territories be required to store their own low-level and intermediate-level waste, and Western Australia and Queensland need to be commended for doing just that. I should point out that the New South Wales government currently stores low-and intermediate-level waste at the EPA at Lidcombe, not to mention the University of Sydney and a number of other universities and hospitals. In Melbourne, waste is stored at the Peter McCallum clinic.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As to whether state legislation can be overridden or not, that issue will be addressed when I make a formal announcement on the nuclear storage issue, which, as I say, will be very soon. These issues are very complex for a whole variety of scientific, geological, legal and other reasons, but I can assure you that I look forward to the support of the opposition when the announcement is made.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">With regard to literacy vouchers, at this stage I have sought the cooperation of the state and territory ministers in making sure that all parents of eligible students are aware that their students are eligible and how they might receive support. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> I think we have had over 7,000 parent inquiries to our hotline, and I understand that as of last week we had almost 2,000 students actually being tutored.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">I announced in April 2003 that I thought it would be a good idea if Australian schools flew the Australian flag. Anticipating that there would immediately be calls for the federal government to fund the flagpoles, I then instructed my department that we would make funding availableâeven though it is a state government responsibilityâfor the flagpoles. We funded the flagpoles up to $1,500 per school where there was either no flagpole or a flagpole that was not fully functioning. We funded that from the Discovering Democracy program, which seemed not an unreasonable thing to do, but contrary to what was said by some that all schools already had flagpoles and flew flagsâand I notice that seven schools in the electorate of Jagajaga have successfully applied for funding under this programâdemand has been quite significant; so much so that as of today we have almost 1,800 flagpoles that have been funded by the Australian government.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Given the demand, as we assessed it towards the end of 2004, it was obvious that it was not feasible to continue to fund the initiative from Discovering Democracy. We transferred it, quite appropriately, to the capital works program for schools. The guidelines for capital works programs for school funding state specifically that, where more than half the cost of the capital workâin this case a flagpoleâis funded by the Australian government, an Australian government representative will officiate. The schools can and do invite whomever they like to come along and speak and do whatever they like, but an Australian government representative will basically explain what the program is about, how much money has gone into it and why. I might add that the commissioning of the flagpole at the Camboon Primary School in the electorate of Cowan was officiated at by none other than the member for Perth.</para>

<para>âThe governmentâs total fixation on skilled migration ensures that in this budget there is very little funding outside that area. We have a situation where $20Â million is to be devoted to the promotion of skilled migration through seminars for employers, advertising in trade journals, attending trade promotion events and developing web links. So the fixation in this budget is very much on that area. There are very few new initiatives in any other facet of the migration intake.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">With regard to refugee humanitarian entry, any increase that has occurred over the last year or so essentially balances the increase from 12,000 to 13,000 in that intake. It does not take into consideration at all the fact that the new intake is very heavily focused on Africaâon people who have been in camps for a decade plus in many cases, people with education that has been disrupted, elements of the population whose families are dispersed and broken up et cetera. So, whilst the opposition congratulates the government on taking a new thrust on the African intake within the refugee humanitarian category, the fact that an increased per capita allocation has not been made means that the settlement of these people will not be handled or done properly. Their settlement in this country is a major problem because quite obviously, as anyone who has any expertise in this area knows, this is going to be a more demanding migrant population. These are people who have basically not seen modern conveniences, have no experience of sanitation and water supplies and come from very deprived rural areas.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Returning to the skilled intakeâwhich I say is the only interest of this government: the attempt to solve very obvious skills shortagesâout of Australiaâs total intake of 137,000 next year, a monstrous 97,000 will be people coming to this country to fill shortages in the labour market. The government can talk as much as they want about high employment being the reality here. Despite the unemployment levels that are part of this debate, the crucial reality is the monstrous failure with regard to TAFE training and skills acquisition in this country.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As I said earlier, we have a new proposal here which, whenever I have mentioned it in public meetings, has elicited reactions of horror from Australians. That is the proposal that we skirt around the world to find people to come to Australia and do apprenticeships, people who will later on be able to migrate through those apprenticeships. What has happened to the country that it is no longer interested in young people, in making sure that they have the opportunity in rural and regional areas to take up apprenticeships and that they do not go to the cities because they feel there are no jobs or opportunities in regional towns? This is a total admission of defeat by the government, the fact that they have now come up with this new proposal that will bring people in from Timbuktu, Timisoara, Tehran or wherever around the world in an effort to fill these gaps. This intake of 97,000 really makes previous levels of intakes pale into insignificance. Through the nineties there was a level of 25,000 a year. By the end of next year, the government will have brought in 440,000 people under the skilled category in the period of the Howard government.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We have seen a thrust by this government to undermine conditions in the country through the entry of large numbers of temporary workers who are able to work in the Australian economy. That of course has been accompanied by no action whatsoever by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs with regard to illegal workers. We had a promise from the previous minister six years agoânot six weeks ago; six years agoâthat they would legislate to change the onus of proof against employers who hire illegals. Six years later, there has been only inaction and inactivity; nothing has occurred. In the interim, they have very much liberalised peopleâs ability to come here as temporary workers.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">When we talk about bringing in so many people under the skilled category of migration, we often ignore the other part of this problem. The <inline font-style="italic">New Internationalist</inline> this month looked at the question of how Britain, for instance, has saved $US117Â million in training costs by recruiting Ghanaian doctors since 1998. It looked at Zambiaâs public sector retaining only 50 of the 600 physicians trained in medical schools from 1978 to 1999. It talked about QueenslandâQueensland is very topical, of course, with regard to medical labourâwhere 40 per cent of the medical work force was trained abroad. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para>

<para>Telstra has further advised that on 27 October 2004, it notified the Leichhardt Council of its intention to install antennas on an existing floodlight pole within Leichhardt Oval, which included a proposed consultation plan.</para>
<para>Advice from Telstra indicates that on 7 December 2004, letters outlining details of the proposed installation including timeframes for comment, carrier contact details and information on low-impact facility installations, were sent to:</para>

</item>
<item label="">
<para>(2)Â Â  Telstra has advised that the reason for deciding to install antennae on an existing floodlight pole within Leichhardt Oval was to provide GSM and CDMA coverage to the surrounding areas. Telstra advised that this area has poor reception and has for some time been the basis of complaints by customers of poor quality mobile service.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>Telstra further advised that after looking at alternative options, the Leichhardt Oval was considered to be the most appropriate site as it would provide the least visual impact on the surrounding community. Additionally, it was noted that Optus had already constructed a similar installation on one of the other floodlight poles at the Oval.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>No opposition or objection to the proposal was received by Telstra until it commenced its notification and consultation process.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>(3)Â Â  Telstra has advised that alternative sites have been considered, but the Oval area proved the only feasible option. Telstra further advised that the surrounding area is comprised almost completely of residential dwellings, and available locations/space for a mobile telecommunications facility are limited. Telstra has also advised that it commenced work on the installation on 26 April 2005.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>(4)Â Â  Telstra has advised that the facility is a low-impact facility as defined in the Telecommunications (Low-impact Facilities) Determination 1997. The New South Wales Land and Environment Court found that the facility in question was a low-impact facility. Telstra further advised that a consultation and notification process with the Council, residents and other concerned parties was conducted in accordance with the Australian Communications Industry Forum (ACIF) Industry Code for the Deployment of Mobile Phone Networks (the Industry Code). The Industry Code requires carriers to take into account a range of issues, including community concerns, and coverage and siting issues in deciding whether to proceed with an installation at a particular site.</para>

<para>âThe answer to the honourable memberâs question is as follows:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="loweralpha">
<item label="(a)">
<para>The total amount of outstanding Student Financial Supplement Scheme loan balance and the number of outstanding loans cannot be reliably ascertained as two separate sets of dissimilar data are maintained by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and Centrelink.</para>
<para>Under the Student Financial Supplement Scheme, a student took out a loan with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. In the first five years of the loan, repayments are voluntary. In the fifth year from when each loan was taken out that loan is referred to the ATO. Once the studentâs income reaches the threshold ($37,667 in 2004-05 prices) the student is required to make repayments of the loan through the taxation system. The ATO holds data relating to Student Financial Supplement Scheme debts incurred in the years 1993 to 1999. Repayment of these loans is income-contingent. Centrelink holds the data relating to loans incurred in the years 1999 to 2003. Repayments for these loans are still voluntary. This data will be progressively handed over to the ATO until 2008 when the last of the loans become due for income-contingent collection through the taxation system.</para>
<para>Trying to compare the different data distorts the actual amounts owing as the records refer to different data sets. ATO and Centrelink maintain separate and dissimilar records. Under the Student Financial Supplement Scheme a student had to make a separate loan application and sign a separate contract for each calendar year in which they took out a loan. Centrelink treats each loan as a separate debt with some students having multiple debts. By contrast, the ATO consolidates each separate debt amount received from Centrelink into one debt amount for collection purposes.</para>
<para>The ATO estimates that total outstanding debt as at 11 May 2005 (the date of the Parliamentary question) in respect of Student Financial Supplement Scheme loans held by persons with a residential address in Australia is $1,338,224,166; and the number of clients with outstanding debts was 157,572.</para>
<para>Centrelink estimates that the total outstanding debt as at 31 December 2003 (the most recently available figures), in respect of loans held by persons with a residential address in Australia, was $943,494,316; and the number of outstanding loans as at 31 December 2003 was 223,096. The number of loans does not equate to the number of clients.</para>
</item>
<item label="(b)">
<para>The amount of outstanding Student Financial Supplement Scheme loan balance and the number of outstanding loans in the electorate of Prospect cannot be ascertained.</para>
<para>The ATO advises that their data is not able to be sorted by electoral division.</para>
<para>Centrelink is able to sort the data it manages on the loans by postcode. The information for the electorate of Prospect is indicative only, as some postcodes in the electorate of Prospect cross electoral boundaries.</para>
<para>Centrelink has advised that for loans incurred in the years 1999 to 2003 for persons residing in postcodes within the electorate of Prospect:</para>

Global greenhouse gas emissions are on track to increase by around 40 per cent on 1990 levels by the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, and the Protocol will change this growth by only one percent.

<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>The Australian Government contributes to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) through a range of policies and actions focused on promoting the conditions necessary for economic development and poverty alleviation. Australia has increased its Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) in real terms by 37 per cent since 1997, and will provide an estimated $2.491 billion in ODA in 2005-06, an increase of $358 million on the 2004-05 budget. The government provides ODA to invest in health, HIV/AIDS prevention, education, and rural integration and development in low-income countries. The government has doubled its HIV/AIDS commitment to $600 million by 2010, including a new $50 million contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The governmentâs commitment to global efforts to manage the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS directly addresses one of the MDGs.</para>
<para>The government has invested in many of the MDGs in the 2005-06 Aid Budget. In 2005-06 Australia will spend more than $1 billion on activities related to governance, including law and justice, economic reform, civil society and human rights. Direct expenditure on health and education will increase by $81 million compared to the 2004-05 budget, to a total of over $600 million, including basic health and education in Indonesia and the Philippines. Expenditure on water and sanitation will total $152 million, where Australia is leading international efforts in promoting water quality. The Aid Budget also provided for $305 million in programs related to the environment, including support for the Global Environment Facility and Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund.</para>
<para>The position of the Australian Government is that ODA alone is not sufficient to meet the MDGs. The government is committed to ensuring that its contribution to and implementation of the MDGs is aligned with broader efforts to support global economic growth through the Cairns Group in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Doha Development Agenda round, the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, and the Paris Club. Â Â Â Â </para>
<para>In its approach to the MDGs, Australia has emphasised the importance of balancing calls for ODA increases against the need for developing countries to pursue good governance, end corruption and harness other sources of finance to generate the growth needed to reduce poverty. Australia will produce a report in the lead up to the UN Summit, outlining how a partnership approach focused on improvements in economic policy, good governance, trade liberalisation, debt, and aid effectiveness will fast-track progress towards achieving the MDGs.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>The government has considered the report of the British Governmentâs Commission for Africa, Our Common Interest. The Australian Government supports the reportâs focus on good governance and accountability, its emphasis on the importance of stability and security to underpin effective development, and the need to abolish trade distorting subsidies in agriculture.</para>
<para>In response to the reportâs recommendation for an additional $US25 billion per year in aid to Africa by 2010, the Australian Government emphasises that any such increase would need to be accompanied by a reduction of barriers to trade and good governance measures.</para>
<para>While the governmentâs first priority remains the provision of targeted development assistance to the Asia â Pacific region, the government contributes funding and supports programs to assist Africa. The government will increase aid to Africa from the 2004-05 budget estimate of $67.5 million to $77 million in 2005-06.</para>
<para>The December 2004 review conducted by the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) noted its support for Australian Aid to Africa and acknowledged Australiaâs focus on aid to its immediate region.</para>

<para>âThe Minister for Justice and Customs has provided the following answer to the honourable memberâs question:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>I am aware of Kembla Tube and Fittingsâ assertion that the decision of January 2005 to amend anti-dumping measures has not resulted in the expected price increases for copper tube from the Republic of Korea (Korea) in the Australian market.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>Yes, I am aware of the specific nature of the complaints raised by Kembla Tube and Fittings in correspondence dated 14 March 2005 and at a meeting with Australian Customs Service (Customs) officers on 1 March 2005.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>Customs has responded to the issues raised by Kembla Tube and Fittings. Customs met with Kembla Tube and Fittings on 1 March 2005 and also responded by letter on 22 March 2005 stating that certain inquiries were being undertaken. As Customs is bound by the constraints of section 16 of the Customs Administration Act 1975, Customs has not been able to provide Kembla Tube and Fittings with the detail of the inquiries undertaken.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>Since January 2005 investigations have been undertaken or commenced into imports of copper tube from Korea which have involved or will involve visits to importers and exporters. Additionally:</para>
<para>- Certain anti-dumping measures against copper tube from Korea are due to expire in May 2006. The expiration of the measures was advertised on 26 April 2005 and called for applications to be made for the continuation of the measures. A continuation inquiry would allow for a review of imports of copper tube from Korea, including re-assessing injury to the Australian industry;</para>
<para>- The monitoring of imports has continued over this period to ensure compliance with the anti-dumping measures in place for the imports from Korea.</para>
<para>These inquiries will seek to establish that the sales of the copper tube are at arms length as required by law. It is a commercial decision for importers to choose to sell the goods at prices lower than those pre-dating January 2005.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>A thorough investigation of imports of copper tube from Korea was undertaken in the second half of 2004 as part of the Review Inquiry that established the new levels of measures in January 2005. Further investigations will be undertaken as part of current inquiries and as part of the anticipated continuation inquiry.</para>
</item>
<item label="(6)">
<para>A sales route exercise is usually undertaken in order to establish that the transactions between importers and exporters are at arms-length. As noted at Question (4), previous inquiries have been and future inquiries will be made to establish that the transactions are at arms length.</para>
</item>
<item label="(7)">
<para>As outlined above, Customs has been active in pursuing the issues involved in copper tube measures as allowed by law.</para>
</item>
<item label="(8)">
<para>Customs is continuing to monitor imports of copper tube to ensure that there is compliance with the amended anti-dumping measures applying to copper tube exported from Korea.</para>
</item>
<item label="(9)">
<para>Errors were found in some entries for home consumption of copper tube imported from Korea. Most of these were minor in nature, for example: use of incorrect classification and statistical codes. Corrective action has been taken. For the remainder, where underpayment of interim dumping duty was involved, Customs is in the process of undertaking recovery action. Penalties are being considered as part of this action.</para>
</item>
<item label="(10)">
<para>A full investigation was undertaken into imports of copper tube from Korea during the review inquiry that established the revised level of measures. Another full investigation will be undertaken during the anticipated continuation inquiry.</para>
</item>
<item label="(11)">
<para>I am aware of the claims made by Kembla Tube and Fittings. It has not been ascertained if the alleged threat of job losses would be due entirely, or even partly, to anti-dumping factors. Customs is currently undertaking (and anticipates undertaking) further inquiries into imports of copper tube from Korea as noted at Question (4). I will wait on the outcome of these inquiries before deciding if any further action is warranted.</para>
</item>
<item label="(12)">
<para>If during the course of the inquiries, material injury to is found to be continuing, or is likely to recur, to Kembla Tube and Fittings, I may decide to continue the measures for a further five years.</para>
