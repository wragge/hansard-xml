But the question of whether there will be a Senate inquiry into this or any other piece of legislation will, of course, be a matter for the Senate. I do not hold the view of my predecessors that the Senate is unrepresentative swill.

<para>—I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question and for the work that he did on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration when his committee took the semi-annual testimony from the Governor of the Reserve Bank in Melbourne on Friday. I think the honourable member will agree with me that the outlook which was presented by the Reserve Bank governor was pretty up-beat. He noticed that consumer demand had slowed and there was a consolidation of household balance sheets going on but also that the economy was showing good growth, particularly in employment and investment. In quite colourful language, the Governor of the Reserve Bank described the low-inflation outlook for the Australian economy as ‘nirvana’—a more colourful word than I would use or the government would use. They were the words of the Reserve Bank governor. He also said in his testimony:</para>

</quote>
<para class="block">So that is a pretty stable outlook, and I have always said that if we keep inflation low in Australia we can keep interest rates low. That optimistic testimony from the Reserve Bank governor no doubt comes as a severe shock to the shadow Treasurer, the member for Lilley, who in extraordinary scenes in April, expecting an interest rate rise, wired himself into a TV studio so he could give a live commentary on what he expected would be an interest rate rise. I have seen a lot of shadow Treasurers but I have never seen one so opportunistic as to get into a studio at 9.30 on the day after the Reserve Bank board meeting so that he could weep crocodile tears about an interest rate rise that he was expecting. He was severely embarrassed when interest rates did not rise that day and, instead of being glad for millions of Australians, he attacked the central bank for not raising interest rates. He said:</para>

He no doubt was disappointed by the testimony which was given by the central bank governor in Melbourne last Friday, but millions of Australians will not be because they know that low inflation means low interest rates. Under this government they have had a chance on their mortgages, they have had a chance with their jobs and good economic management will keep on coming.</para>

<para>—I can say this: it is not the greatest risk to interest rates in Australia. The greatest risk to interest rates in Australia would be you becoming Treasurer of this country. I can think of millions of Australians falling into threat, but you getting into government would be the greatest threat to the wellbeing of millions of Australians. So, having relieved ourselves of that threat in the near future, we will go on and we will talk about Telstra.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I say to the member for Lilley, who apparently is now apprised of what the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has recommended to the cabinet—I must say, it comes as news to me, but then again the member for Lilley no doubt has inserted his little listening devices in the cabinet room and he knows what is going on—in relation to Telstra that it is certainly the view of the government and I think of most analysts that the ownership of Telstra has to be resolved. It can be either fully nationalised or fully privatised. I do not believe there is anybody in Australia that believes that it should be fully nationalised; therefore, its status can only be resolved in one way.</para>
<para>Can I also make it clear that this government believe that the proceeds of the sale of a capital asset should be invested for future generations. That is what we have always done in relation to retiring debt. In relation to retiring debt, have a look at the record. The record is this: when this government were elected Commonwealth net debt was $96 billion. By the end of the last financial year we had relieved future Australian generations of $80 billion of Labor debt. If you reduce debt by $80 billion—</para>

</talker>
<para>—I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. As he knows, a number of his own constituents have been beneficiaries of the free trade agreements that have been negotiated with Thailand and Singapore—a policy perspective, I suppose it is fair enough to say, that has been opposed all the way by the Australian Labor Party. Nonetheless, it is an indication of our government getting on with the job of improving the circumstances for Australians and providing more opportunities both at home and abroad for the Australian business community.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Thai and Singapore FTAs are delivering real benefits to Australian exporters, particularly those in the electorate of Hinkler. The Singapore free trade agreement entered into force two years ago and since then Austrade has assisted 454 companies enter into the market, and over half of those were actually new exporters entering the Singaporean market for the first time. That effort has delivered an extra $320 million worth of additional exports, just into that market alone, as a result of the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement.</para>
<para>As far as Thailand is concerned—and of course the Thai FTA has not been going for a full 12 months—Australia’s merchandise exports to Thailand have grown 40 per cent since 1 January this year when the FTA came into force. Total two-way trade with Thailand is now over $8 billion, which is quite significant. The areas of improvement with Thailand include a 43 per cent increase in the export of wine, a 19 per cent increase of pharmaceutical products, a 25 per cent increase in aluminium and a 62 per cent increase in fresh fruit and nut products going into the Thai market. So the point here is that the exercise of negotiating bilateral free trade agreements is absolutely imperative to our effort to see economic growth across Australia as far as our exporters are concerned.</para>
<para>The company in the electorate of the member for Hinkler that has done extremely well out of these negotiated outcomes is a company called Austchilli that exports chilli products and food additives across the world. They have taken advantage of these agreements in exporting product into Singapore—not to mention another company, in Western Australia in the electorate of Canning. I am sure the member for Canning would recognise a company called Edwards Hot Water from Canning. They are now exporting hot water systems into Thailand.</para>
<para>So there are primary products but also manufactured goods going out of Australia into these markets, sustaining Australian jobs in the Australian economy—jobs that we want to see sustained for many years into the future. We have embarked upon a serious reform program over the years, including targeting bilateral free trade agreements to enhance opportunities for Australian businesses so they can generate more employment in the Australian economy. The reforms that we propose today, particularly the industrial relations reforms, are targeted and aimed at doing exactly the same things as far as the work force in Australia is concerned.</para>

Will the Treasurer confirm that he also said on the question of whether a person such as a small business person would have access to collective bargaining, ‘Well, it’s a question of choice’? Given these statements, will the Treasurer guarantee to small business people like Bob, an owner-driver whom I met today, that they will be able to choose to bargain collectively represented by a union under the government’s trade practices legislation, a choice Bob wants to make because of his concerns about his safety, the safety of others on the road and his family’s livelihood?</para>

<para>—Under the Trade Practices Act people can bargain collectively as long as they give notification; otherwise, it would be construed as anticompetitive conduct. The government has put in place procedures which will make it easier to engage in collective negotiation of small business even though, prima facie, it is considered anticompetitive conduct under the Trade Practices Act.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>But the government does not propose to allow the Trade Practices Act to become a vehicle for trade unionism. The Trade Practices Act is a vehicle which regulates economic relations. It is the Industrial Relations Act that regulates trade unionism and it is under the Industrial Relations Act that trade unions register and get members. I have never seen a trade union yet have itself registered under the Trade Practices Act and get legal personality, corporate status, the rules approved and its elections conducted under the Trade Practices Act. That is done under the Industrial Relations Act. That will not be changing under the new system. The Trade Practices Act will continue to regulate economic activity.</para>

<para>—I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I am not surprised he is interested as he was part of the parliamentary delegation that visited Aceh in June. I appreciate the insights he has brought back and I know his constituents appreciate his interest as well. The government warmly welcomes the signing of the historic agreement to end hostilities between the government of Indonesia and the Free Aceh Movement, known as GAM. That agreement was signed in Helsinki.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This is a tragic conflict which has lasted for over three decades and it has brought enormous suffering to the people of Aceh and more broadly to Indonesia. It is estimated that there have been something like 15,000 people killed as a result of this conflict. This is a peace agreement that offers a real opportunity for lasting peace for the people of Aceh who, after all, are still rebuilding their lives after the devastating tsunami of Boxing Day last year. I can only congratulate both sides on this achievement.</para>
<para>When Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono became the President of Indonesia he said, amongst other things, probably to the Prime Minister but also to me and to others, that he wanted to resolve the Aceh problem peacefully. He did not want to use military means to resolve it. This agreement is an enormous tribute to President Yudhoyono and to his team. They have done an extraordinarily good job in the most difficult of circumstances. I do not detract from the credit that must be given to the Free Aceh Movement as well. They deserve credit from their perspective. I think President Yudhoyono has done a great thing here, and we very much hope that this peace agreement will stick and that both sides will fulfil their obligations under the agreement.</para>
<para>It is significant that, as I have mentioned already, it is in Aceh itself where reconstruction is taking place. The fact of peace breaking out in Aceh will obviously facilitate the reconstruction work post tsunami. We have already allocated an initial $50 million rehabilitation package to Aceh as part of our $1 billion, five-year funding under the Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development. This will make it all the easier to help rebuild Aceh.</para>
<para>In conclusion, there is to be an Aceh monitoring mission. It will be of about 200 to 250 personnel. They will be from the European Union and ASEAN. They will do a good job overseeing the implementation of this agreement and we will always be happy to provide logistical assistance to that peace monitoring team should they require any logistical assistance from Australia.</para>

<para>—The government will be proceeding with the amendments to the Trade Practices Act. The main reason we are proceeding with those amendments is that they enhance the bargaining capacity of small business. That is the reason we are going to proceed with them. As the Treasurer correctly said, he is not aware, and I am not aware, of a union that has ever sought registration under the Trade Practices Act or sought to have its rules and the conduct of its affairs governed by the Trade Practices Act. The Leader of the Opposition knows that this is a ridiculous proposition, but of course maintaining the position that he does is entirely consistent with the cherry-picking approach the Labor Party has always adopted to the rights of trade unions under the law of Australia. This House will remember that for years and years the Labor Party argued that the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act, which regulated commercial conduct, should be taken out of the Trade Practices Act and put into the Industrial Relations Act. Why? Because those provisions would be ineffective as part of the Industrial Relations Act.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The proposition of the Leader of the Opposition is not one to advance the interests of small business. Small business will be advantaged by our amendment, just as small business will be advantaged by the changes we propose to the Workplace Relations Act and just as small business has been advantaged by the reductions in interest rates. I will wager that every person to whom the Leader of the Opposition has spoken today has been a beneficiary of the enhanced economic conditions of the last 9½ years. If those conditions are to be maintained and strengthened in the future, instead of opposing what the government is doing, the Leader of the Opposition should be getting behind not only the amendments to the Trade Practices Act but also the amendments to the Workplace Relations Act.</para>

<para>Under our proposals, it will continue to be unlawful for employees to be dismissed for refusing to sign an AWA, for example. This will not change. It will continue to be unlawful to dismiss a person taking temporary absence from work due to illness or disability. It will continue to be unlawful to dismiss a worker who is absent from work because of their family responsibilities. And it will continue to be unlawful to dismiss a worker in relation to the filing of a complaint or participating in proceedings against an employer involved in an alleged violation of laws or regulations. None of these things will change under these proposals.</para>
<para>I see that the ACTU has put out another booklet setting out some scenarios. What it fails to point out is that these scenarios, even if they are true, are unlawful under the current provisions and will remain unlawful in the future. What we see from the ACTU is a campaign in which it is happier to exploit and manipulate workers than to actually tell them the truth. The depth of this campaign was revealed last Wednesday evening on the <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> program when the President of the ACTU, Sharan Burrow, was filmed at an ACTU campaign meeting in which she is recorded on film as saying:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I need a mum or a dad of someone who’s been seriously injured or killed. That would be fantastic.</para>

<para class="block">That is an absolute disgrace. It is deeply offensive to all decent Australians that the President of the ACTU would be saying on film at a campaign meeting that what it needs is the parent of a dead or injured worker in order to continue its politically motivated campaign. That is shocking. It is a disgrace. The President of the ACTU had a chance this morning on radio in Adelaide, on the Leon Byner program, to retract that disgraceful statement and she said, ‘I make no apology for that.’</para>
<para>This is a statement for which there is no defence. There is no defence for saying, ‘We should run a political campaign off the back of a seriously injured or dead worker in Australia.’ Yet that is what the ACTU is saying. It is disgraceful. The former presidents of the ACTU are in here—the member for Throsby, the member for Batman, the member for Hotham. I do not believe that they would have said something like that. I invite them to get on the phone this afternoon and ask Sharan Burrow to retract this disgraceful statement. This is offensive—deeply offensive. It ought to be retracted.</para>

<para>—My question is addressed to the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education. Won’t the latest push for yet another 20,000 skilled migrants next year bring the total number of extra skilled migrants under the Howard government to 270,000? Isn’t it true that the Howard government has turned away 270,000 Australians from TAFE since 1998? Doesn’t this mean that for every extra skilled migrant the Howard government has imported at least one Australian has been turned away from TAFE? Why isn’t the Howard government’s priority training Australians first?</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question. I am very shocked to think that the Australian Labor Party, the alternative government in this place, would want to talk down those who have come to Australia with skills that we need in our economy. In fact, to try to defeat the notion that migration is somehow something less than a nation-building exercise invites a very simple observation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>When the Labor Party was last in power, 60 per cent of the people arriving in this country went on welfare. Under this government, over 60 per cent of people arriving in this country under a migration program that is focusing on Australia’s interests and on Australia’s terms and conditions are going into jobs. This government has delivered higher levels of apprentices in training. This government has delivered higher levels of people taking on training and higher levels of people completing training. We have put all of that in place. At the same time, we know that in order to gear up Australia for the future we will have new innovation and new opportunity that we will present to the generations to come.</para>
<para>If the Labor Party really cared about getting people into training they would do a couple of things. First, they would stand against the TAFE fee increases that the states have presided over—and they will instantly take a point order because they know I am right.</para>

<para>—I thank the honourable member for Wentworth and acknowledge the great interest he has in the Middle East. I appreciate his interest in asking this question. Prime Minister Sharon’s disengagement initiative is, I think, a very positive step taken by him and the Israeli government towards bringing about the goals of the road map for the Middle East, which our government strongly supports. I want to make this point because I do not think it is made often enough. Prime Minister Sharon deserves enormous credit for the courage he has shown in taking this extraordinarily difficult and sensitive step. I would also like to acknowledge the professionalism of the Israeli defence forces in carrying out this decision, because it has obviously been very sensitive as well. I think that so far they have handled it very well. We would encourage Israel to continue to maintain their efforts.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Likewise, I welcome Palestinian President Abbas’s commitment to stopping terrorism and incitement to further bloodshed in the context of the disengagement. It is obviously important that the Palestinian authority is firmly able to control law and order and to ensure that this process of disengagement is not in any way disrupted by terrorists. I would urge all Palestinians not to waste this opportunity that has been provided. I hope that both sides can now build constructively on the momentum of disengagement.</para>
<para>The honourable member for Wentworth asked what Australia was doing about it. We announced a week or so ago a tangible contribution to the disengagement process with the secondment of an Army officer to the international Security Sector Working Group. I have also been talking with Jim Wolfensohn—who, honourable members will recall, was the Australian President of the World Bank; he is now the quartet’s Special Envoy for Disengagement—on ways that Australia can make a significant contribution through our aid budget to making sure that disengagement works. We have been discussing particular projects to assist the Palestinians in the context of disengagement—particularly to assist Palestinians obtain work and to develop business opportunities.</para>
<para>I really do want to emphasise the admiration we in this government have for the decision that Prime Minister Sharon and the Israeli government have taken to make this big step of disengagement. It is difficult. It has been politically very challenging for them to do it. Ministers and parliamentary supporters and campaign workers have been politically lost during this process, but Prime Minister Sharon has stuck with it and he deserves great credit for it.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Makin for her question. I can advise the House that, so far, the government has spent some $160 million to prepare our country against this potential threat. There are 21 thermal imaging screeners that could be deployed to airports within hours of a possible human pandemic outbreak. The government is stockpiling 40 million surgical masks, 50 million syringes and 303 ventilators. There are six quarantine centres prepared to deal with some 500 people each. On a per capita basis we have the world’s largest stockpile of antivirals after Finland. Also, the government is upgrading the World Health Organisation collaborating influenza laboratory in Melbourne and, most recently, the government has committed almost $5 million to ensure that a candidate vaccine against pandemic flu starts trials next month. That is the latest advice I have from CSL. In addition, a live exercise to test our pandemic preparedness will take place in November. We cannot tell if, or when, there will be a pandemic flu outbreak but, according to the World Health Organisation, Australia is as well prepared as any other country to meet this potential public health disaster.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Braddon for his question and his obvious interest in the business and community associations in his electorate that understand the significance of the availability and the affordability of insurance. Members of the House will only too well remember the collapse of HIH and the fact that the federal government committed some $640 million to the HIH Claims Support Scheme to ensure that insurance would be available to businesses and community groups at that most challenging time.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I congratulate the states for working with the leadership of the federal government at the time to ensure the tort law reform that came in. I report to the House today that the ACCC and APRA surveys, two independent surveys, have now confirmed that the downward pressure that we were trying to achieve on premiums has been achieved with up to a 4.8 per cent reduction in public liability and professional indemnity insurance premiums. That is good news for Australian businesses. But unfortunately there are still some real impediments to the affordability of business insurance, public liability insurance and professional indemnity insurance: Labor state and territory governments.</para>
<para>In New South Wales metropolitan areas, for every $100 that a business pays in business insurance premiums, an extra $37 goes to the state in the form of taxation. In metropolitan Victoria, for every $100, an extra $38 goes to the state Labor government in taxes. But in regional Victoria—and I do not know how any business can survive there—they are hit with a massive 82 per cent. For every $100 of premium paid, there is an extra $82 in state taxes collected by the Victorian government in the form of the fire services levy, GST and stamp duty—82 per cent. So, on one hand, whilst the Labor governments have worked well to bring down tort law reform and that is having downward pressure overall on premiums, on the other hand, the state Labor governments continue to charge these exorbitant taxes and taxes on taxes to our business community stymieing the growth of business. I have one example here from a small delicatessen in regional Victoria—no doubt a mum and dad operation—whose premium was $2,191 but, when you add state Labor taxes, it jumps to $3,158.</para>

<para>—The Leader of the Opposition says that it is GST. It is in fact the fire services levy and stamp duty. The study of the Insurance Council of Australia indicates that over the last five years state Labor governments have increased their take of state taxes on insurance premiums by 51 per cent. They are now collecting $3.2 billion—money that could be well spent on creating more jobs in regional Victoria, in metropolitan New South Wales and throughout Australia. The Labor Party not only stands for higher taxes but delivers higher taxes.</para>

<para>—My question is again to the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads. Minister, was departmental advice about the Primary Energy grant changed after the senior adviser to the Deputy Prime Minister wrote to the minister’s department in July last year instructing that the grant be approved and moneys paid as a matter of urgency, or was it changed because referees for the application included the then Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Trade, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, a senior adviser to the Prime Minister and the Associate Secretary of the Prime Minister’s department?</para>

<para>—Where a project is considered under Regional Partnerships and is located in a minister’s electorate, it is normal practice for another minister in the portfolio to act as the decision maker for that project, which is of course quite proper to do. In accordance with this established procedure, Minister Campbell, at that time, was the decision maker on Primary Energy. Minister Campbell, in his then role as the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, asked the department to progress the application. I signed off on this project on 27 July 2004. Again, I remind the House of the importance of this project to that community and the importance of Regional Partnerships to communities around Australia.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Solomon for his question. I appreciate how serious this problem is in the Northern Territory and in other remote Indigenous communities around Australia. I regret to tell the House that the advice I have is that petrol sniffing has claimed some 100 lives over the last couple of decades. Under a scheme operating since 1998, the government is supplying unsniffable petrol to some 42 remote Indigenous communities. In the recent budget the government committed a further $9 million to supply unsniffable petrol to another 23 remote Indigenous communities, and the government is currently talking to the Northern Territory government about a possible further extension of the scheme to include a wide area of Central Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This government certainly will not leave vulnerable communities to cope on their own. As people like Noel Pearson have recognised, in the end benevolent government is not capable of solving all the problems of these communities. Some communities such as Yuendumu have successfully tackled this problem by quite literally taking sniffers by the scruff of the neck and sending them to rehabilitation at outstations such as Mount Theo. While I appreciate that what works in one place does not necessarily work elsewhere, I do commend the example of self-help at Yuendumu to all Indigenous communities that are afflicted by this terrible problem.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Blair for his question. Since 1996 there has been a 100 per cent increase in the number of new apprentices in training in the electorate of Blair. That is an additional 860 people who have had an opportunity not just simply to build the skills they need for today but also to become the leaders of tomorrow. On that theme, I want to acknowledge that Group Training Australia has today, as part of a three-day leadership course, here in the gallery 21 superior apprentices from the Australian work force who will become the leaders of tomorrow. Apprentices, as you know, are not simply creating opportunities for themselves; they go on to become employers themselves and give opportunities to the next lot of people who come along. That is something the member for Brand forgot when he was the minister in charge. We actually saw the record drop for people in training in those days. We are still paying the price for that. After question time, these 21 apprentices will be meeting with the Prime Minister, which is terrific.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In answer to the member for Blair’s question, each year the publicly funded training system in this country trains 1.7 million Australians, an increase of half a million since 1995. Over the next four years there will be $10.1 billion of Australian government investment. Leadership that we are providing at the national level, to try and coerce and encourage the state governments to realise their national obligations as well as their state imperatives, is absolutely critical.</para>
<para>As part of our new support for apprentices in 2005-06 we are spending $587.1 million on a number of new initiatives. That will help to ease the financial burden for apprentices and their employers. The Commonwealth Trade Learning Scholarships—two payments of $500 for eligible new apprentices in skills needs trades—will assist around 90,000 new apprentices in the first two years alone. There is a new payment of $25 per week for the third-year apprentices who have moved away from their family homes. That will benefit about 3,000 annually. That will mainly help people from rural and regional areas. It will bring, too, some 7,600 people who are benefiting under that approach, for the first, second and third years of their apprenticeships. As well, all employers who have made a significant contribution to a new apprentice’s training will share in the $2,750 completion initiative recognising the commitment of employers who have provided 25 per cent or more of a new apprentice’s training.</para>
<para>Of course from 1 October we will start to see first year apprentices being able to gain access to the $800 tool kit allowance. That is a very popular initiative, let me tell you. With the extension of entitlements to Youth Allowance, Austudy and Abstudy to new apprentices, as many as 93,000 will benefit over three years. This government know that the economy is strong today. This government know that the training of apprentices is at record levels today, but we are not taking any of it for granted. We are looking at the years of the future and know that the investments we make today will build a long-term sustainable platform for the Australian economy. It is good for the individuals involved; it is great for Australia.</para>

Today it is at six per cent, so congratulations to the member for Canning and congratulations to the Howard government for putting in place programs which reduce unemployment. We also know that, since 1997, 352,000 Australians have been helped through the Work for the Dole program. Many of them have gone on to work and many of them have benefited from a program that has helped them to understand work experience, working in a team environment and giving back to the community.

<para>—With the indulgence of the parliament, I am very happy to respond to the member for Lowe. I did give some consideration to this. The normal practice of the parliament is, of course, to have condolence motions for former members of this House and then, as I understand it, by the decision of the government of the day in relation to other distinguished Australians and, from time to time, distinguished citizens of other countries. We, for example, have not had a condolence motion to mark the death of the former British Prime Minister Edward Heath—that is one name that comes to my mind. It is a question of judgment. By deciding not to have it I did not mean any disrespect to David Lange. I did make some comments in the media on behalf of the government, but there is no invariable rule, no custom and no convention of the past that says that every time the prime minister of a country with which this country has close relations dies we have a condolence motion. I would have to check the record; I am not certain that we, for example, had a condolence motion when the former Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Obuchi, died, although the Leader of the Opposition and I both attended his funeral in Tokyo. There was no disrespect. It is not because he was part of the Labour Party, let me assure you; it is simply that it has not been the custom always to do that. I think that in making a decision on balance not to do so I was merely reflecting the custom of the past.</para>

<para>—Mr Speaker, I may be mistaken—if I am, excuse me—but I did raise the point of order on the understanding that it was specifically directed towards a member. It was my understanding that that was the case. I did not pursue the matter and, if the reason for you not accepting the point of order was that it was directed more generally towards all of us, I accept that, but I think if one examines what precisely was said it was directed towards a specific member and, in any case, as a member on this side I would object even were it to be directed to us generally, because this side of the House would regard it as extremely offensive to be labelled as xenophobic. Coming to the particular, if you check the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> I suspect you will discover that it was directed to a particular member.</para>

<para>—There is a most unseemly discussion going on among members of the government and in the dialogue between the government and broader community on the subject of propositions around the sale of the remaining publicly owned share of Telstra. Most Australians consider telecommunications to be a matter of deep concern for them and they consider the overall structure of the telecommunications system to be a vital matter of national interest. It has become a matter of horse-trading between various members of the government backbench as to how much the price will be for betraying the national interest. Will it be a $2 billion price of betrayal, a $3 billion price of betrayal or a $5 billion price of betrayal? What price will it be?</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Australian people are very clear-cut on this issue. The Australian people have said emphatically and for some considerable time that they do not want Telstra sold. They do not want Telstra sold if $2 billion is available for the bush, they do not want Telstra sold if $3 billion is available for the bush; they want Telstra not to be sold. That is their position. They do not believe that a Telstra sold will be in either their interests or the national interest. They do not believe that, if Telstra is sold, the concerns they have for the quality of services will be alleviated. They do not believe that, if Telstra is sold, they will get a better price for telecommunications. They do not believe that, if Telstra is sold, it will produce the peak performance in our telecommunications system that they and their businesses now need from new investment in better and better telecommunications technology. They believe that they will be exploited and that their interests will be traduced. It is as simple as that. It is a simple proposition in the mind of the average Australian. And it is not just in the mind of the average Australian Labor voter; it is in the mind of the average Australian Liberal voter and in the mind of the average Australian National Party voter. All of them think this. This is as close to a unanimous point of view as our community ever gets on a major national issue.</para>
<para>The government cannot make a case for the full privatisation of Telstra, just as it cannot make a case for industrial relations changes or for voluntary student unionism. It cannot make a case because there is not one. All this government has is an extreme ideology. It is a government drunk with power, in total control of both houses of parliament. It will do this because it can. And in the absence of any evidence, what do we get from this government? We get a bad vaudeville act from ‘Backdown Barnaby’. In 48 hours, Barnaby Joyce, who promised the Queensland electorate not that he would sell Telstra for $2 billion, $3 billion or $5 billion but that he would not sell Telstra at all, is apparently prepared to sell it for $3 billion. That is what his commitment to his electorate is worth.</para>
<para>I can tell Barnaby this: the Australian people consider the offset of $3 billion for a regional telecommunications program as a rationale for selling Telstra as a joke—a bad joke, but a joke. Frankly, if after 48 hours Barnaby Joyce decides that he will vote for the sale of Telstra, they will regard him as a bad joke as well, because those in Queensland who voted for him had the very distinct point of view that he would take a stand. They voted for him in quite large numbers on this specific and explicit issue. He ran on it and they expect him to vote against it.</para>
<para>We see the Leader of the National Party, Mr Vaile, in his former role as auctioneer. He is auctioneering Telstra among his colleagues and within the government. He is playing the auctioneer’s role in the cabinet and participating in the bidding process at the same time: ‘What am I bid? I’m bidding $2 billion.’ Then the Queenslanders come in and say, ‘No, it’s really five.’ Then the new President of the Queensland Nationals says, ‘It’s three plus three; with three we’ll leverage another three.’ I tell you what: I have never seen anything quite so unseemly as this process that the government has entered into on telecommunications, nor anything quite so sickening for the average Australian who sees an asset of immense value to them simply wafting away on the government’s prejudice, wafting away on an unseemly bargain—a pork barrel of our political opponents, particularly The Nationals.</para>
<para>They believe that a privatised Telstra will produce rising prices. They have an example of that with the partial privatisation of Telstra which has seen line rentals rise form $11.65 to now around $30. They fear very much that what will occur if Telstra is sold is that they will become the subject of a quasi-monopoly operation on pricing. It is not just ordinary citizens who feel this. Businesses as well fear the consequences of a predatory privatised Telstra operating unchecked, full-blooded, with an obligation on it—as it will have—to optimise the return for shareholders in every decision it takes, whether it be investment in new equipment and technology, whether it be in prices for access to its network or whether it be any of the other services it provides.</para>
<para>I once had in this place responsibility for microeconomic reform in communications. I had responsibility for Telstra and I had responsibility for the possibility that Telstra would have competitors. One thing we understood absolutely when we were dealing with Telstra in that context was that we were dealing with what was largely a monopoly provider, that no other company was likely to obtain a position of equality with it. The most sensible thing that you could do to ensure that new technologies were introduced and that reasonable prices were charged to consumers was to offer a regulatory restraint on the main provider and opportunities for new companies to come in and compete with it. But you understood absolutely when you went through that process—and we took advice on this from people who had experience of introducing competition to telecommunications in other countries—that, while ever there was a monopoly or a substantially dominant provider, the very last thing you wanted to do if you wanted to ensure that people got the benefit of competition with regard to prices and new technologies was privatise the main provider. That was an absolute no-no, because you immediately got confusion in the Treasury and confusion with those responsible for selling it as to what their obligations were. Was their obligation to optimise returns for the taxpayer? Or was their obligation to get in place a system which was a good one for all consumers, a system which enabled or ensured that all consumers got the benefit of competition?</para>
<para>It was a very important question. But nobody—absolutely nobody—thought for one minute that you would get an impetus from a privatised monopoly or market-dominant provider for the benefits of competition. You would get absolutely the opposite. There are all sorts of suggestions about putting in place a competitive arrangement that would hold its position in check. Quite frankly, none of those regulatory arrangements work. The simple fact of the matter is that a privatised Telstra will go full bore for shareholder benefit over consumer interest all the time. Frankly, it is obliged to. The people who are sitting on the board of a privatised Telstra would be liable to legal action from any one of the shareholders if they failed to perform accordingly.</para>
<para>That goes for a whole range of other things as well, not just the price of Telstra’s services. It also goes for decisions on rolling out the communications system. You see, we do not necessarily have in this country the best system that we could have. Mr Trujillo, in assuming the CEO’s job in Telstra, has been extraordinarily frank, I have got to say. He has walked in and said that if Australia is to have a telecommunications system remotely competitive with those countries with which it likes to compare itself, a truly massive investment is required. He is no doubt influenced by facts like this: Australia’s broadband performance of 7.7 subscribers for every 100 people is the worst of any major industrialised country and is 21st in the developed world.</para>
<para>What you have to understand these days, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, as I am sure you do, is that the difference between private communications and private consumption and a person’s business interests has narrowed dramatically in the world of work that we now see. The average household needs access to broadband not simply for the kids’ homework but, frankly, for the business interests of the people in the house. That is what they need it for. It is a major element of their capacity to successfully conduct themselves economically now from their household. So a statistic like that is horrendous. And it is no small wonder that, in this appalling auction that we see going on on the other side of the House, we finally see one or two people start to put up their hands and say: ‘Hey, hang on a tic. We’re not just dealing with a bush problem here; we’re dealing with a problem across the totality of the system. We’re not just dealing with a situation that requires a $2 billion, $3 billion or $5 billion investment in the bush; we’re dealing with a situation that requires massive investment across the whole country, across the outlying suburbs of the major metropolitan areas, up to and including our central business districts.’</para>
<para>What Mr Trujillo has pointed out to our community is that there is a massive capital investment job in front of Telstra. I tell you this, Mr Minister at the table and Mr Deputy Speaker: if you privatise Telstra now, in advance of even taking the first step on the ladder of that capital investment, you can absolutely guarantee that two things will happen. First, roll-out will be slow paced, as the argument on the Telstra board goes to optimising the value of existing infrastructure all the time. Every time you try to roll something out, someone will say, ‘Well, maybe that is in the interest of that business, but it’s not in the interest of our business.’ That is the first thing that is going happen.</para>
<para>The second thing that is going happen is that that roll-out is going to occur in the patchiest possible way. It will occur first—and maybe exclusively—only where there are sections of the community able to pay a substantial price for it. That will not include regional Australia and that will not include the outer metropolitan areas of our capital cities; it may include the central business districts. The patchwork that we now have of an inefficient system will be repeated and the new technologies will not be made available to all. Nobody can predict now what the technologies will be that will be absolutely essential 10 years from now. You simply cannot know. You cannot future-proof telecommunications. All you can do is put in place a structure that ensures that you have a capacity to influence, as time goes by, the roll-out of new opportunities. And the only way you can do that is if you have your hands on those levers and the ability to influence them. What this government now proposes to do will not only damage individual Australians; it will damage Australian businesses. It lacks commonsense and it is sullied by the obscene horse-trading that is going on amongst National Party members to get themselves yet another slush fund. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—The government welcome this matter of public importance. Every opportunity we have to debate our achievements in office with regard to telecommunications and to outline our future plan, even vision, we will embrace. Unlike the Labor Party, we do not underestimate the capacity, intelligence and desire of the Australian people to fully examine this issue, given its economic and social importance.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Labor Party has marginalised itself, and that is the kindest assessment one can give. A more ruthless assessment would have the Labor Party having rendered itself irrelevant in this debate, whereas the Australian people are deeply engaged in the issue of the privatisation of Telstra. Just rolling up the old bogyman of privatisation as an inherently evil thing consigns the Labor Party to total irrelevance. The Australian people have moved on. One of the reasons they have moved on, apart from their own developing interest in the vital issue of telecommunications, with all the ramifications for their daily lives and businesses and for the nation’s future as well as its current prosperity, is that it was debated, discussed and voted upon in the 1996, 1998, 2001 and 2004 elections.</para>
<para>‘Stop underestimating Australian voters’ would be my call to the Labor Party. Australians have looked at this issue election in, election out. Consequently, the mere raising of privatisation is not going to scare the horses. They want a more informed and serious debate of the kind that the Labor Party seems constitutionally incapable of having on the privatisation of Telstra. It is not just an issue of privatisation. It is about the full privatisation of Telstra, which has been the government’s longstanding policy—it is no surprise. We are not ambushing anybody; we have gone to four consecutive elections on the issue and faced the judgment of the voters. We have three planks. The first has been to encourage greater competition. That will bring about cheaper prices and greater infrastructure. The second has been to bring in regulation in respect of customer service guarantees, universal service obligations and tough consumer safeguards. The third plank in the government’s telecommunications policy has been to target those areas, especially in regional and rural Australia, where there is market failure or a decline in infrastructure unable to be provided for by the marketplace.</para>
<para>We have delivered on all three planks. On all three this government honoured the commitment. Consequently, we come to this debate on the privatisation of Telstra not just having been open and honest with Australians in facing their judgment in every election since 1996 but also with a track record. As a result, our three-pronged approach to telecommunications has brought material and measurable benefits to Australians wherever they live.</para>
<para>We remain committed to the sale of Telstra, because we believe it is in the best interests of the company. It is in the best interests of the 1.7 million shareholders of Telstra and it is in the best interests of Australia in that it will further competition and bring about new opportunities to introduce new services and lower prices. But that has to be done against the backdrop of regulation that protects the national interest as well as the interests of consumers. At the same time, one of the most significant benefits from full privatisation is that it will remove the tension inherent in the position of the government as part-owner of the country’s major carrier as well as the nation’s regulator.</para>
<para>The key point in all of this is to understand the difference between the role of government and the role of the private sector—a key point that is lost on the Labor Party. The government’s role is not to own Telstra; it is to regulate for the whole industry. It is this regulation that will deliver the benefits to consumers. This is the responsibility and the power of the government of the day. Look at our regulatory regime: look at the universal service obligation, which guarantees people access to a phone service; look at the customer service guarantee, which makes sure that people’s phones are connected and repaired in a timely and efficient manner, or else the carrier faces a penalty; look at the regulation informing price controls, which constrains Telstra’s pricing behaviour; and look at the regulation, indeed the legislation, that locks in untimed local calls.</para>
<para>Since the introduction of competition in conjunction with the regulation imposed on Telstra and other carriers by the government, Australian consumers have seen a decrease in the real price of more than 20 per cent of telecommunications services. All Australians can now choose between different service providers for their fixed phone, mobile phone and internet services. There are more than 100 telecommunications carriers operating in Australia. There are now more than 16 million mobile phones in operation in Australia across a variety of networks, including Hutchison’s 3G network. The number of broadband subscribers in Australia is now well over one million. It is a good sign for competition that almost half of Telstra’s ADSL subscriptions are wholesale services being resold by competitors.</para>
<para>As well as regulation and competition there is support for rural and regional Australia. Since 1997, the government has committed more than $1 billion to improving communications infrastructure and services in Australia, most of which has been spent in regional Australia. Remember that it is not the ownership of Telstra that preoccupies, concerns and will eventually decide the issue for rural Australians. They are much more pragmatic. They want to know what the future guarantees will be on the levels of service and pricing. The government is at one with them in that regard. As the cabinet and the Liberal and National parties consider these issues over the course of this week, that is what will be dominant in their thinking: future services for country people.</para>
<para>I can assure the House that the government’s credentials in rural and regional Australia are strong. Always remember, as many people in country Australia do, that in 1991 the Leader of the Opposition, the then Minister for Transport and Communications, led the then government’s decision to corporatise Telecom and convert it into Telstra. From that moment on the directors of Telstra had to act under their corporate, legal and legislative responsibilities only in the commercial interests of Telstra; so Telstra from 1991 could not invest in uncommercial ventures or spend money in an uncommercial way. Telstra received little or no assistance from the Keating governments leading up to the 1993 election and then between 1993 and 1996.</para>
<para>It is the Howard government since 1996 that has spent, on average, more than $100 million a year from the budget allocations for rural and regional Australia. It was the Labor Party that put in place a commercialised Telstra that would not invest in regional Australia. What is Labor’s record in government? Their record is little or no competition, little or no regulation to protect the interests of consumers and customers and little or no investment in regional Australia. I correct myself—they did make a major decision that affected rural Australia: in 1995 they actually closed down the analog mobile phone network. It fell to the Howard government in 1996, in partnership with Telstra and at considerable expense to all parties involved, to establish the CDMA network so as to give country people—who were unable to access the digital network for cost as well as territorial reasons—a mobile phone network. And full marks to all involved at the time. It was a superb engineering feat.</para>
<para>So Labor’s attack on the government rings hollow because they had their chance when they occupied the treasury bench to bring about meaningful, lasting reform of telecommunications in this country and to support rural subscribers and communities. They failed obviously and demonstrably in both regards. The Howard government has spent a great deal of money through Networking the Nation and responding to the telecommunication inquiries. Some of the specific achievements have been to spend more than $140 million to support the extension of mobile coverage to 98 per cent of the population, and 40,000 customers in remote Australia have received access to untimed local calls for the first time. There is also an opportunity for these customers to take up subsidised, two-way, high-speed satellite internet services, and moreover the HiBIS program has seen many small country towns receive broadband or high-speed internet for the first time in a way, without the government subsidy, they could never have done.</para>
<para>So, quite frankly, there is a vigorous and sensible debate about the importance of telecommunication services under way in rural Australia, and the Labor Party is left behind, as will be the Independents if they have this knee-jerk reaction appealing to what they think is the more popular point of view of opposing privatisation, full stop. Any member of this parliament who opposes the privatisation of Telstra full stop is seriously underestimating their constituents. Our constituents want this debate to continue in the way that it has. They want to be able to match the government’s intentions against its track record. They want to be able to examine the government’s plans and proposals to secure regional and rural telecommunications into the future. But the members of the Labor Party and the Independents do not need gratuitous advice from me. Having been around this debate for a long time, having been to four elections with the privatisation of Telstra as the government’s policy, I well know the depth of interest and the level of understanding that rural people bring to this debate. If the members opposite want to treat country people as if they will be easily persuaded by simple sloganism, they can go ahead and do it.</para>
<para>Senator Conroy, the shadow minister for communications and information technology, has admitted that Labor made some mistakes on regional telecommunications. That was big of him. How could you deny that the Labor Party neglected regional Australia? How could you deny that the Labor Party was paralysed to reform the telecommunications sector in Australia by failing to introduce new competition, by failing to introduce the necessary regulatory framework that would allow competition to flourish and at the same time by failing to cap prices and ensure the level of service for customers that they require? The fact that the Labor Party is clinging to government ownership of Telstra as its central plank of telecommunications policy in the absence of any debate, discussion or policies on telecommunications highlights not only its irrelevance but its scant grasp of the complex issues. Quite frankly, the Labor Party has vacated the field on all of these telecommunications issues.</para>
<para>Most Australians know that Labor’s telecommunications record in office was appalling, so it is no major concession by the shadow minister for telecommunications to say that Labor failed the people of Australia when in office. He is only stating what is known to be the obvious. We could give Senator Conroy some marks for such an apology, except he is not doing anything about it—that is the problem. Senator Conroy has proffered an apology on behalf of the Labor Party, but the Labor Party is returning to its bad old ways, trying to play the politics not the policy, underestimating Australians and failing to realise that this is a serious debate of national importance. Simply having one response only—the total opposition to the privatisation of Telstra—serves itself and the country poorly. Labor’s record, quite frankly, is shameful and Labor is not doing anything about improving it because it will not do the hard work. It rolled up with an MPI today with no questions in the parliament about it. It is on the sidelines—in fact it is out of the ballpark—when it comes to all aspects of this debate. The government’s record is strong, the internal debate is strong and the result will be strong.</para>

<para>—The coalition, in their obsession with the sale of Telstra, remind me of a song sung by that great Australian rock band AC/DC: <inline font-style="italic">Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap</inline>. In this case it is a dirty deal, it is done dirt cheap and all Australians will be the poorer if it goes ahead. Over the past few months I have spoken many times in this House about Telstra’s abject failure to deliver adequate telecommunications services in my electorate of Swan. Last week I related the case of a local freight-forwarding business, Freightshop, in my electorate. Located 400 metres from the Perth international terminal, he cannot get broadband. Despite repeated requests of Telstra over a five-year period, this business is unable to access a broadband service.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Mr Kel Watkins, the owner of Freightshop, has been informed by Telstra that the international airport is too far from the Ascot exchange and that therefore they cannot supply a broadband connection. As you can imagine, Mr Watkins’s business depends fundamentally on access to customs systems on the internet and email. Understandably, he is becoming very frustrated with the slow speed of his current dial-up connection. Mr Watkins is a small business owner and says that, while bigger companies can afford wireless connection, small businesses are missing out. Today’s edition of the local newspaper in my electorate, the <inline font-style="italic">Southern Gazette</inline>, reports that due to the unavailability of broadband Mr Watkins has now decided to relocate his business.</para>
<para>On 29 July I wrote to the new CEO of Telstra, Mr Sol Trujillo, about this situation and have not yet heard back from him. Let us be clear about this: here we have an export oriented small business—the lifeblood of the economy—which is being massively disadvantaged because a majority owned government big business is failing to deliver a basic service. This demonstrates how utterly farcical this government’s claim is that it looks after small business. What a joke! I raised Mr Watkins’s case on Paul Murray’s program on 6PR radio in Perth and afterwards Mr Murray’s program was inundated with calls from Perth residents with similar stories of Telstra’s poor services and the inadequacy of broadband access.</para>
<para>When I raised Mr Watkins’s case in the House last week, the member for Herbert came up to me afterwards and said that the solution was simple: everybody has access to broadband—all that the businesses and households in my electorate had to do was get a satellite dish. Get a satellite dish! This guy has a business 400 metres from the Perth International Airport and the best a government member can say is, ‘Go out and get a satellite dish.’ It just goes to show once again how out of touch the member for Herbert and the government are when it comes to the provision of these services. It is redolent of Marie Antoinette’s comment to the French people when they complained they had no bread to eat: she said, ‘Let them eat cake.’ I think that is what the government is doing to people in Swan and around Australia.</para>
<para>Let me relate just two of the many comments about Telstra services which my electorate office has received from people in Swan. Mr Robert Birch of Kewdale says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Although I live within 8 to 10 kilometres of Perth (a capital city in Australia), Telstra is unable or unwilling to provide [an ADSL] service to residents……How could they even propose modern services to the country areas when they cannot even properly service capital city suburbs?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">My sentiments exactly. Mr Dennis Cherry of Kewdale:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Through my carrier, Up N’ Away, I applied twice for ADSL … each time Telstra said I was too far from my exchange in Ascot ... Just after that I received a letter from Telstra saying they were conducting a trial to test new [broadband] technology ... I applied and it worked perfectly for three months. After that they closed it down and I had to go back to dial up. What is going on with Telstra?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Mr Cherry is not alone in having been approached by Telstra to receive a service on a trial only to find that the services are not available on a permanent basis. I have heard many similar complaints from people in Swan about Telstra’s often used tactics of promising residents access to broadband on a trial basis, delivering that service for the period of the trial and then informing the customers—lo and behold—that despite being able to provide broadband the service is not available on a permanent basis. Not only is this ploy misleading and deceitful but I cannot believe that it is actually good business practice. Can you imagine any other business which provides a service successfully for a three-month trial basis and which then says, ‘Sorry, I can’t give it to you on a permanent basis’? What is the purpose of the trial if you cannot ultimately get the service?</para>
<para>There is only one reason why Telstra gets away with it: Telstra remains effectively and essentially a monopoly. We all know that a fully privatised monopoly is the worst of all outcomes for consumers. Already consumers are getting a raw deal from Telstra’s services. Under a fully privatised Telstra it will only get worse. So much for this government’s rhetoric about its concern for families and businesses. It sells them out to pursue its ideological obsessions. Families need broadband to ensure their children can access the best possible educational services; businesses need broadband to ensure they can be competitive and successful. On both counts you can only conclude that, on the government’s watch, families and businesses in my electorate and many others are being treated with contempt. You would expect that at the present time, when Telstra is under the spotlight, given its proposed sale, the company would be moving heaven and earth to improve its services throughout Australia. You would expect that Telstra would currently be demonstrating its corporate ‘best behaviour’. If what is currently being seen is best behaviour, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that it is far from good enough.</para>
<para>The debate about Telstra, which has occupied so much print space in the newspapers and taken up so much time in the parliament, has focused almost entirely on services in rural Australia. Having been a farmer in Western Australia for a number of years, I agree that over the years their telecommunications services have been significantly below par, and those living in rural Australia deserve much better than this government is delivering in terms of telecommunications services. But the political preoccupation of the Howard government with services in the bush has overshadowed the needs of those who live in the cities, as was pointed out last week in the coalition party room by the member for Lindsay.</para>
<para>But this is not just the member for Lindsay. The member for Tangney issued a press release on 19 May this year in which he boasted that he had been to see the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and ‘the big guns at Telstra’:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… armed with the weight of hundreds of complaints from local residents, university students, parents and small business operators, they argued the case for the people.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Not one or two—hundreds of complaints. He went on to say that his electorate could now rejoice because Telstra had promised ‘ADSL will be fully enabled by the end of June’. The member for Tangney is new to this House, so perhaps he could be forgiven for swallowing such twaddle. You can bet your bottom dollar that his constituents have not yet popped the champagne corks in celebration of his efforts because they know their services have not improved.</para>
<para>In the last election campaign the government announced $50 million to improve broadband access in metropolitan areas, but almost a year later not one single cent has been spent. This program was reannounced in this year’s budget in May. That is $50 million not yet spent in the cities, as opposed to $160 million for the HiBIS program for internet access targeted at the bush. This proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that urban residents are being treated with scorn by this government as it falls over itself to hand money to the bush to prop up the National Party. It is vital that the Australian government undertake to deliver broadband services to all Australians, irrespective of where they live. That should be the overriding objective of the government in the debate about telecommunications, yet the government is ignoring that objective to pursue its ideological agenda involving spending billions of taxpayers’ dollars to buy the vote of Senator Joyce.</para>
<para>Before I finish, let me comment on the role of the National Party in this debate. Without Senator Joyce we all know that the National Party would have caved in on the sale of Telstra ages ago. Despite crude bullying tactics, Senator Joyce at least had the gumption last week to stare down the Liberals. But, finally, as with past National Party practice, it appears that he too has been bought off. Once again, the National Party have their snouts in the trough. Having been a pig farmer, I can recognise the delighted little squeals from those opposite at the prospect of the sale. But those delighted squeals will soon turn to cries of terror when Telstra reaches the market.</para>
<para>When the National Party sign off on the sale of Telstra, I believe the consequences for them will be similar to the fate of the Democrats once they agreed to the GST. They will be finished; they will be part of tomorrow’s breakfast. Frankly, once Telstra is sold, what will be the point of the National Party? This is of course the Liberals’ covert agenda. The fact is that there are many more Liberal MPs representing rural electorates than there are National Party MPs. Those Liberals are deeply frustrated by the fact that National Party MPs are disproportionately overrepresented in cabinet and the ministry. Everyone on the coalition side of politics knows that the fast track into cabinet is to join the National Party. As we see day after day in this House, you can perform in a way that can best be described as pedestrian and, if you are in the National Party, you still get to sit around the cabinet table. So the Liberals have developed a cunning plan to kill off the National Party by privatising the rest of Telstra and, in so doing, removing the last reason for their existence. Mark my words: the full privatisation of Telstra will herald the death knell of the National Party and its inevitable takeover by the Liberals.</para>
<para>Telstra should not be privatised. Services are already woeful in the cities and in the country and they will only get worse if Telstra is privatised. I will finish by quoting a letter from Perth resident Mr Rodney Coker, published in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> last week. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">When Telstra can give a broadband service to the businesses at Perth International Airport ... then maybe they will be able to get a decent service into the bush for people.</para>

<para>—This is an interesting matter of public importance debate to be a part of. As I sat and listened, I heard coming from the opposition benches a host of interjections. Most notable was the member for Throsby who interjected that we should listen on this side of the chamber to the Newspoll, that we should listen to our constituents and that we should closely look at what the people of Australia want. I wonder whether the member for Throsby and other members of the Australian Labor Party have been looking at the wrong Newspoll. The Newspoll that I saw had the Australian Labor Party at a record low this morning. We saw dissatisfaction with the Leader of the Opposition at 51 per cent. We saw the Leader of the Opposition as preferred PM at 25 per cent compared with the Prime Minister, John Howard, at 57 per cent. In fact, only 31 per cent of the Australian population is satisfied with the opposition leader’s current performance—the lowest level ever and lower than when Mark Latham, the former member for Werriwa, was leading the Australian Labor Party.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The question can be asked: what has all this got to do with the debate currently taking place here in the chamber? Mr Deputy Speaker, I will let you know what it has to do with it. It has to do with the fact that the Australian Labor Party is so desperate to prop up the Leader of the Opposition that it will cling to anything in the hope that it resonates with the Australian population. In this particular case the Australian Labor Party is adopting a policy position completely devoid of any integrity whatsoever in the vain hope that in some way this might do something to assist the Leader of the Opposition to rise back up from those depths of despair—only a 31 per cent satisfaction level—to where he might in some way be a competitive alternative to the Prime Minister.</para>
<para>This is not going to work. The reason this will not work is that there is a complete lack of integrity when it comes to the ALP position on the further privatisation of Telstra. Let us not lose sight of the fact that Telstra at present is 49 per cent privatised. For all intents and purposes it is half privatised and has 1.7 million shareholders. Those 1.7 million shareholders have a right to demand of the Australian Labor Party their rationale for insisting that the only way that we can ensure future telecommunications services of an adequate standard is to continue this ridiculous half-pregnant ownership model that Telstra is currently lumbered with. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition, speaking this afternoon, made a number of comments about the need for Telstra to invest in more technology and in a roll out of additional technology. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition in that respect: there does need to be greater investment in the provision of infrastructure by Telstra. The question is: how do we ensure that that takes place? That is the most important question.</para>
<para>It was interesting to hear the substance—or I should say the lack thereof—in the contribution of the second speaker from the opposition in this debate. The member for Swan came into the chamber today and used as the rationale for the continuation of this half-pregnant ownership model of Telstra the requirement that it should be split because there was a local person that the member for Swan gave as an example, Mr Watkins, who was unable to gain access to high bandwidth broadband even though his business was situated only 400 metres from the Perth airport. I would try to educate some members opposite about the difference between government policy and its effects and technological impacts. The reality is that we are talking about a telecommunications network that was rolled out 100 years ago and when it was rolled out 100 years ago it was rolled out to deliver voice services.</para>
<para>What we are now seeking to do is to utilise that same technology in a way to deliver the demands of a new and sophisticated general public. One way we are doing that is by enabling copper wire to carry high bandwidth. But there is a limit to this technology, and that means that if someone is more than 4.5 kilometres away from an exchange then they cannot have access to ADSL broadband—and that has nothing at all to do with the ownership of Telstra. There is a technological limit on what that technology can do. For the member for Swan and for the Australian Labor Party to come into this chamber and claim that because of limits on technology, because of limits on what we can do with a phone system that was installed 100 years ago, the best way forward is for Telstra to remain in this half-pregnant ownership model is absurd. It is farcical, and the Australian Labor Party knows it has zero substance when it comes to policy integrity on an issue like this.</para>
<para>The question can then be asked: what can the government do? What can the government do to ensure that customers can be satisfied that Telstra will respond to their needs? What can the government do to ensure that people in regional Australia, that people in metropolitan Australia, have access to reasonable levels of quality when it comes to telecommunications services? The answer, quite simply, is regulation. Regulation is an entirely separate question as to whether or not Telstra is fully privatised or remains as this half-public, half-privatised model. Members opposite do not want to talk about this issue because they would much rather muddy the waters and claim that limits on technology are, in some way, going to have an impact on it. They think they can sniff a vote in this issue. But this government is not concerned with that; this government is concerned with good policy, good technology and good outcomes that will ensure that we continue to add value to the Australian economy—not with the opportunistic, petty politics that the Australian Labor Party focuses on in this debate.</para>
<para>We saw the classic thinking of the Leader of the Opposition when he said, and I use a verbatim quote: ‘We need to command and control. We need to ensure that we, the government, keep our hands on the tiller.’ That is classic left of centre thinking from the Australian Labor Party. It sits there and puts forward the contention that the Australian Labor Party is in the best position to know about what the Australian public needs in terms of new technology in the future. Unlike electricity, unlike roads, unlike water pipes, when it comes to telecommunications, there is more than one way to deliver a service. The Australian Labor Party might think it is particularly clever and the Australian Labor Party might think it is in the best position to command and control the roll out of new technology but, if it does that, it will lead Australia backwards, it will run down services and it will cause additional problems.</para>
<para>If you think back to when the Australian Labor Party was in government, you start to see very clearly the difference between an Australian Labor Party that says one thing but then does something completely different. When the Labor Party today stands up and cries foul on the inability of people to secure a decent telecommunications service, it does not mention the fact that when the Australian Labor Party was last in government and when Telstra was fully publicly owned, it could, in fact, take up to 27 months for someone to get a connection to a telephone system—27 months! And the Australian Labor Party says full public ownership of Telstra is a superior system to privatisation. The reality is that this government is leading the charge through the universal service obligation imposed not only on Telstra but on all telecommunications companies. This government is leading the charge with the customer service guarantee. This government is leading the charge in ensuring, to the greatest extent possible, that there is parity between urban areas and regional areas when it comes to the provision of telecommunications services.</para>
<para>Compare that to Labor’s record. There were no consumer safeguards when Labor was last in power, so it is very rich for the Australian Labor Party to now come into the chamber and claim that in some way it is trying to do the right thing. This is a very simple issue. There is no connection between regulation and ownership. This government needs to concern itself with effective regulation. The best way we can ensure that we provide effective regulation of telecommunications companies is to separate ourselves from the conflict that we are currently caught in, where we are part-owner and part-regulator. Let us forget this notion of trying to maintain Telstra as a half-pregnant ownership model. Let us get Telstra fully privatised. Let us let the market work out the best delivery platform for future telecommunications and let us stop the scare campaign of the Australian Labor Party and the Independents, who will go around their electorates talking up fear and talking up limitations to telecommunications technology because they think there is a vote in it. Policy integrity is what is required, and good policy integrity should see the full privatisation of Telstra. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—The proposed sale of the remaining publicly owned shares in Telstra is a line in the sand issue in the bush. There is no competitive model that will work, other than in the biggest regional cities. Competition is a furphy in this debate. For almost a decade now, I have fielded the concerns of country people over poor telco services. Those concerns continue and those people know they will only receive upgraded services through continued public ownership of the most important thing that can maintain any sort of equity between city and country—their telecommunications network. Despite the millions spent in recent years, that network is still like an old tea towel—still strong around the edges perhaps, but seriously frayed in many parts, with big holes in other sections. People in country areas know how they can be left high and dry, as they were with the switch off of mobile analog services.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>CDMA came as an afterthought after tremendous political pressure, much through the work of Boyd Munro and APUMP and the stream of protests from all over country Australia through my office. CDMA is still only fair to poor as a line of sight technology. On the drive from Bathurst to Canberra, I have no mobile service for large sections on GSM and my staff have the same problems with CDMA. There are no plans for mobile services in towns of less than 300, such as Cumnock and Tullamore. Broadband ADSL services are impossible beyond five kilometres of an exchange in country areas, and many parts of large centres, like Bathurst and Orange, are still not ADSL enabled and there are no plans to carry out this work. Where ADSL is not available, the HiBIS option is offered at $40 a month more. It is not an option for most families. They are left with a dial-up guaranteed internet speed of just 19 kilobits per second.</para>
<para>This is an equity issue, an education issue and a needs issue, and these gaping holes in the provision of services across rural and regional Australia cannot be fixed with a cynical $1 billion spend and $100 million a year interest earned from the Deputy Prime Minister’s special fund—a fund, by the way, that any incoming government could wind up straight away and redirect to its political priorities; and if it is Labor, it will not be the bush.</para>
<para>We have seen many figures bandied about in recent weeks. Let us go back to earlier this year when The Nationals’ own Page report suggested that $7 billion would be required to provide adequate broadband services to rural areas. The then Telstra management suggested it would be more like $30 billion. The truth of the matter is that no-one has any idea how much is required to deliver state-of-the-art services because any survey of needs is simply a snapshot in time.</para>
<para>And who is going to do the work, with Telstra unable to meet its guarantees now? What about the so-called universal service obligation? Telstra argued several years ago that this would require a billion dollars a year for the foreseeable future. Telstra’s competitors said $200 million was enough. The Productivity Commission looked into it and said the figure was closer to $600 million. This government signed off on $200 million and next year just $170 million will be spent to help equalise services covered under the USO—that is, basic landline telephone and payphones only, not the broadband internet that so many country Australians cannot access. No wonder Sol Trujillo does not want regulation or anything to do with the real problems of the rural network. He knows what it is like and what is needed. He wants to maximise profits for his private shareholders, just like Optus and all those other private telcos want nothing to do with providing services into unprofitable parts of the market. They are happy to cherry-pick the juicy bits, just like a privatised Telstra would do for its private shareholders. As I said, there is no competitive model that will work in other than the most profitable parts.</para>
<para>The Nationals have had the chance for the past nine years to argue the case Senator Barnaby Joyce is now putting on behalf of his constituents. They could have crossed the floor at any time. They now hide among the skirts of Senator Joyce, wallowing in a new-found profile but saying nothing publicly, letting him cop the bullyboy flak from their Liberal coalition partners. The country Liberals, senators and members, have all been party to a disgraceful betrayal of their constituents, with the possible exception of the member for Hume, although he is not here and he, too, has been uncharacteristically quiet in recent days on this issue. Has Bill Heffernan got to him too?</para>
<para>Senator Joyce, up until his hesitation today, had tremendous support throughout rural Australia—indeed right across Australia, as today’s Newspoll shows. Returned diggers said to me at functions over the weekend, ‘We fought for this country and we fought for the sorts of things that the country had and one of those things is a proper communications network that is publicly owned.’ That is the point that country people are making over and over again. My own electorate poll shows that 93 per cent of 2½ thousand respondents are adamant that Telstra remain in majority public ownership. Should Senator Joyce and his colleagues reject that opinion and support the sale, this issue will—as a previous speaker said—become The Nationals’ GST. I say too to any other senator who may be wavering and who may be a substitute vote if Senator Joyce stands firm: it will be one of your very last votes in parliament because your days will be numbered as well.</para>

<para>—You know when the Labor Party are not fair dinkum because you just have to look at what the MPI is about and whether they actually address the MPI. Let me remind you what the MPI is about. It is about the failure to provide telecommunication services to all Australians, and the Labor Party did not once address that issue. Let me address it directly here and now. Every Australian, no matter where they are in this country, can get a phone service right now. Every Australian, no matter where they are in the country, can get broadband internet right now. They can get broadband internet and they can get a reliable phone service right now. So what is this business about the failure to provide telecommunication services to all Australians? They are there now. That is the hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party. The member for Swan told this House that he has a customer who is 400 metres from the Perth Airport who cannot get broadband internet. I can tell the member for Swan that that customer can get broadband internet now and he can get it in either of two ways.</para>

<para>—He will not get ADSL because ADSL technology, as the member for Moncrieff rightly said earlier, only goes 4½ kilometres on copper wire from an exchange. We accept that. That is technology. That is the limit. But the member for Swan’s constituent can either take satellite broadband or he can take wireless broadband. Both services are available at Perth Airport right now and it is irresponsible for the member for Swan to get up in this House and mislead the parliament.</para>

<para>Haven’t you noticed that the more of Telstra that is privatised, the better the services have become? Have you noticed that? It has been an amazing thing that the Australian Labor Party does not like to recognise, but it is true. Let me talk about some of those services. In the sitting break I went to Warrawagine Station on the edge of the Great Sandy Desert in Western Australia. You could not get a more remote location. And what did I find at this remote location? There were four homesteads on the station and every one had broadband internet access, provided free of charge by Telstra. Each house had its little satellite dish and it was connected to the world free of charge by Telstra. Also on the station was another satellite dish providing 32 phone lines if the station wanted 32 phone lines. That was provided free of charge by Telstra. This station only wanted four phone lines, as it happened—and most of us in the cities do not have four phone lines—but they could have had another 28 if they had wanted them, right there and then. What a fantastic service. The Labor Party says that we are not providing services to all Australians, but there they are.</para>
<para>What did I do then? I took the trouble—the Labor Party and the member for Batman should do this—to go to Telstra’s global operations centre at Clayton in Melbourne. What do you find there? You find a state-of-the-art centre that has been there for five years. There is nothing like it in the rest of the world. Of course, they have a back-up global operations centre in case something goes wrong with the main one. What did I do when I was there? I went onto the floor of the global operations centre and, without notice, said: ‘I’ve just been to Warrawagine Station in the Great Sandy Desert. I want to have a look at the state of their satellite receiving terminal. Please show it to me.’ From all of the technology all across Australia, Telstra pressed the buttons and up on the screen came Warrawagine’s satellite earth terminal sitting on the edge of the Great Sandy Desert. They said: ‘This is what is happening at the moment. This line is actually engaged’—and so on. They showed me the earth receiving station in Perth and the other end of the satellite link so that they could see if there were any faults there. Then they said—using the internet, of course—‘We’ll take you to Warrawagine’s point of presence in Karratha.’ They just pressed a couple of buttons and we were looking at the point of presence in Karratha.</para>
<para>What fantastic technology. The reason they have it is so that, if there is a fault, you can get in there and get it fixed quick smart. While I was there, right in the middle of a great bank of video display screens where they put up the most urgent faults in red, a fault was discovered on the Townsville-Cairns line. I thought they had put it up just because I was there, but they had put it up because there was a real fault. I said: ‘What is this serious fault? It’s in red, right up in the middle. It is Townsville-Cairns. I want to know.’ Out of the hundreds of thousands of services in that corridor, the fault was one 64-kilobit per second ISDN line that had gone down and Telstra’s priority was to have it right at the top in red. They said, ‘We want to get it fixed as quickly as possible.’ What sort of service is that? I take my hat off to Telstra. I want to see Telstra grow to be a great Australian. The only way that Telstra is going to realise its full potential is if we take off the brakes and let it fly. The sooner the Senate does its work, the better.</para>

<para>—I was with the member for Herbert at the particular station, as was the member for Batman. As he has done in his speech today, the member for Herbert displayed his ignorance about Telstra’s capacity to deliver services at that station, and I was a little disturbed by some of the things he had to say. This issue has been around for some time, and the past week has really brought it to a point. There are a number of people suggesting that the full privatisation should take place now and that some billions of dollars should be invested in current infrastructure and the so-called future-proofing that the government continually talks about. The Prime Minister has said in this very chamber, in answer to a question from me, that no government can bind a future government to the delivery of services or guarantee that regulations that are put in place by this parliament will be borne out in other parliaments. It is against our Constitution to do that. So it is absurd for people in the National Party—and I would be pleased to see the member for Hinkler address this issue when he follows me—to say that you can future-proof, set funds aside, to guarantee that there will be equity of access to services that are available at the moment and services that have not yet been invented.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>On Channel 10 on Sunday, for the first time, the Leader of the National Party alluded to how difficult it was—I think it was in answer to a question from Michelle Grattan—for experts to assess what it would cost to put in place future technology that has not yet been invented. Isn’t that mind-boggling? The leader of the party that is out to sell this for short-term political gain—and because it has got itself into a bit of a bind—said he was willing to talk to as many experts as possible, but then said, ‘It is impossible to cost this because we do not know what the technology is going to be.’ That same person, the Leader of the National Party, suggested that setting aside a $2 billion fund which would produce $100 million per annum would be sufficient to future-proof regional and rural Australia. It is an absolute joke.</para>
<para>The new CEO of Telstra had the audacity to come to Canberra and say to the Prime Minister and others that he believes there has been an underspend, an underinvestment, of about $5 billion in regional and rural telecommunications. He made that point and I agree with him. At least someone in the field who should know what he is talking about has put a figure on the underspend up until now. That is an indictment of the government’s policy and the National Party’s policy. In the last few days, even the minister has said, ‘It’s patchy.’ Last year she was saying it was up to scratch; now it is ‘patchy’. The people who were saying it was not up to scratch are starting to say it is looking good and that, if we set aside a fund of $2 billion, the money generated will guarantee services. What utter nonsense! They are taking the Australian people for absolute fools.</para>
<para>The other part of this so-called plan is that $1 billion from the $30 billion to $32 billion from the sale will go into the immediate restoration of services. I have just been on a 10,000 kilometre drive across regional and rural Australia. The reception on my mobile phone—and I have as good an aerial system as Telstra can provide—provided access to mobile communications for 1,800 kilometres of the 10,000 kilometres. If people are suggesting that is up to scratch—that that is good enough—and that $100 million a year, or even $1 billion in a one-off payment, is going to correct those sorts of problems, again they are taking the electorate for fools.</para>
<para>You have a situation where the government are saying, ‘This is the grand plan: a billion dollar one-off payment. The interest on $2 billion’—this is over as many years as they would like to suggest—‘would equate to $100 million a year,’ which is $25 million a year less than they have been putting in over the last eight years. The minister has said that the government have spent $1 billion since 1997—$125 million a year. The promise, the commitment for the future with this great fund, is $25 million a year less. But let us look at that. You have the CEO saying there has been an underspend, an underinvestment, of $5 billion. They are all—even Barnaby Joyce—running out there now saying, ‘This is better than we had a few weeks ago. This is looking good. They are looking for reasons to capitulate. The government’s response is $1 billion and $100 million a year for the rest of history. It will take 40 years on those calculations to reach the equivalent of what the CEO had the audacity to say to the Prime Minister last week about the $5 billion underspend. He did not even get to what is required for the future because he does not know the technology that Australians will generally need to access these services in the future.</para>
<para>The issue here is equity of access and equity of price. If you get that right, through this very important piece of infrastructure you can negate the problem of distance as being a disadvantage of living in regional Australia. That is the issue here. If you fully privatise this organisation as many have said—including the only member of the National Party, Peter McGauran, who has spoken so far in this debate—it is a commercial reality. The Treasurer said today that it was a commercial reality that they would have to operate for their shareholders not the service. What has happened recently is that the focus of the government and of Telstra has been on a sale, on underinvestment in infrastructure, on high dividends, so that the share price can be maintained at an artificially high level with the move towards a sale, and against service. I genuinely hope that Barnaby Joyce in the Senate sticks to his guns on this particular issue. I have seen indications of weakness in the last day or two.</para>
<para>I say to members of the National Party who do have a genuine concern—the speaker following me, the member for Hinkler, has a genuine concern on this issue—that, if you have ever purported to represent regional Australia on an issue, this is the one to stand up on. The government and particularly, but not only, the National Party members have an opportunity to make a stand for regional Australia. Do not lie down on this issue. Telstra is too important to regional Australia to sell off. It is easy to decorate a cake that you know is only for short-term advantage to get out of a political bind. Take the Liberals on on this particular issue and stand up for country people. Listen to what they are saying in all the polls. Listen to what they are saying right across the nation on this issue and vote no to the sale of Telstra when the issue comes before the parliament.</para>

<para>—If ever I have heard a lot of pious nonsense, I have heard it today. We should be looking at a vision for this country’s telecommunications. What we have at present is just a mishmash of ideas. Some people say, ‘If it stays at the current level of ownership, it will be okay.’ Others say, ‘If it’s privatised, it’ll be okay.’ But what we are not engaging in is how we deliver to the people of Australia, in capital cities and the outer metropolitan areas, in the country and remote areas, a level of telecommunications fit for a country in the 21st century. What we have is a mishmash. What has happened over the years, going back to 1991 and the current Leader of the Opposition, is a trail of betrayal. If in 1991 the then communications minister had really wanted to give Australia a first-class telecommunications system by corporatising it, he should have had the vision and the know-how to know what that meant.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>When you corporatise something, you ask it to act commercially in the market. You have shareholder ministers if you do not have shareholders, and they expect, as shareholders do, profits. That is a given. If the minister had really been serious at the time, he would have separated the wholesale and retail operations of Telstra by whatever means—structural, operational or accountancy—into different streams. If we were going to have competition in Australia’s telecommunications, fundamental to that was that, as you concocted a new system, Telstra had to provide third-party access. It had to provide wholesale rates for other people operating in the market. In something as competitive as telecommunications, without that separation you are left with the situation where the competitor is also the gatekeeper. You can argue about all these problems that we have heard today in the House and discuss so-called solutions to your heart’s content, but, until you face the fundamental problem, it will never happen.</para>
<para>The fundamental problem lies in three areas. The first is that you must create a new platform: a platform for delivering high-speed broadband and other services into the heartland of Australia—from the outer metropolitan areas into the country and, to the extent that you can, into remote areas. Why? Because we are at the threshold of new technologies and we will never deliver them on a clapped out copper system, although executives of Telstra Countrywide would have us believe so. When you look around Australia and see that people are operating on 19.2 kilobits, you realise that it is just a disgrace. When you have an international hotel on the Gold Coast operating at 28.8 kilobits, you really have to ask: ‘Have we seriously addressed that problem?’ We have not. We must roll out a new platform. My suggestion is that that would be a combination of copper fibre and uplink/downlink wireless connection.</para>
<para>The Leader of the Opposition and the member for Hunter showed last Thursday that they were not even properly engaged with the debate and had an appalling knowledge of the whole issue. For example, the member for Hunter asked the Deputy Prime Minister:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Is he aware of speculation that Telstra is now prepared to offer up to $5 billion? Deputy Prime Minister, how do you explain this $3 billion difference?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In other words, he was asking about the $3 billion difference between the $5 billion that Sol Trujillo was talking about and the $2 billion that was suggested for the future fund. They are two totally separate things. The $5 billion is for the roll-out of fibre optic and wireless technology.</para>
<para>It is funny, isn’t it: Telstra has been telling the Australian public that the National Party’s idea of rolling out copper to the extent of $7.2 billion would never work; it would cost somewhere near $30 billion. Can you all remember that? It was only a matter of seven or eight weeks ago. Yet when Sol Trujillo came here he was able to tell us that we can now hotwire regional Australia for $5 billion. I think someone has been kidding someone.</para>
<para>The platform is the guarantee that as new technologies become available you can get them to the bush. But the future fund is also important because as new technologies become available, given the economies of scale in regional Australia, you will need something to guarantee that those new technologies are rolled out in the system. The third thing you need is a regulatory system that guarantees a separation of Telstra’s wholesale and retail operations, because only in that way will you get a genuinely competitive market.</para>
<para>One of the Independent speakers has said that you can never have a competitive market in regional Australia. I disagree with that. It is already happening in mobile technology; why should it not also happen in a properly restructured terrestrial system? There is no reason at all why that should not happen.</para>

<para>—I will not prolong this speech any longer, other than to say that a lot of people have walked around with their hands on their hearts in this parliament for many years. When this was a key issue as far back as March 1998—I remind the member for Kennedy that he was a member of the same party as me—I raised this matter of drawing a line in the sand at 49.9 per cent until such time as these things had been worked through. I was not supported by one person in this parliament—not one! At the National Party conference in Brisbane just a few weeks ago I added an amendment to the motion that had been put up and which the government by and large adopted:</para>

</quote>
<para class="block">Until we get those three things in place all this puffery about selling Telstra and not selling it will achieve nothing. It could be happening today under its current level of ownership and it could happen in a totally free enterprise market. Let us cut all this nonsense and start thinking about the people in outer metropolitan areas, country areas and remote areas and about our nation as a dimension of our GDP with a modern 21st century telecommunications system.</para>

<para>—I come a little ill prepared for the debate on the matter of public importance today because it took me a long time to get here. We were delayed for four hours at airports on the way. This is rather interesting because in country Australia, as my honourable colleague from New England said, we do not have a choice of airlines. The great privatisation was wonderful for the big cities of Australia. We could go from Townsville to Melbourne for $270 return, but it was a bit unfortunate for the people in Mount Isa, who have to pay $880 return for half the distance—from Mount Isa to Townsville. In the five or six years—or whatever it is—since we privatised Qantas I have only travelled on a non-Qantas flight, I think, four times. Those who are familiar with me know that five, six or seven times a week I get onto an aeroplane to go between major ports. So the privatisation was possibly a wonderful thing for the cities of Australia. You can go to Auckland from Brisbane and return for $270, so it is terrific for those people, but for those of us who do not live in the metropolitan areas of Australia: too bad, so sad. We are now subsidising the cities. That is what has happened.</para>

<para>—The member for Deakin is laughing. This member, who is from Melbourne, is putting a proposition to this parliament that, after Telstra is privatised and Mary Murgatroyd’s phone breaks down in Julia Creek, they are going to fly a technician from Townsville or Brisbane to fix her phone. Is this the proposition that the honourable member is seriously putting to this House? Does he seriously expect a single person in this country to believe that proposition?</para>

<para>—The member for Deakin—yes, we want to get him on record because he has opened his mouth. I think that people in Australia feel there is a rising tide against the government with industrial relations and the sale of Telstra. If I were a betting man I would be shortening the odds on this side of the House for the next election. Every time a telephone breaks down in the electorate of the member for Deakin, those people are going to remember how he came into this place and advocated the sale of Telstra. That 70 per cent are not in the country areas of Australia. I have never seen this as a city/country debate. I do not think that the results will be much different in the city, but I am not here to represent the cities. I deeply regret that my National colleagues seem to now represent the city interests. If Barnaby Joyce sells us out and votes for the sale of Telstra, it will probably be the last gasp for the National Party.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I was in a major debate with somebody on national television. He was naming all the countries that had privatised their telecommunications and even Cuba has privatised their telecommunications provider. I said, ‘It may be suitable for Cuba.’ I do not come into this place with any fixed ideas that everything should be privatised or everything should be government owned. Each case should be judged upon its merits, but on that side of the House now is the belief that absolutely every single thing should be privatised—that it is a magic wand that will overcome all of our problems and deliver a better Australia. I would like to know for what area it will deliver a better Australia, and I do not have to go back any further than last weekend, when we had our mid-west Rugby League grand final. It may mean nothing to people in this House, but it means a hell of a lot to us. Half the population of the town turns up to our Rugby League grand finals. I found that our president and our starring centre had left Hughenden because there was yet another round of sackings in the railways due to the fact that we have virtually no railway services left in the mid-west towns. There is just no railway system left.</para>
<para>All of this competition business was highlighted by the Productivity Commission report on transportation by Mr Hilmer. They pointed out that there was a $4,000 million subsidy for commuter transportation in Australia, that this was disgraceful and that if we deregulated the taxis and privatised the railway system it would solve all the problems and be marvellous for us. I was originally pretty positive about it. I thought that maybe some of this $4,000 million subsidy would come back to the people in the bush, who pay 100 per cent tax when they go to work of a morning because their petrol is taxed at 120 per cent and at that stage our motor cars were taxed at about 50 per cent as well. So I thought this was a pretty good idea, but let us see how it worked out for rural Australia. In my home country in the mid-west of North Queensland, we have no rail services at all. We have lost all our football terms; we have lost all our people; we have lost our top senior high schools. Heaven only knows we have even lost our pubs in some towns. That is how it worked out for us.</para>
<para>Getting back to the cities, I mentioned the $4,000 million subsidy the other day and a senior public servant corrected me and said the subsidy for the cities was now $6,500 million. I deeply regret it when I hear Liberal country members speaking on this—although they have had the decency not to come in here and talk, but the National Party members come in here and talk. I do not know how they do that. They absolutely must know. What I am talking about here is not confined to the Kennedy electorate; it is every rural electorate in Australia. All right, we Independents have the freedom to speak out, but even when I was in the National Party at least I spoke out. Sometimes I did not have the courage to vote with my convictions, but at least I had the courage to speak out and call it what it was. When we were getting shafted I said we were getting shafted. I think that that somehow helped the people out there in regional Australia.</para>
<para>I was at the Mount Isa rodeo on the weekend—I was working on the bar—and six people came up and said what a great bloke Barnaby Joyce was. I tell you what: after he has voted for the sale of Telstra, if he does, they will not be saying that at the rodeo next year. It is not a good thing, because it will just break their hearts again. Someone raises their hopes but then sells them out and dashes their hopes. It would be better if he had shut his mouth and not said anything if that is what he intends to do.</para>
<para>A previous speaker to this debate spoke about technology. I do not know where these people come from. Do they know anything about Australia at all? Do not get up here and shoot your mouth off if you don’t. Another speaker got up and said we have broadband everywhere. I have not checked it recently, but I know I have letters in my office telling me we have no broadband in Mareeba on the north-east side of the river. We have no broadband at Soldiers Hill in Mount Isa. We have no broadband in Ravenshoe or Herberton. Maybe these people are all lying—I have not had time to check these things since the debate has been raised, but I most certainly will now. I suspect that these people are not writing me letters for the joy of it.</para>
<para>As far as technology goes, when I had a cattle station right up in the middle of nowhere, we saw four changes of technology in a 15-year period. Not us, but some of our neighbours had copper wire and then that was replaced by DRCS. Then the DRCS was changed to satellite and some of the other stations have now been changed from satellite to HCRC. I saw four changes of technology. I did not have to go on bended knee to the Treasurer and say, ‘Please will you finance this new technology?’ <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<motion>
<para>That, in accordance with section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the House approves the following proposal for work in the Parliamentary Zone which was presented to the House on 9 August 2005, namely: Pathway on the southern foreshore of Lake Burley Griffin including ‘Australians of the Year Walk’.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">The proposed pathway is located at the western end of the southern foreshore of Lake Burley Griffin. It connects an existing pathway adjacent to Commonwealth Avenue Bridge to the existing lakeside promenade. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline> The southern foreshore is a popular walking, jogging and cycling route. The pathway generally comprises a concrete footpath in sound condition. However, parts remain as unformed dirt tracks in poor condition.</para>
<para>The tracks pose risks to public safety within the Parliamentary Zone. They contain potholes and trip hazards and are slippery when wet. Provision of concrete footpaths to match the remainder of the pathway is consistent with the government’s funding purpose of improving public health and safety. The pathway is adjacent to the lake’s edge, and it is appropriate that bollards be included as part of the works as clear markers of the edge.</para>
<para>The pathway comprises concrete paving, a series of bollards, street furniture and lighting. Incorporated in the pathway are five metal strips set flush in the concrete, forming the five stave lines to a musical score. Precast concrete bollards are to represent the notes to the music score of the Australian national anthem and will be placed within the metal strips according to their position within the music, along the length of the pathway.</para>
<para>Set flush and fixed to the bollards will be photo-anodised, full-colour aluminium plaques containing the names and images of Australians of the Year. Each plaque will represent a year of the award, and they will be arranged chronologically, starting at the western end of the path. At either end of the walk an interpretive sign will be installed, describing the history of the Australian of the Year Awards and introducing the Australian of the Year Walk. The pathway will be lit at night with the Parliamentary Zone light fittings currently installed along the southern lakeside promenade.</para>
<para>The National Capital Authority has advised that it is prepared to grant works approval to the proposal pursuant to section 12(1)(b) of the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988. The approval of both houses is sought under section 5(1) of the Parliament Act 1974 for the pathway on the southern foreshore of Lake Burley Griffin, including the Australians of the Year Walk.</para>

<para>—As the person who represents this area until the current redistribution process takes effect, I want to say a couple of things about this proposal. I support the proposal, so I will not be controversial or long, but the statement seems to me to miss a couple of things. With the assistance of the clerks and the Table Office, I had a look at the original documentation that was tabled in the parliament in June, when, I think, the proposal was originally brought to the parliament for advice. It is very comprehensive in terms of design drawings and all those things, but there are two things we do not have: first, what is it going to cost, and, second, what is the timetable? Those are two things—the second, in particular—that we need to know.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This work is overdue. In saying that, I am not being critical. All works have to be done in sequence; not everything can be done at once. If this is when this project came to its turn in the queue, that is fine. So, in saying it is overdue, I am not criticising the failure to do it before; there is always more work to do than there are resources available to do it. I will give the minister about 30 seconds more while he consults with the officers, which is perfectly reasonable. I would like the minister to let me know now, as would be theoretically appropriate before we approve the motion, but obviously I am not going to hold this up. If the minister would send me some information about costing and timetable, I would be grateful.</para>

<para>—These two bills were introduced into the House on Thursday last week. They are being debated here today, and they are listed for debate and passage in the Senate this week. The <inline ref="R2414">National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (Repeal, Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2415">Australian Workplace Safety Standards Bill 2005</inline> are inextricably linked and, as a consequence, I have no objection to there being a cognate debate on these two bills. I make it clear at the outset, though, that Labor supports the legislative underpinning to develop and declare occupational health and safety codes and standards but opposes the abolition of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. As a consequence of that, Labor supports the Australian Workplace Safety Standards Bill 2005 but opposes the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (Repeal, Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005. Labor adopts that position for the following reasons. Firstly, the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission bill seeks to abolish the tripartite National Occupational Health and Safety Commission, the NOHSC, and replace it with the Australian Safety and Compensation Council, the ASCC. Secondly, the Australian Workplace Safety Standards Bill 2005 seeks to enshrine in legislation the power of the Australian Safety and Compensation Council to develop occupational health and safety standards and codes once the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission is abolished.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Regrettably, Australia continues to have a poor record with respect to work related death, injury and illness. It is estimated that there are around 3,000 work related deaths in Australia each year. Work causes more fatalities than the national road toll. In 2002 road fatalities numbered more than 1,700 deaths. To think that Australia’s workplaces have a higher fatality incidence is truly appalling in modern Australia. When one breaks this down, the true gravity of the situation becomes apparent. Nearly 450 of those work related deaths—an average of nearly 10 per week—are the result of a traumatic incident at work, including work related road deaths, and a further 150 deaths occur while working Australians are travelling to or from work. Another 200 people who are bystanders die each year as a result of someone else’s work activity.</para>
<para>In 1996 National Occupational Health and Safety Commission researchers arrived at a conservative estimate that at least 2,300 people died each year as a result of work related exposure to chemicals. This does not reflect the current extent of death from occupational disease. In the near future this figure may rise due to the expected increase in asbestos related deaths, a tragedy that for many decades has continued its macabre assault on working Australians, particularly through the Wittenoom disaster and the James Hardie disgrace. Australia has the highest incidence of asbestos related disease in the developed world. The incidence in Australia has been rising steeply since 1970, and it is estimated that the total number of asbestos related deaths will reach at least 40,000 and perhaps as many as 60,000 by 2020.</para>
<para>More broadly, approximately 480,000 Australian employees experience a work related injury or illness each year. That translates to approximately 2.8 million Australians suffering from work related long-term health conditions. Each year there are around 140,000 compensated work related injuries resulting in an absence from work of one or more weeks. In comparison—excluding New South Wales, for which relevant data is not available—there are around 13,500 road accidents involving casualties each year in Australia.</para>
<para>Turning to the compensation paid to workers suffering as a result of workplace injury, I regret to advise that only around 40 per cent of all employees who experience and suffer from a work related injury or illness receive some form of compensation. This of course has an enormous deleterious cost to our social and economic bottom line. It has been estimated that the cost to the economy exceeds $20 billion per annum, and it should be borne in mind that this figure of course does not take into account the social cost—the trauma and personal suffering of the victims and their families.</para>
<para>Most responsibility for the implementation of occupational health and safety legislation, standards and codes of practice is exercised by state and territory governments. The Commonwealth’s involvement is through the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission, the Workplace Relations Ministerial Council and, in its role as an employer, the Commonwealth Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission.</para>
<para>In 1985, Labor established the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission through the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission Act 1985. As a consequence, the commission has been in operation for about 20 years. The commission is not just the Commonwealth’s national body but Australia’s national body. It leads and coordinates the national effort to prevent workplace death, injury and disease in Australia.</para>
<para>The commission is a tripartite statutory body with 18 members, including representatives of the Commonwealth, state and territory governments; and the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which are the formal representatives of employers and employees. The commission is not a regulatory authority and thus neither makes nor enforces law. Largely the commission is responsible for producing key national standards as a model for laws in each Australian jurisdiction to help to achieve nationally consistent regulation; providing occupational health and safety statistics; ensuring that health and safety issues are included in training courses for employees in Australian industry; providing practical guidance to solve occupational health and safety problems and issues; and setting the national occupational health and safety research agenda.</para>
<para>Because the commission does not make or implement occupational health and safety legislation, each jurisdiction may take up and amend commission documents to suit its own regulatory processes. This can result in differences in the way legislation is implemented in individual states and territories and has led in more recent times to arguments for the harmonisation of occupational health and safety legislation and regulation across and throughout the Commonwealth.</para>
<para>The principal goal in establishing the commission in 1985 was to reduce the unacceptably high national record of occupational death, injury and illness. In doing so, the commission sought to develop an awareness of issues relevant to occupational health and safety matters among members of the community and facilitate public debate and discussion on such issues; to provide a forum in the public interest by which representatives of all Australian governments, employers and employees may consult and participate in developing and formulating policies and strategies relating to occupational health and safety matters; and to provide a national focus for activities relating to occupational health and safety matters.</para>
<para>A key element of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission is its tripartite nature. Tripartism is the most positive way of working within Australia’s constitutional framework. It ensures that the principal representative parties involved in occupational health and safety—namely governments, employers and employees—develop a close working relationship, an understanding of each other’s points of view and a commitment to common goals. Under the existing tripartite structure of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission, the Commonwealth and state governments have clear and distinctive roles and responsibilities in occupational health and safety matters. The role of the Commonwealth is primarily one of coordination, facilitation and leadership.</para>
<para>Since 1991, through its tripartite committees and working groups, the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission has declared seven priority national standards and codes of practice, covering a range of workplace health and safety hazards. While these have not always been adopted in a nationally consistent way in state and territory legislation, the very fact that priority national standards and codes of practice have been declared is testimony to the utility and success of the commission.</para>
<para>In 1997, under the government’s direction, the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission reduced its activity with regard to the development of national standards and codes of practice, although there are a range of hazards still to be addressed, including working hours, stress and bullying. The commission has been reluctant to take national action on these issues.</para>
<para>Funding to the commission has been reduced since the Howard government came to power in 1996. In 1995-96, funding for the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission was $19.78 million. In 2004-05 it was $15.023 million. This has lead to the virtual cessation of National Occupational Health and Safety Commission financial support for important occupational health and safety research.</para>
<para>Some workplace hazards have the potential to cause so much injury or disease that specific regulations or codes of practice are warranted. These regulations and codes, adopted under state and territory principal occupational health and safety acts, spell out the duties of particular groups of people in controlling the risks associated with specific hazards. Regulations are legally enforceable. Codes of practice provide advice on how to meet regulatory requirements. As such, codes are not legally enforceable but they can be used in courts as evidence that legal requirements have or have not been met.</para>
<para>The national commission sets occupational health and safety standards for hazards common to many industries and workplaces across Australia. These standards do not become law until they are adopted as regulations in each of the states and territories. In March 2004 the Productivity Commission reported on its inquiry into n<inline font-size="13pt">ational workers compensation and occupational health and safety frameworks.</inline> That report focused primarily on workers compensation rather than on occupational health and safety. The Productivity Commission found that ‘national uniformity in OH&amp;S regulation should be a priority’—a reference to the harmonisation of approach to which I referred earlier.</para>
<para>The Productivity Commission recommended that the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission be reformed but not abolished. The Productivity Commission also recommended:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">clear specification of the objective of achieving uniform national occupational health and safety legislation and regulation in all jurisdictions in the NOHSC enabling legislation;</para>
<para class="block">agreement by all jurisdictions to adopt, without variation, the legislation and regulations proposed by NOHSC and approved by the Council;</para>
<para class="block">NOHSC have the ability to appoint advisory bodies, noting the importance of consulting with employers, unions and all jurisdictions;</para>
<para class="block">specified timetables for Council review of proposals from NOHSC, similar to those applying in relation to food standards — the process to be prescribed in the legislation; and</para>
<para class="block">funding of NOHSC shared by the jurisdictions, together with a commitment to funding the research and data collection necessary to ensure the development of a best practice national occupational health and safety system.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Howard government’s response to the Productivity Commission’s inquiry is to abolish the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission and replace it with the proposed Australian Safety and Compensation Council—the ASCC. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations announced in May 2004 that the government would maintain current funding for this body. In other words, the current funding of the commission would be applied to the proposed Safety and Compensation Council.</para>
<para>Let me deal briefly with some provisions of the two bills. The <inline ref="R2414">National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (Repeal, Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005</inline> provides for the abolition of the commission through repealing the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission Act 1985. The bill also deals with the consequential and transitional matters arising from that repeal and from the enactment of the Australian Workplace Safety Standards Act 2005. Notably, the current standards and codes declared by the commission will be taken to have been declared by the ASCC, the body replacing the commission. As the minister indicated in his second reading speech, the bill ‘also preserves the effect of any public consultations that are under way and allows for these to be treated as if they had been undertaken by the new council’. The bill also transfers the National Occupational Health and Safety Strategy 2002-2012 and the associated business plan to the Australian Safety and Compensation Council.</para>
<para>The <inline ref="R2415">Australian Workplace Safety Standards Bill 2005</inline> establishes the Australian Safety and Compensation Council by administrative or executive action. The Australian Safety and Compensation Council will be an advisory body only. The council is to be created executively rather than being underpinned through legislation. Labor is opposed to this downgrading of the status of the primary Commonwealth body responsible for leadership in occupational health and safety matters.</para>
<para>The Australian Safety and Compensation Council’s functions will include the declaration of national standards and/or codes of practice relating to occupational health and safety. In addition, according to the minister, the Australian Safety and Compensation Council, as its title suggests, will:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">establish a national approach to ... workers compensation.</para>
</quote>
<para>As a result of representations from various stakeholders, the Howard government has agreed to empower the Australian Safety and Compensation Council through legislation with the ability to declare national standards or codes of practice. This is achieved through the bill and is a measure of the bill, which, obviously, Labor supports.</para>
<para>Labor opposes the abolition of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. The Productivity Commission’s report did not recommend the abolition of the commission. It recommended adding to the commission’s role and specifying the objective of achieving uniform national occupational health and safety legislation and regulation in all jurisdictions within and throughout the Commonwealth in the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission Act. Labor believes that replacing this statutory body with one that is merely administrative and executive is a downgrading of the important role the Commonwealth should play in leadership for occupational health and safety.</para>
<para>In addition, the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission Act 1985 provides a very detailed list of functions for the commission that includes: declaring national standards; formulating policies and strategies relating to occupational health and safety; making recommendations to action for state and territory governments; making recommendations in relation to compliance with international standards relating to occupational health and safety matters; reviewing laws and awards relating to occupational health and safety matters; evaluating policies, actions and laws made as a result of the commission’s work; research, inquiries and publications about occupational health and safety; and providing training and educational and promotional programs regarding occupational health and safety. In part for these reasons, Labor opposes the abolition of the commission.</para>
<para>Given the government’s stated intention, as reflected by the bill, is to abolish the commission, Labor is pleased that the government has agreed to empower the new ASCC through legislation to be able to declare national standards or codes of practice. Labor is also pleased that the Australian Workplace Safety Standards Bill 2005 defines the ASCC as a tripartite body that represents the interests of governments, employers and employees. As a consequence Labor supports the Australian Workplace Safety Standards Bill 2005.</para>
<para>In addition, while Labor agrees that it is also important to address the recommendations the Productivity Commission made regarding workers compensation, to merely add this role to the body replacing the commission without providing additional resources means, in effect, that the government’s financial commitment to addressing occupational health and safety has been significantly reduced. Labor believes that ongoing national research into occupational health and safety, something severely compromised by the ongoing funding reductions to the commission in recent years, plays an ongoing important role in the identification and prevention of workplace death and injury in Australia.</para>
<para>The proposal to abolish the tripartite, statutory National Occupational Health and Safety Commission and replace it with an administratively created advisory body, the Australian Safety and Compensation Council, substantially downgrades the Commonwealth’s participation and active role in occupational health and safety. Labor supports the development and implementation of national occupational health and safety standards and is committed to ensuring that there is a tripartite forum at the national level with employer, employee, industry and union, and state and territory government representation. In Labor’s very strong view this is best effected by the continuing role of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. As a consequence Labor opposes the repeal bill.</para>

<para>—The <inline ref="R2415">Australian Workplace Safety Standards Bill 2005</inline> is required in order to ensure that the most important right for Australian workers is maintained—health and safety in the workplace. The bill will establish an Australian Safety and Compensation Council and will repeal the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. It will provide the legislative basis for declaring national occupational health and safety standards and codes of practice. The way this will happen is that through the bill we will ensure—and the government is committed to this—that there is a nationally consistent framework in place to manage safety. The bill will provide a platform for state and territory jurisdictions to adopt standards in the legislation and ensure that across Australia there are appropriate sanctions and penalties in place for failing to comply with certain workplace safety standards.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The council will establish a national approach to safety and workers compensation and this national approach is very much needed. It is about 100 years since Federation. We now have eight different jurisdictions in this country, each with its own system of workplace relations and workplace safety. This government is committed to ensuring that, as much as possible, we have a uniform approach across Australia. Of course, we also recognise the responsibility and the obligations that the states have in this area of need. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline>
</para>
<para>I am almost sure that the topic of safety and workers compensation has never before had such a large audience in this chamber, but I will resume what I was saying before the member for Chifley interrupted me. The bill arose following the Productivity Commission’s report <inline font-style="italic">National workers compensation and occupational health and safety frameworks</inline> of March 2004, which recommended that a number of changes take place in the area of occupational health and safety. We as a government have not accepted one of those recommendations. We decided to abolish the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. This will be abolished; however, as I mentioned earlier, we will be establishing the Australian Safety and Compensation Council in its place. Its primary function will be to recommend initiatives for the Workplace Relations Ministerial Council and promote national consistency in occupational health and safety and workers compensation.</para>
<para>The Australian Safety and Compensation Council will be established administratively, with membership to be made up from representatives from the Commonwealth, state and territory governments, employers and employees. I know that a lot of stakeholders in this debate have welcomed this representation. I note that the opposition is keen on the council being established by legislation rather than through an administrative instrument. Of course this is not taking place. Nevertheless, the new council will have the ability to make recommendations to the ministerial council, and each of the various jurisdictions around Australia will have the ability to introduce in its own legislative program the recommendations that are brought forward.</para>
<para>The process of declaring standards which are suitable for adoption in legislation by the jurisdictions assists in improving uniformity in OHS regulations in Australia. We are often told by employers that they have to operate within myriad different regulatory frameworks in Australia. Accordingly, the declaration of occupational health and safety standards and codes that can be adopted in state and territory legislation is an important step in reducing duplication and inconsistent regulation.</para>
<para>For a few brief moments I want to discuss the role of the Australian Safety and Compensation Council. I know members on the other side will support it, as noted by the member for Perth. The ASCC will undertake the following key activities. It will develop a work plan for the implementation of the national framework for OH&amp;S and workers compensation priorities, which will be endorsed by the Workplace Relations Ministerial Council. It will seek agreement by all jurisdictions to adopt and implement national OH&amp;S standards declared by the council and endorsed by the ministerial council. It will provide for and encourage the states and territories to undertake a leadership role in the revision of existing national standards and the development of new standards as required. It will monitor the OH&amp;S and workers compensation performance data at a national level, including the appropriate use of performance indicators. This is an issue which I am very much interested in. I will have more to say about it in another debate which will take place tomorrow afternoon.</para>
<para>Furthermore, where appropriate the council will establish subcommittees. This recognises of the importance of consulting with relevant experts in the development of general and specific OH&amp;S and workers compensation policy and regulation. Above all, it will have a research role and an evaluation role to ensure that we have best practice in the workplace.</para>
<para>The government continues to be committed to improving occupational health and safety and workers compensation in this country. It is committed to ensure that the myriad regulatory regimes around Australia are brought in line and that there is consistency across the states.</para>
<para>Our commitment to improving workers compensation is one that goes back a number of years. We made an offer a number of years ago to successive Victorian governments on two specific projects that would have allowed for a federal safety inspector to go on site. In return, additional funds would have been allocated to that state government for those projects. I understand that one of those was Federation Square and the other one was the MCG project. On both occasions the state government of the day rejected the offer and rejected the involvement of the Commonwealth government in having the right to enter those work sites.</para>
<para>We are committed to this bill. We do not see this as an issue that needs to be politicised. I certainly welcome the opposition’s support of these bills. I note that they are not willing to support the repealing of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. I think their concerns are ill-placed. The states will continue to have the ability to introduce, through their own legislation, the various codes of practice and conduct which will be recommended by the council to the ministerial council.</para>

<para>—I am happy to rise to discuss the <inline ref="R2414">National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (Repeal, Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2415">Australian Workplace Safety Standards Bill 2005</inline>. Both of these bills are interrelated. It is true to say that, whilst Labor accepts that we can support the Australian Workplace Safety Standards Bill, it was made very clear by the member for Perth and by other commentators outside this place that we believe this is a downgrading of national occupational health and safety generally, particularly as it follows the proposed abolition of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. If Labor were to have its way it would be looking to revitalise and strengthen the current commission.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The current commission has undertaken very good work since its inception and it focuses on a very important area in the workplace. The one thing I think we share across the chamber in this place is an understanding of how important occupational health and safety policies are and how important it is that they are enforceable to ensure that we mitigate the capacity for Australian workers to be injured. If we prevent that likelihood we diminish the likelihood of fatality or injury generally in the workplace.</para>
<para>The National Occupational Health and Safety Commission has played its role in ensuring at least that there were efforts by the governments of the states, the territories and the Commonwealth to collaborate on matters of importance in this very important area of public policy. However, it is unfortunate that, instead of strengthening and building upon the importance of the commission, the government chooses to replace this tripartite body for an administrative council, which we believe would not have the teeth or the wherewithal to properly undertake the work that it will be asked to. We therefore see it as an unnecessary diminution of the national profile of OH&amp;S.</para>
<para>The commission itself managed to identify the fact that there are thousands of fatalities in Australia each year. Indeed, it received evidence from Access Economics that an estimate of 4,900 fatalities in Australia each year should be used as the approximate benchmark for fatalities in this country so that we can then work out ways to reduce that level of deaths in the workplace.</para>
<para>The other very frightening statistic is the ABS statistic on work related injuries dated September 2000—some time ago now—which indicated that 477,800 persons experienced a work related injury or illness in the 12 months leading up to that date. In other words, between September 1999 and September 2000 almost 500,000 people had reported an injury of some sort, of whom 189,400 received workers compensation of some kind. That is a frightening proportion of the Australian work force—a frightening indictment on Australia’s incapacity, at least to date, to reduce injuries in the workplace. Therefore, it seems odd that the government would be putting less money into this area rather than more money.</para>
<para>It is important to note that, with the election of the Howard government in 1996, the occupational health and safety budget at the Commonwealth level was reduced by between 30 and 40 per cent. I think that exemplified the government’s priorities and illustrated to those who paid attention that it did not consider that the Commonwealth had a particularly important role in this area.</para>
<para>Whilst it is fair to say, as the member for Deakin indicated, that we have given some qualified support for the new council, it is not true to say that we support the entirety of these two bills or that we do not propose a preferred option, which would have ensured proper recognition for trade unions, employers and government in this legislation. It seems to me, and I think anyone who has represented employees in the workplace would say, that it is very important to bring all the parties relevant to the workplace together to consider ways to prevent injury. Therefore, to diminish one party’s role in that seems a very odd thing to do indeed. However, it is consistent with the government’s attitude towards employee organisations. It is a consistent thread that runs through all their legislation, not only industrial relations legislation—or, in this matter, occupational health and safety policies—but all areas of public policy.</para>
<para>It seems now that it is almost a compulsory provision of any piece of legislation introduced by the government that there be some mechanism whereby collective bargaining will be diminished or threatened. We have seen that with education policies that tied Commonwealth funding to compelling employers to offer AWAs—even though that is not the intent of the Workplace Relations Act—and we have seen ministers outside the IR portfolio propose legislation that tries to reduce the likelihood of unions collectively bargaining. Unfortunately, even when it comes to something that I thought we had some sort of consensus on—namely, occupational health and safety—we see an unnecessary reduction in the role of trade unions in what would generally be seen as an area where we could get consensus. That is unfortunate. It is another example where the government’s blindness and its enmity towards employee organisations are such that it would rather play politics than have good public policy.</para>
<para>As the shadow minister indicated, we support the second bill as it is important that there be a national body, but we believe that there is no need to remove the NOHSC. We note that the minor parties and Independents in the Senate have been on the record opposing the abolition of the NOHSC. Andrew Murray indicated his opposition to its abolition. Other spokespeople—people not from the Labor Party—have expressed concern about this unnecessary repeal of an important piece of legislation and the abolition of a relatively effective commission, when compared with what is being proposed. Having said that, I indicate, along with my colleagues, that whilst we have concerns about the way the government has decided to go down this path we are relieved that in the NOHSC’s place there will at least be somebody that will be able to bring together the parties nationally to talk about matters related to OH&amp;S policies in order to bring some improvements to Australian workplaces and hopefully reduce the likelihood of injury or death.</para>

<para>—I was interested in the contribution of the member for Deakin. He had the temerity to commence with an allegation that the <inline ref="R2415">Australian Workplace Safety Standards Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2414">National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (Repeal, Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005</inline> are ‘required for safety’. After listing the responsibilities of the new body, he finally assured all and sundry that any concerns were ‘ill placed’.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am afraid that I must have some doubts about his assurances, because this legislation has to be seen in the context of measures over the period of the current government. We have heard earlier references to the reduced expenditure that has been devoted to this area in the last decade. We now see a body being established which, as detailed by previous speakers, will essentially have less legislative strength and will be given responsibility in workers compensation without any consequent increase in the allocation of money towards that body. One can see a record of reduced money being devoted to the field, and in this new responsibility there will realistically be less expenditure again for safety.</para>
<para>Previous speakers have cited the numbers of workplace deaths in this country, the most dramatic example being in the building industry. The figure, for which there is no debate, argument or contention, is that a worker a week dies in that industry. A paper produced for the parliament some time ago by the Parliamentary Library stated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The NOHSC have estimated that there are more than 2000 fatalities from workplace accidents and diseases per annum. This figure is only an estimate, because the long latency period of some diseases and the difficulty in relating some conditions to periods of work makes it difficult to quantify the precise number of deaths. However, the figure of around 2000 is taken to be an accurate estimate by NOHSC, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) and the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Those deaths are estimated to cost the Australian economy $30 billion annually.</para>
<para>We are talking about serious matters. On a broader front, we are talking about the individual devastation that occurs in families. In Sydney we have had very strong media coverage of the death of Joel Exner, a 16-year-old who fell 12 metres to his death from an Eastern Creek building; Anthony Hampson, a 42-year-old father of two who was badly injured after falling seven metres from a Gosford reroofing project; Dean McGoldrick, a 17-year-old who fell 12 metres from a Sydney building site; et cetera ad nauseam.</para>
<para>It is interesting to note that previous speakers have talked about what is essentially part of this process, the attempt by this government to marginalise the unions and to take them out of the focus in industrial relations. That, of course, should be seen in the context of the ILO—another tripartite body; both sides are talking about tripartite bodies today in this debate. The ILO, which is internationally recognised and respected and participated in by Australian employers, noted in 2004 the central role of unions with regard to safety and determined that there was a correlation between union involvement in safety matters and low injuries, et cetera. It said that internationally sites were three times more likely to be safe where committees with union involvement were on the site, and it was two times more likely that there would be a management OH&amp;S audit of those sites where unions were involved. As I said earlier, this is a serious matter at a personal level and with regard to national productivity and our overall financial situation in this country.</para>
<para>People have spoken about asbestos. This is another area where we must have some concern and once again question the credibility of the government. We have witnessed the ACCC and the department of industrial relations harassing, following and pursuing councils in Sydney that have tried to put bans on the asbestos industry and its products. If they were really committed, as the member for Deakin says, to legislation to help workers, to protect people and to ensure safety we would not have measures by this government and its organisations to pursue those who seek to highlight the asbestos issue in this country—the dangers and the deaths that have resulted. They are estimated to be at least 53,000 by 2020.</para>
<para>As the member for an electorate which is very close to the major manufacturer in Sydney, James Hardie, and also to the previous manufacturer, Wunderlich, owned by CSR, I am very aware of these issues. Those employers tended historically to employ the latest strand of migration to this country, the new wave of migrant labourers that occurred. In the period I was associated with the union that had coverage in this field, the Lebanese in particular were prevalent. In our area we have not only the possibility of a very high prevalence of deaths and serious illness over the next decade but also the reality of masses of illegal dumps by James Hardie in the region. The numbers are thought to be quite high.</para>
<para>Can we have the confidence the member for Deakin puts to us that all our doubts as to the government’s gestures and intentions should be dismissed and that we can be assured that the government really intends to do something? I say not because, as I said with regard to asbestos, we see them pursuing those who seek to publicise and dramatise this industry and its failings; and we see the expenditure they have devoted to occupational health and safety in this country. Also, they really got out of bed very early on one particular legislative endeavour over the last few years and that was to override the ACT legislation on industrial manslaughter. Once again, as the previous government speaker, the member for Deakin, said, that is not very active on all of the recommendations of the ACCC—they have decided not to follow one or two of those—but very active in intervening to make sure that workers in the ACT are not going to be protected by a bill which said that an employer or a senior officer could have fines of up to $5 million and 25 years in jail if they were perceived to have played a major role by their negligence in regard to an employer.</para>
<para>The other thing that leads me to have some doubts about the government’s real intentions to increase safety in the interests of workers in the industry is the performance of the infamous Cole commission into the building industry. The government did say that the minister should table the annual NOHSC report on progress in implementing the NOHSC occupational health and safety strategy for 2002-12. However, after hearing a plethora of complaints about the role of the CFMEU in this industry on what would seem to many of us to be a very serious issue, occupational health and safety—with one death a week in this industry—the commission ‘proposed to address this critical issue’—they did say a few nice words on the way through—‘other than through the public hearing process’.</para>
<para>It was decided that there would be a conflab and some discussion papers. That of course contrasted with a welter of witnesses coming forward, with tens of millions of dollars devoted to that inquiry and with the threat of court proceedings, most of which came to nothing—$60 million worth of taxpayers’ money spent on supposedly a good purpose came to no significant prosecutions. As I say, I have grave doubts that we are going to get the protection of people in this country through this legislation.</para>
<para>In general we have a government which has sought constantly to override legislation aimed at introducing measures against the pursuit of people responsible for deaths in industry. We witness a government which has reduced expenditure on safety in this country and the process of this committee itself. We are assured it is going to be tripartite and that it is going to have some role. But, given its performance over the period since 1985 when it was established to set standards, do analysis, come up with training proposals, produce statistics and propose national measures that would be taken up by the various states, one must have grave doubts that the real intention of this government is to accomplish anything worth while for workers in this field.</para>
<para>Rather than come up with these kinds of measures which seek to diminish and deride the need for occupational health and safety in this country the government should be setting about establishing a proper national database, ensuring that the safety records of particular companies are kept, ensuring that licensing in an industry should become a matter for contractors and subcontractors with poor records, looking at a safety plan being provided on all projects—the successful applicant giving this to the union delegates afterwards to ensure it is adhered to, and looking at government contracts and adherence to safety standards by companies that are contracted. As I said earlier, the government should be looking at industrial manslaughter and at the annual inspection of various contracts and measures of adequate financial deterrence.</para>
<para>In conclusion, there were some nice words said by the opposition about these measures, some of which are not of concern. Clearly the broader agenda of this government is to decrease the role of workers in safety issues on sites around the country, to ensure that there are not tougher measures against deaths on sites and to diminish the overall emphasis in this country on occupational health and safety.</para>

</talker>
<para>—The <inline ref="R2390">Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Budget Measures) Bill 2005</inline> before us tonight does provide some welcome relief in funding for universities but it is very partial relief. It astonishes me that, on the very day when the government has announced that it will now seek an immigration program that has not been seen since the era of the ten pound pom, we are debating policies of a government that has been presiding over enormous skill shortages. Skill shortages do not happen overnight. There is evidence of the emergence of skill shortages going back almost a decade. In nine long years this government has done very little to anticipate and ease the skill shortages with which this country is now afflicted. This legislation makes a very small contribution to it but I have to categorise it as being too little, too late.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I do in fact support the notion of a larger immigration program and one that is based on skills, but this should be a complement to domestic skills formation rather than a substitute. Yet after nine long years, this government has allowed the skills crisis to develop to the point where it has had to adopt almost emergency measures in the form of the announcements that have been made in the last day or so. It bemuses me that the present Minister for Education, Science and Training has been so unsuccessful in gaining support of the Prime Minister and his cabinet colleagues for extra government funding for our universities. The results of this sloth and inactivity are there for all to see.</para>
<para>We know that there is enormous value in increasing the proportion of high school leavers who go on to complete university. I will cite some of the relevant indicators: Australian university graduates earn at least 50 per cent more than high school completers and 70 per cent more than high school drop-outs. So even the private benefits from a university education are very large—a 70 per cent increase in earnings, on average, compared with high school drop-outs.</para>
<para>But that is not to count the wider social benefits—the benefits to the nation as a whole—which, in economic jargon, are called ‘spill-over benefits’. They are very large indeed. Plenty of empirical work has been done on this. Indeed, the nurturing of intellect and the acquisition of skills is by far the most potent source of productivity growth in the modern world. That point has been demonstrated by empirical work conducted by the OECD. Now knowledge and skills arguably stand alone as the only source of comparative advantage in the 21st century. This point was made in 1996 by Lester Thurow. The value of investing in skills through higher education is that it offers the double benefit of not only raising productivity but also lifting lifetime work force participation rates. I refer to a study by Access Economics that has just been documented in a publication released by the Business Council of Australia. In that report Access Economics says:</para>
<quote>
<para>Education is increasingly becoming the ‘engine room’ of modern economies. If we get this part of the economy right, most other things ought to fall in place (or be better placed), because increased investment in education boosts both productivity and participation.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The truth is that the Whitlam government opened the doors of the nation’s universities to the children of working Australians—to average Australians and underprivileged Australians. The Hawke and Keating governments expanded access to a university education, equipping young people with the skills to be able to go on to a university education, through a doubling of the proportion of young people who completed year 12 from 36 per cent to well in excess of 70 per cent. Equipping young people to go on to university was a great contribution to our nation’s future, but the Hawke and Keating governments did more than that. Through the introduction of HECS, the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, funding coming from the future earnings of the students themselves was used to expand greatly the number of university places, thereby opening up access to our universities by people who otherwise could not afford it.</para>
<para>The coalition government, however, is reversing all this. It is making access to a university education a lot harder for all except the privileged. Both the increased rationing of places according to the capacity to pay full fees and the prospect of massive HECS debts for those fortunate enough to gain a HECS place are creating circumstances where the number of Australians going on to university has now fallen for only the second time in the last 50 years. This is a terrible tragedy. During the 1980s and early 1990s, when there was great debate and great activity on an economic reform program for Australia, it was often said that to stand still in the Asia-Pacific region is to fall behind. We needed to continue with reform and to invest in education, in knowledge and in research and development in order just to hold our place among other countries in the region and in the wider world. That was the accepted wisdom at the time, but it is not the wisdom of the Howard government. In relation to higher education, the Howard government at present is not only standing still but is falling behind. If to stand still is to fall behind, then let us think for a moment of the consequences of going backwards.</para>
<para>In this the Asian century, the countries of our region are investing heavily in higher education—to the point where India alone is producing six million university graduates a year, two million of whom are English speaking; and China is producing an estimated 3.4 million university graduates a year. Australia, in contrast, is producing 215,000 university graduates a year. It is obvious that we cannot match the absolute numbers of university graduates of India or of China; but, in this the Asian century, we certainly need to take a great leap forward in the proportion of our young people who go on to a university education.</para>
<para>In the 1960s, using the best available statistics—which sadly are scant—the proportion of young people going on to university was about eight per cent. Through the 1980s, with the introduction of HECS and the expansion of university places, it had built up and it is now around 30 per cent. In my book, 30 per cent of young people going on to university is a grossly inadequate proportion. If we are to be successful in this the Asian century, if we are to compete effectively against China, India and other emerging countries in our region, we must lift the proportion of young people who are going on to university—because, as Lester Thurow has observed, knowledge and skills stand alone as the determinants of comparative advantage and the wealth of nations in the 21st century.</para>
<para>But what is the Australian experience with skills formation? It is an indictment. A Productivity Commission review of the Australian evidence concludes that the increase in average schooling in the working age population slowed from 0.5 a year in the 1980s to 0.2 a year in the 1990s. The Productivity Commission concludes:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... there appears to have been no significant acceleration in work force skills in the 1990s. In fact, the evidence shows a faster increase in skills in the 1980s.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So when Australia had genuinely entered the productivity race and was reforming the economy, that was a great period. But, to accelerate that productivity growth, we needed at the same time to continue through the 1990s and the early 21st century the sorts of investment in education that had occurred in the 1980s under the previous Labor government. Sadly, that did not happen and the Productivity Commission has concluded that there was a deceleration.</para>
<para>The Productivity Commission is not alone. The conclusions have been confirmed by the OECD’s work, which indicates that skill upgrading made no contribution to Australian productivity growth between 1990 and 2000. Drawing this work together, Saul Eslake asks:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">So why has education apparently not made any discernible contribution to the improvement in Australia’s economic performance over the past decade? The answer, unfortunately, seems to be that there has not been any discernible improvement in Australia’s educational outcomes—at least insofar as they impact on productivity growth during this period.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I have to report that Australia ranks a lowly 20th out of 30 OECD countries in the share of 15- to 19-year-olds enrolled in postcompulsory secondary education. So the story is a tragic one; it is a story of tragically wasted opportunity.</para>
<para>Again, Australia stands alone among OECD countries on another score. The privately funded share of education spending has risen more quickly in Australia since 1995 than in any other OECD country. We have been unique amongst OECD countries in failing to increase public funding commensurately with increased private funding. By that, the OECD means that private funding has increased more rapidly in Australia than in any other country and that public funding has fallen behind. In other countries both private and public funding have risen together so that obviously the total number of young people who could go on to higher education has been increasing. But that is not the case in Australia, and it is an indictment of this government.</para>
<para>The fundamental problem—and it goes to the provisions of this bill—is that this government has failed to index adequately the Commonwealth grants that go to our universities. There are varying estimates of the total funds that the universities have missed out on as a result of the government’s unwillingness to index those payments, but essentially the government’s philosophy is that university education is a private matter and that nearly all additions to the funding of universities must therefore come from the private sector. The government does not recognise, does not acknowledge the wider benefits to the community of a university education.</para>
<para>The consequence is plain: Australia stands out amongst OECD countries as the one country where increases in private spending on education have substituted for, rather than complemented, extra public spending. I will quote again:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In fact, many OECD countries with highest growth in private spending have also shown the highest growth in public funding of education. This indicates that increasing private spending on tertiary education tends to complement, rather than replace, public investment. The main exception to this is Australia, where the shift towards private expenditure at tertiary level has been accompanied by a fall in the level of public expenditure in real terms.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So there we are. Australia is unique amongst the OECD at a time when we know—when all the evidence shows—that skills formation is the most powerful contributor to productivity growth and therefore prosperity and the wealth of nations. The Australian government stands alone amongst OECD countries in shifting funding towards private expenditure at the tertiary level and reducing the level of public expenditure in real terms.</para>
<para>I pick up where I began and ask the question rhetorically: why has this Minister for Education, Science and Training been so spectacularly unsuccessful in gaining the support of the Prime Minister and of his colleagues for increased support for our universities at this incredibly important period in Australia’s development? The answer has to be, for starters, that the Treasurer does not want to see the minister for education succeeding to the same extent that he has seen his other rival, the Minister for Health and Ageing, succeed in getting a lot of money for Medicare before the last election. So, in this rivalry for the prospective future leadership of the Liberal Party, it is not only the minister for education who is missing out—and I will not be weeping crocodile tears for him—but also the young people of Australia.</para>
<para>It is my duty to report a conversation in which the minister for education was involved. A matter of privilege was reported in this parliament just a few days ago by the member for Eden-Monaro in relation to the falsification of documents. I reckon this one deserves a bit of scrutiny, too, because it is surely inconceivable that the education minister could have engaged in the dialogue to which I am about to refer. When the minister announced that the government would be allowing universities to apply full fees to up to 35 per cent of Australian students, he seemed pretty confident that he would be able to remove a cap on the amount of fees that could be covered by the FEE-HELP funding support program. FEE-HELP is similar in design to HECS, but the problem is that FEE-HELP is capped at $50,000. We will recall that, many times before the last election, the Prime Minister was saying that there would be no $100,000 university fees under his government. Well, many scores of university courses now charge fees well in excess of $100,000, so that is yet another broken promise on the part of the Prime Minister.</para>
<para>The minister for education was interviewed on the John Faine program on 4 August. John Faine asked:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The man responsible for introducing student loans says the way the system is evolving and where you are taking it is only going to help rich students, students from rich families, is he right?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The minister replied:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Well in fact Professor Chapman—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">the architect of the HECS program—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">is right, but the interpretation of what he is saying is in fact a little bit incorrect. Professor Chapman is one of the people who designed the HECS program and what he is referring to in this context Jon are the full fee paying students, these are the Australian students.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Professor Chapman was indeed referring to those full fee paying students—up to 35 per cent of students now. The minister then went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Well in fact we have got 784 courses in Australian unis which charge or offer full fee paying places to Australians, we have got about 16 of those courses that have fees of around $100,000 or more, needless to say veterinary science, dentistry and so on.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I would just point out that that number has greatly increased since this interview on 4 August. John Faine then asked:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Medicine?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The minister replied:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Well Medicine not yet, but that’s coming in, and we know that Notre Dame will be about $125,000 and we have heard that Melbourne will be about $200,000.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The minister seems very worried about this, but it is his legislation that is allowing this to happen. John Faine said to him:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Now there is no way that an ordinary Australian family can afford to put a kid through one of those courses is there?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The minister replied:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Well in fact you are right.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So here is the minister saying that John Faine and Professor Chapman are right. The reality is that the minister was confident that he would be able to get that cap removed from FEE-HELP. He went back to cabinet and he got rolled. The result is that here we are in this the 21st century—the Asian century, where we will need to compete against these countries—and the government has increased the number of full fee paying Australian places to up to 35 per cent and it has allowed universities to increase HECS by up to 25 per cent. It is pricing a university education out of the reach of the sons of daughters of the working people of this country. This legislation gives me the opportunity to brand this minister a complete failure and to call as very urgent the need for fundamental reform of our higher education system.</para>

<para>—It is rather disappointing that the member for Rankin, in speaking on the <inline ref="R2390">Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Budget Measures) Bill 2005</inline>, which largely involves committing extra funding to James Cook University and the University of Western Sydney, used the opportunity to push his own hobbyhorse and in a distorted way represent his views about private funding versus public funding for universities. I must point out in response to the member for Rankin just a couple of critical points that he omitted. In decrying, as he did, the cocontribution through the HECS scheme of students at university he totally ignored the fact that it was a Labor government in the mid-1980s that introduced the HECS fee system on the principle that there was a role for students who would benefit from a university education to contribute something towards their own education.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>He also omitted to say that the HECS increases for those universities which have decided to increase HECS funding over the last couple of years are really only marginal increases and that, even for those courses and those universities where a funding increase has been agreed to, it will still only involve students increasing their contribution to the cost of a university education from 26 per cent to 28 per cent. In other words, taxpayers will still be meeting 72 per cent of the cost of the average university education. This is an increase from 26 per cent to 28 per cent or a decrease in the taxpayer contribution from 74 per cent to 72 per cent—hardly the draconian changes that the member for Rankin was indicating.</para>
<para>Another two points need to be made in response to the member for Rankin before I turn to the legislation before us. Firstly, in that change the government substantially increased the threshold at which university students would commence repaying their HECS debt from $24,365 to a threshold last year of $35,000 and a threshold in July this year of $36,814. Rather than being able to argue, as the member for Rankin has, that somehow university education is being priced out of the realms of possibility for the ordinary worker, the very substantial rise in the threshold at which repayment starts actually does make it a lot more affordable for average university students. They can earn a whole lot more after university graduation before they need to start repaying their HECS debt.</para>
<para>The other point that needs to be made is that the member for Rankin and many others on the other side keep referring to these full fee paying places and talking about $100,000 degrees and so on as though somehow this means that ordinary people are being precluded or excluded from university. The critical point that he again conveniently omitted is this: no university is able to impose full fee paying places at the expense of taxpayer or HECS funded places. They are in addition to—over and above—the increased HECS places. They are not in any way precluding Australian students from taking up the increased number of university places under the HECS system.</para>
<para>The other point that he omits is that the Labor Party is quite happy to continue to support full fee paying places for overseas students but would want to prevent Australian students accessing the same right that overseas students have. For the life of me I cannot understand the double standards that Labor wants to apply here: it is okay for students from overseas countries to come and pay to access an Australian university education but not for an Australian student who might have just missed out on a HECS place to avail themselves of the same opportunity. I am stunned that Labor wants to provide an opportunity for students from overseas that they want to prevent being made available to Australian students.</para>
<para>Let me turn to the legislation. The technical details of this legislation really are quite straightforward. They are, despite the tangential offering from the member for Rankin, non-controversial, but the implications and the impact of this legislation are quite significant in three ways. Firstly, this legislation is a clear demonstration of this government honouring its election commitments. The amendments to the Higher Education Support Act 2003 are amendments for two purposes that were promised prior to last year’s election. The first is to provide 100 new places in veterinary science and tropical agriculture at James Cook University. These places will commence in 2006 and will rise to 274 places by 2009. This was a commitment of $13.9 million that was made last year that is now being delivered. These extra places will provide veterinary science places for veterinarians specialising in the prevention and early detection of animal diseases that are prevalent in tropical areas, so they will be a great boost to the tropical part of Northern Queensland. As well as this, these places will provide for education in aspects of tropical agriculture, including the agriculture that involves sugarcane production—again, of direct relevance to the local community. Here again the government is honouring its election commitments.</para>
<para>The second aspect of this bill is the commitment of funding of $25 million over the next three years to improve infrastructure at the University of Western Sydney. I for one, along with a number of my colleagues—and I notice the member for Macarthur at the table there—have been pushing for years for extra funding for infrastructure and so on for the University of Western Sydney. Last year the Prime Minister made a commitment that we would deliver extra funding for infrastructure for the University of Western Sydney. This legislation delivers on that commitment. It delivers an extra $25 million. That includes $7 million for a new library at the Penrith campus. It delivers $2 million for upgraded research and teaching facilities at the Hawkesbury campus. It delivers $7 million for a medical faculty at the UWS Campbelltown campus—that is in addition to $18 million already budgeted. It includes $9 million for a new teaching building at the Parramatta campus. So that is $25 million for the University of Western Sydney, directly delivering on those election commitments that were made last year. We said we would deliver, and here we are delivering.</para>
<para>This funding allocation involves substantial tangible improvements for these two universities, further evidence of the government’s commitment to higher education. We had the member for Rankin somehow talking about a reduction in funding for universities, a government abrogating their responsibility. He very conveniently ignored the fact that we had an allocation of an extra $2.6 billion over five years for higher education or an extra $6.9 billion over 10 years for education in last year’s budget and a record $7.8 billion in this year’s budget for higher education. This is a substantial commitment to higher education, both broadly and also, I am pleased to say, in the area of Western Sydney.</para>
<para>I was interested to hear the shadow spokesperson for education, the member for Jagajaga, speaking on this bill last week. What she was saying seemed to be supporting these funding commitments. It was quite interesting, though, to compare that with what she had to say last year. When the government made these election commitments last year, in this place the member for Jagajaga dismissed this $25 million for the University of Western Sydney and the $13.9 million for James Cook University as ‘cynical election sweeteners’, ‘little sweeteners’ and ‘just a drop in the ocean’.</para>
<para>I can assure the member for Jagajaga that the $25 million for the University of Western Sydney is not just a ‘little sweetener’. It is not ‘just a drop in the ocean’. The people of Western Sydney greatly appreciate the $25 million that will improve facilities at our university, and I am sure the people of North Queensland greatly appreciate that extra funding for James Cook University as well. I am appalled that the member for Jagajaga could have dismissed them as ‘just a drop in the ocean’. This is very significant funding for two very important regional universities.</para>
<para>The money committed to the University of Western Sydney will help meet the needs of a university that is vital to this region of Sydney. This is an area of really substantial need. We have 1.8 million people in Western Sydney, rising by something like 50,000 people a year, with large housing projects planned. The population will continue to increase in years to come. Yet, in educational terms, over the decades the Western Sydney region has not been catered for as well as other regions of Sydney. We have a lot of young people with aspirations for improved education, hungry for education and eager to get on in life, yet significantly, compared to other regions of Sydney, the educational attainment in decades past has not been as good. For instance, only 10.5 per cent of the population of Western Sydney is tertiary trained, compared to an overall average of about 21 per cent for Sydney—a much lower participation rate. So I am pleased to see that the government is demonstrating its commitment to building higher education in Western Sydney. For instance, in this year’s budget we had $235.7 million committed to the University of Western Sydney. That is an increase of $15.3 million or 6.9 per cent over last year. This year there were 18,267 fully funded undergraduate places, up by 2,747 since 1996. So I am delighted to see this as yet another demonstration of this government’s commitment to the University of Western Sydney.</para>
<para>I want to refer to two specific aspects of this legislation. The whole of the $25 million will be a significant boost for Western Sydney, but two aspects are of particular interest to me. One is the $2 million for research and teaching infrastructure at the Hawkesbury campus. This will include a state-of-the-art confocal multiphoton fluorescence microscope system, which will be the only one in Australia. It will put applied science research at the University of Western Sydney Hawkesbury campus at the forefront of some of this research in Australia.</para>
<para>The University of Western Sydney Hawkesbury campus has been doing it tough for a number of years—the declining interest in agriculture has been part of the reason for that—but in the last three or four years I have been greatly encouraged to see the numbers rebuilding there. We are one of the leaders in horticulture. We have seen exciting growth in recent years in aspects of applied science, including environmental science and forensic science. We have seen a growth in nursing places, and I want to see that continue. This $2 million for the state-of-the-art research microscope system at UWS Hawkesbury campus will certainly continue to boost its profile.</para>
<para>The second feature I want to focus on is the extra $7 million allocated for the medical school for the University of Western Sydney. I make the point again that this $7 million is in addition to $18 million already committed, so this brings the Australian government’s commitment to the UWS medical school to $25 million. Starting in 2007, this will mean 80 places for medicine, and that will pipeline out to 320 places by 2010. I note that last year the member for Jagajaga criticised the government for committing money for infrastructure but not for places. Again, the member for Jagajaga was wrong. We have a commitment for 80 places to start in 2007, and up to 320 places will be in place by 2010.</para>
<para>The building and commencement of a medical school for Western Sydney will be a great boost to this area for two reasons. The first reason is educational. Young people living in Western Sydney who want to study medicine and who have the ability to study medicine will no longer have to spend three to four hours a day travelling from, say, the Blue Mountains or Kurrajong in my electorate of Macquarie into the University of Sydney or the University of New South Wales. They will now be able to study medicine in Western Sydney. This will be of tremendous benefit educationally.</para>
<para>More broadly, the establishment of a medical school in Western Sydney will be a great boost for medicine and for health services in Western Sydney generally. Western Sydney does suffer. Our doctor-patient ratio is much lower than it is for most of Sydney. In Western Sydney in my electorate the doctor-patient ratio is one to 1,800, whereas in central Sydney it is one to 825, so we do need to attract GPs to Western Sydney. The government has undertaken a number of other initiatives that are starting to have an impact, and I greatly appreciate those. But this facility will also help to attract doctors to the area, for a couple of reasons.</para>
<para>Firstly, some of the places will be bonded places. Students will be allocated places to study medicine at UWS on the condition that they practise for a certain time in Western Sydney. That will directly add to the supply of GPs in the area. Secondly, students from elsewhere who come to study at UWS will realise that it is a great place to live. They will put down roots, they will make connections, they will form friendships in the area and they will decide to settle in the area and practise in Western Sydney. So the establishment of a medical faculty there will boost the number of doctors practising in Western Sydney. This legislation is really going to be of significant benefit—and in your electorate of Blaxland as well, Mr Deputy Speaker Hatton. It will benefit all of those who live and work in Western Sydney.</para>
<para>In summing up, I will make one other point. It is a disappointment to me that the New South Wales state government are not willing to help in this enterprise. When the idea of a medical faculty for UWS was first raised, the then Premier Mr Carr said: ‘Yes, this is a good idea. UWS needs a medical faculty.’ The Australian government have now committed $25 million. There is $25 million on the table. But what do we have from the New South Wales government? No commitment of cash to help, and we really need it. The challenge is there for the New South Wales government. If they are serious about the benefits that a medical school will bring to Western Sydney, they need to match the Australian government’s contribution.</para>
<para>Even worse than the state government’s neglect of UWS is its iniquitous payroll tax regime, which takes money out of UWS. I have made the point before that every year the state Labor government takes around $10 million out of the coffers of the University of Western Sydney via its payroll tax system. This year we have the Australian government committing some $235 million to the University of Western Sydney and we have the state government saying: ‘Thank you very much. I’ll take $10 million of that out and put it into state general revenue.’ If the New South Wales government were really committed to the University of Western Sydney, it would be ending that payroll tax regime and supporting the University of Western Sydney in the same way that the Australian government is.</para>
<para>I am pleased to support this legislation. It brings a significant amount of extra money to the University of Western Sydney. It delivers on a key election commitment to the people of Western Sydney and it will bring substantial benefits to the people of Western Sydney, as well as to the people of North Queensland through its commitment to the James Cook University.</para>

<para>—I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in support of the extension of funding, particularly in relation to the University of Western Sydney. I wish to speak on the extension of funding for the new medical school at Campbelltown. While I wholeheartedly support the development of a medical school at the Campbelltown campus, I do have some concerns. A $7 million injection of funds into the development of the university’s medical school is a welcome investment in the south-west of Sydney. It is an investment which I would suggest is well overdue. Although this commitment does not match the one that Labor took to the last election, clearly Labor’s commitment of some $43 million has made the government realise that the medical school is something that is needed for our region.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Minister for Education, Science and Training noted in his second reading speech:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The ... medical school will enhance and improve the teaching hospital capacity and the delivery of health and medical services in western and south-western Sydney. It will also provide opportunities for local students to study medicine in their own region.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Might I suggest that the development of this medical school is on track. I am pleased to note that in the week before last the <inline font-style="italic">Macarthur Advertiser</inline> reported that the Australian Medical Council had approved the first stage of the university’s medical school, which gives the university the go-ahead to implement their medical program. The <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> went on to report that over the coming months the university will develop detailed plans, outlining such matters as curricula, staffing facilities, research and clinical placements. It is expected that this second stage of the process will be submitted to the Australian Medical Council for its consideration sometime in February next year.</para>
<para>I would like to take this opportunity to commend the work of the dean of the medical school, Professor Neville Yeomans, and the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Western Sydney, Professor Janice Reid, for their hard work in getting the school to this point. They should be recognised for and congratulated on their efforts.</para>
<para>The development of a local, high-quality medical school and medical training infrastructure is extremely important to south-west Sydney and Western Sydney because our region needs more doctors. As a young and rapidly growing community, the ability to find affordable and accessible medical services is essential. In my electorate alone, there are more than 20,000 families with dependent children. Although the medical school will be a welcome addition to the medical infrastructure in the south-west, it is a medium-term proposition and the government continues to fail to address the short-term needs of this community.</para>
<para>In 2004, it was estimated that Australia needed up to 3,000 more GPs. Consider that in conjunction with the report by the <inline font-style="italic">Medical Observer</inline> last year which indicated that 57 per cent of those GPs surveyed believed that general practice was not a good career choice for students. Having regard to that statistic, I hope the government intends to integrate its policy approaches to medical training and workplace planning. The Campbelltown campus will not produce a fully qualified doctor until 2012. While its contribution over the longer period is likely to be immense, families in my electorate and throughout the south-west of Sydney need the government to do more right now to increase the supply of doctors and affordable and accessible health services within this region.</para>
<para>At the outset, I mentioned that I had some concerns. My concerns do not directly relate to the appropriation of $7 million to the university but rather to the notion that this will mean that local students can automatically access the medical school. I understand that all students will have that access, subject to meeting the relevant education standards. I also understand that prospective students will be subject to a battery of aptitude tests and interviews. My concern is that, due to the decade of neglect of tertiary education under this government, local students may be priced out of the education market. I am concerned that, because of the quite draconian changes to student income support over the last decade, many students and their families are placed under considerable financial pressure when they undertake university studies.</para>
<para>Often parents contact my office to seek some insight into why this government is making it even more difficult for their children to get a university education by subjecting them to an income test to receive the youth allowance. The income test is not based on the income of the student but on the income of the supporting parents. Labor took to the last election its policy aimed at improving income support for students while they study. I note that the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, in its submission to the 2005 Commonwealth budget, called on the federal government to improve income support for students but, alas, the government has not acted on that submission.</para>
<para>I am concerned that the belief behind the strong community support for the medical school, which is predicated on the basis that the sons and daughters in greater Western Sydney will have access to it, will not necessarily translate into reality. In my electorate, the 2001 census reported that only six per cent of the people had attained a bachelor degree or higher. Many of those people were among the first in their families to receive a university education, because a university education was not placed beyond their reach. The importance of having a high-quality, local university is not lost on my constituents.</para>
<para>When I was studying, I would have appreciated the opportunity to attend a local school rather than attending lectures in Sydney and making that late-night trek home. To some extent, for people who studied in those days—and particularly for those who lived in Campbelltown—it was half dangerous. It was not dangerous in respect of personal security but, in those days, you did not catch the normal suburban train home to Campbelltown. At that hour of the night, you lined up to catch the <inline font-style="italic">Cooma Mail</inline>. You could not afford to get too comfortable on that train because, as the member for Macarthur will know, if you missed Campbelltown, you were likely to end up in the Southern Highlands or somewhere between there and Goulburn. The students who follow us will at least not have to brave the ventures of part-time study in Sydney and travel home to Campbelltown.</para>
<para>Recently I spoke to Dr Andrew McDonald, the Director of Paediatrics at Macarthur Health Services. He is right behind the medical school and is looking forward to integrating the local hospital network with the school. He knows the quality of health care professionals in our area and is confident that the medical school, with the support of the region’s hospitals, will produce high-quality doctors. While no-one can ever be certain that locating a medical school in Western Sydney will produce more doctors who live and work in the region, I am heartened by the findings of a number of studies that in fact suggest as much. The evidence suggests that students from rural and regional backgrounds often end up practising in rural or regional areas. It is my understanding that the likelihood of this occurring is heightened when these students have the opportunity to study in or near the areas which they are from. I am confident, with the support of the local hospitals, with the support of high-quality health care professionals such as Dr McDonald and his team, who are currently practising in our area, and with the support of the local community, that once students have the opportunity to experience all that our region has to offer they may make the decision to stay.</para>
<para>I hope it is the case that students from the south-west and from Western Sydney do get the opportunity to study at this medical school, because they already know what a great place the region is and what a great place it is to raise a family. I would be reasonably confident that the majority of graduates who come through that infrastructure would continue to see some purpose in living and practising within our region. I hope the funding in conjunction with the government’s tertiary education policies will not mean that the first generation of people from this region to have reasonable access to a university education will be the last. I hope that the medical school will act as an inspiration for the local students to study hard in the knowledge that they could end up studying at a fantastic institution that is just down the road from their families and their long-established personal support networks.</para>
<para>The University of Western Sydney medical school was suggested by a Labor Premier and later adopted by this government, and as a Labor member I have to say that I am extremely proud to support it. The school has been supported by the Labor state government, contrary to the suggestion from the member for Macquarie, as the state government intends to provide a site adjacent to or within the Liverpool Hospital grounds for the development of support facilities. The University of Western Sydney is a fine institution and I support its aim to develop a distinctive and innovative school that will support and integrate with our local community. I look forward to the extension of the Campbelltown campus of the university and the development of the medical school itself.</para>
<para>Not long ago the university launched a Bachelor of Laws program. I can report that this has proven to be a success, with many graduates who have studied at the campus continuing their association with the region by living and working there. I noted recently on the Whitlam Institute’s online forum on the medical school that a student from the university made the following contribution:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Indeed, it not only makes good strategic sense to establish a medical school in Western Sydney ... For why should people residing in greater Western Sydney have to travel up to one hour and half to attend a medical school, when the best training ground is in their own back yard?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I think that is a reasonable quote. It is important to realise that for south-west Sydney to grow we should have resources like those of the medical school being developed. South-west Sydney has much to offer. It is certainly a ground for significant development not only in industrial production; it is also an area where we are producing many fine students who will be there to service the higher technical industries as they develop.</para>
<para>I did mention earlier that, having had the opportunity to meet with and discuss matters with Dr McDonald, I understand the supportive role that does fall to the medical profession in developing further professionals—in his case paediatricians—to be supplied within that area. We do have very committed medical practitioners residing within the region, and I think their contribution certainly needs to be acknowledged in this debate as well. This is not just a matter of making a contribution of $7 million and establishing the medical school; this is the combination of a lot of hard work by many people—including people in this House, which I will freely acknowledge—who are committed to improving the lot of Western Sydney and to the development of educational facilities and clearly focused on what is necessary if they are to advance and improve the productiveness of greater Western Sydney, which obviously encompasses a number of electorates, including that of the member for Macarthur and my own.</para>
<para>I am proud to be here to support the efforts to have this medical school established. I look forward to seeing, by the year 2012, doctors being produced by this facility. I would very much hope that the statistics and reports that I quoted earlier do come to fruition. I hope that we manage to attract and retain within south-west Sydney many of the practitioners that would otherwise be encouraged to go elsewhere—places other than Liverpool, Campbelltown and their surrounds.</para>
<para>I indicate that, apart from the facilities of the university, there will be a significant integration of training facilities at hospitals such as Campbelltown Hospital and the Liverpool Hospital—and I understand that there will possibly be discussions with Camden Hospital—which will have a significant effect in the placing of students during their practical training. Also, those hospitals will significantly contribute to the educational development of students who attend the medical school on the Campbelltown campus.</para>
<para>Those facilities are already staffed by people who are not only qualified but very dedicated professionals. From my discussions with those people, I understand their level of support for this facility. Their personal support is unquestionable. They will certainly do everything that they can possibly do to facilitate the building of strong links so there will be a teaching hospital capability closely linked through curriculum and medical facilities with the school as it is developed at the Campbelltown campus.</para>
<para>As I indicated, notwithstanding the concerns I have expressed, I support the development of this institution. I look forward to its opening. Moreover, I look forward to the Campbelltown campus being expanded to include the medical school and to seeing local students given the opportunity to participate and aspire to such a wonderful thing as being a doctor servicing people throughout my local area. I look forward to the prospect of having those students retained as doctors servicing our community.</para>

</talker>
<para>—In summing up debate on the <inline ref="R2390">Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Budget Measures) Bill 2005</inline> I would like to thank the members of this House who have spoken on the bill for their interest in the issues. However, I wish to correct a few comments made by the member for Jagajaga at the start of the debate and the many errors contained in them.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The member for Jagajaga spoke at some length about the financial health of the university sector. I am happy to inject some facts into the picture of doom that she represented here in this place. In 2003, the following results were reported. Sector revenue was $11.9 billion, an increase of around $650 million from 2002. Total net assets were $22.8 billion. Cash investments were $5.6 billion. Over the past five years, net investments and capital assets have totalled $5.2 billion. The financial health of the university sector is strong indeed.</para>
<para>The member for Jagajaga also spoke about the purported massive increase in the number of full fee paying students in Australian universities. Again, the facts show exactly the opposite. Last year, there were only 16,299 full fee paying domestic undergraduate students in public universities, of whom 6,086 were undertaking summer and winter courses outside their regular semester study. This number was around three per cent of all domestic undergraduate students in public universities—hardly a massive increase in domestic full fee paying students.</para>
<para>The member for Jagajaga made much of the reported high fees for some courses, including a combined medical and law degree at Monash University, reported to cost $256,000. In fact, the university has advised that the combined degree is not currently offered on a fee paying basis, and no decision has been taken to offer it on this basis in 2006. This is clearly scaremongering.</para>
<para>The member for Jagajaga claimed that the OECD figures show that the government has taken Australia backward in educational participation and attainment. In fact, educational attainment levels have been increasing steadily. In 1998, some 25.4 per cent of Australians aged between 25 and 64 had tertiary qualifications, according to the OECD. In 2002, this figure was 31 per cent. Australia still has the highest school expectancy, or years in study, at 21.1 years, according to the OECD.</para>
<para>Finally, the member for Jagajaga raised the issue of the higher education triennium report—a report put out by the Department of Education, Science and Training each year on the state of higher education in this country. I am happy to say that that report will be available in September. I look forward to the member for Jagajaga having the chance to digest some of the facts in this sector and making a more accurate and informed contribution on higher education at her next opportunity to speak.</para>
<para>I would now like to reiterate a few points about the bill before the House. The bill is a further illustration of how the Australian education sector will benefit from the record $7.8 billion investment that the Australian government has made in this sector in the 2005-06 budget. As members will be aware, the policies of this government have resulted in record numbers of students accessing university. The Australian government is making available more Commonwealth funded places than ever before, with 409,393 places this year, an increase of more than 12,000 places over last year. The Australian government is also addressing student demand by funding over 39,000 new student places over five years between 2004 and 2009. These places will enable an estimated additional 50,000 students to study full time or part time at university.</para>
<para>The measures in this bill will further strengthen the facilities and the infrastructure available to our universities. As a federal spokesperson for Western Sydney, I and my Western Sydney colleagues are proud to be members of the Howard government, a government that delivers on its commitments to improve the educational options and opportunities for all people in Western Sydney and beyond.</para>
<para>This bill will provide the University of Western Sydney with $25 million for new capital infrastructure funding to boost teaching, research and facilities for students over the next three years. As members will recall, in the 2004-05 budget the government pledged $18 million towards the establishment of the university’s new medical school in order to encourage school students in the outer suburbs of Sydney to study medicine and to contribute to their own community. If people study medicine in their local area, there is a good chance they will practise medicine in their local area.</para>
<para>This bill provides a further $7 million to the university’s medical school for 2006, making a total government contribution towards the medical school of $25 million. The new medical school will serve the well-documented medical needs of the Western Sydney community and will provide opportunities for students from Western Sydney to study medicine in their own local area.</para>
<para>The Western Sydney community will further benefit through the provision in this bill of $7 million for the university’s construction of a new library at its Penrith campus. The new funding for this critical facility will provide library services for UWS staff and students but, just as importantly, also benefit the wider Penrith community, like many other universities around Australia do.</para>
<para>This bill also assists students at the University of Western Sydney by providing an additional $9 million towards the establishment of a new teaching building at the University of Western Sydney’s Parramatta campus. Furthermore, this bill provides an additional $2 million to the University of Western Sydney’s Hawkesbury campus to upgrade its research and training facilities. As members would be aware, the university has a long history of providing high-quality agricultural education at Hawkesbury. The funding provided through this bill will further enhance the delivery of educational courses that are of direct benefit to the Australian agricultural sector.</para>
<para>These initiatives reflect the Australian government’s ongoing commitment to building better community facilities and providing improved education and opportunities for the people of Western Sydney. The University of Western Sydney puts the people of Western Sydney at the heart of its mission. The university has set itself an aim that over the next 10 years its teaching facilities and practices, research activities, student experiences and community engagement will rank among the best in Australia. The people of Western Sydney deserve no less.</para>
<para>In addition to the $25 million of new support to the University of Western Sydney contained in this bill, the Australian government is providing $25.9 million to strengthen the educational and research opportunities in North Queensland. Members would recall that earlier this year the government provided $12 million over two years towards the new veterinary science and agricultural school at James Cook University’s Townsville campus. In recognition of the importance of the study of tropical sciences the government is providing $26 million to James Cook University to fund teaching and research in veterinary science and tropical agriculture.</para>
<para>This bill will fund courses in veterinary science and tropical agriculture at James Cook University. It will establish a new undergraduate degree program and provide 50 new places for the courses, including studies in the prevention and early detection of diseases in livestock. The bill also provides an additional 50 places for new undergraduate degree programs in tropical agriculture, giving graduates expertise in tropical plants and exposure to research in vital agricultural areas, such as sugarcane production. These 100 new places in veterinary science and tropical agriculture will commence next year, and by 2009 future undergraduate numbers will rise to 274 places at a cost of $13.9 million.</para>
<para>As we have seen elsewhere, new diseases can have devastating consequences across nations, affecting both their rural and urban communities. We must take steps to place Australia at the forefront of the cutting edge research to avert such disasters here. These new undergraduate degrees will provide Australia with expert understanding in the fields of tropical animal diseases and tropical agriculture, which is vital to Australia’s national prosperity.</para>
<para>Breakthroughs in the production and the knowledge of plants that thrive in a tropical climate can boost crop production and improve the livelihoods of many Australians, particularly those in the regional and rural communities. It is essential that Australians continue to develop expertise in these fields. The establishment of the new veterinary science and tropical agriculture schools and undergraduate courses will help position James Cook University as a global leader in teaching and research in these fields, further enhancing Australia’s international reputation.</para>
<para>The funding provided to James Cook University through this bill reflects the Australian government’s recognition of the unique contribution that regional higher education institutions like James Cook University make to their local communities, for students from rural and regional areas and to our national prosperity.</para>
<para>This bill will also amend the maximum funding amounts under the Higher Education Support Act 2003 and the maximum amounts for transition funding under the Higher Education Funding Act 1998 to reflect indexation increases.</para>
<para>This bill will enhance both the quality of our higher education systems and the choices available to our students. It also reflects the Australian government’s strong commitment to ensuring that our universities continue to play a vital role in Australia’s economic, cultural and social development. I urge all members of this House to support this bill.</para>

<para>—It is another day and we have another bill showing yet again the government’s ideological approach to industrial relations. The government has a blinkered view and a divisive approach. There is a preparedness on the part of the government to bend over backwards to meet the extreme views of its constituency. The <inline ref="R2234">Workplace Relations Amendment (Small Business Employment Protection) Bill 2004</inline> again demonstrates that, despite its rhetoric, it is not a government that is governing for all Australians.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I have been involved for more than 35 years in aspects of industrial relations in this country. I have had many negotiations, discussions and understandings with people about the best way to get the best results. I have always found that most people are reasonable and are willing to see the other person’s point of view. It has taught me that it is much better to take the cooperative and consultative approach, but that has never been a lesson that this government has understood or practised. It prefers to hammer an ideology and it prefers division and disagreement rather than discussion and agreement.</para>
<para>It is very interesting that this government, having been re-elected, refuses to stand by its promise that no worker would be disadvantaged under its brave new world of workplace regulation. Of course they will be disadvantaged. I spoke last week about legislation that would see that disadvantage occasioned. This bill also makes workers worse off. Worst of all, it also seeks to overturn a decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission—a decision of the independent umpire. Now that this government has the numbers in both houses, it will legislate away what a tribunal has determined on the merits of the case presented to it.</para>
<para>Quite frankly, it is un-Australian not to accept the umpire’s decision. There were a few Australians who were not too happy with the Damien Martyn dismissal last night, but the Australian cricket team with all the tensions involved accepted the decision and went on to get a remarkable draw in the circumstances. It is un-Australian not to accept the umpire’s decision, but that is what this bill does: it overturns the umpire’s decision—a decision which gave employees of small businesses fair redundancy provisions and which was arrived at when parties had had the opportunity to put their case.</para>
<para>The commission said that redundancy pay is to compensate employees for the loss of entitlements and credits and for hardship when they are made redundant. The commission’s decision was consistent with moves at the state level to provide for redundancy pay for employees of all businesses. That is what the commission and the states have determined and that is what is fair, but not in the eyes of this government. This bill seeks to overturn that decision. The minister says that it is a flawed decision. We know that the government went to the last election promising the following:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">A re-elected Coalition will continue to pursue changes to take the unfair dismissal laws burden off the back of small business and protect small business from redundancy payments.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In other words, that means that they are going to make it easier to sack people and strip away their protection. That is what it means. They were prepared to assert that in the context of a decision arrived at in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the AIRC.</para>
<para>The government talks about the need to protect. I accept that it is important to protect the interests of small business, but it is also important to protect the interests of the people who work for them. It is important to protect people like 15-year-old Deanna Renella—who I spoke about in this place last week and will return to later—an employee of a national franchise chain, Bakers Delight. What about the protection of people like her? That is where the government lacks balance and fairness.</para>
<para>This bill seeks to remove redundancy pay requirements for small businesses with fewer than 15 employees, cancel the commission’s decision and override any state laws that provide for redundancy pay for small businesses. The minister says that this legislation does not prohibit the employers from agreeing to redundancy provisions and reaching agreement with their employees, but they are prohibiting the commission determining that outcome when the parties cannot reach agreement.</para>
<para>This is a fallacious argument on the part of the government. They say that they want to encourage relationships between employers and employees that envisage this, but, when parties cannot reach agreement and the commission determines—that is the commission’s role—on the case and merits put by the employers and employees and comes down in favour of the decision, the government say, ‘No, you cannot have it; we are going to overturn it.’ In other words, they reject the merits of the case and just proceed with their ideological thrust.</para>
<para>I pose a question to the parliamentary secretary at the table and to the government: how realistic is it to expect the balance to be in favour of the employee when they front up to an employer? What do you think an employer is going to say when the employee says, ‘By the way, after that set of conditions, I also want two weeks pay for every year of service if I am made redundant’? What do you think the employer is going to say? It is a fatuous argument; it is nonsense.</para>
<para>That is why for a century in this country we have had the Industrial Relations Commission, the independent umpire. But this is a government that is now prepared to torch it, to burn it. If anyone doubts my statement about the balance between employer and employee look at what a judge in the Industrial Relations Court of South Australia had to say in the case I referred to earlier. This is what Judge McCusker had to say on the ability, the balance if you like, of an employee to be able to stand up and bargain on the same terms with an experienced employer:</para>
<quote>
<para>In considering this submission I leave aside for the moment the manifest disadvantage of the respective bargaining positions of a 15 year-old Year 10 student negotiating her terms with an experienced businessman.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Of course, he is right. Here is the government talking principle and protection but allowing the types of draconian industrial relations laws and practices that it is overseeing to tip the balance. I heard the Prime Minister last night in an address to the Australian Industry Group and here today in the parliament saying that it is not the intention to tilt the playing field in favour of the employer. If it is not the intention it is certainly what is happening. I believe, quite frankly, that it is the intention because you cannot believe a word the Prime Minister says on this, particularly when he has ditched his no disadvantage test.</para>
<para>We on this side of the House accept that small businesses do need some protections. They do need, in the case of the unfair dismissal situation, an ability to deal with the problems of redundancies where there have been litigious and vexatious employees, where demands have been made on them for hush money, where they have been pursued and encouraged by ambulance chasers, where they have been encouraged to pay go-away money and where small businesses that cannot afford the time or the money to defend themselves in court have been forced to pay. They do need protection from those sorts of circumstances.</para>
<para>Every time this government, on whatever number of occasions, brought their unfair dismissal legislation into this parliament Labor proposed amendments to give that protection to small businesses, to look after their interests. On every one of those occasions the government were not interested in accommodating or embracing those amendments. They just want the blanket ability to make it easier to sack employees—to improve employment prospects by making it easier to sack people. I have never heard anything more ridiculous in my whole life, and I have had to deal in practical terms with a lot of these issues and a lot of these disputes. The government of the day has to set the framework in which the parties can negotiate and if they cannot resolve it they can have access to an independent umpire. That is the only sensible way these issues can go. If there are people exploiting the system by all means make amendments in the way we have suggested.</para>
<para>In relation to the unfair dismissal proposals, we even proposed alternatives that exempted small businesses. Now the government, not content to make exemptions in the case of small businesses, wants to classify and make those exemptions in the case of companies employing fewer than 100 people. Of course, the Treasurer of the country wants to go even further and extend the ability to sack people to any company in the country.</para>
<para>This legislation does not address the issue that we have talked about. Labor have proposed sensible amendments previously; the government should look at them again and come back and present a more balanced approach than the one we are experiencing today. Our proposed amendments address the real issues faced by small businesses whilst providing protection and assistance to employees—protection for both sides. We are not stripping protection away from one side and tilting the playing field in favour of the other. Our proposals note that the commission does not believe that in general small businesses do not have the capacity to pay severance pay but it does recognise the fact that some small businesses may not be able to pay.</para>
<para>What also concerns me about this legislation is that it may also affect workers’ other legitimate entitlements. The General Employment Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme, GEERS, meets certain employee entitlements in the event that an employer is unable to pay them due to insolvency. GEERS is not legislated, but the government accepted at the time that the community standard of eight weeks pay for redundancy entitlements was the norm. Presumably, it now no longer accepts that community standard. GEERS requires a legal obligation before it pays. This bill may remove that provision. So I would be interested to know, when the government responds on this bill, whether it has the effect on GEERS that I have outlined.</para>
<para>Labor have proposed a better alternative in this field too—a trust fund to protect the entitlements of all employees, not just those who happen to work for the company that the Prime Minister’s brother was chairman of. The only time the full entitlements of employees have ever been protected in this country was when Stan Howard’s company got into trouble. We propose the introduction of a trust fund that would have exempted from contributions all small businesses. Here we would have had a win-win outcome—protection for employees and protection for small business because they would not have had to pay. The government again ignored that constructive suggestion because it prefers blind ideology to real solutions.</para>
<para>We have now entered an Orwellian world where, as in <inline font-style="italic">Animal Farm,</inline> four legs good, two legs bad. For this government everything is either black or white: business is good; employees are bad. Do not listen to their rhetoric, look at their track record: AWAs are good; collective agreements are bad. We are prepared to discuss these issues, to look to solutions to reach agreement, but that can only happen if the other side is prepared to do so too.</para>
<para>I want to return to the Baker’s Delight case because it is instructive in terms of AWAs and the way in which this bill seeks to strip away protections for certain employees. I raised this matter in the House last week and the Leader of the Opposition questioned the Prime Minister in relation to it. In response, the Prime Minister said that the 15-year-old worker concerned was not covered by a valid AWA. This is correct. He said that the 15-year-old worker was a casual worker and had been underpaid according to the relevant South Australian award. That is also true.</para>
<para>That is true, but it is not the point at issue here. Her AWA was only invalid due to a technicality because it had not been filed—it had not been properly witnessed and lodged. If it had been witnessed and lodged properly, she would have been able to have been paid at the lower rate. The court was only able to order restitution in her case for the underpayment of the award rate, the $1,500 payment, because the AWA had not been properly filed. I make that point because the Prime Minister promised that there would be no-one worse off as a result of going on to an AWA. This is the famous no disadvantage test.</para>
<para>Clearly, this girl could have been disadvantaged as a result of going on to an AWA. She not only could have been underpaid but also could have lost her sick leave, her annual leave and her annual leave loading—so much for the Prime Minister’s guarantee of no disadvantage. She would have been paid less and she would not have been entitled to those entitlements that I just mentioned because they would have been included in her pay rate—a pay rate 25 per cent lower than the award rate.</para>
<para>We even had the situation in which the employer, Yurong Holdings, attempted to argue that the worker was allowed to take home a loaf of bread and that that should be taken into account. I have heard the argument ‘Let them eat cake,’ but now, under the brave new world of industrial relations that the Prime Minister talks about, we are paying people with loaves of bread. This is an outrage, yet it is the system that this government is encouraging.</para>
<para>It gets worse, because the employer tried to blacken the worker’s reputation—a 15-year-old girl—by saying that she ‘is believed to be responsible for a till deficit of $751’. The judge in this case said:</para>
<quote>
<para>This is a very grave allegation. It is pressed on appeal. Yet not one piece of probative evidence beyond assertion was identified or suggested to back it up.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This is the brave new world of AWAs. This is the evenness, the protection and the no disadvantage that the Prime Minister talks about. No wonder he is not prepared to give a no disadvantage test now, because it is worth nothing in the current climate, and he is going to strip it away.</para>
<para>I make this point because it is terribly important: the girl in that case was able to get restitution because the court ordered that she be paid. Why? Because the technical failure to lodge the AWA meant she was not covered by an AWA and had to be covered by the industrial law of South Australia. But what about the other 50 workers employed by the same company under precisely the same terms where the AWA was validly lodged? These people must be underpaid too by any reasonable objective test, yet they cannot get restitution. That is the problem. Here we have a government that says, ‘Unions cannot have collective pattern bargaining,’ but is prepared to condone pattern bargaining in terms of AWAs that strip away entitlements and underpay people. The no disadvantage test cited by this government is worthless. This legislation is stripping away collective rights and undermining entitlements. It is bad legislation and it should be opposed <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>.</para>

<para>—The previous speaker, the member for Hotham, raised one issue of a girl working for McDonald’s in South Australia as being the total basis of Labor’s opposition to this proposal. Let me go through some of the cases that have been described by the former opposition spokesman for small business, the member for Watson, as ‘go-away money’. Let me describe some of the instances of go-away money that have been the cause of the government’s concern and small business’s concern about this issue.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Sharan Burrow, in a presentation to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Human Services inquiry into balancing work and family claimed that research shows that 93 per cent of employees in the private sector on individual contracts have no additional family rights. Let us have a look at that research and get some accuracy because, as always, the Australian Labor Party’s comments have to be read in detail and then referred to the original statements.</para>
<para>The ACTU omits the following information, which has come from the research that Sharan Burrow quoted from. AWA employees are more satisfied than collective employees that they are rewarded for their effort—44 per cent to 29 per cent. Nearly twice as many AWA recipients compared with employees on collective agreements are happy with their reward. This is the research that Sharan Burrow would not quote. Out of a range of figures indicating how successful AWAs have been for most employees, she chose to quote to a parliamentary committee one figure on family issues, neglecting to mention the others. I will go through them. AWA employees are more satisfied with the change in their pay and conditions—38 per cent to 29 per cent; that is a 50 per cent advantage for people on AWAs compared with those on collective agreements. AWA employees felt they had more influence over decisions affecting them in the workplace—69 per cent to 65 per cent. AWA employees were more likely to say that stress in the workplace had reduced over the last two years—19 per cent to 14 per cent; while collective employees are more likely to say stress has increased—49 per cent to 37 per cent. AWA employees are more likely to say that management does its best to get along with staff—64 per cent to 44 per cent. AWA employees are more likely to feel that management gives them a say in how they do their job—58 per cent to 35 per cent. Giving only an insignificant part of the story forms the basis of the way the Australian Labor Party is operating during this debate, and that is pretty typical.</para>
<para>The minister today indicated how workers in small businesses would continue to be protected against inappropriate conduct by their employers. For example, it will continue to be unlawful to dismiss or victimise an employee for refusing to agree to a new workplace agreement. That is not being run by the Australian union movement or the Australian Labor Party. They say that people will be penalised by being sacked if they do not agree to a new workplace agreement. That is not true. It is a blatant lie being told by the union movement and the ALP on this issue. The Office of the Employment Advocate will continue to provide a strong inspection service. In 2003-04, the Office of Workplace Services concluded over 4,700 investigations into breaches of federal industrial law. But what did the leader of the ACTU say in these circumstances? She said, ‘I need a dad or a mum of someone who has been seriously injured or killed; that would be fantastic to run’—I suppose, as part of their publicity campaign. What a way to look at these issues, just to search for the tragic loss of an individual to publicise the union part of this campaign.</para>
<para>Let us look at some of the specifics. Why does small business feel so reluctant to employ when there is the prospect of unfair dismissals? Sharan Burrow says, ‘It’s only a matter of process; fix up the process and everything will be okay.’ The previous speaker for the opposition tended to say the same thing—‘We are now ready to talk; we are now ready to listen to the government.’ For years those opposite have rejected the government’s approach to consider, for small business, a modification. Peter Reith and subsequent ministers, Tony Abbott and now Kevin Andrews, have tried many times to talk logically to the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party in every instance in the Senate rejected our approaches about making it fairer for small business. Even your shadow spokesman, Tony Burke, said that this was go-away money that was being demanded. He said, ‘There is go-away money being demanded’—and there is. Let me give you a few examples.</para>

<para>—The member at the table should be very interested to hear of an employee of a manufacturer who was dismissed for physically assaulting a coworker. The New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission reinstated the employee, finding that there had been an unfair dismissal. An employee from another factory was dismissed for sleeping on the job and falsifying the attendance records. But, in an extraordinary decision, the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission determined that the dismissal was unfair. He had been sleeping on the job and falsifying the records and was then reinstated. This is happening time and again. Small business knows of these instances, so why would they be prepared to employ extra people? They know that, if the process goes to court, there is a cost of between $5,000 and $20,000. So what do they do? They pay go-away money to the employee involved.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>In another instance an employee removed over $15,000 from a safe, lent it to an off-duty colleague and then falsified the reconciliation documents relating to the safe. The money was gambled away and the employee was sacked. He was subsequently reinstated by the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission to a supervisory position where he still would be responsible for large amounts of cash, notwithstanding his complete breach of protocol and the employer’s trust. Under the unfair dismissal provisions of the legislation that Laurie Brereton brought into this place, which was approved by this parliament, that is the stupid situation we have with small business and the reinstatement of people. This government has been consistently trying to get rid of the problems the Brereton legislation has created.</para>
<para>Not all of these instances make the front page of newspapers, but the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> on Monday, 4 July told the story of the New South Wales Department of Education and Training being incapable of doing anything and being unprepared to sack a teacher who had been convicted of possessing 600 images of child pornography. This teacher in the New South Wales system was convicted of possessing 600 pages of pornography and the department was not prepared to sack this person because it feared being hit with another unfair dismissal case. Why did the New South Wales Department of Education and Training feel this way? Because the department had recently had to reinstate and pay out $28,000 to a teacher it had sacked for having an affair with a pupil, the department was not prepared to move when it found another teacher with 600 pages of child pornography. That is how this process is working.</para>
<para>The Australian subsidiary of an offshore manufacturer had a major problem with an aggressive employee who engaged in verbal abuse and other intimidatory behaviour against other employees and management. A serious concern for this employer was the length of time that due process took to dismiss the employee under the present New South Wales legislation. Legal costs of some $40,000 were incurred, but the greatest concerns were the safety, morale and OH&amp;S problems that persisted until the employee could be removed from the premises. So there were long, protracted processes, with the troubled person still on the job and the employer being unable to remove the individual. Therefore, the dangerous situation continued and legal costs amounted to $40,000 to get rid of and solve the problem.</para>
<para>A tourist operator received complaints from the passengers of a particular bus driver. The passengers complained that the driver was rude and had taken the passengers on an alcohol-induced wild ride. The bus operator gave the bus driver a chance to redeem himself only to find that another group of passengers were also taken on a wild ride. The sacked driver took the operator to the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission. The commission found the employer was justified in sacking the driver but then found that the operator had to pay his own costs of $12,000. The operator is no longer in business. This is the thing that employers fear. This is the thing that worries them. I have them in my electorate, and they come to see me.</para>
<para>A pub owner employed a young woman who said that she wanted to work part time, four days a week. Within two weeks she had told him that she wanted to work only two days a week and, two weeks later, said that she was pregnant and wanted to work only one day. The pub owner said, ‘I’m sorry. I really wanted somebody for four days; that was what you were employed to do. I am going to have to let you go and get somebody who can work for four days.’ He let her go, and there was an unfair dismissal claim of $10,000. That bloke nearly lost the pub and nearly lost the capacity to continue his business. He did not have a spare $10,000 in cash to resolve this matter. He came to see me and I tried to resolve the matter. The court had decided that he had to pay the money and, even though the terms and conditions of employment were clearly stated and understood by the employee, they were abused by the employee and this small business man found himself up for the amount of $10,000. It is completely unfair.</para>
<para>But the protection needs to remain for employees, and the protection will remain for employees, as the minister said today. It will be unlawful for people to be dismissed if they refuse to sign an AWA. That will not change. It will continue to be unlawful for people to force someone else into an AWA that they do not want or to dismiss somebody for a temporary absence from work due to illness or disability. All that will continue; it will not change. But the crazy idea that unfair dismissal meant that you could dream up something, that you could have a grievance against an employer, that you could be vexatious in your claims or that you could be angry because you had lost your job and wanted to get back at your employer is going to be removed, because it is stalling employment opportunities for others. Those who make angry or vexatious claims, those who can see an easy way of claiming $5,000 to $10,000 from a former employer, are going to have to find a different way of earning their money because this is going to stop. They will no longer be able to get at the employer for easy cash. They are going to have to find different ways of getting their money, and it is only fair that they should make way for those following behind them who want to work.</para>
<para>Another story is that of a manufacturing company repeatedly warning an employee about inappropriate conduct and language. A final warning was given to the employee when he threw a tool at another employee. The employee was finally sacked when he again verbally abused another employee. So this guy was a menace to his own workmates and to himself, throwing tools at them and abusing them. The employee brought an unfair dismissal claim, and the commission found that the employer acted fairly towards the employee in relation to procedural issues. Therefore, the proper warnings were given and the appropriate processes were gone through in relation to this employee, who had been abusive to his workmates and to those around him in throwing tools at them. The commission found that the process the employer had gone through of warning this guy, saying that his behaviour was unacceptable and then finally sacking him was satisfactory and that the employer had followed all the procedural processes. But the commission then determined that the abusive behaviour and remarks to other employees was not a valid reason for summary dismissal. The commission determined that the dismissal was unfair and awarded compensation to the applicant, in addition to substantial costs to the employer in the form of management time and legal costs.</para>
<para>I have another story. A US professional service organisation decided to close its office in Australia. A manager who was on maternity leave at the time received redundancy pay and all other entitlements. This person was the company’s representative. The professional services organisation decided to close its doors. The manager, who was on maternity leave, quite appropriately received redundancy pay and all the other entitlements. Nonetheless she alleged that the decision was taken in response to her being absent on maternity leave and claimed additional compensation through an unfair dismissal claim. The US based employer, unfamiliar with the principles that operate in this country and with Australian law and concerned that the allegations could affect its reputation, engaged a solicitor. It is normal for an overseas company to want to maintain its good name. In spite of the claim having no merit whatsoever, the employer became concerned that its defence would consume excessive resources and settled with a payout. That is what it is about: the capacity to bluff somebody into paying you when there is no reason to receive payment—and that has to stop. This needs to stop in Australia. It is a cancer that eats away at the relationships between people, particularly people in small businesses—the very businesses whose livelihoods and success depend on trust between a small number of people. That is what is eating at the core of small business employment in Australia today.</para>
<para>The Australian Labor Party has had many opportunities to agree with changes. If it was the process that was the problem, as Sharan Burrows is now saying, we could have agreed to a process and we could have settled it in the Senate. But the Australian Labor Party decided, ‘No, we’ll tough it out’. The game has changed and it is going to go through and be restored to where it should be. It is not going to be unfair to employees, because every employee in Australia is going to have these basic protections. Those in large businesses will have a few additional ones, but those in small businesses will have all the basic protections of their salaries, holidays, sick leave and unfair dismissal if there is a dismissal for not signing an AWA or for temporary absence or illness—it will continue to be unlawful to dismiss a worker because of absence at work due to family responsibilities. All of that will continue. It will continue to be unlawful to dismiss an employee for filing a complaint or participating in proceedings against an employer involved in alleged violation of laws and regulations. None of these things are going to change. They are all going to be there. The protections for employees in small businesses remain. What will go is the capacity to dream up some trumped up charge against a former employer and threaten them with court—threaten them into having to take time off and leave their place of business and not be able to carry out their duties because there is only a small number of people in the enterprise, and threaten them with financial damage because of the need to be off the job defending a trumped up case in a court.</para>
<para>That is going to change because those former employees are going to have to find genuine cause from now on as to why the employer has dealt badly with them. I have read out probably a dozen cases and one from my electorate. I know that there are many more out there like this, and all the Australian Labor Party can come up with is a case that is under the current law and not even an unfair dismissal case, claiming that as the reason why these changes should be opposed. I have never heard such a weak argument. I have never seen Simon Crean on such thin ice. I have never seen the leaders of the Australia Labor Party grasping at straws like this to make a case. I have never seen the ACTU so desperate that they want to see a person dead on the job or maimed or seriously injured in order to support their case. I think it is disgusting that the Australian Labor Party can so abuse workers—its so-called supporters; half its membership—in this way. I know Australia is going to change for the better when this change comes into place. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I am not entirely surprised that the member for Mitchell has problems understanding what we are saying, because he is clearly speaking to the wrong bill. The <inline ref="R2234">Workplace Relations Amendment (Small Business Employment Protection) Bill 2004</inline> does not deal with unlawful termination; this bill concerns whether or not small businesses should have exemption for redundancy payments. It is an important matter for us to debate and the member for Mitchell was clearly speaking to the wrong bill. He was obviously focusing his energies on unlawful termination when what he should have been doing was considering the bill before us and, indeed, the amendments moved by the member for Perth.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This bill reminds me of the extent to which the government is willing to go to override any other party who would like to determine a particular matter—in this particular case, of course, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. It was charged with the responsibility of listening to parties, pursuant to the Workplace Relations Act 1996, making applications on whether or not there should be changes to the TCR provisions to allow the possibility for employees to be in receipt of redundancy payment if they were made redundant and happen to be unlucky enough to work in a small workplace—for an employer with fewer than 15 employees.</para>
<para>That is the nub of this matter. Last year the full bench of the Industrial Relations Commission determined that, yes, there should be some capacity for Australian workers who work for a company with fewer than 15 employees to be in receipt of some payment if indeed they were unfortunately retrenched. There were a number of reasons why the commission determined that way. I can assure all members in this place of this: the ACTU made its applications, the major employer bodies made their applications and the commission rejected parts of all submissions made and determined what they believed to be a balanced and reasonable decision. In the end they sought to amend the TCR provisions so as to include the capacity for employees in those smaller workplaces to be in receipt of redundancy. They acknowledged that there would be circumstances in which small businesses may not be able to pay, and so they went to the matter of incapacity to pay. But they also recognised the changing nature of our economy and the fact that a much greater proportion of employees are now working for smaller employers since the 1984 TCR decision was made. Twenty years on, the commission, headed by Justice Giudice—a government appointee, and some would argue a wise president, but certainly someone who has standing in society—who indeed presided over this matter, determined that there had to be some way in which employees were not unreasonably discriminated against by their fate of working for an employer with fewer than 15 employees. So the decision determined to allow for a maximum of eight weeks payment if someone were so tragically made redundant.</para>
<para>I for one do not agree with the contention that we on this side do not accept that it is a difficulty for small businesses. In fact, today the government had an opportunity to allow small businesses to be represented by whom they wished and withdraw the provisions of the proposed Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005. At the moment, if enacted, that legislation would proscribe the rights of small businesses to have employee organisations represent them. If you want to talk about the rights of small businesses, here was an opportunity today for the government. In the gallery we had many small business people—people who are on occasion in a great deal of debt, purchasing their own rig and placing themselves in a position where they must receive an income just to keep up with the payments of the debt for that rig. They came here today to ask the government to reconsider the way in which it seeks to limit their rights—not unions’ rights; the rights of small business people—to be represented by trade unions if they so wish. Indeed, they have a right to choose anyone else.</para>
<para>It is quite extraordinary that the government manages to distinguish organisations like the Australian cricket association or other employee bodies from employee organisations registered under the Workplace Relations Act. This again highlights the fact that it is even willing to hurt small businesses if it can in some way adversely affect trade unions. So we do not really need a lecture from the member for Mitchell or any other member on the other side in relation to the concerns that small businesses have.</para>
<para>I return to this bill and say: we would hope that small businesses are not affected. We would hate to see the case whereby a company is so commercially affected or in some way injured that it cannot continue to employ as many employees in its work force. But of course we need to have some balance in the argument.</para>
<para>It is instructive that the ACCI, the AiG and other peak employer bodies quite rightly represented their views, the views of their members—that is, the many employers in this country—and submitted their position to the commission, the statutory authority, the independent umpire that has been around for over a century. Indeed, the ACTU on behalf of registered organisations of employees did likewise. As a result of that, the independent umpire rejected parts and accepted parts of submissions made by all parties and came up with what would seem to be a reasoned position. It was not an extreme position, as it has been purported to be—that is currently being put forward by the government in relation to industrial relations generally—but a position that balanced the rights, concerns and entitlements of employees and the obligations of employers in that regard. It was also a commercially sound decision, to ensure that there was not too great an impost upon small businesses.</para>
<para>Further to that—and I certainly have not heard this mentioned today in the debate—when the employers, along with the Commonwealth and other bodies, made subsequent submissions before the full bench, the full bench amended its decision of 26 March 2004 on 8 June in that same year. It said that recognition of the years that would have to be calculated to determine a redundancy payment would not commence until this year. In other words, there would be no contingent liability held by any small business on the basis of the decision and the amendments that were made by the commission in June last year. So, again, that was a very sound, reasoned and careful decision.</para>
<para>I ask the members opposite to consider reading at least parts of the 103-page decision, because I think it allows members opposite—who seem to have an extraordinary ignorance about industrial matters, in some respects anyway—to realise how much effort goes into not only the submissions by the parties on behalf of employees and employers in this country but the efforts by the commissioners to make a decision that is fair and reasonable to all parties. We have to juxtapose that behaviour—of process, of listening to arguments, of finding a decent and reasonable determination—with the extremes of this government in relation to its attacks on working people.</para>
<para>We have seen its willingness to deny small businesses the right to be represented in certain matters by trade unions but by no other. The government mantra ‘right to choose’, if genuine, would allow anybody to be an agent for a particular party if that party wished them to be so. But of course the blind hatred the government has towards unions unfortunately blurs propriety. It blurs the right and wrong in this matter. Equally, there is a failure of the government to see that there has to be some balance between protecting small businesses on the one hand and protecting small business employees on the other in relation to a prospective redundancy. It is not getting that balance right but is instead overriding the Industrial Relations Commission and its decision. If you look at the evidence and the submissions made by the parties, you will find that the decision really comes down the middle of the two respective submissions.</para>
<para>I go to the statement that has been made by the full bench. The statement does provide for an increase. In the broader sense, beyond the application for small businesses, it provides for greater increases in redundancy payments for four years up to 10 years. It does not change at all the current entitlements for less than one year up to four years. Remember that that relates to more than 50 per cent of the work force these days, so clearly it is a very important part of the decision. I do not necessarily agree with it, but the commission felt that an increase would be an impost and chose not to support that. Whilst the commission accepts that small businesses should indeed pay a redundancy if they are able to, it suggests that it should be a maximum of only eight weeks. So there is still consideration of the position of the small business.</para>
<para>I will not compare the government’s position with the opposition’s position and I will not compare the government with previous Labor governments; I will compare this government with previous conservative governments. I have to say that by any comparison, particularly in this area, this government is very antiworker. You would not see Menzies, Fraser, Harold Holt or other conservative governments legislate on every occasion possible to prevail over a decision made by a statutory authority that is charged with a responsibility to hear submissions, undertake a due process and proper consideration of matters and determine a particular outcome. You would not see such injudicious intrusion by those governments into these matters. But you do see it, constantly, with this government. It is a major problem. I know members opposite are concerned. Every time I raise my own fears that this government has it in for working people—</para>

<para>It is very unusual for a government to continually legislate to prevail over decisions made by the Industrial Relations Commission. So I hope the government reconsiders its position. The government is in a very powerful position; I understand that. The government is in a very powerful position in both houses, and I believe that when you have so much power you should use it wisely. You have a responsibility to use it wisely.</para>
<para>The amendment moved by the member for Perth, the shadow minister responsible for this area, really says: why not reconsider the decision made by the commission to determine the matter, because it is a balanced decision? The amendment moved by the member for Perth asks that the House note:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">(1) ... that the nation’s independent umpire in industrial relations matters, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC), has examined and heard submissions concerning the impact of redundancy payments on small business;</para>
<para class="block">(2) ... that the AIRC has found that the available evidence does not support the general proposition that small business across the board does not have the capacity to pay—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">and, importantly, that the House recognise—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">(3) ... the circumstances of those individual small business which are incapable of making redundancy payments.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is an even-tempered, well-balanced proposition that the government would accept if it were not so extreme in its outlook with relation to working people. That is the difficulty that this side of the House has with this matter. We understand that there will be differences of opinion; however, the government should consider whether it is motivated by the wrong reasons—motivated not to create good public policy but to hurt groups that do not agree with the government of the day. We see that now with the government’s attacks on students and registered employee organisations. A wise government, in light of its power, would reconsider its approach and try to reflect some balance.</para>
<para>To date there has been a grave failure of the government to do that. I think the government is making a mistake in selling Telstra, and it is making a mistake in not allowing student organisations to run at campus level in the manner in which they have been. I think the government is making a mistake in preventing small businesses from being represented by unions if they so wish. The government is denying them that right by bringing into the House the Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005, which effectively removes the choice. It is the opposite of what the government preaches about the rights of principals and their agents—it removes the choice.</para>
<para>I would like to finish my contribution to this debate by saying that the government has an opportunity to find the right balance between small businesses and their employees and to ensure that the rights and considerations of each other’s position is extended to both. Unfortunately it would seem that, unless there is a change of heart by the government, the workers of this country will get it in the neck again.</para>

<para>—There is no doubt that the small businesses—all one million of them—are performing well in this country. They are the very engine room of continued growth, and this side of the House will never forget that. They are the backbone of the strong economy that we in this country enjoy. Without doubt, many small businesses are very profitable but we must never confuse that profitability with the ability to afford large redundancy payments. You only have to work in small business to know just how hard that can be. That is precisely why it is completely outmoded to come into this House to talk about preventing retrenchments in business—be they small or micro—by applying severance pay to those who create jobs in this country. Placing an obligation on small business to make those redundancy payments will simply lead to an additional cost impost on the very wrong group if you want a strong economy and more job opportunities. It would be unaffordable for many small businesses, and that is the case that I will make tonight.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Clearly employees of small business will not gain anything from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission decision that we are debating today if they have no job to go to as a result of that decision. The member for Gorton gave a very considered 15 minutes about the removal of choice and about both parties having rights. He also provided something that I hear very rarely: a robust defence of the AIRC, which underlines this country’s flawed process of averaging out the submissions from two completely divergent parties and making decisions based on that. We just flail around in a miasma of ambit claims, with the member for Gorton satisfied that a decision between the two means that everyone is being looked after.</para>
<para>We have to be far more considered, and we must ask ourselves two key questions. The first is from a small business perspective. Have you ever run a small business of three, four or five people, where your employees are effectively members of your commercial family, and been faced with making that horrible decision? The decision of redundancy is not necessarily affordable. Are the right parties taking responsibility for a decision to restructure or to make somebody redundant? The second question is from the point of view of the worker. No doubt there is hardship when one loses employment. Who should pay for that restructure or that move? To make the case that the small business should be penalised for doing what it does best is about placing the punishment on the very group that can least afford it. The opposition has to make a case that someone else should pay. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline>
</para>
<para>It is the height of effrontery for the member for Gorton to simply hold up a piece of paper from the AIRC and claim that, because they said that redundancy payments were affordable for small business, they are. Anyone who has run a small business would know that that is far from the truth. The second case that has not been made by the opposition, of course, is: if there is going to be hardship that needs to be met for those who lose their jobs, why is it that small business needs to pay? If welfare for those who lose a job is to be considered in this country then I say that that case has not been made by the opposition.</para>
<para>The one lesson that we have learnt from having those on the other side of the House in government is that you can certainly and quite easily regulate to increase costs, but you cannot regulate to save jobs, because only real jobs deliver job security. You need the conditions whereby small business feels confident to create those jobs. We on this side of the House think it is imperative that small business, as a sector, has every opportunity to be supported to put on and employ as many people as possible, and this legislation is a great example of doing just that. It will serve Australia’s small businesses well and it will save them the decision and the cost burden being imposed by the AIRC.</para>
<para>Preceding me, what we had from the member for Gorton was 15 minutes of considered reason whereupon he hit the wall and basically collapsed into some antiworker ramble and antigovernment diatribe. For 15 minutes we had some belief that by averaging out the parties at the AIRC we could make great employment and workplace policy in this country. That is patently not the case. If we are trying to seek an optimum balance then we have to find a balance of interests. That is not necessarily an average between the two claims of two parties at the AIRC.</para>
<para>There are obviously the equally meritorious considerations of looking after the welfare of workers and making decisions that are best for business. But tonight we are considering those who employ fewer than 15 people. It is not that hard as a microbusiness to find yourself employing 15 people. It is completely time-wasting to be considering one side at the expense of another. That completely hostile, 1890s type approach to industrial relations, as we have heard from a couple of speakers on the other side, where they simply raise examples of vexatious employers, or they give ludicrous examples of being summarily dismissed over the phone for one’s family requirements or looking after children, is completely unrealistic. Redundancy is never taken lightly by reasonable employers, and we need to be looking after the welfare of those who are made redundant. The case that has not been made tonight is that weeks and weeks of pay should be the responsibility of small business when they are employing fewer than 15 people. That is a case that has not been made, and to simply assume it should be because the AIRC said it is so is to misunderstand what it is like to be in small business.</para>
<para>The AIRC effectively tried to remove that exemption for businesses of fewer than 15 people. That redundancy scale that was set up in 1984 that applies to larger businesses has been in place since then and ranges between four and eight weeks. It is interesting to remember that it was not so long ago that the ACTU came to the AIRC with another series of ambit claims. It does serve this parliament well to remember what they were: an attempt to double the existing award redundancy payment obligations on employers from eight weeks to—wait for it!—20 weeks; to extend redundancy pay to casual employees; to include penalty rates and overtime payments in redundancy; and to add an additional allowance for employment and financial advice. That was the ambit claim coming from the other side that, in some way over time, led to this decision made early last year.</para>
<para>This <inline ref="R2234">Workplace Relations Amendment (Small Business Employment Protection) Bill 2004</inline> will do important things. It will amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to ensure that the allowability of redundancy pay is limited to those who employ more than 15 people. It will provide that any variations made to the award since March of last year, that are effectively imposing redundancy pay obligations on employers with fewer than 15 employees, will have no effect. It prevents the commission from making redundancy pay orders under section 170FA against an employer who has fewer than 15 workers, and it overrides any territory laws that might impose similar redundancy pay obligations.</para>
<para>Of course the evidence from leading economists supports the case I am making tonight. Businesses will feel reluctant to restructure if they are being rendered less efficient and if they are being rendered less capable to adjust to or to reflect changes in the workplace and markets. They will be more prone to closure, less resilient to future crises and, in the end, offer less security to all the other employees in the business. They will be less able to renew, less able to pursue new opportunities in a high-risk environment and obviously less able to grow. Single or partial redundancies, if they are made impossible to do or extremely expensive for small business, eventually simply threaten the entire business. There is an increased capacity to make viable restructuring that saves all other employees.</para>
<para>We should also look at the other side of the story; economic and employment conditions are very different to how they were 10 years ago. There are a large range of services that actually make redundancies—while I would never ever want to go through the experience of redundancy—far less harrowing than they were just 10 years ago. We have a near-universal award redundancy scheme in place for employers with more than 15 people; that has been in place for 20 years, but extending it down to the smallest—the microbusinesses, I call them—will do nothing to improve workplace relations. It will not do anything to improve competitiveness. It will not do anything to help efficiency, productivity or, in the end, the jobs, the products and the production that they are responsible for. It will not do anything to help the opportunities for future growth.</para>
<para>Expanding these existing standards down to the smallest businesses simply fails them, because the redundancy payments increase currently for length of service and one’s salary, but for the smallest of businesses these payments can sometimes be crippling. I completely reject the assessment of the AIRC that there is the capacity to pay in all microbusiness. The other side of the House is ignoring the fundamental point that employees are gaining just as much as their bosses in a strong contemporary labour market. The Australian redundancy standards, currently funded by employers, compare extremely well internationally, and in many cases are even higher.</para>
<para>Career expectations are changing. Individuals today have realistic and well-understood expectations about training, working, retraining and changing places of occupation. How companies now train, retrain and retain their staff means that workers will seek re-employment based upon their experience, their training and their retraining, so it is a far more fluid and flexible work market than ever before.</para>
<para>There is already an increasing investment by employers and governments in education and training, and there is a trend towards more transportable skills. Both from an active and a passive labour point of view, the market assistance that is available in the community to assist in the process through redundancy and back into employment is witnessed by some of the shortest periods of unemployment between jobs that we have seen in a generation.</para>
<para>My case tonight concerns extending these laws to the smallest of business. Many of these employers are taking home extraordinarily low salaries. Often their businesses are struggling. At a time when additional regulation is expected, this can only cause more trouble and more uncertainty within a small business.</para>
<para>The alternative from the other side is this. If the small business is not to pay redundancy payments, precisely who should be paying them? We have not yet had any coherent argument that government should be paying them. That would be the case that would have to be made if, as the member for Gorton said, we could find some middle ground. Effectively there has been no regard to the economic benefits that we have seen in this country that make redundancy a very different proposition from what it was a decade ago.</para>
<para>Of course, businesses have a commercial and a legal obligation to run and to act in the best interests of their employees and either the business itself or its owners. In some unavoidable cases, that does lead to redundancy. But why should we penalise the smallest of businesses for what is effectively commercial commonsense, if not commercial law?</para>
<para>In conclusion, let me say this. Losing your job can be an absolute kick in the guts. There is no doubt that that is the case for those who face termination of employment. The case that needs to be made tonight concerns whether the burden of redundancy payments should be placed upon small businesses themselves. Redundancy is never completely the fault of one party or the other. There are multiple parties that suffer from redundancy and that are likely to be affected by a decision to restructure, to make a company more effective and efficient or to respond to the demands of the marketplace. That burden should not be rested with the smallest of small business in this community. It rests with individuals; it rests with society more generally, through government, taxation, welfare support, retraining and the labour market opportunities that this government is providing.</para>

<para>—Once again I find myself following the honourable member for Bowman, and doing so after he has done an admirable job of trying to defend the indefensible. The honourable member for Bowman put together a mishmash of arguments to defend the <inline ref="R2234">Workplace Relations Amendment (Small Business Employment Protection) Bill 2004</inline>, which takes away not the rights of workers but the rights of ordinary people to be sustained in their moment of greatest need.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This is an example of this government’s extreme industrial relations agenda that we see time and time again in this House. It is also an example of this government’s confused and schizophrenic approach to small business. This government thinks that the only way it can help small business is to pit the owners of small businesses against their employees. It thinks that there is always a zero sum game—that the only way the proprietors of small business can benefit is to take something away from the employees of small business. We on this side of the House have a very different approach. We say that small business can be helped and that the employees of small business can be helped at the same time. Our entire small business policy supports that argument.</para>
<para>This government finds itself in the situation where it has breached its promises to small business. It has not delivered at all for small business. It is strong on rhetoric but small on delivery. It can only take away from the employees of small business to benefit the owners of small business.</para>
<para>The honourable member for Bowman talked about a miasma of ambit claims. He talked about small business being less able to renew. Small businesses will still be able to renew if the Labor Party’s amendments are adopted, but they will be able to renew in such a way that the innocent victims of downturns in the economy and, sometimes, poor management decisions do not have their livelihoods taken away in such a way that they are unable to put food on the table. That is what this government is doing.</para>
<para>This bill overturns the decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to ensure and entrench the redundancy rights of employees of small businesses. The bill appears to ignore a supplementary decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission which essentially agreed with the submissions of the Commonwealth and the employers, particularly the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Australian Industry Group.</para>
<para>The commission noted that small businesses may lack the financial reserves to meet redundancy payments arising out of the March decision. Accordingly, the commission varied its March decision and decided that, for the purposes of calculating redundancy payments, small business employers need take into account only employment service rendered after 8 June 2004. This means that the contingent liability of small business is zero until June 2005, irrespective of the employee’s years of service. The commission’s recognition of the potential of some small businesses to have difficulty in paying is sensible, as is the commission’s solution. I was drawn to the commissioners’ decision, and in particular the following excerpt from it:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">While some small businesses lack financial resilience and have less ability to bear the costs of severance pay than larger businesses, the available evidence does not support the general proposition that small business does not have the capacity to pay severance pay. In the period 1997-98, the most recent period for which data are available, some 70 per cent of small businesses which reduced the number of persons they employed made a profit. For those businesses which are unable to meet their redundancy pay obligations the incapacity to pay provision, as amended by this decision, provides an avenue for relief.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Neither the honourable member for Bowman nor any other government member, to my knowledge, has referred to that particular finding of the commission. Those opposite say, ‘No small business will be able to pay this. We are lifting the burden off small business.’ They say the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has not considered this matter properly. They do not recognise the fact that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has done considerable research. It did not toss a coin or say, ‘The employers say this; the unions say this. We’ll go fifty-fifty.’ It was a considered decision which has been ignored by the honourable member for Bowman, by other members opposite and—surprise, surprise—by this government in its extreme approach.</para>
<para>The commission’s approach is a sensible one. It approaches the capacity or incapacity of a small business to pay on a case-by-case basis. It is an approach that the opposition endorses. The government has endorsed another approach—an extremist approach. This is the logic of the government’s argument. The government says that, if you work for a company with 16 employees, you should get redundancy pay. However, if you are unfortunate enough to work for a company with 14 employees, you miss out.</para>
<para>Let us go back to first principles. The honourable member for Bowman said one thing that I agree with: if you lose your job, it can be a kick in the guts. What is redundancy pay for? It is to help people who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. It has been generally accepted on both sides of politics, indeed throughout the Western world, that redundancy pay is legitimate. But rather than adopting a case-by-case approach, rather than adopting the principle of capacity to pay, the government has taken the approach of simply abolishing the rights of people who work for companies with 15 or fewer employees to redundancy pay. The government has failed over its nine years in office to deal with the matter of employee entitlements generally. I have a private member’s bill before the House on this matter.</para>
<para>The government, after the scandal of national textiles and Ansett, introduced the General Employment Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme, GEERS. I would like to address the intersection of this bill and the GEERS. The scheme meets certain employee entitlements in the event that an employer is unable to pay due to insolvency. However, the entitlement to payment under the scheme is generated by evidence of (a) the entitlement and its accrual and (b) a legal obligation to meet the entitlement. This bill potentially removes the right to access the GEERS for employees of certain small businesses. By removing the right to redundancy pay, this bill removes the entitlement to redundancy pay and therefore potentially removes the capacity of some employees to access the GEERS. So this government says it is all about capacity to pay but, with this bill, it removes the rights of employees to access a scheme that is not paid for by small business—</para>

<para>—The honourable member for Moncrieff will have his opportunity. He caterwauls from the back in his normal right-wing manner. My friend the honourable member for Moncrieff rushes into this House for any opportunity to support the government’s extreme right-wing industrial relations agenda, as is his perfect right. He caterwauls from the back. I challenge the honourable member for Moncrieff to deal with the intersection of the GEERS and this bill. I challenge him to explain to this House why the GEERS will not be affected by this bill. I challenge him to explain this government’s approach to employee entitlements generally. I challenge him to defend the government’s record on employee entitlements, the national textiles disaster, the Ansett imbroglio et cetera.</para>

<para>This government’s rhetoric on small business is strong; its record is poor. Is this a priority for small business? As I have said before in the House, I spend as much time as I can talking to small businesses in my electorate. Not one of them has raised the need for exemption from redundancy payments. As I have said before, small business regularly raises with me the need to be freed up from unnecessary paperwork. This is something that the government has made much worse. The government promised to cut small business paperwork by 50 per cent. Instead, it has increased small business paperwork substantially. We have seen the GST and superannuation choice—two massive burdens on small business and their paperwork compliance regime.</para>
<para>Some small businesses have also had a significant increase in their paperwork and compliance costs as a result of financial services reform. One small business in the financial services field that I know of in my electorate has gone out of business because of these reforms. If the government’s reality matched its rhetoric, we would see much more action on these fronts and less ideologically driven attacks on the employees of small businesses, which create two or even three classes of citizens.</para>
<para>There will be three classes of small business employees in this country if this bill is passed. There is the class where, if you work for a company with fewer than 15 employees, you have the right to be dismissed and you have no right to retrenchment. If you work for a company with between 15 and 100 employees, you could still be dismissed but you will have some rights to retrenchment pay. If you are lucky enough to work for a company with more than 100 employees then you are right on both fronts. This government is so ideologically confused that it has created three classes of citizens—first-, second- and third-class citizens—when it comes to employees of small business.</para>
<para>As I said at the outset, this government’s approach is that there is only one way to help small business—that is, to take something away from the employees of small business. Why doesn’t this government do something about the paperwork compliance burden for small business? Why doesn’t it do something to take the burden that it has created in relation to superannuation choice? The government has the chance to do this right now. Why doesn’t it do something to give certain small business owners the capacity to have the bargaining agent of their choice, whether it be the Cricketers Association or, heaven forbid, a registered trade union? Why doesn’t it give the small businesses of this nation that right, that choice? We hear all about choice from this government—superannuation choice, for example—but it is taking away the right to a choice for certain small businesses to have trade unions representing them in their negotiations.</para>
<para>This government is ideologically confused but ideologically hell-bent on taking away the rights of employees of small business. This is an illogical, unfair and ideologically driven system that lets down Australian workers, lets down small businesses and lets down the economy generally. I call on the House to support Labor’s amendment and I call on the House to take a sensible, well-measured, reasoned approach and reject this government’s extreme ideological agenda.</para>

<para>—I am pleased to rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2234">Workplace Relations Amendment (Small Business Employment Protection) Bill 2004</inline>.This bill amends the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to maintain the exemption that exists for small business from redundancy pay by overturning the recent decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission imposing redundancy pay obligations on small businesses. I am pleased, as a representative for the seat of Moncrieff, which on a per capita basis is the small business capital of Australia, to associate myself with the very good benefits that will flow and will continue to flow to small business as a consequence of the enactment of this bill.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is interesting for me to follow the member for Prospect and the remarks that the Labor Party have made in this debate. It has been interesting to hear the Australian Labor Party come into this chamber and argue in some confused way that they in fact are the friends of small business. They argue that they are the friends of small business by enforcing very harsh obligations, in many instances, on the small business sector. Nothing could be further from the truth.</para>
<para>I heard the member for Prospect remark that it is up to the Howard federal government to justify the various propositions that we are putting forward in reforms to industrial relations and the need that we see to maintain the exemption for small business from redundancy pay. I also heard the member for Prospect claim that it is an ideologically confused Liberal Party and an ideologically confused National Party that are sending mixed signals to the Australian work force and Australian small business owners about what we see as the best way forward for this sector. It is interesting that the member for Prospect and the Australian Labor Party would argue that in this particular bill it is the Howard government that is ideologically confused.</para>
<para>It is interesting because, when the test case was put before the AIRC in this particular instance, the state Labor governments did not support having redundancy pay imposed on small business. State Labor governments adopted a contrary point of view to that which the member for Prospect and other Labor members have put forward in this debate this evening. Let there be no doubt that there is only one political party that is confused when it comes to what is necessary to continue the growth of employment and small businesses in Australia, ensure the profitability of small businesses and, most importantly, provide the necessary conditions for a flexible work force for small businesses so that they can provide one of their most overriding concerns—that is, employment opportunities for Australians. After all, it is almost a cliche now when we say that the small business sector is the engine room of the Australian economy.</para>
<para>I am very pleased to speak on behalf of small businesses in my electorate of Moncrieff and in Gold Coast City, and to argue for a continued exemption for those small businesses from the burden of redundancy pay. I recognise that an exemption for small businesses from redundancy pay may have possible ramifications for an employee. But I am reminded that, if a small business becomes insolvent, then there is nothing for the employee at all. Far be it from us to say, ‘We’ll impose a redundancy pay obligation on you’—which may be a contributing factor to the eventual insolvency of a business. There will be nothing for the employee then.</para>
<para>The crocodile tears from the Australian Labor Party about how harshly this government treats employees could not be further from the truth. This government is committed to ensuring the right economic conditions through strong economic management, the right conditions to employ a productive work force and, most importantly, that the impossible shackles that Labor Party policy would impose on future employment are not imposed, so that small businesses will actively go about employing Australians, giving them a chance and providing them with a pay packet which, fundamentally, is a key concern.</para>
<para>I have always rallied behind local businesses on the Gold Coast and I am not about to stop. My wife is involved in small business and I come from a small business family. I continue to stand up in this chamber and speak on behalf of small businesses. Many small businesses simply cannot afford large redundancy payouts. There are now some 1.6 million small businesses operating in Australia and, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, their annual profit is approximately $32,000 per business.</para>
<para>This recent decision by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will impose unreasonable financial burdens on small business. For example, a typical retail small business with, say, seven employees, each with six years continuous employment, would face a contingent liability for redundancy pay of nearly $30,000. There are reasonable grounds to assume that the bill will have potential influence over the redundancy entitlements of some one million small business employees, on the assumption that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission’s redundancy decision potentially broadened access to the redundancy pay entitlement.</para>
<para>I recognise that, for those one million potential small business employees, it could be construed as a negative. But the point that I will stress, and the more important point, is that if these kinds of exemptions are not provided to small businesses—small businesses with an average profit of some $32,000 per annum—people will not be employed to begin with. As I said earlier, if a business becomes insolvent, then people would not have the opportunity to receive many of their entitlements, let alone their redundancy pay entitlements.</para>
<para>The coalition is absolutely committed to opposing unnecessary restraints on small businesses, which make it harder for them to employ people. If this bill is not passed, the vast majority of small businesses that are covered by federal awards will eventually, it is fair to say, be subjected to providing redundancy payments for their employees in accordance with the AIRC decision. It is likely that this decision will also flow through to the state jurisdictions. This bill will not affect any redundancy pay provisions that were in awards prior to the AIRC decision. The AIRC has created a new entitlement which did not previously exist.</para>
<para>It is absolutely vital that opportunities for continued growth and job creation for those 1.1 million non-agricultural small businesses in Australia continue to be maximised. It is even more essential for the 3.3 million people that are employed by these businesses. This bill in no way prevents small businesses reaching agreements with their employees to include redundancy provisions in their terms of employment. It is about preventing the imposition of a one-size-fits-all regulation which, quite frankly, many small businesses will not be able to afford. The government have been consistent and strong and I will be consistent and strong in my support for small business. We recognise that the biggest threat to jobs growth in Australia is the unnecessary impediments which make it harder for small business to employ people.</para>
<para>This decision is fundamentally flawed because the decision the AIRC took overturned the exemption from severance pay for businesses with fewer than 15 employees. This exemption was established by the AIRC’s predecessor back in 1984, a decision which was then turned on its head. The Queensland Industrial Relations Commission recently decided that the small business exemption under the Queensland system should remain. It found that the imposition of redundancy pay obligations had ‘the very real potential to result in the insolvency of a number of small businesses.’ In 1994 the New South Wales Industrial Commission also reaffirmed the need for small business exemption. It is significant to note, as I stressed earlier, that none of the four state governments that took part in this AIRC test case supported the removal of the exemption—the Queensland and WA state Labor governments opposed the removal, while the New South Wales and Victorian Labor governments neither supported nor opposed it.</para>
<para>Despite what the member for Prospect said earlier, the fact remains that redundancy pay provisions can be incorporated into awards if that is the decision of both parties to the award. The result is that we provide a framework which provides flexibility to small business owners and employers as well as ensuring that small business employees are in a position to also argue the merits of their case. The fundamental fact is that redundancy pay principally comes into effect at a time when a small business is having problems. There are not many small businesses that will make their staff redundant if everything is going very strongly. Typically, the reason for redundancy is the fact that a small business is encountering financial difficulties or experiencing transitions with regard to the goods or services that they provide. So there is no point in wondering what the impact would be on small businesses if at a time of financial difficulty we were to say, ‘You must meet the liability of redundancy payment to those employees who are taking redundancy.’ Can you imagine the problems that would cause?</para>
<para>This was a flawed decision. This bill is crucial to ensuring the long-term sustainability of a flexible workplace relations system that is to the benefit of employees and employers. Most fundamentally, this bill continues to reflect the Howard government’s and my own commitment to supporting small business because it is fundamentally central to the long-term sustainability of employment and economic prosperity that all Australians enjoy. In conclusion, I highlight that this is a positive bill, good for small businesses on the Gold Coast and good for continuing employment in Australia.</para>

<para>—In the brief time that I have to make a contribution in this debate on the <inline ref="R2234">Workplace Relations Amendment (Small Business Employment Protection) Bill 2004</inline>, I am more than pleased to add my voice to the government’s argument its need. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline> Like many of my colleagues on this side of the House I am more than pleased to add my voice to this bill, which protects small businesses. From the contributions of all members on this side it is evident that there is only one voice speaking out on behalf of small business, and that voice is on this side of the House and not on the other. We have the interests and the livelihoods of those who take the brave and often risky gamble of entering into a business venture of their own to heart. I know that all of us on this side certainly have made it a core concern of ours throughout this term of government, and in fact throughout the entire Howard government stewardship of this country.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I too know how it feels to put all your hard earned savings on the line and to have your family wondering if it was the right move to give up your salaried position. It is only through small businesses that we truly begin the process of employment growth that so many others in the community will eventually benefit from. I welcome the opportunity to stand up and assist small business in this place. I am also proud of the fact that the coalition remains the only political voice in Australia that will vehemently oppose unnecessary restraints on small businesses, particularly when they make it harder for them to employ people. Small businesses can well do without excessive shackles being placed upon them. By voting against this bill, that is exactly what the opposition are doing! They are placing shackles upon them which have been imposed by a recent decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</para>

</talker>
<para>—We have heard much talk of the 60 years since the end of the Second World War. Tonight I want to talk about a person whose contribution to this country in the postwar period so epitomises the contribution to this country and to my own electorate of the Ukrainian community. My electorate has one of Australia’s greatest concentrations of Ukrainians. It has many Ukrainian community institutions, such as the Karpaty Credit Union, the Ukrainian club, the Ukrainian Catholic Church, the monastery, the women’s association hall et cetera.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Johann Kwasnycia lived within 10 houses of the house I grew up in. His life epitomises the contribution of a lot of the Ukrainians in my area, families such as the Iwachiws, Baranowskis and Shymkos. In giving this speech, I will paraphrase extensively the obituary speech given by his son following Johann’s recent death. It is very interesting to read the contribution that Johann made to this country.</para>
<para>Johann left his homeland to escape the invading Russian Army when he was only 15. When the war ended in 1945, exactly 60 years ago, Johann was working in Germany, where most had to struggle to survive under extreme food shortages. Johann continued applying to return to his homeland but was forced to stay and work in Germany.</para>
<para>Johann and his family migrated to Australia and arrived on 11 November 1949, after six weeks of sailing in cramped ship accommodation. During the trip he worked on the boat, painting to earn a bit of extra food supply. In order to pay the fare to Australia, the family had to sign a contract to work on a farm in Tenterfield for two years. However, on arrival in Australia, they were told the contract was cancelled and they were required to be resettled in corrugated iron shelter housing at Cowra.</para>
<para>In 1950 they moved to Kensington, Sydney, where the four lived in the rented one bedroom of a house. Life proved very difficult in Sydney, with Johann frequently walking to the city and back to find work. He eventually landed a job on the faraway Snowy Mountains hydro scheme, where he worked until the late 1950s. He often spoke of the cold and freezing conditions working there and living in Cooma. Later on, Johann was to work on a number of construction projects in Sydney, including the Eastern Suburbs railway tunnels, the Malabar treatment works and the Warragamba Dam, before moving on to the Opera House, where one of his final tasks was being suspended high in a harness gluing the large tiles onto the giant sails.</para>
<para>Johann’s life revolved around the Ukrainian church at Lidcombe, which he attended fervently. He was extensively involved in many of the Ukrainian community’s activities. He enjoyed the company of his countrymen in a community house at Merrylands until its sale, playing cards and recalling the past. He made many donations to various Ukrainian and local charities and sent parcels and money home.</para>
<para>Johann was a devoted family man and became a true grandfather; in Johann’s obituary, his son spoke about Johann’s many family outings. Johann tinkered endlessly under his house in his spare time. He built his own cross-cut saw, plane saw, ripper, grinder and anything else he could put together from bits he collected. He clearly passed his collection habits on to his son.</para>
<para>In 1994 at the age of 70, following the fall of the USSR, he was finally able to go back to his home in the Ukraine to be reunited with his family, who he had not seen for 55 years.  He told of the difficult conditions they still endured.</para>
<para>Johann Kwasnycia’s life typifies the contribution of the Ukrainians in my electorate and more particularly in the suburb I come from, along with those families I mentioned earlier. In this country we have 33,000 people who say they are of Ukrainian extraction and, of those, 13,000 were actually physically born there. This community has endeavoured very strongly to maintain its Ukrainian traditions. It is increasingly difficult in second and third generations to imbue people with interest in their background and their history. To give a typical example of their continued activity, I recently attended the celebrations of the Cossack group which has toured Australia. They are very proud to say that they have been to Yulara, amongst many other places, showcasing their culture, skills and music.</para>
<para>As I said, Johann’s life typifies the Ukrainian contribution made in my area, which essentially derived from a migrant hostel on Merrylands Road that had previously been an American hostel during the Second World War. As we celebrate 60 years since the end of the Second World War, we should also put on record the contribution of those early migration waves after the Second World War, as those migrants contributed so much to the building of this country and its diversification. Johann was typical of that contribution. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—From time to time members in this House are tempted, for a variety of reasons, to change their direction in life. Recently I was asked by a very successful local company to join their progressive and dynamic team. The company is one the fastest growing businesses in the Hunter. I had the pleasure of working with them briefly prior to returning to politics in 2001. Since then I have witnessed their contribution to the development of a stronger Hunter. I am flattered that they value my abilities to make a substantial contribution to their effort and to share in their successes. I have an excellent rapport with the owners. Their direction and ideals are much in line with mine: building better opportunities for our region, creating wealth and jobs, and doing so with the utmost integrity.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>However, I have found that politics offers rich rewards that money cannot match. I will give two recent examples. The first was when I recently assisted a constituent, Sue Brown, to be reunited with her injured daughter Louise Barry, in London, following the train and bus bombings. The second was the smiles on the faces of the students at Dungog High School when, after their sheep were slaughtered by disturbed youths, I was able to organise replacement sheep so that their studies could continue. That is what makes the work of a politician so enjoyable and worth while. It is the reward you get from helping your constituents—a mother to be reunited with her daughter, or students to overcome a traumatic experience.</para>
<para>I think back to why I went into politics in the first place. I did so not because I was a long-time member of the Liberal Party or an ideologue shaped by conservative icons. I came into politics because I was an angry person and had just experienced one of the most significant events in my life—the birth of our twin boys. It is an understatement to say that the birth of your children refocuses your priorities in life. In 1991, when my twin sons, Robbie and David, were born, I genuinely feared for their future. I recognised the challenges they would face and believed our country was headed in the wrong direction. Rather than complain, I accepted a challenge from a friend and decided to jump in and do something about it. I can clearly remember the evening of 5 July 1995 when I was heading out to a Liberal Party ‘meet the candidate’ function for the Paterson preselection. My then four-year-old son asked me, ‘Daddy, why are you going out tonight? Can’t you stay home?’ I told him that I was going out for him and that in a few years he would understand why.</para>
<para>Over the time I have been in parliament, I have spent a lot of time discussing the issues of time management, reason and direction with my family. Like others in this chamber, my family do understand—sometimes with difficulty—encourage and wholeheartedly support my decision to represent the people of Paterson. Their reason for doing so is simple. They support my being in this parliament to help make this country a better place. In my first speech in this House, I said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... if I can be remembered for one contribution to this House I would want it to be that I was part of the team that helped turn the ship around; to steer a new course towards the nation’s salvation.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Today, when I look into the eyes of my children, I know that there is still a lot of work to do to provide them and others like them with the opportunities that I and many in this House enjoyed as young Australians. When asked what drives my passion to be in parliament, I say that it is best summarised as my family and my nation. I forever ask myself what the future holds for the people of Paterson, those I represent and care about. My place is in this parliament representing them. Accordingly, I have advised the company that I cannot accept their kind offer. I am determined to do whatever I can to make this nation a better place and to provide opportunity, hope and leadership for our children.</para>

<para>—Last Wednesday I had the opportunity to meet with maintenance engineers from Newcastle who are the subject of industrial action being taken by their employer, Boeing. This is not the first time that this matter has been drawn to the attention of the parliament and I am sure that it will not be the last. In rising to lend my support to the engineers at Williamstown, I acknowledge the hard work of the member for Newcastle in standing up for the rights of these workers, including their right to be represented by the Australian Workers Union.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This dispute goes to the heart of concerns that working Australians have about the government’s industrial relations agenda. This is more than a dispute between a group of employees and their employer. The engineers at Williamstown have already had a taste of what is to come from the government’s industrial relations agenda, as for the last four years they have been on individual contracts. They are not simply taking a stand against the notion of being on contracts. They have tried it, have found that it does not work for them and have decided that they would prefer to be under a collective agreement. Being on individual contracts, they have found that every time the company makes a change in policy or procedure it fundamentally and unilaterally changes their conditions of employment.</para>
<para>I am sure that everyone was relieved to hear the Prime Minister’s views on the matter last week when, in response to a question from the Leader of the Opposition, he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">….the existing law means that the company is within its rights in taking the position it is taking. It is fair and proper, under the existing law.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Everyone would have been relieved by that answer, as it gives some insight into the future of industrial relations—at least in the way John Howard sees it. So much for assurances that employees will have a choice. The minister keeps reminding the House that workers will be able to elect to be on an AWA or, if they wish, they may negotiate collectively and, indeed, through a union. However, that is not the case for these employees at Boeing.</para>
<para>The Prime Minister continues to refuse to guarantee that workers will not be worse off. He maintains that his record is his guarantee. I have to say that people are starting to treat his record in this regard very sceptically. We have an example right here and now at Newcastle. Boeing has been in Australia for a while and knows the industrial relations system. It has no qualms in having its employees at Bankstown under a collective agreement with the AWU as the principal respondent, but it is another story at its Williamstown site. We understand that the company is quite adept in reading between the lines, particularly when it comes to currying favour with the Howard government.</para>
<para>In fairness, what better way to maintain the inside track when eyeing off Australian Defence Force contracts than to embrace the government’s Holy Grail: the Prime Minister’s personal ambition for the past 30 years to have workers forced onto individual contracts. It is difficult to look at this dispute in any other way. Boeing workers at Bankstown, as I said earlier, are happily ensconced on a certified collective agreement, while the workers at Williamstown are locked out because of the company’s insistence that they be on Australian workplace agreements. Either the company is suffering industrial schizophrenia or it is displaying gross corporate hypocrisy at levels not seen before in this country. Some might even go so far as to suggest that Boeing is simply sucking up to the government to prove its loyalty and improve its standing.</para>
<para>There has always been a resolution available for this dispute. The employees at Williamstown agreed previously to have all of their claims heard and determined on their merits by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the country’s peak industrial umpire. These are not militant people. The majority are former RAAF personnel who have served their time protecting this country. The last thing they want is to be involved in an industrial dispute. They are skilled engineers who look after our fleet of FA18 fighters and all they want is a fair go. Interestingly, Boeing has opposed the intervention of the industrial umpire and has shown its preparedness to starve its employees—these former servicemen—and their families into submission. I wonder what this company really believes when it thinks of its employees, their families and the community. Does this famous American icon see its workers only as units of production? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Yesterday the Israeli defence forces began supervising the final withdrawal of Jewish settlements from the Gaza Strip. Many of these settlements have been home to Jews for more than 30 years. It came as no surprise that there is enormous sadness about this withdrawal on the part of the Israeli people, nor can it come as a surprise that many Israelis have opposed the withdrawal—vigorously, but so far without violence. Long may that be so. Traditionally, victors do not surrender land to those they have defeated. Israel occupied the Gaza Strip from Egypt after its successful defence against attack from its neighbours in 1967. Now it is withdrawing from those last parts of the Gaza Strip upon which it built settlements. It is not receiving anything in return; this is a unilateral withdrawal.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The pragmatic justification made by Ariel Sharon is simply that Israel cannot maintain settlements in areas which are overwhelmingly populated by Arabs. There are about 1.4 million Palestinians in Gaza and just 8,500 Jews. The cost of defending the settlements is $US560 million each year. It is better to consolidate in those areas where the Jews are a majority. This is an about-face for Sharon, often known as the father of the settlement movement, and a reminder of the wisdom of Moshe Dayan’s reproach to those Israelis flushed with victory after 1967 who thought of a greater Israel from Jordan to the sea: ‘You want the dowry,’ he said, ‘but you do not want to marry the bride.’</para>
<para>But the opponents of the withdrawal say that this is a capitulation to terror. It will be seen as a victory for the violent, a win for Hamas and a confirmation that Israel will continue to retreat in the face of a terror campaign that has been waged against it. They cite Sharon’s earlier claims that a withdrawal is not a recipe for peace but a recipe for war. Many observers watching the demonstrations with thousands of Jews flying their orange flags of protest will conclude that it is Sharon and Israel that have most at risk. I beg to differ. If the withdrawal results in no diminution of terrorism, if it results in a Hamas controlled Gaza being the source of further attacks against Israel, then the Israeli defence forces have the capacity to respond decisively. Sharon said yesterday, in a nationwide address, ‘If they choose fire, we will respond with fire, more severe than ever.’</para>
<para>But, most importantly, if this unilateral withdrawal is rewarded with violence, Israel’s complaint that there is no partner for peace will be confirmed. The world will have seen Israel go through the most agonising and demoralising internal struggle as it withdrew from Gaza. It will have seen how difficult—nearly impossible—it was even for a leader like Sharon to complete that withdrawal. Then, if after all that, the critics of withdrawal are confirmed—if, after all that, withdrawal is a recipe for more violence, not peace—how can the world continue to pressure the Israelis to cede more territory? On the other hand, if all our prayers are fulfilled and the withdrawal does succeed in creating a new level of trust and the end, or perhaps the beginning of the end, of violence, then all the people of Israel and the Palestinian territories will be winners, as we will all be.</para>
<para>Prime Minister Sharon is as tough and as shrewd as they come. He knows what he is playing for. One outcome least sought but most likely is that the withdrawal does nothing to diminish the level of terror, but it will certainly make Israel’s borders somewhat easier and much cheaper to defend. It will give Israel a powerful moral argument to use to resist further concessions. The other outcome most sought but less likely is that it will be the beginning of peace. Abu Mazen and the Palestinians have the most at risk in this game. It can be the renewal of a peace process or it can be the loss of considerable moral capital in the eyes of the free world. So while the world focuses on Sharon and Israel, it is the player on the other side of the chessboard who has the most challenging moves to make and the most to win or lose. Sharon is putting the ball in Abu Mazen’s court—he cannot afford to drop it.</para>

<para>—In the past few days I have delivered a petition to this House from 1,008 petitioners in the central west of New South Wales. The petition:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">... draws to the attention of the House the appalling availability of dental services throughout rural and regional Australia in public dental clinics for those in most need. This is caused primarily by inadequate staffing levels due to low salaries paid to lecturers in universities and the length of time required to train dentists.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The petition also asks the House to:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... take the necessary action to train and fund adequate numbers of dentists willing to staff public dental clinics ... as well as maintenance and oral education to all citizens deemed eligible.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I do not believe there is one member of this House who has not seen distressed low-income and pensioner constituents seeking assistance for urgent dental treatment. They have problems that, if left unattended, will present far more serious health consequences down the track and a burden on the public health dollar far in excess of timely treatment for their current crises.</para>
<para>This petition has been gathered from as far afield as Grenfell, Hill End, Orange, Bathurst and Lithgow by the central west based Rural Dental Action group, with the able assistance of Bathurst Combined Pensioner and Superannuants branch. I pay tribute to Marge Bollinger and Dr Cath Errey, who were instrumental in the establishment of the action group in August last year. Thanks to this group, the wider public and those who cannot get dental care now realise how much was lost when the program introduced by the former government was axed in 1996. This government said then that the scheme had served its purpose and that dental care was a state responsibility. The federal scheme had reduced waiting times for public dental care from two years to six months. In the nine years since its axing, a two-year wait is again normal.</para>
<para>But the Minister for Health and Ageing has recognised the public outcry with his very minimal Medicare cover announced in last year’s budget when $200 per annum worth of care was reinstated for the most chronic and complex cases. However, the minister knows how minimal is the care one can obtain for $200. But he at least recognises that the Commonwealth does indeed have power under section 51(xxiiiA) of the Constitution to make laws for dental services, a power specifically granted in a 1946 referendum.</para>
<para>Dental care for the needy is a national responsibility as well as a power, and the petition I deliver also seeks a national program to address the urgent need for more graduates and university lecturers with payments that will attract them from private practice dentistry. At the moment, a senior lecturer in dentistry receives about $72,000, hardly the kind of remuneration that would attract a senior experienced dentist from private practice to academia, whatever his or her dedication to the cause.</para>
<para>Charles Sturt University has been working on a plan to train dentists under the health sciences program with a transfer to postgraduate training at Sydney University. That is one model that needs urgent exploration. The Australian Dental Association, with whom I met last week, has recently detailed the extent of the crisis. In my own area—the central west of New South Wales, where the Rural Dental Action Group is working so effectively—there are just 17 dentists per 100,000 people, whereas the national average, itself quite insufficient, is 47 per 100,000. The other sad fact is that the age of dentists is ever increasing, with a third of them over the age of 50.</para>
<para>The Dental Association has a number of proposals for improving those figures, one of which is the establishment of a Commonwealth dental health program similar to that discontinued in 1996, which would be administered by the states, with a mix of public and private surgeries being utilised. The other part of the association’s plan is a scholarship scheme for rural students. As well, the association is suggesting a moratorium on fee indebtedness for dental graduates who agree to work in regional, rural and remote areas.</para>
<para>These are issues of health care and health education, yet the association has had little joy in trying to meet with the health or education ministers. One office says that it is a health issue and the other says it is an education issue. Well it is both, and I hope both ministers can find the time to sit down with the association and work out a solution to this crisis. I applaud the Rural Dental Action Group for its efforts and its petition, and I urge the government to act upon its requests.</para>

<para>—Over the last 12 months I have compiled 4,500 submissions from all round Australia on the body that I refer to as the national shame of Australia—that is, the Child Support Agency. Out of those 4,500 submissions I have, with the able assistance of a researcher, sifted through and compiled those submissions which carry detailed evidence of the way in which the Child Support Agency operates. Let me inform the House of a case relating to one of those submissions, which is the tip of the iceberg with regard to the problems associated with this government agency.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>A couple’s 14-year-old child runs away from home because of a dispute with the father about his possible suspension from his local high school. The couple are frustrated and bewildered after nine months of attempting to get the child to come home and receiving absolutely no assistance at all from the New South Wales Department of Community Services or the New South Wales Police Service, who tell the father that the child has a right to stay where he wants providing the people he stays with are not harming him or he is not in trouble with the police. The child is drinking alcohol and the parents are concerned about him getting into unlawful activities.</para>
<para>The child tells police and DOCS that he wants to live with his aunt, the father’s sister. The parents were advised that it was this 14-year-old’s choice as to where he wants to live. The parents are further advised to give him his clothes. The parents are also unable to obtain school records relating to the child as he has changed his address without the parents’ knowledge. They are advised by the school that they cannot forward any correspondence to the parents because he is no longer living with them.</para>
<para>The rights of the parents are further violated by the bizarre actions of the Child Support Agency approving the aunt’s application for child support from the parents of this child. The CSA then advise the parents in writing that they have calculated the amount of child support the parents must pay the aunt. We have a situation here whereby a child who is 14 years of age has been assisted to live with his aunt despite the biological parents’ opposition and concern for his safety and wellbeing. In other words, their rights as parents have been abused. They have been forced to pay child support—18 per cent each of the earnings of each of those individual parents.</para>
<para>There are a number of questions that need to be asked about this particular Child Support Agency case, as there are a significant number of questions to be asked about the other 899 I have so far processed and which I hope will culminate in about 1,150 to 1,200 cases. The questions are: (1) Under what act or sections of an act of this parliament has the Child Support Agency taken this action to assist in removing a child from his biological parents? (2) Under what section or sections of federal legislation has the Child Support Agency made a decision to force biological parents to pay child support payments to a person who is not a parent of the child? (3) Is the child and/or the person he is living with receiving any payment from Centrelink or any other Commonwealth social security agency and/or department and, if so, under what Commonwealth legislation is this payment being made to this person?</para>
<para>I believe this example is a serious abuse of the rights and responsibilities of law-abiding citizens and parents, and it is typical of the abuse of power which appears to be endemic in the Child Support Agency based on the 899 further cases I have to date. I can assure you, Mr Speaker, and I can assure the minister of the Crown on my side of politics responsible for this agency in this parliament that they are going to be hearing a lot more about the illegal activity and the way in which the Child Support Agency has not only contravened a number of federal acts of parliament but—more importantly, I believe, based on constitutional advice I have received—contravened the Constitution of this great nation of ours and that I am going to bring them to account for it.</para>

<para>The Photovoltaic Rebate Programme (PVRP) aims to provide assistance to householders and owners of community buildings, such as schools, to install photovoltaic systems. Other key objectives are to:</para>
<para>- Reduce greenhouse emissions;</para>
<para>- Assist in the development of the Australian photovoltaic industry; and</para>
<para>- Increase public awareness of renewable energy.</para>
<para>The Guidelines for the programme are set out in two parts, (a) for residential and (b) community buildings. Cash rebates are available for grid-connected or stand-alone photovoltaic systems. The current rebate level for new systems is $4 per peak watt, capped at $4,000 per residential system and $8,000 per community building system. A lesser amount of $2.50 per peak watt of output is available to extend existing systems, up to a total of $2,500. In addition there is a Developer component which has been run through a tender process.</para>
<para>A. Residential Guidelines</para>
<para>Eligible systems</para>
<para>PVRP rebates will be available for residential PV systems that can be either grid connected or stand-alone.</para>
<para>Equipment requirements</para>
<para>Major equipment items included in the application (PV modules, inverters, battery regulators and batteries) must be new equipment and not second-hand. Applicants seeking to extend existing systems should check first with the relevant State authority or the Australian Greenhouse Office (AGO) as appropriate.</para>
<para>Installation at owner’s principal place of residence</para>
<para>The PV system must be installed at the applicant’s (owner’s) principal place of residence as shown on the electoral roll. The Commonwealth will only fund one rebate per residence. An applicant may qualify for a rebate for a new house under construction and should check with the relevant State authority or AGO as appropriate.</para>
<para>Rebates are payable on owner occupied houses and owner occupied units within a body corporate. Rebates are also payable on owner occupied transportable homes, provided the owner occupier owns the land, or is a long term lessee of the site (minimum of five years). Ownership must be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the State authority.</para>
<para>Joint Ownership of PV Systems</para>
<para>The applicant must be the owner of the PV system that is the subject of the application. The AGO will consider an applicant to be the owner of a PV system where:</para>

<para>—The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1) (a)">
<para>and (b) The Department of Family and Community Services (FaCS), which includes the Office for Women (OfW), commissions a range of research, which, while not necessarily focusing on employment conditions, can contain some data on casual employees and women. However, primary responsibility for collecting workplace data rests with the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR).</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>Australia’s workplace arrangements, taxation and the integrated social support systems work in a complementary way to provide a comprehensive system of support for families from the time of birth of a child, and ensure that support for families is broad-based, practical and long term. The Howard Government has introduced a range of policies to encourage more family friendly workplaces.</para>
<para>The Australian Government has also supported and promoted extensive public debate about work and family issues including balancing work and family responsibilities. This has led to increased public awareness of options and benefits, including increased employer flexibility around hours of work, starting and finishing times and part-time employment.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>Australia’s strong economic position, continuing low inflation and low interest rates are key contributors to supporting families’ wellbeing. This has led to growth in real wages, employment and productivity. The Australian Government’s responsibility is to ensure broad economic and social policy settings provide an environment where families have the best opportunity to realise their goals and make their own choices in balancing work and family.</para>
<para>The Australian Government has provided unprecedented support of $21 billion towards payments like Family Tax Benefit, Maternity Allowance, Child Care Benefit and Parenting Payment to help families with this choice.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>The Workplace Relations Act 1996 provides the basis for a flexible workplace relations system that provides choice for working parents. The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations produces a range of resources to promote awareness and understanding of work and family issues and the range of flexibilities offered through the workplace relations system.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>The Australian Government seeks to assist families to make choices around work and family that best meet their aspirations, needs and circumstances. Employees wishing to change their work/family balance will face different issues depending on their individual circumstances.</para>

<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>From 1 July 2006, the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme (SNSS) and the Disabled Supplementary Services Program (DSUPS) will be replaced by the Inclusion Support Subsidy. Eligible services currently supported through SNSS and DSUPS will be supported under ISS.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>Yes, funding to increase the hourly rate paid to In Home Carers caring for children with ongoing high support needs is consistent with the DSUPS guidelines. A child’s ability to participate in an alternate care setting is not a determinant of DSUPS support.</para>

<item label="(3)">
<para>Yes</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>In Home Care is a targeted form of child care where the care is provided in the child’s own home by an approved carer where no other child care options exist. The In Home Care Review is looking at the costs of child care support provided by carers for children, including children with disabilities (although this is not solely the focus of it). The In Home Care Terms of Reference specifically include the requirement to identify the costs of providing In Home Care. The review has not been extended to look at financial support provided to the family of children with disabilities.</para>

<para>The review of In Home Care was not conducted in response to representations from parents. The national peak body made representations for In Home Care. .</para>

<para>The Community Link consultation report (dated August 2003) suggested that not all child care services could consistently access support through the Supplementary Services Program or funding through the SNSS in timely manner. The Inclusion and Professional Support Program will ensure equitable access for services.</para>

From 1 July 2006, the Inclusion Support Subsidy Scheme will replace the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme and the Disabled Supplementary Service Program.

<para>Services available to assist culturally and linguistically diverse families in NSW at 1 January 2006 to assist in meeting needs include: The Child Care Access Hotline - a national telephone information service that provides parents and employers with information and assistance on child care. To assist callers from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds the hotline uses a telephone interpreter service. Centrelink Jobs, Education and Training Advisors (JAs) and Personal Advisors (PAs) are able to discuss any issues that may affect the parent’s choice of child care service type including such things as the need for care appropriate to culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) families. Under the new Inclusion and Professional Support Program child care services will be able to access specially trained bicultural support workers to assist in integrating children from diverse background into a quality care environment. The Commonwealth, and all State and Territory governments have endorsed the Charter of Public Service in a Culturally Diverse Society, under which all government agencies are responsible for ensuring their services are accessible to Australia’s CALD communities.</para>

<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>I am aware of reports that the master of the bulk carrier <inline font-style="italic">Flecha</inline> declared his ship to be at security level 2 while berthed at the Port of Wallaroo in March 2005.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>Only a Contracting Government to the SOLAS Convention can raise a ship’s security level. If the ship’s Flag Administration had raised the ship’s security level, then it would have been appropriate that the Office of Transport Security be notified of this. However there is no evidence that the Flag Administration raised the ship’s security level, and the Office of Transport Security was not notified that the ship’s security level had been raised.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>No. A public declaration that the security measures adopted by a ship are other than they actually are is not a breach of the Maritime Transport Security Act 2003 or the SOLAS Convention / International Ship and Port Facility Security Code. Under the SOLAS Convention, the Master of a ship may implement such measures to protect the safety and security of the ship as are deemed necessary.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>No. A public declaration that the security measures adopted by a ship are other than they actually are is not a transport security incident. The question of whether such a declaration is appropriate is a matter for the Flag Administration, and my Department has written to the Flag Administration about this matter.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>The Government accepts that, under the SOLAS Convention, the master of a ship may implement such measures to protect the safety and security of the ship as are deemed necessary, and that this may include denying access to persons whose access is not otherwise mandated on the grounds of “security”. However the Government considers the making of a false declaration about the security level at which a ship is operating to be an inappropriate use of the Maritime Transport Security Act 2003 and the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code. As noted above, the question of whether such a declaration is appropriate is a matter for the Flag Administration. In the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Flecha</inline>, my Department has written to the Flag Administration.</para>

<para>Australian airports are not able to recover the administrative costs incurred in the development of a Transport Security Program under the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 from the $35 million Regional Airport Funding Program.</para>
<para>The Regional Airport Funding Program offers funding support to airports that are new to the regulatory regime. The funding is available for the installation of basic security infrastructure such as fencing, lighting, surveillance equipment and alarm systems. The funding is not available for ongoing staffing costs or consultancy costs.</para>

<para>—The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">(1) and (2) The name of the project proponent is recorded for all Natural Heritage Trust (NHT) and National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality (NAP) funded projects. However, the proponent’s name does not necessarily indicate the level of Indigenous involvement in project implementation. Many thousands of projects have been funded during the life of the NHT Phase One and Phase Two and the NAP and it is not practical to undertake a manual assessment of the degree of Indigenous involvement where the proponent does not indicate that they are primarily an Indigenous organisation.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I provide the attached data for which we are confident that the organisation is primarily an Indigenous organisation. In providing these data, I must advise that the figures would be an understatement of funding provided to groups where there is Indigenous involvement or where projects generate direct or indirect benefits for Indigenous communities due to sponsoring arrangements or joint involvement. In many cases funds are allocated to regional organisations, such as catchment management authorities, which in turn use the funds for Indigenous purposes.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I also provide the following examples of larger-scale projects that involve substantial Indigenous participation but which were not picked up in the data search based on proponent name:</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Northern Australian Indigenous Land and Sea Management Association (NAILSMA) was a joint recipient of $3.9 million of NHT regional funding in December 2004 to undertake a major project on Turtles and Dugongs covering all of Northern Australia. This will fund the development and implementation of five community-based regional action plans and will integrate traditional knowledge with scientific research to build community capacity to make responsible resource management decisions and improve management of these threatened species. The proponents and beneficiaries are not solely Indigenous and the recipients were not identified as such and the project not included in the data provided in the attached Tables.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">There is major Indigenous Community involvement in the $2 million Natural Heritage Trust funded ‘Ghost Nets’ Project that will seek to substantially reduce the amount of abandoned foreign fishing nets and other debris in the Gulf of Carpentaria. This debris threatens marine wildlife, such as turtles, dugong, dolphins and sea snakes, and cause losses to the fishing industry through entanglement of nets and lines. The project is managed by the Northern Gulf Resource Management Group Incorporated and involves numerous Indigenous Communities around the Gulf, the Australian fishing industry, a number of non-government organisations and State Governments, but was not picked up in the data interrogation as funding for Indigenous projects.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I add that the Natural Heritage Ministerial Board has recently approved projects under the Regional Competitive Round of the NHT allocating funds to Indigenous organisations amounting to $1,356,977. Encouraging Indigenous engagement was a specific theme for this funding round and is consistent with current Australian Government emphasis on increasing the level of Indigenous participation in NRM programmes.</para>

<para>and (2) I am advised by my department that opinions were sought from the Solicitor‑General in 1990 and the Australian Government Solicitor in 1999 on the Governor‑General’s role as Commander-in-Chief. Both opinions support statements, including by the then Governor‑General in 1983, the Right Honourable Sir Ninian Stephen AK GCMG GCVO KBE KStJ, that the Governor‑General’s role as Commander‑in‑Chief is essentially a titular one and that the Minister for Defence has general control and administration of the Australian Defence Force by virtue of the provisions of the Defence Act 1903. I agree with that view.</para>

<para>Notes:</para>
<para>Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Fremantle and Port Adelaide figures are from the Bureau of Transport and Regional Economics. Other figures are from various Customs sources and local port authority statistics.</para>
<para>The industry standard is to record container statistics in twenty foot equivalent (TEU) unit terms rather than the actual number of containers. Most international containers are either 20 ft (1 TEU) or 40 ft (2 TEUs).</para>
<para>The Customs Container Examination Facilities operated five days per week up until July/August 2004, when the facilities commenced six days per week operations.</para>
<para>Container Examination Facilities in the ports of Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane operated for all of 2003/04. The Fremantle Container Examination Facility commenced operations in November 2003 and there was a 13 week ramp up period.</para>
<para>TEU inspected is comprised of containers x‑rayed where Customs has container x-ray systems (Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Fremantle) and containers physically examined in the other ports.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>Figures provided by the stevedores indicate that on average containers are delivered to the Container Examination Facilities around 43 hours from when the container is unloaded.</para>
<para>Once cargo arrives at the Container Examination Facility, an x-ray inspection and analysis of the resulting image takes around 10 minutes per TEU. A physical examination can usually be completed within a few hours, but may take 24 hours or longer depending on a range of factors such as the presence of fumigants in the container and the type of cargo.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>The following import container figures are for all other Australian ports through which import containers passed for the 2003/04 financial year.</para>
<para>Customs screens and risk assesses all cargo entering Australia. All high risk containers are physically examined by Customs.</para>
