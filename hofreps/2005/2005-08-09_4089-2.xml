<para>âOn 3 July 2005 I announced a number of changes to the ministry. Following the resignation of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the member for Gwydir, the Hon. John Anderson, the swearing in of the new ministers and parliamentary secretaries took place on 6 July 2005. For the information of honourable members, I table an updated list of the full ministry.</para>

<para class="block">I take the opportunity whilst on my feet to extend my congratulations to the member for Lyne, the new Leader of The Nationals and the new Deputy Prime Minister. I also extend my congratulations to the member for Wide Bay and the new Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Hon. Warren Truss, who has become the new Deputy Leader of The Nationals. I look forward to a continuation of the very close relationship between the Liberal and National parties, which has been a characteristic of the last 9Â½ years of highly successful coalition government.</para>
<para>I also inform the House that the Minister for Human Services will be absent from question time today and for the remainder of this week. He is on leave following the birth of his first child. I extend the congratulations of the House to Joe and his wife, Melissa, and to Xavier Augustus Babbage-Hockey on his very safe arrival.</para>

<para>âby leaveâOn a similar matter to that raised by the Prime Minister, I inform the House that on 24 June I announced changes to the shadow ministry. We are joined by two. I congratulate the one who is here and the other, who has just taken a seat in the Senate: Mr Tanner and Senator Anne Hurley. We are also very pleased to welcome back Nicola Roxon, who has become a mother. She was on leave when parliament last sat and is now well and truly back into the swing of things. I look forward to working with my colleagues intensely over the next 2Â½ years, holding this government accountable and then defeating it. I present an updated list of the shadow ministry.</para>

<para>âWith the indulgence of the House, I wish to say a few words about the tragic terrorist attack in London on 7 July. The details of this attack are well known to all Australians. I simply wish on behalf of the government, and I know on behalf of all members, to record our repugnance, horror and disgust at the nature of this attack. It claimed some 52 lives. Sadly, that death toll included the life of one Australian, Sam Ly. I will say something about that young man in a moment.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I did have the opportunity when I was in London to visit Gillian Hicks, who is tragically a double amputee as a result of the attackâa person who displayed, in my private conversation with her, tremendous spirit. She spoke warmly and enthusiastically about her pending marriage in December this year and of the love and support she had received from her English fiance and also her only sibling, her brother, who had travelled from Adelaide to be with her. I also met Louise Barry, who was on the bus at Tavistock Square. She spoke eloquently, if I can put it that way, about the experience. Both of them represent to me a reaffirmation of the tremendous spirit of Australians in situations of such adversity.</para>
<para>I would like to pay tribute to the resolve, the resilience and the strength of the British people and the Londoners, who responded in such characteristically gutsy fashion to this terrible attack. I did have the opportunity, because of my visit to London in July, to personally convey to the British Prime Minister the concern of Australians, our support, our sympathy and our sense of identification with the British people at that time. As the House will know, there is no city in the world, apart from our own, with which Australians feel a greater sense of identity, understanding and sympathy than the city of London. Most of us have travelled on the very underground rail system that was the subject of these disgraceful attacks.</para>
<para>This is not the time to have a lengthy debate on the issues of terrorism, except to remark that those who stand accused of this crime were British-born citizens. They were the children of immigrant parents. As the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper so poignantly put it in an analysis of the experience of Sam Lyâwhose parents were Vietnamese immigrants to Australiaâone young man, the child of immigrants in a new country, took a particular path, a positive path, which tragically ended in his death; others took a different path which ended in these destructive deeds. It does raise questions indeed about the argument that terrorism is in some way a product of social exclusion and loneliness in a new country.</para>
<para>On behalf of, I know, all Australians, I record my sympathy with and concern for the British people. I congratulate their emergency services, which were the subject of very laudatory comments from the two Australians I visited in hospital, for the very effective and powerful responses. Obviously at another time in another place there will be opportunities to debate the responses and so forth, but this is an occasion to express our close identification with the people of Great Britain and to express our sympathy to those Australians who suffered and to the relatives of Sam Ly, who was tragically killed in this cowardly attack.</para>

</talker>
<para>âOn your indulgence, Mr Speaker, I wish to speak on the same matter and to agree with the sentiments expressed by the Prime Minister and the remarks that he has just made. I think it is the case in this country that whenever there is an attack like this or an event like this in the United Kingdom, particularly in the city of London, very large numbers of Australians, me included, feel as though it is an attack on our family. We identify with our friends, kin and, in some cases, colleagues in Britain who go through and experience the horror of such an assault.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>London is a city which resonates in the minds of many Australians, both of older and younger generations, for the toughness it displayed during World War II. It has come to epitomise in the minds of many of us stoicism and courage. That stoicism and that courage were on full display in the aftermath of this fiendish attack on ordinary Londoners who were going about their business in the normal way, at peak hour going to work. It was not an attack on the elite, not an attack on political targets per se, but was an attack on the lives of ordinary Londoners. It was a cowardly attack, a vicious attack and one which renews our determination to resist the blandishments of the people who are followers of bin Ladenâs cult of death and evil and all the offshoots of it. I was immensely impressed with the remarks made by Tony Blair when he said in his immediate response to the attack:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Whatever they do, it is our determination that they will never succeed in destroying what we hold dear in this country and in other civilised nations throughout the world.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">His calm, his determination and his sense of being in control of the situation were deeply impressive to all of us who watched him.</para>
<para>Among the dead and casualties were some of our own. In a sense, for the reasons that I have already stated and that the Prime Minister stated, this is no surprise. There are something like a million Australians overseas, and very large numbers of them are in London. Were anything to happen in that city, the chances of Australians being caught up in it are very high indeed. Sam Ly, the Australian who diedâand our condolences go to his family and his friendsâwas very typical of these million Australians taking with them to the countries which they visit or in which they work that spirit of Australian independence of mind, that lovely egalitarian spirit and that desire to have a go. He epitomised that in his life, and his death is utterly tragic.</para>
<para>The injuries to Gillian Hicks and Louise Barry, mentioned by the Prime Minister, also conjure in us all the deepest sense of sympathy and horror. The brave spirit that they have shown in meeting their afflictions is also something that deeply impresses all of us.</para>
<para>The wife of our opposition spokesman on foreign affairs was in London at the time. Our spokesman went back to London on the day of the attack and was able to experience very first-hand that sense of stoicism and that spirit of defiance that were there in the British community. He was able to report on it very well to an Australian audience as he discussed that. All of us here saw those comments and empathised with them. He was able to very effectively represent, as indeed did the Prime Minister himself, the fact that Australia had a deep personal bond and shared an empathy with the British going through this horrendous attack.</para>
<para>What it does for us allâand I conclude on this; as the Prime Minister says, there will be other opportunities to debate thisâis make us absolutely determined that we get our responses to terror right. Our responses include an utter determination to defeat them. We comprehend that this is a sophisticated and complex war that requires a sophisticated and complex response. As we sit down and work our way through the consequences of this, we can take nothing for granted. We can assume nothing from what we might previously have thought to be intuitive approaches to people who have been longstanding in this community, for example. We have to get things absolutely right. Also, we are battened down for a long conflict. This is nothing that is going to be resolved anytime soon. But because it is long does not excuse mistakes. We have got to get absolutely everything right. Events like that in London just renew our determination to do that.</para>

<para>âMy question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission decision yesterday to give Australian parents a fairer deal, including the right to request up to two years unpaid leave to care for a new baby, up to eight weeks paid leave for new parents and part-time work until the child goes to school. Will the Prime Minister guarantee that these new rights will continue under his governmentâs extreme industrial relations changes?</para>

<para>âCan I say very directly in relation to the last part of the question that these changes are not extreme; they are the sensible next step along the path to securing more productivity for the future wage and salary earners of Australia. So far as the particulars of the IR Commission decision are concerned, we are examining them and, as the minister has indicated, our position will be reflected when the legislation is brought down.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Could I say a couple of things about the changes before the Leader of the Opposition and those who sit behind him get too carried away with the nature of the commissionâs decision. The commissionâs decision was notable for the fact that it gave people a right to ask for something. I would have thought it was a very odd industrial relations system that had to give people the right to ask for something. In a true flexible system, you ask for it; you are not conferred a right by some third party to do soâyou just ask for it.</para>
<para>The best way that I could categorise the decision of the IRC is that it represented a recognition that when it was all boiled down the question of whether people could properly enjoy such additional rights depended very much on an agreement to be concluded at the enterprise. That has been really the essence of the reforms that we have argued for. The reforms that we have argued for will provide greater flexibility.</para>
<para>The Leader of the Opposition seeks guarantees. I tell you what I will guarantee: I will guarantee that under our reforms real wages will continue to grow and that under our reforms unemployment will continue to fall. I will further guarantee that if you embrace the approach of the Leader of the Opposition the economic progress of the last 15 years will stall.</para>

<para>âI have seen claims, and they have come from the Leader of the Opposition and also from some of the spokesmen that sit behind him. The thrust of these claims basically is that over the last four years, since 11 September 2001, the government has not done enough to look to the national security of this country and by definition that if the Leader of the Opposition had been in charge of things everything would be better and we would all be a lot safer. He talks about âyawning gapsâ in our aviation security and he talks about us behaving as though we believed the threat was not real and should not be addressed.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Let me remind the House of what the government has done and let me remind the House of what the Labor Party, including the Leader of the Opposition, stopped us doing for two years. Let me remind the House that since September 11 the government has committed about $5.6 billion for robust and comprehensive national security measures. They include significantly increased resources for intelligence agencies, specialist police counter-terrorism units, new laws dealing with terrorism, enhanced Australian Defence Force tactical response capability, tighter aviation and maritime security, initiatives to protect critical infrastructure, and counter-terrorism building in our own region.</para>
<para>But even more relevant to the criticisms that the Leader of the Opposition has made, can I remind the Leader of the Opposition of something, particularly in light of his statement on 25 July 2005:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">â¦ it is the Opposition which has taken a wholly positive and constructive approach to whenever the Government has put up legislation enhancing the powers of ASIO and putting in place terrorist legislation.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">But let us look at the record. The government introduced a suite of legislation in parliament in July 2002, and it took almost two years before the opposition agreed to pass that legislation. For two years we were struggling to get the support of the Labor Party in the Senate to enact a necessary enhancement of ASIOâs powers. The Leader of the Opposition, in contrastâ</para>

<para>âHe says, âRubbish,â Mr Speaker. The Leader of the Opposition in fact voted in favour of delaying the legislation. What the government wanted to do was to give the Attorney-General the right to proscribe organisations. What was the weak response of the Labor Party? The weak response of the Labor Party was to say that the only organisations you could proscribe were those organisations proscribed by the United Nations Security Council. They said, âWe will guard our security according to assessments of the United Nations Security Council.â The oppositionâs âpositive and constructive approachâ saw that legislation amended in the Senate to remove the governmentâs power to list organisations like Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad group and Lashkar-e-Taiba.</para>

<para>âYou can interject as much as you like; it was the Labor Party that blocked our attempt to strengthen the powers of ASIO. Now the Leader of the Opposition has got the nerve to stand up in this place and say, âThe government have gone to sleep at the wheel.â You were trying to stop the wheel turningâthat is what the Leader of the Opposition was doing.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Do you know the irony of all this, Mr Speaker? The person who actually removed the road block was indeed the former but not very lamented member for Werriwa when he became the Leader of the Opposition and he and the member for Barton got together. The member for Barton knows that what I am saying is correct. They got together and they decided that this obstruction should end in the national interest. But for two years, with the support and the endorsement of the member for Brand, under the leadership of the member for Hotham, the Australian Labor Party blocked our attempts. So let us have no more of this opposition humbug that the government have gone to sleep on terrorism; it was the opposition that delayed legitimate attempts to strengthen the powers of ASIO, and the Australian people will not forget it.</para>

<para>âMy question is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Can the minister confirm that on 14 July a member of the public, wearing a backpack, gained unauthorised access to the tarmac at Sydney international airport through the perimeter fence? Didnât that person walk 300 metres and end up a few metres away from the planes before being challenged by a baggage handler, who used his personal mobile phone to ring and alert the security services? Minister, how many other breaches of security at Sydney airport have there been since the former minister said on 7 June that he would act immediately to fix the problems of airport security?</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for his question. The incident referred to by the honourable member has been canvassed significantly in the media, so of course his statement today comes as no surprise. The reality is that a member of the public did, on or about the date the honourable member has spoken about, cut through the fence on the perimeter of the Sydney airport. He was observed by the closed-circuit television system at the time, so his attempt to enter the airport was immediately identified. He was always under surveillance. I understand he was in custody within 14 minutes and at no stage did he threaten any aircraft or any of the personnel in that region.</para>

<para>âThere needs to be surveillance activities and there also needs to be a capacity to apprehend those people who do break through an early line. This is, in fact, an example of a security system actually working. When the person was identified, he was apprehended. That is, of course, what we expect to do. Police do not always stop people from speeding but, from time to time, they arrest those who do. In this particular instance, the man was clearly identified and apprehended. The government is taking a range of measures to improve security at Australian airports. There is already a significant level of security that is multifaceted.</para>

<para>âWe have also commissioned Sir John Wheeler to do an external review of the airport security arrangements around Australia. That review is quite well advanced. The government expects to receive a report from Sir John Wheeler within a month or so, and it will respond further to any recommendations which he makes. But in relation to the particular incident that the honourable member referred to, at no stage were any aircraft at risk. The gentleman concerned, I understand, is receiving medical assistance at the present time, but at no stage was any passenger or any aircraft at risk as a result of this ingress.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Greenway for that question. It touches upon the living standards of low- and middle-income Australians, and there is probably no person in this House who has a better sensitivity for their concerns and needs than the member for Greenway. The good news is that the mantra that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer is wrong according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. That is a mantra we have heard repeatedly from those who sit opposite, but the figures that came out last Friday are a stunning repudiation of that mantra. They are also a very strong endorsement of the social justice approach which has underlaid the policies of this government for the last 9Â½ years. What these figures disclose is that, over the period 1995 to 2003-04, the average household income in Australia grew by 20.7 per cent in real terms. This is adding wages, tax benefits and government transfer payments together so that you get a measurement of the real position of Australian households.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>What was really welcome about this finding was that the real incomes of low- and middle-income households increased by a proportionately greater amountâthat is, 22 per centâthan the real incomes of the richest households, which increased by 19.3 per cent over the same period: low- and middle-income households up by 22 per cent; rich households up by 19.3 per cent.</para>

<para>âHe says it is rubbish. We have got the trades hall statistician instead of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. It is not rubbish; it is reality. It is all of a piece with the findings of the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, presided over by Ann Harding, which showed again and again in successive surveys that, as a result of the policies of this government, the households that have benefited the most are the low- and middle-income households.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>It is all of a piece with the experience of the Australian public. I find that, as I go around this country, the Australian public know that the best friend the workers of Australia have ever had is the Howard government. The Australian people know that. I repeat that the proudest boast I had in the last election campaignâparticularly, but not only, in Western Sydneyâwas that under this government taxation has fallen, inflation has fallen, interest rates have fallen and wages have gone up. And now we have independent confirmation that the greater wage increases have, in fact, occurred in the lower income brackets.</para>
<para>Can I simply say to those who sit opposite and to other critics of the government that the facts are on the side of this government. We have been a friend of the Australian battler. We have been a friend of the Australian worker. We have lifted their living standards. Under us, real wages have risen by 14 per cent; under Labor, they rose by a miserable two per cent. Under us, the minimum wage has risen by 12 per cent in real terms; under Hawke and Keating, it fell by five per cent in real terms. The record and the facts are there. We are the friends of the Australian workers. We are not engaged in rhetoric for Australian workers; we actually deliver outcomes for their benefit.</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. Yesterday the Reserve Bank of Australia released its quarterly <inline font-style="italic">Statement on Monetary Policy</inline> and noted:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">... the economy continues to be characterised by a solid pace of growth ... and by strong labour market conditions.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Reserve Bank also noted that there was a âmild downturn now under wayâ in housing. This is something that I have been pointing forward to for quite some time. The Reserve Bank also noted:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Households now seem to have entered a phase in which they are consolidating their balance sheets ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Again, this is something to be welcomed. This is happening at a time when there are other factors supporting spending and activity. According to the Reserve Bank:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Employment has been expanding strongly ... contributing to growth in household incomes, as are the tax cuts that came into effect on 1 July.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">All members of the House will welcome the fact that, since we last met, every Australian income tax payer received a tax cut on 1 July this year. Of course, that was the tax cut which the Labor Party opposed. It believed that no-one should have a tax cut on 1 July. Whilst I am on my feet, I will say that, as far as I know, the Australian Labor Party has not changed its policy, which means that, according to the policy of the Australian Labor Party, tax rates today should be higher and people should hand back the tax cuts that they got in the month of July. This is from the Leader of the Opposition who brought you the policy beginning with ârââthe policy of rollback.</para>
<para>The Reserve Bankâs report on the Australian economy is consistent with the governmentâs own view that the economy will continue to grow in a sustainable way and that it is marked by low inflation. Of course, if we can keep inflation lowâwithin the two to three per cent band which the government has set by agreement with the Reserve Bankâit will mean a continuation of the low interest rate regime which has been so beneficial to Australiaâs families. It does not mean that the government can rest on its laurels; there is still more economic reform to be done. This is the government that intends to do it. We say to the Australian Labor Party: if it is serious about getting credibility on economic matters, support this governmentâs reform agenda.</para>

<para>âThat is a big point from the member for Grayndler, one of Laborâs intellectualsâand we wish the new member for Marrickville good luck in the preselection battles that are going on in New South Wales. Unfair dismissals, a litigious solution, do inhibit employment intentionsâthat is, if people believe that they can be subject to very capricious legal action which is time consuming and expensive, they tend to be conservative in their employment intentions. This is not just a view that is held by this government; this is a view which has been reported on by the OECD and the IMF, and I notice that there was a report over the weekend from Access Economics which was commissioned by the Business Council of Australia. Unemployment is now at a 30-year low in Australia. It is probably at the lowest that we will see in cyclical terms, which is a 30-year low. If we want to take unemployment lower in this country, we need structural reform. We need to get rid of job-destroying, capricious legal actions. We need to give small business a go. This is the side of the House that believes in economic reform.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Mallee for his question. A lot of constituents in the electorate of Mallee have made significant contributions to the export effort in the last 12 months. In 2004-05 Australia recorded a new export record level, with $162.3 billion worth of exports going out of Australia. That has never been achieved before in Australiaâs history. Bear in mind that when we came to office in 1996 the figure was $99 billion. So, in the life of the coalition government, exports have gone from an annual figure of $99 billion to $162.3 billion. In the last year we have seen a 13 per cent increase in our exports. That has been to the significant credit of all the exporting businesses across Australia and the hundreds of thousands of people who are employed in that sector. During the year we saw record coal exports, record metal ores and minerals exports, record services exports, record numbers of tourists and record exports as far as educational services are concerned. We saw very strong growth in manufacturing exports and in rural exports, notwithstanding the difficult circumstances caused by the drought.</para>

<para>âThe important point to make is that we cannot just rest on our laurels on these export figures. We cannot just rest on our laurels and say, âWeâve reached this level.â We have to keep on driving the process of change. We have to continue to improve the economic circumstances in Australia so the productivity, the efficiency and the competitiveness of our exporting industries remain ahead of most of our major competitors.</para>

<para>We must remain ahead of our competitors across the world and this cannot be done without continuing the reform process. In the life of our government we have reformed the waterfront to the benefit of our exporting industries. Our exporting industries were also significant beneficiaries of the GST tax reforms. Those tax reforms took billions of dollars worth of taxes off the back of our exports. Today we are proposing new reforms in the area of workplace relations, specifically targeting the ability to make our exporting industries more competitive and more productive so they can better compete in the global marketplace and so we can continue to generate new and better paid jobs. These figures did not just happen; they came through a lot of hard work on our economy. They will not continue unless we are prepared to continue the pace of reform in the national interest.</para>

<para>âNever bank on a fair repetition of a quote from this side of the House by the mob who sit opposite. Let me simply say that the government has announced its policy, and that policy is to remove the unfair dismissal laws on up to 100. That will be legislated.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>While I am on my feet, can I just remind those who sit opposite of a few realities in relation to the effect of these unfair dismissal laws. These unfair dismissal laws are not some ancient Magna Carta right. They were introduced by Laurie Brereton in 1994 and they have in fact had the effect of destroyingânot producingâjobs. We want to change the unfair dismissal laws in the name of lifting employment.</para>
<para>We draw on the evidence of other countries. It is very interesting that those countries that have the lowest unemployment are those countries that have the less heavily regulated labour markets. Those that have the highest unemployment, such as Germany and France, are those that have the most heavily regulated labour markets. By abolishing the unfair dismissal laws in relation to firms with up to 100 employees, we will be generating jobs for small business and we will be removing the disincentive and intimidating effect of these laws.</para>
<para>I remind those who sit opposite that this has been a commitment of this government since 1995. We went to the 1996 election pledging to get rid of Laborâs unreasonable unfair dismissal laws and we believe the proposal to remove them on businesses of up to 100 employees strikes the right balance and will be of immense benefit to the small business men and women of Australia.</para>

We donât want more reform in this country. The industrial relations well is dry.â He quoted labour economist David Peetz in support of his proposition. I do not know David Peetz, but a very quick survey on this independent voice quoted by the member for Lilley finds that David Peetz, under the auspices of the ACTU, has been conducting research for the last 18 months into the experience and performance of union officials and delegates. A search of the <inline font-style="italic">Workers Online</inline> magazine finds that David Peetz is described as its resident bard who writes poems for <inline font-style="italic">Workers Online</inline>. He not only writes poems; it further emerges that David Peetz sings in the trade union choir.

<para>âMy question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister recall saying on Melbourne radio, in answer to a nurse who was concerned that she might lose her long service leave entitlement, that, âWell, thatâs not trueâ? Does the Prime Minister also recall saying on 4 August on Radio 3LO that, âLong service leave is going to be preserved, absolutely going to be preservedâ? Given that Victorian nurses get 26 weeks long service leave after 15 years of service under their award, which is double what is specified in Victorian legislation, will the Prime Minister guarantee Victorian nurses that their long service leave entitlement is âabsolutelyâ going to be preserved?</para>

<para>âI am not going to spoil you with a song today, Mr Speaker. I thank the member for Casey for his question and, if I may say so, the interest he personally shows in Australiaâs relations with Asia. I do not think there is any doubt that Australiaâs relationship with ASEAN is at a historic high. I amâand I know that the government as a whole isâparticularly delighted that Australia has been invited by ASEAN to participate in the East Asia Summit and to be present at the birth of what could turn out to be a dynamic East Asian community.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I do not think I could overstate the importance of this achievement. The first summit will be held on 14 December in Kuala Lumpur and will bring together the leaders of ASEAN, China, India, Korea, Japan and, of course, Australia and New Zealand. This East Asia Summit brings together the most dynamic economies in the world, with 49 per cent of the worldâs population and 21 per cent of global trade. It is an enormous step forward for this country to participate in our engagement with Asia through the East Asia Summit and to upgrade our relations with our own region in this way.</para>
<para>This, after all, has been a very significant period for our relations with Asia; it has been a historic period. We have begun negotiations on an ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand free trade agreement. We have had visits this year from the leaders of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam. We have seen a 49 per cent increase in our two-way trade with ASEAN over the last six years. Practical cooperationâin particular, in areas such as counter-terrorismâthrough our 11 memoranda of understanding and also a series of bilateral initiatives with our partners has been absolutely critical.</para>
<para>I notice that the Leader of the Opposition says we should do more with Asia in countering terrorism. He is clearly not aware of the establishment of the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation and not aware of the massive engagement we have not only with Indonesia but also with other countries of the region in assisting with counter-terrorism activities.</para>
<para>Let me conclude by making this point: the Labor Party and some of their fellow travellersâcommentators and some of their fellow travellers in the mediaâhave criticised this government for being too close to the United States of America, because they believe, amongst other things, that would damage our relations with Asia. That has been proven to be totally false. In a period when the Prime Minister was in Washington with President Bush, Condoleezza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney, consolidating the closest relationship Australia has ever had with the United States, we developed an initiative to get into the East Asia Summit which brought us closer than we have ever been to the East Asian community. If another political party could achieve that, I would be very surprised.</para>

Minister, doesnât the governmentâs minimum conditions standard provide four weeks annual leave and eight days sick leave, which is less than the five- to six-week annual leave entitlement in about 30 federal awards and less than the sick leave entitlement in more than 50 federal awards? Didnât the ministerâs spokesperson say on 15 July that they âdid not think drafters had worked out whether award conditions coming over and above the standard would be lostâ? Does the minister guarantee that employees on these awards will not have their conditions cut to the new minimum conditions standard?</para>

<para>âI presume the honourable member wants the answer to the question he asked. The award system will remain in place and those workers who choose, usually through their unions, to arrange their industrial affairs via the awards will continue to be able to do so. The reality is that workers have left awards in their droves because under both collective and individual agreements they are better off because they are able to negotiate a better outcome for themselves.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>We had some questions earlier about the decision of the Industrial Relations Commission in relation to the so-called family leave test case. This highlights the bizarre nature of the current system, the award system which the Labor Party wants to defend. In order to resolve a dispute you have to create one in the first place. That is what the Labor Party wants to defend. In order to get permission to go and talk to your employer, you have to go off under an ambit claim to the Industrial Relations Commission. This is the bizarre system which the honourable member seems to be defending.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Kooyong for his question. I can inform him and the House that over 725,000 Australian workplace agreements have been entered into by Australian workers since they were introduced in 1997. We know the Labor Party does not like this, but in the last 12 months alone 200,000 Australian workers have entered into Australian workplace agreements.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In fact, at present it is reported in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline>âin the Leader of the Oppositionâs home stateâthat one of the major utilities, one of the essential service providers in Western Australia, Western Power, is negotiating Australian workplace agreements. The managing director of Western Power, reported in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> this morning, said it is important for any business in a competitive environment to have the flexibility of Australian workplace agreements. This is interesting against the background of a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> of last Friday headed âScrapping AWAs âwould lose worker votesââ. The report says this:</para>
<quote>
<para>Heâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">this is the Leader of the Oppositionâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">said these peopleâmany from Laborâs old heartland in the western suburbs had signed Australian Workplace Agreements or were self-employed.</para>
<para>And Labor could not desert them by sticking to its policy of abolishing AWAs at the next election and then expect to receive their support.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Why would he lose their support? Because, on average, workers on Australian workplace agreements are better off by some 13 per cent than those on collective agreements. That is why he is concerned that his policy to scrap Australian workplace agreements would not be supported by the very people he would want to support him in the coming election.</para>
<para>What we have at present is the Leader of the Opposition trying to walk both sides of the road. On the one hand he is trying to say, âWeâll maintain our policy to scrap Australian workplace agreements,â but on the other hand he is trying to send a message to people who are on Australian workplace agreements, âNo, weâll leave them alone; we wonât scrap them.â The reality is that what the Australian Labor Party and the Leader of the Opposition want to do is to strangle Australian workplace agreements by stealth, the very thing which the Gallop government did in Western Australia when it won power in that state. This has antagonised not just the union movement but the Leader of the Oppositionâs own colleagues in the caucus. The President of the ACTU, Sharan Burrow, came out expressing her disquiet about the member for Brandâs flip-flopping over the issue. In fact, we have colleagues from the caucus reported as saying that they are getting edgy and that the Leader of the Opposition should adopt a black or white position on this issue, instead of vacillating in the way he is at present.</para>
<para>Where does this lead? It was interesting to note that the one person not invited to the union picnic day on Sunday by Unions NSW was the Leader of the Opposition. Where was the Leader of the Opposition on Sunday? There were reports that there was this lonely figure walking along the road between the Wharf Restaurant and Doyles in Sydneyâthe road leading to The Gap. That sums up the position of the Leader of the Opposition at present: no friends in the labour movement over this issue and increasing disquiet from his own caucus because, once again, we have this flip-flopping from the member for Brand.</para>

I made the point in my speech as well that the Queensland branch of the National Party and the Queensland government under Bjelke-Petersen were absolutely committed to workplace relations reform.

<para>âI thank the member for Hasluck for his question and his interest in the ongoing reform of the building and construction industry, an industry which he had some considerable personal experience in prior to coming to this parliament. This week the government will introduce into the parliament amendments to establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission, which will be charged with investigating and prosecuting unlawful conduct in the commercial building and construction industry. This is a key plank, a key response, to the findings of the Cole royal commission which found that the commercial building and construction industry in Australia was rife with unlawful and corrupt conduct, particularly in Western Australia, the state of the member for Hasluck, and also in Victoria. The rate of industrial disputation in the building industry is almost five times the national average of all industries, and it is even worse in Western Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We had the example just last week of the construction on the Perth to Mandurah railway project which was hit by industrial action when 200 CFMEU members all took sickies on the one day; the so-called âblue fluâ. This was not unexpected, because on 11 July, after a similar incident, Unions WA secretary, Dave Robinson, also commended such tactics saying:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We will consider every form of action and a lot of that, I can tell you, from now on will be quite creative.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In light of this quite clearly blatant industrial action by the CFMEU in Western Australia, we have a Western Australian state government, whose taxpayersâ money has an interest in this particular project, showing itself entirely incapable of addressing the unlawful and corrupt behaviour in that stateâs building industry. The industrial relations minister in Western Australia, Mr Kobelke, said on <inline font-style="italic">ABC Radio</inline>:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">There is a high level of disputation in the building and construction industry in Western Australia and that is something which we think should not be happening.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It should not be happening according to Mr Kobelke, but then when asked what he would do about it, this is what he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I certainly will be talking to the union to point out to them that this is not only causing disruptions to the industry it is really giving them a very, very bad name, and I think that should be of some concern to them.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It is also incumbent upon the union to look and see why these things are happening and hopefully they will have a change of heart so that these matters will not continue.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Here we have Mr Kobelke in Western Australia saying to Kevin Reynolds, âListen, mate, I think you should have a change of heart,â but saying to the CFMEU, which has donated $4.9 million to the Australian Labor Party, âCome on, mates, letâs just have a change of heart.â The reality is that this is a weak response once again from the Western Australian Labor Party. They know that change is needed to clean up the corruption and, in some cases, the criminal behaviour which occurs in this industry.</para>
<para>What has the Australian Labor Party done in relation to corruption in this industry? It opposed the Cole royal commission; it opposed the establishment of the building industry task force; it opposed the establishment of the Building and Construction Commission. At the last election we had a policy from the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand, to abolish the building industry task force. The reality is that this is a weak response from the ALP. It knows there is a problem. Only this government will do something to clean up, once and for all, the corrupt and criminal behaviour in the building and construction industry.</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question. He represents one of the significant airports in regional Australia and is therefore particularly interested in these sorts of issues. Last month, the former Minister for Transport and Regional Services and the Attorney-General announced a range of measures to tighten Australiaâs aviation security. The government has now set about the task of implementing those commitments.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Presently, 100 per cent of international checked baggage is screened to detect explosives and other dangerous devices, and we are taking steps to extend those measures to domestic airports. We are seeking to remove the legal impediments to the use of video surveillance devices which are not visible at airportsâbut with appropriate signage, of course. The criminal history of all those people who currently have aviation security identification cards is being reviewed, with a view to terminating the grandfathering arrangements which had existed under the previous safety regulations. We have committed $35 million to upgrading security arrangements at regional airports. Air site access is being significantly tightened, particularly for persons, goods and vehicles entering sensitive air site areas.</para>
<para>I am aware that this morning the member for Brisbane had some comments to make about the use of photo identification for people boarding aircraft. That is, of course, among the many issues that governments consider in looking at what are the most appropriate security measures to put in place. There are some doubts as to whether the compulsory use of photo identification on boarding would be a major advantage. It is interesting to note that the United States 9/11 commission report indicated that all but one of the terrorists involved in the 11 September events in the United States had state issued photo IDs, but that did not do anything to stop the perpetration of those outrageous events.</para>
<para>It is more important that we identify what people are carrying than that we identify who they actually are. That is why there has been such a significant emphasis placed on baggage and what people are carrying, and on ensuring that those who board aircraft are not carrying any of the devices that they might need to perpetrate an outrage similar to what we have seen in some other parts of the world.</para>
<para>The Sir John Wheeler review that I referred to earlier is looking at a wide range of airport security measures. We have not closed the door on any options. But we do need to have an appropriate balance between assuring peopleâs security on our public transport systems and enabling our economy to progress in a reasonably efficient way and ensure that people are able to move freely around this country to exercise their privileges as Australians.</para>

<para>âMy question is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Can the minister confirm that the Inspector of Transport Security, Mr Mick Palmer, has not yet returned to this $400,000 a year post and will not do so until September? Can he confirm that seven days after the London bombings the head of the Office of Transport Security, Mr Andrew Tongue, was removed from his position to sort out the mess at the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs? Can he also confirm that four of the five most senior positions in the transport security division of his department are now filled in an acting capacity only? Minister, shouldnât Australians be alert to and alarmed by this security shambles?</para>

<para>âThe honourable member for Brisbane is continuing the tradition of the Labor Party in failing to understand the role that Mr Palmer has in relation to aviation security. His job is to investigate significant incidents that have occurred; he is not there to oversight the day-to-day aviation security arrangements. There are 250 other people in the department who take that responsibility very seriously. That is their job; they are doing it effectively. If there were to be an incident which required Mr Palmer to undertake an investigation, he would be called back to undertake that kind of investigation. There is not a requirement for that at present. The current arrangements are appropriate for the current circumstances.</para>

<para>âMr Speaker, my question goes to the question of the right of reply of absent members when they are criticised. The Prime Minister, in the course of an answer, launched a stinging attack on the report of the joint intelligence committee and its role in requiring amendments to the governmentâs unfair security legislation. The chairman of that committee, the member for Fadden, is absent. I wonder what procedures the standing orders might provide for him to respond on his return.</para>

It seems terribly archaic that the House refuses to embrace technological advances that can enhance the way the public can participate in Australian democracy, which is ridiculous in the 21st century. I ask the Speaker to advise when the House is likely to enter the 21st century and join the Senate in accepting petitions electronically.</para>

<para>âIt has been an extraordinary question time in which we saw the new Deputy Prime Minister of this nation repudiated outright by his Prime Minister on the first question he answered from this side of the House. Contrary to the Prime Ministerâs interpretation, the Deputy Prime Minister was not confirming what he had said to the National Party gathering. He was confirming the minimum conditions that he said would be protectedâand they are: four weeks annual leave; personal and carers leave; parental leave, including maternity leave; maximum ordinary working hours of 38 hours per week; public holidays; meal breaks and smokosâby the legislation of the Commonwealth government. That was the National Party position. That is what he said in this place, and the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will show that record unless it is doctored between now and when the greens become available to the general public. All of us here heard that. That was the guarantee as far as the Deputy Prime Minister was concerned. The Prime Minister then got to his feet and attempted to interpret that as a positive answer to the fact that he had said something like that, as opposed to actually giving that commitment in this House. The Prime Minister did what he has done to just about everybody who has tried to give some degree of definition in this debate: he slapped him downâjust as he slapped down his Treasurer and just as he slapped down those who have come out and pointed out things which might, from time to time, be seen by the Prime Minister to be inconvenient for him.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Let us understand one thing absolutely here: no guarantee has been given by the Prime Minister or the minister to the minimum conditions which are laid down now in awards in the industrial system. Therefore, all we have to go on in this place is what the Prime Minister has had to say about the minimum standards that he is prepared to protect and what we know of the minimum standards that exist now. If the Prime Minister wants an answer as to why Australian workers, unionised and non-unionised, are turning out in their thousands now around this country at meetings I have been to, meetings my colleagues are going to and many other meetings and informal discussionsâtalk about barbeque stoppers; the attack on the wages of ordinary Australians is the barbeque stopper par excellenceâlet me do a comparison taking ordinary Australian workers, those who build this nation and create the families that sustain a future for us. What they fear is that the difference between award conditions and minimum standards means nurses, for example, could lose up to 33 per cent of their pay, or $18,688 per year. Restaurant workers could have wages cut by up to 20 per cent, or $7,052 per year. Hotel receptionists could lose up to $9,037 per year. Tradespersons such as electricians could have a pay cut of up to 16 per cent, including the loss of payments for supervising and specialist qualifications. Cleaners could lose up to 27 per cent or $9,686 per year, including rest and meal breaks.</para>
<para>This is a collapse of Australian standards of living. It will oblige, of course, those workers to struggle in some other way to ensure that they get back what they have lost in order to keep paying their mortgages, to keep paying for the necessities of life and to keep their children at independent schools, if that is where they can manage to send them at this point in time. Basically, all the things that sustain family life are bound up in the sets of conditions that now apply in awards that have been obtained through collective agreements, which are now protected as irreducible minimums below which a worker cannot be paid legally. This is a critical issue for ordinary Australians.</para>
<para>It was also interesting in question time today that, for the first time, the government attempted to present an economic rationale for this. There is no economic rationale. This is not about efficiencies in the workplace; this is about lowering wages. This is not about improving productivity. That, by the way, is collapsing under this government because, as the Reserve Bank and the OECD know, the only way you are going to get a substantial increase in productivity in our work force is by addressing the issue of skills, which this government has shamefully neglected, and the blockages to production in our infrastructure and by encouraging again innovation in our businessesâan encouragement stripped away by this government in its early budgets. That is how you will increase productivity in the work force. All you will do with the governmentâs measures is to cut wages. You will increase the profit share but you will not automatically increase productivity as a result of doing that.</para>
<para>It is no surprise that the people of this country should be mystified by this, because this represents a piece of opportunism and arrogance on the part of this government that was not foreshadowed in anything this government had to say during the last election campaign. The community is absolutely transfixed by what the government intends to do, because what it intends to do had not the slightest foreshadowing in the course of the last election campaign. There was nothing said in the last election campaign about an intention to change average weekly work hours. There was nothing said about the view that four weeks annual leave was up for grabs. There was nothing said about award conditions above the standard being removed. There was nothing said about what might happen to meal breaks or that lunch would be a luxury. There was nothing said about eliminating penalty rates in relation to public holidays or about knocking over shift rates. There was nothing said about state IR systems being overridden. And there was nothing said in the last election campaign about what would happen in relation to unfair dismissalsâthat a situation would emerge where there would be a suggestion that the application of unfair dismissals to businesses employing under 20 people would be lifted to 100.</para>
<para>Given what this government is now proposing, the Australian people are entitled to believe that during the last election campaign they were deeply, deeply misled. They demand an answer from the government guaranteeing them that those things that they did not expect are not going to happen. They demand that answer from the government. The Prime Minister tried to make an economic argument, as I mentioned a little earlierâbut this, as I said, was the first time he has done that. What he said at the Liberal Party national conferenceâwhich, by the way, repudiated him on all of thisâwas that his rationale for what he intended to do was not a matter of economic necessity in this country or a matter of significance with regard to the efficiencies of industry; he said it was an article of faith. That was the Prime Ministerâs defenceâand indeed it is.</para>
<para>The Prime Ministerâs statement, and all that we have had to hear from him since then, is of a piece with his obsession since the day he entered federal politics, an obsession best and most violently summarised by him back in 1992. When he was invited to speculate on whether or not he would stab the Industrial Relations Commission in the back he said, âNo; when we get into office we will stab the IRC in the stomach.â It was an extraordinarily violent allusion to a longstanding institution of this nation but an absolutely authentic representation of the obsession and extremism underlying what the government intend to do about industrial relations policy. It was an absolutely authentic representation of the sheer extremism of the Prime Ministerâs position.</para>
<para>From time to time in his arguments on industrial relations, the Prime Minister conjures an image of the world which may have had some level of resonance in the 1970s but which has absolutely no resonance now. It has no resonance now, because of simple decisions taken by the Australian work force in the 1980s and 1990s that they would undergo a process of structural reform that would substantially increase the productivity of our work force, that would lift the profit share in return for additional investment in innovative change in Australian industry through one industry plan after another.</para>
<para>The Australian work force, with their employers and with the government at the time, decided Australia needed to change. They understood that by going over to a system of enterprise collective bargaining, by making changes in the structure of the work force, Australia would remain competitive with the region around us and that through that process of reform Australia would be able to participate in and benefit from the international economy. We knew that a nation of 20 million on its own would never provide the economic circumstances that would permit growing prosperity for the people of this nation. We understood that absolutely at the time. The Australian work force understood that and they delivered change. They were prepared to sacrifice some levels of their security; they were prepared to make changes to move to a different form of collective agreementâthey were prepared to do all those things. It is as though the Prime Minister slept through it all. It is as though he is the Rip Van Winkle of Australian politics. He woke up in 1996 and said, âWell, things are as they were in the 1970s, so I am going to act accordingly.â</para>
<para>But the Prime Minister said something else in 1996, which he is not saying now. As he wheedled his way into office in 1996, the Prime Minister gave an absolute guarantee that no Australian worker would be worse off. He and his minister will now find any formulation but that. That is the one thing he will not say about the situation that confronts Australians nowâbecause he knows, deceitfully, that he does not have to. He has the power in the Senate and he has 2Â½ years to put it all in place. He will sweat blood and he will wade through mud up to his neck to get through that ambition that he has always had for Australian industrial relations. That ambition is to shift the balance crucially against the position of the ordinary Australian wage earner; to eliminate from the work force and from any role in the labour market at all, as far as conceivably possible, organised labourâthe trade unions; and to stab in the stomach the Industrial Relations Commission and eliminate it from its classic role in conciliation and arbitration. He has this chance now and he will not miss it.</para>
<para>What we saw in question time today were the essential first stages of his manoeuvring around the issue, his characteristic misleading in answers, his half-truths and all the rest of itâhis utter refusal to give guarantees on anything, and the slapping down of any of his ministers who might get up and deviate from that line, who might create for the Prime Minister the slightest degree of embarrassment. Our news for the Prime Minister is this: we are on to you. Our news to the Prime Minister is that we know what he is up to. We are going to expose it around this country and we will deal with it. No amount of his mealy-mouthed arguments, or those of his spokesman in this matter, is going to conceal from the Australian public what is aimed at themâand we will defeat you at the next election on this. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âNothing demonstrates more the time warp that the Australian Labor Party is caught in than that performance from the Leader of the Opposition. Had we been gathered here in 1996, when we were debating the Workplace Relations Act, we would have heard the same rhetoric from the Leader of the Opposition. Nothing has changed in terms of the Australian Labor Partyâs opposition to every incremental change in industrial relations that will bring about a better outcome for the people of Australia. What we heard today from the Leader of the Opposition are the very same sorts of words, the same statements, that we heard in this place nine years ago, in 1996.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>What has happened since then? There are 1.6 million extra jobs in Australia or 10 million Australians employedâthe most Australians employed ever in this country. Real wages have gone up by 14 per cent compared to just 1.2 per cent under the previous 13 years of the Labor government. The ordinary working men and women of Australia know that this government is one which has protected them and their conditions over the past nine years. No amount of windbaggery and no amount of rhetoric from the Leader of the Opposition will change for one moment the fact that Australians are better off today than they were in 1996.</para>
<para>The Australian Labor Party and the ACTUâthe labour movementâwant to claim today the benefits of those changes. You hear Mr Combet out on the hustings saying: âWell, everythingâs going well in Australia. Weâve got more people in jobs. Weâve got higher real wages. Weâve got lower levels of industrial disputation. Weâve got interest rates a far cry from where they were, the 17 and 18 per cent that home loan mortgage payers were paying some 15 years ago. Weâve got inflation roughly in that band which the Reserve Bank regards as acceptable.â We hear this from the ACTU and the Australian Labor Party, claiming credit for the economic position we are in today. Yet what they do not say is that they fought tooth and nail against every reform that was made by this government to bring about those conditions. That is the reality that is facing Australia.</para>
<para>What the Labor Party said in 1996 is what they are saying now. Let me quote from Stephen Smith, the member for Perth. The Labor Partyâs industrial relations spokesperson said in this House on 17 October 1995:</para>
<quote>
<para>The Howard model is quite simple. It is all about lower wages; it is about worse conditions; it is about a massive rise in industrial disputation; it is about the abolition of safety nets; and it is about pushing down or abolishing minimum standards. As a worker, you may have lots of doubts about the things that you might lose, but you can be absolutely sure of one thing: John Howard will reduce your living standards.</para>

<para>âAbsolutely pathetic, as the member for Macquarie reminds me. In contrast to that, real wages over the last nine years in Australia have gone up by some 14 per cent. The changes which the Labor Party objected to on every occasionâwhich they voted against on every occasion, in this place and in the Senateâbrought about the economic reform that has led to the position that Australians are in today. That is what happened. That is the record of this government in looking after the conditions of ordinary Australians.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Not only do we have the Labor Party now wanting to claim the benefit; what they are also saying is that the well of industrial relations reform is empty or, as the Leader of the Opposition puts it, the lemon has been squeezed dry. If we do not look to the future challenges facing Australia then we will not be able to guarantee the living standards of Australians in the future. Had we not done what we did in 1996, 1997 and 1998 then we would not be in the position that we are in today. What I can guarantee is what the Prime Minister said today: I can guarantee that if we do not make some further sensible reform then we will go backwards relative to those countries which we are competing against.</para>
<para>Let us look at the situation we are facing. We live in an increasingly competitive global environment, and that relates particularly to two things which are important to Australia. It relates to how we attract investments to Australiaâwhether the major companies in the world put their manufacturing plants in Australia or China, Malaysia or India. Those are decisions which they look at in terms of the total economic framework of the country, including the industrial relations framework. If they do not see that this is a country where they can obtain productivity compared to other countries then those investments will be going to other countries around the world rather than to Australia. That is one of the challenges that we face in this country at the present time.</para>
<para>The second challenge relates to that; it concerns our exports. If we are not able to compete in the export markets against other countries around the world then we will not be able to provide jobs for Australians. So on two bases we have challenges which we must face in this country in terms of looking to our future. Standing still in Australia at the present time is not an option for us. If we stand still, we in this country will go backwards relative to other countries.</para>

<para>âThe reality, as Australians know, is that no other country in the world owes us in Australia our standard of living. We have to obtain that for ourselves. If we want to continue to obtain investment in this country, if we want to be able to export and have export industries which are competitive, part of addressing those future challenges is to ensure that we have a more flexible workplace relations system than we have at the present time.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Another challenge facing Australia is the ageing of the population and the fact that that means that the net growth of the work force in this country will contract over the next 10 or 15 years. That contraction is happening now, because of the massive demographic change which is occurring in this country. We read every day about skill shortages in different parts of the country. We know that in some parts of the country there already are general labour force shortages. That we have been able to rely for the past five or six decades on population growth as a major factor in economic growth is not going to be the case in the future. The net growth in the Australian work force is currently about 170,000 people per year. It is estimated that for the entire decade from 2020 to 2030 the net growth in the Australian work force will be just 125,000 people. In other words, net growth goes from a current figure of about 170,000 people per year down to an average of 12,000 to 13,000 per year for each and every year of the decade from 2020 to 2030 in Australia. That does not just suddenly happen on New Yearâs Eve in 2020; it is starting to happen now.</para>
<para>The compounding effects of the ageing of the population are ones which we must address in this country. It has been pointed out to us in the <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational report</inline>, by the Productivity Commission in a recent report, by the OECD when looking at Australia and by the Governor of the Reserve Bankâall of these bodies and entities are saying that these are the challenges which are facing us in Australia. If we are going to be a responsible national government, we have to make some changes to ensure that we meet those challenges in the future. Standing still is not a choice for Australia if we want to retain the standard of living that we have at this present time. That is why this government is proposing some further, sensible, balanced, incremental changes to the Australian workplace relations system.</para>
<para>Could I remind the House that these changes first started under the Keating government back in the early 1990sâand they were objected to by the labour movement then. Many will remember that famous meeting in the Sydney Town Hall when Laurie Brereton, the then Labor Minister for Industrial Relations, was shouted down by the union movement because he dared to suggest that we move away from the old award system to a new agreement-making system. It was opposed by the labour movement when the Labor Party was in government in 1993, and it was opposed again by the labour movement in 1996 when we in government brought in the Workplace Relations Act. They said then that it would do all the things that the Leader of the Opposition is saying todayâthat it would strip away all the entitlements and living standards of Australians. They are opposed again nowâI suppose they are consistentâwhen we say that, if we are going to meet these challenges for the future, if we are going to set up the economy of Australia to ensure that we have the standard of living that we enjoy today and to ensure that our children in the future have that standard of living, then we need to make some further incremental changes in relation to the industrial relations system. Why? Because we need to rely on further productivity growth.</para>
<para>There is a clear correlation between workplace flexibility and productivity growth. Very briefly, those industries which have the most workplace flexibility also have the highest productivity growth. Take an industry like the mining and resources sector, an industry that has to compete on the global stage or overseas companies and entities will buy their coal, bauxite, aluminium and iron ore from other places. We have to be competitive. In that industry we have a more flexible workplace relations system, one which has adopted, for example, individual Australian workplace agreements and has achieved the highest productivity. Coincidentallyâand you would never imagine this from what the Labor Party is sayingâthat industry also has the best wages and conditions for workers. Take another industry like communications. Again, it has more flexible workplace relations, higher productivity and better wages and conditions for the people who work in it.</para>
<para>Conversely, those industries that are still locked into the old award system, the award system we are seeing defended by the Australian Labor Party, have the lowest productivity and the least beneficial outcomes in terms of wages and conditions for those who are under that system. What are the Labor Party defending? They are defending an award system created over 100 years ago for the conditions of the 1890s in Australia.</para>

</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>In the last 24 hours we have heard from the Labor Party something about the family leave test case. It is a situation in which the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has said that under an award you can have permission to ask your employer for some more leave when you have a child. Under an agreement you can do that nowâunder a collective agreement you can ask that and under an individual agreement you can ask that.</para>
<para>The Labor Party is defending this 100-year-old system established in the early 1900s for the conditions of the 1890s. This is a party which, as I said at the outset, is caught in a time warp. It is caught in a time warp of defending a century-old system rather than looking at the challenges of the future that we are facing in this country. If there was ever a party that has been lazy in terms of policy development, it is the Australian Labor Party. Election after election we see a party opposite which believes it has some sort of automatic entitlement to be elected to run this country. The reality is that, if you do not have policies and you are not prepared to do the hard policy work and look at the challenges facing Australia, you will not be elected by the Australian people to govern this country. That is the reality facing the Labor Party. Yet here we have, once again, the Leader of the Opposition rehashing a speech which he could have given, and probably did give in similar terms, in 1995 and 1996.</para>
<para>The Australian Labor Party still has on its books a platform which would take industrial relations back prior to even some of the changes which were introduced by the Keating government in the early 1990s. The Australian Labor Party has a platform which would take us backwards by over 10 to 15 years in terms of the way in which the industrial relations system works in Australia. In contrast to that, we are taking a further, sensible, incremental step forward in industrial relations. At the end of these changes we will not have deregulated the labour market in Australia; we will still have a more regulated labour market in Australia than many of our competitor countries around the world. It is telling that those countries that have taken some further deregulation have lower levels of unemployment than we do in Australia and those that still stick to an inflexible system have higher levels of unemployment.</para>
<para>There is a very good, decent, proper and appropriate economic case for making these further reforms. It is one which the Australian Labor Party have their heads in the sand about. They are caught in a time warp. We are not going to join them in that time warp; we are going to move ahead in a responsible way, because that is the only way that we can ensure that Australians in the future will have the living standards that they want.</para>

<para>âThe Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations will be one person who will be wanting some unfair dismissal protection, because we have the minister-in-waiting here, the member for Goldstein! He has been brought in to provide a bit of protection. We know the government wants to get rid of unfair dismissal legislation. This minister will be the first person who will be wanting to reintroduce those protections when the member for Goldstein comes on down, stops providing protection from the backbench and of course takes this ministerâs job. The minister has been found wanting. How long has he had the job? The minister has had the job for merely eight months, and already he has had to bring in some backup from the backbench. He has had to bring in a little backup from the member for Goldstein to make sure that the governmentâs job is done.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Today in question time we saw extraordinary division at the highest level of this government between the Prime Minister and the new Deputy Prime Minister. Minister Vaile, in his first question time as Deputy Prime Minister, was asked whether or not he would guarantee that all of these conditions would be protected. We know all of these conditions are very important to the Australian work force: four weeks annual leave; personal and carers leave; parental leave, including maternity leave; maximum ordinary working hours of 38 hours a week; public holidays; meal breaks; and smokos. The Deputy Prime Minister was asked: will you guarantee all those conditions? He gave a very simple answer; he said yes. We have been trying to get that answer from the Prime Minister and from the minister at the table, the member for Menzies. Maybe the member for Goldstein will agree with the Deputy Prime Minister. You never know your luck! The member for Goldstein might come on down and make the same commitment that we had from the Deputy Prime Minister.</para>
<para>However, the commitment from the Deputy Prime Minister did not last very long, because his boss, the Prime Minister, jumped up straightaway and said: âNo, no, no. That wasnât the question that he was answering. No, my position is there wonât be any guarantee. There wonât be any guarantee to Australian workers who want to have their conditions protected, because I, the Prime Minister, am not prepared to give that guarantee.â The Prime Minister will not guarantee that no Australian will be worse off as a result of these changes. The minister at the table will not give the guarantee that no Australian worker will be worse off as a result of these radical and extreme changes that this government is intent on legislating. And why is it that they will not give that guarantee? It is for one reason and one reason alone: they know that Australian workers will, in fact, be worse off.</para>
<para>And there was more extraordinary division at the highest level of the government in question time today. We asked the Treasurer whether or not he was sticking by his view that anyone could be subject to unfair dismissal legislation. We heard, during the break, that the Treasurer could not see why there was any magic in the number 100. Why should it be that only businesses larger than 100 should be subject to unfair dismissal legislation? He obviously thinks that everybody should be free to be dismissed for whatever reason the boss thinks up. The Treasurer did not repudiate that for one minute today. He stuck to his guns that unfair dismissals should be able to be applied to anybody in the work force. But once again the Prime Minister came in immediately after the Treasurer and said, âNo, the Treasurerâs got it wrong.â It is not only the Deputy Prime Minister who has got it wrong; the Treasurer has got it wrong, and the Prime Minister will have his wayâfor now at least. So there have been extraordinary divisions at the highest level of the government, and the Deputy Prime Minister, in his first day on the job in this House, has made a real hash of it.</para>
<para>The Prime Minister likes to go on public radio and say one thing and then, when he is pinged on his answers in here, he does not like to give the same reply. When the Prime Minister was on the radio in Melbourne a few days ago, he was answering a question from a nurse. The nurses in Victoria are very worried about what this government has in mind for them, because they have very decent long service leave provisions that recognise the very hard work that they do in our hospitals. A nurse rang up and wanted to know whether or not these good and, it is true, over-the-award provisions would be protected by the Prime Ministerâs radical changes. The Prime Minister said to this nurse, while he was on the radio that long service leave is going to be preserved, âabsolutely going to be preservedâ.</para>
<para>I am sure the nurse is somebody who is inclined to believe what the Prime Minister says to her on the radio. She is probably a very decent human being. She probably believed exactly what the Prime Minister was saying to her when he said âabsolutely going to be preservedâ. You would think that if the Prime Minister said that to you then all of your long service leave was going to be preserved. We asked the Prime Minister in question time today: is he going to preserve the long service leave provisions of nurses in Victoria? Did he give a guarantee to preserve those conditions? Not on your nelly! There was no guarantee from this Prime Ministerâand every nurse in Victoria should know itâthat their long service leave provisions will be protected. What will that mean for those nurses? It will mean that they are going to have to work longer and harder before they are entitled to the same amount of long service leave. They will be working harder, they will be working longer, before they get the long service leave that they are currently entitled to, because we know that this government is intent on cutting their long service leave provisions.</para>
<para>We had another question today in question time which also goes to this point of many awards having conditions that are over and above the standard. The member for Lowe asked a questionâ</para>

<para>âA very good question which I hope at least some members of the government realise applies to some very important workers in our community. Take firefighters, for example. These people are out there protecting us in the community. They often have longer leave provisions because it is the case that they work pretty unfriendly hours. There are many different types of people who do not just get the standard four weeks annual leave; they might get five to six weeks of annual leave entitlements, and I gather this happens in about 30 federal awards.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>There are 30 federal awards around the country where people get higher annual leave entitlements than the bare minimum of four weeks. The question to the government is: will these people who are getting five to six weeks annual leave, so higher than the minimum, get that protected? The minister at the tableâs spokesperson said that they had not figured out the answer to that question yetâthey do not know. Maybe the member for Goldstein knows. Maybe the real minister knows whether or not firefighters and police officers are going to lose some of their annual leave entitlements. Maybe the member for Goldstein could answer that, given that the minister does not know the answer. Maybe we will ask the member for Goldstein and he will give us an answer about whether all of these very important members of our community are going to have their industrial conditions reduced. That is what this is all about. They too will have to work longer and harder protecting all of us in the community because this government will not protect their industrial conditions.</para>
<para>We have a Prime Minister who is very out of touch with the reality of ordinary, daily family life. He is extraordinarily out of touch. He has been here for nine long years, during which he has become very out of touch with the needs of ordinary Australian families. Plainly, neither the minister nor the Prime Ministerâand obviously not the Deputy Prime Ministerâcan understand the daily struggle that so many working families have to make sure that they can hold down a job and balance their work and family responsibilities. That is what the Australian people are worried about. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âBefore we rose for the break there was an MPI very similar to this, so we find ourselves with a sense of deja vu. We have to ask the question: why is this MPI being brought on today? All you have to do is look at what has happened in the background in the ALP over the last few days and weeks to get an answer to the motivation for why these sorts of MPIs are brought in. There was a stunt last week when the state ministers asked for a guarantee. They had pressure from the union movement. They were muscling up to the member for Brand and saying: âYou go in there and fight against this government. Otherwise, your position will be at stake.â</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As reported yesterday in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, we have a caucus where concerned Labor MPs are planning to question the Leader of the Opposition, to make him accountable to the caucus over the fact that he was starting to soften the ALPâs line against the governmentâs industrial relations changes. This is particularly the case against individual workplace contracts. So we have a Leader of the Opposition who is under siege. He is under siege in terms of not making any traction with the community and he is under siege from members of the caucus and the union movement. We know that this is all about politics. Greg Combet conceded that. He actually stated that this is purely political. He argued that we need a change of government. The ACTU is not interested in helping workers reap the benefits that will flow from this governmentâs industrial relations changes.</para>
<para>The ALP are in trouble and are calling upon stunts, as they always do. The former Leader of the Opposition made a similar plea in the lead-up to the last election, signing blank corflutes saying, âI pledge and guarantee such and such.â These guarantees are worthless and they know it. They have been the masters of guarantees, going all the way back to Bob Hawkeâs disgraceful guarantee that took place in the 1980s. We have an opposition that have given up. They have given up on Australian workers and turned a blind eye to the reforms and the benefits from the reforms that have taken place in this country under this coalition government. We have a Leader of the Opposition who is saying that the âlemon has been squeezed dryâ. The Leader of the Opposition really does not know what he stands for. Is it any wonder that the Australian public does not know what he stands for?</para>
<para>There was the accusation made by the Leader of the Opposition that we somehow hoodwinked the Australian public at the last election by not announcing some of the industrial relations changes that we are now espousing. There is one thing about the Australian public: they have always known what the workplace relations agenda of this government would be. They have always known what we stand for. What they have not known is what the ALP stand for. How could they possibly know when you have a Leader of the Opposition who constantly vacillates between one position and the other? They say that the âlemon has been squeezed dryâ and there are no more reforms that we can enter into; yet all of a sudden they start to modify their position and espouse some sort of reform agenda.</para>
<para>We have a Leader of the Opposition who said that the GST should be rolled back. Then he changed his mind. We have a Leader of the Opposition who said that AWAs should be abolished. Then he changed his mind. But, under pressure from the union movement in the last few days, he is starting to change his mind again and say, âNo, we will keep AWAs but we will fight for the protection of collective agreements.â We know one thing about collective agreements, which is that the ALPâs position on them will be the death of AWAs, and they know that. We do not know what the opposition stands for, but the Australian public have always known what we stand for. More importantly, they have seen the results of our reforms over the last 9Â½ years. They have seen that there have been real wage increases and that there have been benefits to the average Australian worker over those last 9Â½ years.</para>
<para>The position of the government on a lot of these things has been endorsed by the IRCâs decision yesterday. The IRCâs decision on the family balance case reinforced the notion of an employee making a request and an employer considering that request. One of the considerations by the employer would be on a business case: is it affordable for the business? In other words, we have a requestâa negotiation, a considerationâthat takes place at the grassroots level between the employee and the employer. This is essentially what our industrial relations changes are all about. They are about empowering the people at the coalface to enter into Australian workplace agreements if they choose and about having a number of allowable matters protected through legislation. This is a fair system which will achieve considerable benefits for the Australian worker.</para>
<para>Labor are totally confused on their position. We saw this as recently as a few weeks ago when the member for Perth said in a very boastful way that Labor are the inheritors of Paul Keatingâs legacy. If that is the caseâif Labor are the inheritors of Paul Keatingâs legacyâthen why are they also trying to roll back some of the changes that Paul Keating introduced back in those days? Let me quote the then Prime Minister from a speech he gave to the Institute of Company Directors in 1993. This is what he said about awards and about his changes:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It is a model under which compulsorily arbitrated awards ... would be there only as a safety net.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Over time the safety net would inevitably become simpler. We would have fewer awards, with fewer clauses.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Now the member for Perth, Stephen Smith, wants to unwind not only the governmentâs reforms but also those of former Prime Minister Paul Keating. How can the member for Perth or the Labor Party claim any credit for reform when they are intent on rolling back the very reforms that the previous Labor government introduced in this country? They do not know what they stand for and they do not know what their position is. As each day goes by, it is also becoming evident that the Labor Party, in opposition, are being led all the way to the picnic days by the union movement. We know that the union movement will be coming to Canberra this week, and the opposition leader needs to show some muscle. He needs to show some guts and, unfortunately, he has not got any.</para>
<para>The ALP are looking for guarantees. The best guarantee that the Australian worker has is past performance. The member for Griffith knows that past performance is a great indicator. We have seen it on economic grounds and we have had it verified by the RBA, which said yesterday:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Employment has been expanding strongly, which is contributing to growth in household incomes, as are the tax cuts that came into effect on 1 July.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The RBA went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... while the growth of domestic demand in Australia has eased this year, the economy continues to be characterised by a solid pace of growth in non-farm output and by strong labour market conditions.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Those strong labour market conditions have given us real wage increases of 14 per cent, compared to less than two per cent under the ALP. They have given us unemployment rates of around five per cent, compared to over eight per cent under the ALP. We have seen 1.6 million new jobs, and a job is the best guarantee a person has of their prosperity. The best guarantee is the right to work. We have seen participation rates increase under this government and we have also seen other great indicators that the Treasurer has been the steward of, such as interest rates and inflation being kept not only in check but at record low levels. Unemployment is at a record low level for the last 29 years.</para>
<para>The Leader of the Opposition says that this governmentâs policy is about cutting wages. That is not true; we have seen historically that that is not the case. He accuses us of hoodwinking the community at the last election. This is not true. The community have always understood what we stand for; they just do not know what the opposition stand for. The Leader of the Opposition has also said that the reforms of the 1980s and 1990s have made Australia a different society today than we were, meaning there is no need for these reforms. That, to me, is a Leader of the Opposition who has given up. He has given up. He is basically saying that what we achieved in the eighties and nineties means that we do not have to do this any more. That is reform fatigue, and the opposition should get out of the way. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para class="block">I present the fourth report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD under section 102.1A of the Criminal Code Act 1995. In this report the committee reviewed the relistings of seven proscribed terrorist organisations, namely, Ansar al-Islam, Asbat al-Ansar, the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, the Islamic Army of Aden, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. These organisations were initially proscribed under the Criminal Code in 2003. Subsection 102.1(3) of the code provides that these regulations cease to have effect after two years. However, section 102.1A states that the committee may review relistings and report its findings and recommendations to the parliament. In this report, the committee decided to concentrate on the procedure and criteria for listing an organisation.</para>
<para>Overall, the committee was satisfied with the relisting process. The committee was pleased to receive unclassified statements of reasons from ASIO outlining why it felt each organisation should be relisted and it was satisfied that the government was developing a more efficient and comprehensive process of listing terrorist organisations. However, the committee was concerned that the states and territories received only one weekâs notice for the relisting of Ansar al-Islam and only one dayâs notice for the relisting of the Islamic Army of Aden. Under subclause 3.4(6) of the intergovernmental agreement on counter-terrorism laws, the government is required to give the states and territories reasonable time to consider their response to a proposed listing. In response, the Attorney-Generalâs Department has submitted that it intends to give more notice for future listings. The committee would like to note that it was pleased that, for the other five organisations, the states and territories were given about three weeks to consider the relistings.</para>
<para>Furthermore, in its report <inline font-style="italic">Review of the listing of six terrorist organisations</inline>, the committee recommended that the Attorney-Generalâs Department conduct community consultation on listings. The committee notes that community consultations were not held on these relistings, but it would encourage the department to implement this recommendation.</para>
<para>Moreover, in its report on the listing of the al-Zarqawi network as a terrorist organisation, the committee noted that DFATâs input on the listing was still âsomewhat inadequateâ. The committee is disappointed to have to report that DFAT âdoes not appear to have provided substantive inputâ on the seven relistings. The department was requested to provide assessments of the foreign policy implications of the relistings on the strategic circumstances in which the organisations operate and any information relating to Australiaâs obligations to the United Nations on particular organisations. However, its submissions were not sufficiently detailed to be particularly useful.</para>
<para>The committee was pleased to receive greater detail on ASIOâs evaluation criteria for selecting organisations for listing. Nonetheless, the committee would still appreciate more details on organisationsâ links and potential threat to Australia in future listings. In particular, the committee understands that a terrorist attack could damage Australian interests overseas, but it would also like more information on how organisations present a direct threat to Australia domestically. In addition, the committee believes that ASIO must take care to address all its own criteria for listing in the statements of reason.</para>
<para>The committee is grateful for the input of government agencies and members of the public into these reviews and it hopes that there will continue to be constructive debate on the matter. Notwithstanding any of the above concerns, the committee does not recommend to the parliament that any of these regulations be disallowed. I commend the report to the House.</para>

<para>These personal income tax cuts were announced in the federal budget this year. They cut personal income tax for all Australian taxpayers. They are worth $21.7 billion over the next four years. These tax cuts will assist low-income earners, encourage participation and increase the international competitiveness of Australiaâs personal income tax system. They cut the rate at the lower end of the income scale from 17c to 15c and they increase the thresholds for the higher marginal tax rates to come inâwith the top threshold going to $125,000âfrom 1 July 2006. The opposition has opposed these tax cuts. The opposition believes that no tax cuts should take effect on 1 July 2005.</para>

<para>âThe Australian Labor Party has moved amendments which would mean that no taxpayer would get a tax cut from 1 July 2005. The Australian Labor Party takes that view because it claimed that, if taxes were cut on 1 July 2005, interest rates would go up. That is what it claimed on budget night.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Now, of course, we have passed 1 July 2005. As every Australian knows, they received a tax cut from 1 July 2005. The reason they received a tax cut from 1 July 2005 was that the Commissioner of Taxation published withholding schedules showing the amount to be withheld, on the basis that these tax cuts became law. Those withholding schedules could have been disallowed by the Senate, but the Australian Labor Party never actually moved the disallowance motion before 30 June.</para>
<para>I might go on and say that the Australian Labor Party never actually announced that it would support the withholding schedules; in fact, it determined not to determine a position. With the effluxion of time, the withholding schedules were not disallowed and employers in Australia were therefore able to operate on the basis of the withholding schedules from 1 July. Therefore the tax cuts took effect on 1 July and now, by rejecting these amendments and sending them back to the Senate, the parliament will validate the legislative basis for the tax cut which has already been paid.</para>
<para>Without going through the merits of these tax cuts again, if the House were to accept these amendments it would mean taxpayers paying back tax cuts they received on 1 July 2005. These tax cuts, which employers have already put in place, have been in place now for 40 daysâ$350 million in tax cuts have now been delivered. If the House were to accept these amendments, taxpayers would have to pay an additional $350 million back to the Commissioner of Taxation to refund the tax cuts that have taken effect on 1 July. If the Labor Party gets up and insists on these amendments, it is insisting on a tax hike of $350 million from 1 July until todayâs date, because that would be the effect of passing these amendments. Plainly the amendments are nonsensical. Plainly no-one in their right mind would accept them. Plainly the House should reject them, and plainly the Senate, when they are returned, should validate the legislation and validate the tax cut which has already taken effect and has now been in place for 40 days.</para>

<para>âThese tax cuts are now destined to pass the Senate despite the fact that the economy and individual taxpayers would have benefited much more from Laborâs positive, constructive alternative, which was put in this House and in the Senate and found majority support in the other house. In the Treasurerâs rush to buy votes in the Liberal party room, a massive opportunity was lost. A massive opportunity to deliver a fairer and more internationally competitive tax system was simply squandered.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Howard government would like to pretend that these tax cuts are real reform. They are not. When tax reform is done correctly it can create wealth. It can encourage work and it can act as a vehicle for fairness and as a vehicle for aspiration. On both counts Laborâs package was massively superior to that which was put forward by the government.</para>
<para>The government produced a package that simply put wealth redistribution before wealth creation. As I said in this House before, this was a Sheriff of Nottingham package. It massively redistributed tax cuts to the top, left the great mass of the work force out of the equation altogether and squandered an opportunity to do something about participation. We are constantly lectured in this House about the three Ps. With participation, with Laborâs package, we could have delivered a massive boost to this economyâthe sort of boost, by the way, Treasurer, that has been called for by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, by the OECD and by the BCA because we had a massively superior package to yours.</para>
<para>We acknowledged that marginal rates are too high across the board, but especially for low- and middle-income earners, who were completely dudded in your package. They are the same people that you are lining up to remove their unfair dismissal laws altogether and to massively attack their take-home pay when it comes to penalty rates. You have low- and middle-income earners in your sights. You have hit them once with the tax package and you are now about to hit them with your extreme industrial relations package. The great bulk of workers that make up middle Australia are carrying an even greater tax burden and are penalised very heavily when they work overtime by the Treasurerâs tax proposalsâ</para>

<para>âand those trying to move from welfare to work still face very high effective marginal tax rates, as high as 80c in every additional dollar. So we have no effort in this package to do something about effective marginal tax rates, no effort in this package to do something about simplifying the tax system and its complexityâ9,000 pages of the tax act is the Treasurerâs legacy to this countryâand no real attempt at reform at all.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>What is the outcome of that? The outcome is that the burden on low- and middle-income earners in this country is rising. They are facing higher amounts of tax than they faced in 1996. Even with these tax rates the average tax rate for someone on average earnings will increase from 22.5 per cent to 22.7 per cent. The average tax rate for someone on half the average wage will increase from 12.9 per cent to 15.3 per cent. What does that add up to? Someone on the average wage will pay just over $100 a year more in tax than if the average tax rate on their income in 1996 applied. Someone on half the average wage will pay almost $700 a year more tax than if the average tax rate on their income in 1996 applied. These figures simply blow away the claims that this Treasurer has to be a great supporter of the working class or a friend of the worker. If you throw in the changes to the industrial relations system, what you see is the continual attack on the living standards of low- and middle-income earners.</para>
<para>Of course, that is before you get to the participation challenge. The public record will show Labor proposed a genuine tax reform package that did seek to tackle the participation challenge. There was no effort by the government to target reductions in marginal tax rates for those whose participation would respond the most. The analysis by the Melbourne Institute of Laborâs tax proposal showed that it not only delivered more tax relief for all but the highest income earners but also would have encouraged 75 per cent more Australians into the labour market than the governmentâs plan: that is 75 per cent more Australiansâ78,000 in totalâmany from welfare to work, including 81 per cent more sole parents and a massive 121 per cent more single males than the governmentâs proposal. The analysis of the Melbourne Institute also shows that Laborâs package would have delivered double the increase in the average hours worked compared to the governmentâs package. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI would like to indicate to the House that the government proposes that amendments (3), (5) and (8) be agreed to, and that amendments (1), (2), (4), (6), (7) and (9) be disagreed to. I suggest, therefore, that it may suit the convenience of the House first to consider amendments (3), (5) and (8) and when those amendments have been disposed of to consider amendments (1), (2), (4), (6), (7) and (9).

<para class="block">This afternoon we will be reconsidering <inline ref="R2286">Border Protection Legislation Amendment (Deterrence of Illegal Foreign Fishing) Bill 2005</inline>, which has been amended by the Senate since it was last considered by the House in March. Unfortunately, the majority of these amendments detract from the primary purpose of the bill. The main aim of the bill is to provide greater consistency between the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984 and to amend these acts to mirror certain provisions in the Migration Act 1958 so that suspected illegal foreign fishermen can smoothly move from fisheries to immigration detention.</para>
<para>In its original form, the bill enabled fishermen awaiting prosecution or repatriation to be housed in the same land based facility, regardless of whether they were in fisheries or immigration detention. It removed the need for the fishermen to be moved to new accommodation once fisheries detention had ceased. This facilitated the quick transferal of fishermen from their boats into a land based detention facility as soon as they arrived in an Australian port.</para>
<para>The use of a single detention facility requires consistent administrative, security and staffing arrangements to guarantee the safety and welfare of detainees, staff and visitors. As members will be aware, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, DIMIA, currently uses a private contractor to operate its network of immigration detention facilities. The contract staff, who undertake immigration detention duties, are appointed as officers under the Migration Act 1958. In order for a joint facility to be operated successfully, the bill must allow contract staff to undertake fisheries detention duties by mirroring the relevant provisions of the Migration Act 1958. The majority of the amendments made by the Senate in June are aimed at removing the possibility of appointing and authorising contract staff under fisheries legislation.</para>
<para>If a consistent framework cannot be established, a single facility will not be able to operate. The costs associated with running two separate facilities with different staffing arrangements are highly prohibitive. It is for these reasons that the government will not be accepting Senate amendments (1), (2), (4), (6), (7) and (9).</para>

<para>âI agree with the parliamentary secretary; it is plain commonsense. However, I am pleased to advise the House that the Australian government will be accepting Senate amendments (3) and (8). These amendments were suggested by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee in their report of May 2005.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The amendments propose that officers or detention officers can only be authorised under the fisheries legislation after they have successfully completed minimum training requirements as prescribed by a legislative instrument. The government have always intended that officers would be trained in the use of these powers before authorisation. However, we are happy to include safeguards in the legislation that will guarantee that high standards of training will always be required of authorised officers.</para>
<para>Senate amendment (5) redrafts the requirement that facilities for obtaining legal advice are made available to all detainees while they are in fisheries detention. The original bill had always ensured that all detainees had the right to request access to reasonable facilities for obtaining legal advice. It was also mandatory to inform people in fisheries detention of their right to request access to legal advice if they were to be questioned in relation to a suspected offence. In practice, AFMA already informs all fisheries detainees in their own language of this right upon their arrival in an Australian port. The government accepts Senate amendment (5) as it is evident that the existing practice will satisfy the legislative requirement.</para>
<para>The passage of the Border Protection Legislation Amendment (Deterrence of Illegal Foreign Fishing) Bill 2005 is an important step in the development of fair apprehension and detention policy for dealing with suspected illegal foreign fishermen. It is essential that it be passed in a form that allows long-term, effective detention arrangements to be implemented. I urge the support of the House.</para>

<para>âThe opposition have made their position on Senate amendments (3), (5) and (8) to the <inline ref="R2286">Border Protection Legislation Amendment (Deterrence of Illegal Foreign Fishing) Bill 2005</inline> known in previous debate. We are very pleased that these amendments that were proposed in the Senate and that received the assent of the Senate have been agreed to by the government. In these very substantive matters relating to the detention of illegal fishers in our exclusive economic zone, it is very important that we have proper debate in this House and the other place on matters of considerable substance and concern to the Australian people.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In the spirit of cooperation with the government on these matters, we looked for the common groundâthe common ground that would enable the intent of the legislation to be effected and the border security arrangements that the government was attempting to put in place to come into effect. We did this because, simply, the government had failed in the overall task of deterring illegal fishers, and we thought it was necessary to engage debate and strengthen this particular legislation so that we got from this parliament the best outcome for the Australian people. The simple fact of the matter is that the government has had a tag and release policy with regard to illegal fishers in our exclusive economic zone, particularly in northern Australia.</para>

<para>âThe honourable member for Lingiari will no doubt point this out in debate on the matter in the House. This is a government that talks big on border security. But, when it came to actually putting into effect some good, strong measures to deter illegal fishers, we found that not only were the borders leaking like a sieve but the government had virtually a tag and release policy with regard to illegal fishing.</para>

<para>The government is spending $1 billion on a war in Iraq. Many people in this House would debate whether that contributes to the security of Australians in any shape or form. But what happens when it comes to resourcing a very vital task in protecting important fisheries resources? It is not only in Australiaâs economic interests to protect the resource but also in our international interest to protect it and give effect to the responsibilities that we have assumed in the international arena in this regard.</para>
<para>I am particularly pleased that the government has sought to agree to these amendments, which relate to the training of officers. Wherever possible, where broader coercive powers of detention and seizure have been given to officers of the Commonwealth, we have sought to make sure that the officers are properly trained. It is extremely important that, as far as training is concerned, we have the best quality outcome for these personnel.</para>
<para>We know what happens when things go wrong in this area. In the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of 30 July 2005, the headline is âDetention centre contractor guilty of abuse: study details mistreatmentâ. The contractor in that particular episode is GSL, and we will have more to say about that in debate on the amendments that will come up for consideration in detail in this debate.</para>
<para>We welcome the governmentâs acceptance of the training amendments that we put before the Senate and that were passed by the Senate. We also welcome its acceptance of the amendment relating to disclosing detaineesâ rights to them, an amendment moved by the Democrats in the other place.</para>

<para class="block">There is an urgent need to implement long-term land based arrangements for detaining the increasing number of suspected illegal foreign fishermen who are being apprehended in our northern waters. This is a problem that is not going to go away and is one that requires firm and decisive action on the part of the parliament to support the governmentâs strong policy of deterrenceâa message that will be delivered very forcefully to foreign fishermen who think that in both a commercial and environmental sense they can damage, and even devastate, our local fisheries and industry.</para>
<para>As I said in my earlier speech on other Senate amendments to the <inline ref="R2286">Border Protection Legislation Amendment (Deterrence of Illegal Foreign Fishing) Bill 2005</inline>, the bill is essential to establish the framework to allow us to make the necessary changes to fisheries detention arrangements. It will allow for suspected illegal foreign fishermen to be safely housed in a land based detention facility whilst they await prosecution or repatriation. It will also provide for a smooth transition between fisheries and immigration detention.</para>
<para>The majority of the amendments discussed today would have detracted from Australiaâs ability to efficiently and effectively implement land based detention arrangements for suspected illegal foreign fishermen. To reiterate my earlier contribution, the government supports only Senate amendments (3), (5) and (8). They will, firstly, guarantee that authorised officers have undertaken appropriate training and, secondly, slightly amend the provisions to provide a person in fisheries detention with access to facilities for obtaining legal advice. I am confident that, if the House adopts the legislative framework submitted to it by the government and created by this bill, we will have the best way of implementing better arrangements for the detention of suspected illegal foreign fishermen.</para>

<para>âWe on this side of the House are particularly disappointed that the government has not picked up on the other amendments that were passed by the Senate. Those amendments related to the employment of contractors and their employees and the legal powers that they will assume as authorised officers under this legislation. This is a particularly contentious area of the bill and Labor were hopeful that the government would accept in good faith the arguments that we on this side of the House proposed in this regard. The opposition hold a longstanding view that only Commonwealth employees ought to have these significant powers.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In the broad, we are dealing with illegal fishers in Australiaâs exclusive economic zone. This is an area of some 16,000 square kilometres. There are 30,000 kilometres of coastline and some 12,000 islands in that zone. It is in our economic interest to make sure that this area is correctly policed and that the laws that we have in placeâthat this House puts in place on behalf of the Australian peopleâadequately protect that economic interest and give effect to the international responsibilities that Australia has assumed for its exclusive economic zone.</para>
<para>The proposals that the minister is not happy to accept relate to the strengthening of the powers of fisheries officers to detain and investigate suspected illegal fishers and extending those powers to contractors and their employees. We ought to remind the government of the dangers of its proposal in this legislation and ask the minister, even at this late stage, to reconsider the governmentâs position. At this point in time, the opposition are prepared to accept a broadening of these powers where they are enforced by AFMA officers or officers of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, but we are not prepared to accept the proposition that these powers be extended to contractors to the government and contractorsâ employees under a delegated authority from the minister. We are not talking here about insignificant powers. These are powers to conduct strip searches of detainees without the need to obtain a warrant. The bill also provides some immunity from legal action in respect of anything done in the course of implementing these laws as long as it was done in good faith.</para>
<para>A contractor or his or her employee who is not trained to the level that we would hope they would be, even with the measures that we are putting in place in this legislation, may act in what they consider to be good faith and do some things that are not acceptable to the Australian people. I would have thought that, in its wisdom, the government would have accepted the position of the other chamber: that, in the exercising of these powers, it is prepared to give extended powers to authorised Commonwealth officers but it is not preparedâand this House ought not be preparedâto extend those powers to contractors.</para>
<para>Minister, in my previous contribution to debate in this House I pointed out to you where your own policy had failed in this regard. According to this report, GSL Ltd, which presumably will be up to its ears in these contractual arrangements, was guilty of a very serious breach of contract provisions. GSL was the detention centre contractor that formed the basis of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> article. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThe government will not accept an amendment to the bill that removes the capacity for the government to employ private contractors as fisheries detention officers for the very simple reason that to do so would mean establishing an on-land detention regime parallel to the immigration detention facilities that are already in place. It is not real world. The shadow minister should know that it would be prohibitively expensive. It is not financially viable. Moreover, it is not sensible public policy for the opposition to introduce immigration issues into this debate and to blur the issue of fisheries detention and deterrents.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The opposition are either serious about border protection issues or they are not. This is a phoney issue and a backdoor way to attack the government on immigration issues when we are dealing with fisheries detention. Let us not kid ourselves. Let us strip away the facade of respectability the shadow minister is attempting to build around his argument that contractors should not be used in fisheries detention. The simple fact is that the opposition know very well that, if they occupied the Treasury benches, on both an expense and a policy basis they would not run two separate land-based detention facilities. Whatever concerns and issues you have about GSLâand you have introduced as something of giveaway the point of your opposition to the governmentâs billâtake it up in another forum in another way but approach this issue of fisheries detention more sensibly and practically. The government believes that there is no philosophical justification and certainly no financial one for accepting the Senate amendments, which would mean in practical terms that we would run two detention systems in this country.</para>

<para>âI am disappointed that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has taken that view. Indeed, I would have thought that in this legislation we are attempting to get some sort of seamless administration in this area between fisheries detention and immigration detention. But I take issue with the point that he has made about running two systems and it being prohibitively expensive. This is the government that wasted some $200 million on a Pacific solution. Minister, that argument does not cut ice on the floor of this House. If you are serious about border protection, which you claim you are, you have to do better than a tag-and-release policy of administrative detention while at the same time claiming that you are addressing a significant issue of border protection on behalf of the Australian people.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I mention GSL as an illustrative point, and I think it is a valid one. I think it is a portent of what we can expect in the long term from these particular arrangements. All the opposition is attempting to do here in this debate is to avoid the sort of situation that, I would have thought, has been illustrated by the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of 30 July 2005, which I mentioned earlier, where a detention centre contractor was guilty of abuse. Minister, it does not stop there. We go to the immigration area, which is indeed the substance of this billâstandardising seamless procedures between fisheries and immigration detention arrangements. Another article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Age</inline> of 20 February 2005 is titled, âBaxter guards âdid nothingâ to halt beatingâ. This is the great private contractor nirvana that you are trying to put before this House. Quite simply, the arrangements that you have put in place in the past in the immigration area have failed. We are gravely suspicious that, in this particular instance, even though the government has accepted the training amendments, your heart is not really in it. Basically what you are going to do is to handpass this very important task to private contractors and then give them quite extensive powers to strip search people and also give them very broad coercive seizure and detention powers. We think that it is fitting and proper for this parliament to put in place measures that protect detainees, if you likeâand that is not the whole objective of it; it is to protect the Commonwealth from the excesses that can occur from zealots who may take the law into their own hands in particular instances. I am particularly disappointed with the fact that the government has not seen fit to adopt the particular amendments which have been referred to in the schedule and by the minister and which have been passed by the House. I do believe that some of my colleagues will have something to say on those measures too.</para>

<para>âIt is ironic that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry said that Labor was introducing immigration issues to the debate, given that the government titles this piece of legislation <inline ref="R2286">Border Protection Legislation Amendment (Deterrence of Illegal Foreign Fishing) Bill 2005</inline>. Indeed it has produced no evidence at all to back up the ministerâs assertion that the governmentâs proposed arrangements represent a cheaper option. The fact is that this is a government which has outsourced public accountability. First we had the outsourcing of accountability and responsibility from ministers to the Public Service, and here we have the outsourcing of accountability and responsibility from the Public Service to contractors. Passing the buck and passing the blame have been elevated to new heights under the Howard government. The culture of blame shifting and passing the buck is particularly acute in relation to border protection, thanks to the culture nurtured in the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs over many years by its former minister, Mr Ruddock, and defended to the hilt by his successor, Senator Vanstone. The fact that the Palmer report blew the lid off this failed area of Howard government administration, though, has had no ramifications for the very ministers who presided over it, and in recent years the increasingly out-of-touch Howard government has always passed the buck, no matter how obviously or incontrovertibly the buck should have stopped with the minister.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Has there been accountability or responsibility? No, the secretary to the department has been packed off to a senior diplomatic post. The Immigration secretary made a hash of it so he became the ambassador to Jakarta! It makes you wonder how this government would have treated him if he had done the job well. All of this brings me to the governmentâs insistence that this bill allows for the authorisation of contractors as detention officers and its opposition to Senate amendments (1), (2), (4), (6), (7) and (9). This is another example of the Howard government outsourcing blame and outsourcing accountability.</para>
<para>Even if the Palmer report found that department of immigration staff were inadequately trained, at least immigration officers operate under the Public Service Act and under the governance structure of the Australian Public Service. At the end of the day, public servants remain accountable through the framework of ministerial responsibility to this parliament. But the Howard government knows very well that if things start to go pear-shaped it is far better to fling your arms up in the air and say, âNo; it wasnât us.â That is what contracting out is all about. The record of the Howard governmentâs contracting out in relation to detention was strongly questioned by the Palmer report, which questioned the quality of the service provided by Global Solutions Ltd under the $300 million contract with the government to run six detention centres. The Auditor-General also criticised the governmentâs failure to set out key responsibilities in the contract with GSL. In the first Audit Office report of 2005-06, the Auditor-General said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... the Contract does not adequately specify key responsibilities that are to be met, either by DIMIA or GSL. In particular, clear and consistent definitions are not provided for health standards that are central to detainee welfare. For example; Duty of Care, and the specific obligations for a subcontractor supplying psychological services are not consistent with the departmentâs Immigration Detention Standards. The audit found that the Contract does not clearly specify mechanisms for the ongoing monitoring of subcontractor arrangements, for compliance with intended outcomes.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The new Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs seems to be realising belatedly that the contracting-out pioneered under her predecessor has been a disaster. She was reported by the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> on 31 July as being outraged at the latest blunder, which was that horror road trip during which five detainees were denied food, water and toilet access on a journey from Maribyrnong detention centre in Victoria to Baxter detention centre in South Australia. It was absolutely scandalous.</para>
<para>I understand the governmentâs contract with GSL is under review, as well it should be. Yet, while these mistakes of the past are fresh, here we have today the government proposing to embark on yet another risky bout of outsourcing. This bill creates a new class of officer who may exercise powers related to fisheries detention. It will allow employees and contractors of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority and the department of immigration to exercise detention powers. Under clause 3 of schedule 1 of this bill the minister may appoint persons or a class of person to be detention officers. Under the bill this class of persons may include private contractors as well as public servants. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âIf there were any doubts whatsoever that this was a concerted political campaign by the opposition they have just been blown away by the shadow minister for human services and public accountabilityâs contribution. And the thing about the shadow minister for agriculture and member for Corio is that he thinks that industry is stupid. The fisheries industry will read this <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. They will see the concocted political attack of the opposition for what it is. It is unrelated to the efficient operation of the fisheries in which they have a vital stakeâcommercial not least of allâand you are doing yourself enormous damage. That is why the opposition shadow ministers do not make headway with the business organisations and constituencies they represent, because they do not take a commercial viewpoint on these issues. Anybody reading the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>âbecause no-one will be listening to this debateâwill see your words for what they are. You bowl up some obscure shadow minister for human services to attack the governmentâand even to attack Senator Vanstoneâand the whole contribution is about immigration, a rehashing of issues related to immigration et cetera. Industry will want to know how long it is before they get hit with the cost of a dual detention system, as Labor proposes. Labor wants a dual system of onshore detention facilities and sooner or later industry will believe, rightly or wrongly, that the cost will filter down to them.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Now let us deal with the issue of the contractors. When contractors are appointed as detention officers they are required, obviously, to act within the bounds of their legislative duties and within the terms of their contract. They are not free agents, as is suggested by the opposition. Contractors will not be given the full powers of fisheries officers. For example, they will not be undertaking wider border protection activities. Detention officers will be given training and special authorisation by AFMA before they can exercise certain powers such as searching and screening of detainees. If a detention officer behaves inappropriately, their duties could be reduced, the minister could revoke their appointment or prevent that person from working in a facility. The application of these measures to fisheries detention will mean that the contractors will be working under strict controls and in line with government policy and direction. This is an ideological and political point that the opposition is attempting to make at potential cost to the fishing industry. It is absurd for the opposition to turn this into a debate and an argument on immigration when it is one dealing with fisheries deterrence and detention only. I express my revulsion at the politicisation of this issue by the opposition.</para>

<para>âWe are trying to do the government a favour. We are trying to save it from itself and from repeating the mistakes it has made so recently. Let me point out for the ministerâs benefit that the provisions of the <inline ref="R2286">Border Protection Legislation Amendment (Deterrence of Illegal Foreign Fishing) Bill 2005</inline> will authorise detention officers not only to detain people but also to have authority to move and search a detainee, conduct strip searches, screen detainees and conduct identification testsâa recipe for the same sorts of the debacles that we have seen so recently in relation to Maribyrnong and Baxter.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The employment relationship between the Australian government and contractors is as a third party. It will be an arms-length relationship. We saw a similar attempt last year in the agriculture, fisheries and forestry bill amendment to grant powers as quarantine officers to contractors and their employees. However, unlike this bill, in the AFFA bill there was an important recognition that Public Service style accountability was required for the exercise of these important functions. We saw those provisions in that bill; but in this bill there is no such reference to the Australian Public Service code of conduct, despite the serious law enforcement style powers that will be carried out by contract detention officers. Instead, as evidence to the Senate committee inquiry revealed, a code of conduct that the current DIMIA contractor, GSL Australia, has in place will be relied on. This is not a public document, which hardly inspires confidence.</para>
<para>If we had attempts by the Fisheries Management Authority to uphold this code of conduct for contract detention officers, AFMA would have to sue the contractor for breach of contract in the courts and, if the contracting company itself subcontracted for staff to fill the positions as detention officers, the government would then have to rely on the breaching of two contracts. This would be expensive and time consuming. It would create a significant disincentive to uphold similar standards to the Australian Public Service code of conduct in all but the most significant and politically sensitive breaches. Public servants are much more easily made accountable. Breaches of the Australian Public Service code of conduct can easily be investigated and disciplinary or termination measures taken without the need to initiate and succeed in expensive legal processes through the courts.</para>
<para>In addition, we have no role for the Public Service Commissioner or the Merit Protection Commissioner and a lack of any real capacity to uphold the standards of the Australian Public Service code of conduct. This is the Howard government setting up a workplace culture to fail. And, if it does fail, how are we supposed to find out? There does not seem to have been any consideration given to whistleblower protection for contractors. Again, there is a different mechanism for contract detention officers from what there would be if those officers were public servants. Public servants have a level of security and protection against pressure to act corruptly but, under this bill, there will be no protection for an individual who is put under pressure to misuse their powers. And, if a contractor does misuse their powers, there is no statutory accountability framework to apply to the situation.</para>
<para>Granting law enforcement powers to individuals who are not Australian government employees, not operating under the Public Service Act, not operating under the Public Service code of conduct and not operating under Australian Public Service values is highly problematic for many reasons but particularly because it is about the political motive of this government to shift accountability and blame. What will be the implications when a controversy emerges about one of these cases in the future? Is the government going to take responsibility and accept that it has required the contractor to uphold the same professional standards of operations that are required of public servants or will the hands go up again saying, âNo, it wasnât usââit is the Sergeant Schultz defenceââI know nothing.â Based on the track record of this government, you would have to expect the latter.</para>

<para>âI am not going to repeat all the arguments that my colleagues have enumerated but I will emphasise one or two of them. There is absolutely no doubt in my view that the minister has got it wrong. He is arguing about us creating a dual system. In fact, I was under the impression that you were creating a dual system, because what you are setting up are detention facilities not for illegal immigrants but for fishermen who have breached Australian laws. It seems to me that what we are setting up is a system which, quite seriously, needs to be treated differently from immigration. In any event, we know that the quarantine service operates in such a way that quarantine officers, the people who will be boarding these vessels inevitably, are employees of the Commonwealth. We do not outsource the quarantine arrangements. Why should we outsource these detention arrangements?</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I ask the minister this: what has been the arrangement hitherto? Who has been in charge of the detention of people who have been caught prior to today and prior to the passage of this legislation? What has been the situation in Gove Harbour, for example, that would see six, seven or eight people who have been detained for illegal fishing get in their boat, start the motor up and shunt out of the harbour? Who was responsible for that, Minister? Who was responsible for the numbers of detainees who have been kept on vessels in the Darwin Harbour for lengthy periods of time without appropriate services? Who was responsible for that, Minister? We know that two people detained in this way died. Minister, I am not ascribing their deaths to maltreatment by anyone, but it is significant that these people were on vessels in Darwin Harbour. I ask this: what has been the situation hitherto? Why is it that we have allowed the situation to occur such that we have large numbers of vessels off Australiaâs northern coast and people detained on the vessels in harbours on the Australian coastline? For some periods, we have used the jail at Darwin to detain people. The people who work there were, of course, employees of the Northern Territory Public Service.</para>
<para>There is no merit in your argument about outsourcing these arrangements. There is every merit in the argument being put forward by the opposition that the people who are employed to look after these people should be employees of the Commonwealth or a state or territory. It is the only way to set out clear lines of responsibility and accountability, and responsibility to the people through the parliament of Australia. That is not the current system. We know what will happen: âSorry, we are not responsible for Baxter, it wasnât us. It was those people who we employed on our behalf. Itâs their responsibility.â The responsibility rests with the minister. We have seen departmental heads roll, but we have not seen a ministerial scalp and we ought to have. The minister says, âThis is not my responsibility; it is the responsibility of someone else, the department and the contractors.â It is her responsibility and she should have been held accountable for it.</para>
<para>The fact is we now have a situation off the coast of Northern Australia where last week, in the dead of night, large numbers of islands were excised out of the Migration Act for the purposes of migration law. We know, however, that these fishermen actually get onto Australiaâs soil. We have a very porous border. What will happen next? Will it be, when they head up the Liverpool River or the Blyth River in Arnhem Land, that we will see the government react and say: âOh, golly gosh! One of these boats has got some people seeking asylum who might otherwise be seen as illegal immigrants. What should we do next? Should we excise the coast of Northern Australia?â That is as stupid as this proposal by the minister and it ought to be seen as being stupid. What they ought to do is adopt the Senate amendments which they propose to reject in this place. Here is an opportunity to admit you are wrong. Support the amendments in this place and send them back to the Senate so that we can get on with business. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI rise to speak in this second reading debate on the <inline ref="R2371">Medical Indemnity (Competitive Advantage Payment) Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2370">Medical Indemnity Legislation Amendment (Competitive Neutrality) Bill 2005</inline>. If anybody ever bothers to write the history of the ministerial career of the current Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Abbott, then theyâa lonely PhD student, for example, with nothing better to doâwill record this parliamentary fortnight as the fortnight in which the ministerâs career as minister for health visibly unravelled in this parliament.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The minister for health was appointed to that position on 29 September 2003 with the express mission of fixing the Howard governmentâs political problems in health. It has been said that he did two significant things between the date of his appointment and the date of the election that have assisted the Howard government with its political problems in health. The two things that are said of this minister are, firstly, that he acted to solve the medical indemnity crisis and, secondly, that he secured a package through the Senate for the government that could later be advertised. Of course, we know the centrepiece of that package was the Medicare safety net. Here we are all these months later and the two âachievementsâ, if I can put that word in very heavy inverted commas, the minister would have claimed for himself in his ministerial career as minister for health between the date he was appointed and the date of the election lie shattered on the ground. This incompetent minister undertook a number of incompetent actions and that incompetency is now coming home to roost.</para>
<para>Next week this parliament will debate the legislation dealing with the changes in the thresholds of the Medicare safety net, which, if it was properly named, would be named âthe breaking of Minister Abbottâs rock solid, ironclad guarantee to the publicâ. His Medicare safety net policy, one of the supposed jewels in his crown as minister, lies in a shambles at his feet, with him scrambling around and continuing to try to explain to the Australian people why he was not forthright with them before the election and why he gave them a rock solid, ironclad guarantee that he always intended to breach. The other so-called jewel in his crown as minister for health between the date of his appointment and the election was his work on medical indemnity. Of course, that is unravelling, and the bills before the House are that unravelling laid clear for everybody to see.</para>
<para>We know the Howard government caused the medical indemnity crisis by neglect. It could have intervened to solve the medical indemnity crisis but it did nothing. I will speak more of that later. I have spoken on medical indemnity legislation in this House before and, gee, we have seen a power of it. There is always new medical indemnity legislation because there is always a new patch and there is always a new hole. The Howard government basically caused the medical indemnity crisis by neglect. It could have acted and did not do so.</para>
<para>That is one sin of this government, if you like. But indeed it takes a rare genius, when you finally act after standing idly by as months turn into years, to manage to spend more money on the solution than is neededâin fact, so much money that you create a competitive neutrality issue because you bolster one company offering medical indemnity products so much that its competitors start to squeal. It takes a rare genius to achieve thatâmonths and years of inaction and then, when you finally act, you completely overreact. It is the equivalent of standing still in the street one minute and then racing to 1,000 kilometres an hour the next minute. This government went from doing nothing to doing too much in an ill-advised and incompetent way, and this bill marks that before the House.</para>
<para>Here we are again with yet another piece of medical indemnity legislation. We know that they have patched and they have backfilled and they have patched and they have backfilled. Let me take you to the specifics this bill is dealing with and it shows in its own terms the story of incompetence. This bill once again amends legislation that was first implemented to address the medical indemnity crisis in 2003-04. Specifically, this bill addresses the issues of bias arising out of the assistance that was provided to UMP, the biggest medical defence organisation in Australia, as a result of its collapse in 2002.</para>
<para>I make it clear that Labor will not oppose this bill and I again say for the record that Labor have always helped this government dig themselves out of the mess of their own making that they got into with medical indemnity issues. We were critical of them for sitting idly by. We knew a crisis was coming. Like a blind man staggering down the street, they did not realise they had fallen in a hole until they were at the bottom. As they have tried to scramble out of that hole we have assisted them at every point, including allowing expedited passage of legislation when that was necessary. We simply took the view that doctors and, more specifically, their patients should not pay the price of the Howard governmentâs incompetenceâbut incompetence it has been, and incompetence writ large.</para>
<para>In November 2004 we started to see news stories confirming that UMP had reduced its premiums. UMP was Australiaâs biggest medical defence organisation. It had collapsed. The government bailed it out and then it appeared that the consequences of the bailout were such that it had received so much assistance and so much money that it was able to cut premiums and undercut its competitors. Those organisations which competed with it were rightly saying, âHang on, Iâm in the medical defence business and Iâm offering products. I reasonably price my products and I find UMP is undercutting me. Why is UMP undercutting me? It is undercutting me because it is sitting on a mountain of taxpayer dollars. How can that be fair?â</para>
<para>There was outrage among medical indemnity providersâand no wonder, when it was becoming public that UMP members had enjoyed premium reductions of up to 30 per cent. We know that at least two other medical indemnity funds wrote to the Prime Minister expressing their grave concern about the nature of this outcome and the unfairness to them and their businesses. As a result, the government commissioned a review into whether the assistance provided to the medical indemnity sector gave some players in the market a competitive advantage over others, and this review reported in March 2005.</para>
<para>The report examined each form of government assistance and their interactions, and assessed their implications for competitive neutrality in the medical indemnity market and any resulting competitive advantages including, but not limited to, such possible advantages as savings on reinsurance or capital servicing costs. The review found that the specific assistance to UMP in taking over its past incurred but not reported claims liabilities had resulted in a competitive advantage to the insurer and that that was because the governmentâs adoption of the companyâs back commitments had allowed it to focus just on its future commitments.</para>
<para>Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, no doubt you have had cause to be in the House when this medical indemnity legislation has been debated in the past and I am sure you are familiar with the IBNR, incurred but not reported, terminology, but just for the clarification of the House I will tell you why UMP got into trouble. UMP got into trouble because it had not made proper provision for the liabilities that were likely to arise for adverse medical incidents that had happened. Doctors were insured by UMP. Some of them would have been involved in adverse medical incidents, where a patient had been harmed. Some time down the track that patient might well have made a claim and might have succeeded in getting some damages but UMP had not made proper provision for those future claims when they came on stream. So the liability had been incurredâthough, given the claims had not actually been made, the liability had not been reportedâand proper prudential provision had not been made for it. That is what caused UMP to get into trouble and this report said that, because the government had lifted the weight of the incurred but not reported claims from UMP, it was allowing UMP to focus on its future business in terms of pricing its products, and that was an area of competitive advantage.</para>
<para>Pricing analysis also undertaken by the review revealed that UMPâs premiums were well below its competitors and that this was partly attributable to its ability to focus on future liabilities only. While the report found no evidence of predatory pricing it did conclude that, given the lack of accurate, accessible and industry-wide information on medical indemnity pricing, there was a possibility of industry gaining and destabilisation. The report assessed that the source of UMPâs competitive advantage was the Commonwealthâs adoption of UMPâs IBNR levy, which was assessed at $253 million by the Australian Government Actuary. So when UMP was collapsing because it had not made proper provision for the claims that had been incurred but not reported at that point, the Commonwealth lifted the weight off UMP and then sought to recoup the moneys necessary to fund that through a levy on doctors. This report points to the competitive advantage that that gave.</para>
<para>Labor has previously stated that in determining the competitive neutrality issues arising from the governmentâs assistance, policy responses should be developed to address any identified competitive advantage; deliver a viable, affordable, fair and competitive medical indemnity market; and deliver sustainability for the medical indemnity sector and the taxpayer and fair and transparent outcomes for consumers. Unfortunately, at the rate the minister for health is going, we could all die of old age before what Labor has called for is actually implementedâor, more likely, will be implemented by an incoming Labor government.</para>
<para>This bill is just another bandaid on the patch-up job that has been done to date. If we look at how we got here we find a story about this governmentâs incompetence, and the incompetence of the minister in particular. It would be well known amongst the sectorâand it is probably remembered with some degree of horror by Australiaâs doctors and by many patients, who were concerned that they were not going to get appropriate careâthat this crisis first arose in November 2001, when Australiaâs biggest medical defence organisation, UMP, failed to fund $460 million worth of incurred but not reported claims. In December 2001 UMP increased its premiums on average by 52 per cent. However, for high-risk specialists like obstetricians and neurosurgeons it increased premiums by as much as 123 per cent.</para>
<para>In February 2002, UMP faced pressure by APRA, the prudential regulation authority, to raise additional capital to meet minimum capital requirements. APRA gave UMP until 30 June 2003 to raise over $30 million to meet these requirements. The government intervened on 28 March and said that it would provide a short-term guarantee of up to $35 million to enable UMP to meet its minimum capital requirements. In April 2002 UMP unsuccessfully sought further assistance from the government to enable its directors to get personal liability insurance. On 29 April 2002 UMP filed for a provisional liquidator, who was appointed on 3 May 2002, whose main objectives were to determine the companyâs solvency and ability to continue trading.</para>
<para>This crisis would have left doctors around Australiaâpredominantly in New South Wales, but spread around Australiaâwithout the protection of medical insurance. In those circumstances, many of them would have ceased to practise until the crisis was resolved, because they would not have taken on their shoulders the potential liability of being in practice and being uninsured. While this crisis unfolded, the Prime Minister made a commitment to ensure that, in the event of provisional liquidation, members would be covered while a long-term solution was developed. On 28 April, the day UMP was going into liquidation, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer announced that the government would guarantee claims arising from any procedures from 29 April to 30 June 2002. That was a period in which they then said they would do something to resolve the matter over the longer term.</para>
<para>The AMA was understandably unsatisfied with the governmentâs guarantees, perhaps knowing the record of this government in keeping its word. As a result, the government faced closures of wards and postponement of surgery as specialists sought greater certainty. Letters from both the Assistant Treasurer and the then minister for health, and action by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the AMA, then led to the acceptance of the guarantee. The guarantee was finally approved by the courts and ended up being extended until 31 December 2002. In addition, the government also agreed to assume responsibility for incurred but not reported claims where the incident giving rise to the claim occurred before 30 June 2003. The government determined to recoup from doctors the amount of money it was going to spend on that guarantee. The nature of its levy scheme on doctors caused considerable criticism and, once again, caused a crisis in 2003 when the new minister for health was sitting in the chairâa crisis which could have seen doctors walk off the job. To resolve that crisis, a number of things about the levy were changed.</para>
<para>In addition to taking these steps, the government tried to address the high cost of medical indemnity, which was plaguing the sector, by implementing a medical indemnity premium subsidy scheme to subsidise premiums for obstetricians, procedural GPs, neurosurgeons and GP registrars undertaking procedural training. This ended up being expanded beyond that class of doctors and being based on a formulation of the relativity of indemnity costs to incomes in 2004. The government also implemented the high-cost claims scheme to further reduce pressure on medical defence organisations. Under this scheme, the government provided 50 per cent of insurance payouts over $500,000. In May 2004 there were various measures related to run-off cover. This was because much of the industry was migrating from having provided cover on an incurred claims basis to a claims made basis. That meant that retiring doctors who had left the work force needed run-off cover in case a claim was made post the point at which they had retired. Then, of course, as I have indicated, competitive neutrality issues emergedâand that is why we are here today.</para>
<para>Did it have to be like this? We had a series of legislative patch-ups. We had several periods of crisis when doctors were considering walking off the job. We had doctors who may have chosen to continue in high-risk specialties determining to take the decision to get out of those specialties. We no doubt had doctors in training who were thinking at that time of being an obstetrician or a neurosurgeon, who watched this medical indemnity crisis emerge and thought, âNo, Iâm not going to get into the business of doing that. I will go into some other area of medical specialty.â We had patients worried about cancelled operations. We had patients worried about whether or not they would be able to get obstetric care, for example.</para>
<para>Did it have to be like thisâpatches, problems, competitive neutrality issues, periods of crisis, hundreds of millions of dollars of government money spent? Did it have to be like this? No, it did not. We know that the former Labor government had commissioned a report into the looming medical indemnity crisis. When you looked around the Western world at claims patterns and litigation exposure, it was clear that it was happening everywhere. With Australiaâs system of looking after doctors and making sure they were insured should a patient make a claim against them for an adverse medical reaction or for what they would contend was negligence, it was just a matter of time before it came to Australia. It was nothing more complicated than that. It was clear that this was going to result in a crisis, unless there was some action.</para>
<para>By the time the former health minister, Dr Michael Wooldridge, was sitting in the chair, he would have had access to the Tito report and he would have known that this was a crisis, but he explicitly chose to do nothing. As I have remarked in this House before, we know that not because I think it or because others in this House might think it but because Dr Michael Wooldridge actually said it. At a conference at the University of Melbourne in 2003âafter he had left parliamentâhe actually said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">As Minister, I was accused of doing far too little on medical indemnity. Thatâs completely unfair. I did absolutely nothing whatsoever.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Extraordinary! One wonders what he was taking his pay for in all those long years as health minister. Clearly, it was not for resolving Australiaâs medical indemnity crisis. So we had the long-serving Howard government minister for health, Dr Michael Wooldridge, doing absolutely nothing. We had this crisis looming. We have had the Howard government lurching around trying to fix this crisis. We have had multiple pieces of legislation. And now, as I say, we have the rare genius whereby the government have bailed out a company, which was going to collapse, with so much money that it is now undercutting the prices of people who provide medical insurance and there is a competitive neutrality issue. It is an extraordinary cycle, but that is where we are at.</para>
<para>What should have been done? A series of more fundamental things than this incompetent government is capable of should have been done. What we certainly know about the current minister for health is that, while he might be a patcher, he is certainly nobodyâs reformer and is not a believer in reform. He campaigned against reform in the run-up to the last election. If he can find a solution that will last for 24 hours, he will always prefer that to a solution that would last for 24 years. That is true of much of what he does in the health portfolio and it has certainly been true of this. If he can put on a little short-term bandaid and walk away, that is good enough; that is the approach he has taken. The approach that should have been taken here should have been to ask what was going to fix it for 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 years, but the minister for health would never ask himself a question that big. But if he had asked himself a question that big, he would have come up with the following answers. One of the most important elements is addressing the question of quality of care and avoiding insofar as possible adverse medical incidents. I know doctors are human; they make errors. We have at the table the Minister for Education, Science and Training, who of course was a doctor in a former life and I am sure he would cheerfully admit he made some errors then. We are never going to have a perfect system.</para>

<para>âI am sure he was a better doctor than a minister. My colleague at the table is undoubtedly right. The member for Maribyrnong made a very sharp and undoubtedly true observation. One of these days I am sure the minister for education will get back in touch with his true calling, and we will all be very pleased to go to him as a GP. But, even when he is back in practice as a GP, I am sure that there will be times when, despite all his professional skill and judgment, he will make the occasional error. But we do know, while accepting that there is always going to be some error rate in the system, that we could drive quality in our health system a lot better than we are driving it now. Recent data show that 16.6 per cent of the 14,000 hospital admissions in New South Wales and South Australia resulted in a disability or a longer stay in hospital. That was due to adverse events resulting from a wide range of human and system based failures. Half of these adverse events were considered preventable. There is similar data from the UK and the USA which show that adverse events are at 10 and 3.7 respectively as a percentage of total admissions. We are at 16.6 per cent and the UK and the USA have a far better record of avoiding adverse medical events.</para>

<para>âI doubt that in the litigious society which is the United States you would say that they are not reported. But even if the member disputes the data I do not think he is going to rise in his place, when his turn comes to speak, and say he is 100 per cent satisfied that there is no improvement that could be made in the quality of Australiaâs health system. I see he is shaking his head and in fact agreeing with me that we need to be doing something about quality. If we were doing something about quality, we would be doing something very important to lift the burden off the medical indemnity system.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Let us face it: if we used a parallel with the airline industry and applied the UK rate of misprescribing antibiotics for respiratory infection to an equivalent error rate in flying planes, there would be a thousandfold increase in the risk of dying in a plane crash. As I have remarked, the UK error rate is probably lower than ours. If Qantas decided it would run its system so we all had a thousandfold increase in the risk of dying, I do not think people would be sitting in parliament fiddling around and saying, âThat doesnât matter very muchâ; I think there would be a national crisis, yet we have adverse events probably in excess of that order in our hospital and medical system and we do not do much. We need a major offensive to lift quality.</para>
<para>The second policy area that is very important is the question of open disclosure. We know that it is hard to achieve open disclosure in a litigious environment and that it certainly requires changing the practice of providers, such as hospitals and medical practitioners, so that they do disclose errors. But we know that if we can achieve open disclosure often what could have been a protracted and vexed piece of litigation resulting in costs and a burden on the medical indemnity system can be resolved, because in the first instance often people are just trying to find out what went on. They are trying to find out what happened to them. They might even want something simple like an apology. They might even just want the opportunity to say to the doctor that they really have got a problem and to be taken seriously. The evidence shows that if people are given those sorts of opportunities often what would have become very vexed litigious claims down the track end up being cut off at the first point, but you can only achieve that if the culture is one of disclosure, not cover-up. That is a challenge for our health and medical system.</para>
<para>The third area is a very important one that requires further examination but is in Minister Abbottâs too-hard basket. Maybe I should say it is in Minister Abbottâs too-hard mansion: he would not have a basket to store his too-hard items; they would be building a block of flats to store all of the things he would put in his too-hard basket, so many are they. One of the most important ones in that huge too-hard basket is the question of the long-term care costs of people who are catastrophically injured. We know one of the things that put the biggest burden on the medical indemnity system and certainly caused the biggest fear and apprehension among doctors concerned people who have suffered catastrophic injuriesâfor example, babies that are very severely disabled as a result of an adverse medical event during the birthing process. They have a whole lifetime of costs and care and when that whole lifetime of costs and care is put onto the medical indemnity system it can be in the order of millions of dollars.</para>
<para>That is a problem for the viability of the medical indemnity system and it is also a challenge for all of us. Why should a profoundly disabled infant who has been harmed by the actions of a doctor get a better package of care and assistance than that of a profoundly disabled infant who is disabled not because anybody did anything wrong but just because that was always the way that childâs life was going to be? Why are those two infants in different categories? Why do we look to assist one and have the medical indemnity system bear the cost but not look to assist the other in any quality way that we should? They are the long-term issues in this area. Despite all of the times that I have stood at this dispatch box talking about medical indemnity, these long-term issues do not get fixed. They do not even get considered. They do not make it onto Minister Abbottâs table. It is well and truly time that they did.</para>

<para>âI strongly support this important next block in the rebuilding of the medical indemnity insurance environment. The <inline ref="R2370">Medical Indemnity Legislation Amendment (Competitive Neutrality) Bill 2005</inline> is the next in a raft of measures rehabilitating this sector. This bill implements the recommendations of a review of competitive neutrality undertaken early this year. The government will ensure that competitive neutrality is restored in this industry by requiring medical indemnity insurance groups that benefited from the IBNR indemnity scheme to make a series of competitive advantage payments back to the government to reflect that level of advantage.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Having listened to the Manager of Opposition Business in the House, and having also had the privilege about six months ago to hear a similar response, there is very much a sense of <inline font-style="italic">Groundhog Day</inline>, not in bills around medical indemnity repeatedly coming into this House but in her response to those bills. It is akin to a back-seat driver looking behind at each turn and saying, âYou could have made that turn a little better or a little more effectively.â The question that she has raised is threefold. Firstly, has the approach to medical indemnity been overly incremental or, on the other hand, have we over-intervened in the sector? Secondly, has it been a case of too little too late or a case of too much too soon? Often both criticisms are levelled at the government. Finally, there is this assumption that medical indemnity is some rarefied environment where only the federal government operates with industry to come to solutions. Certainly, the involvement of state jurisdictions, often ignored by the Manager of Opposition Business, is a key contributor to reaching a solution for medical indemnity. The reason for that, of course, is that the states retain control and responsibility for tort law reform.</para>
<para>To give an illustration, there was very little point in the federal government stepping in and effectively intervening in a sector where tort law reform was not there first as a platform. What was required in medical indemnity was for all jurisdictions to come together and agree on a solution. To not find a state based solution to tort law reform was to effectively allow larger and larger payouts. Were states not to act at that point, the federal governmentâwhichever party was in powerâwould have been left with a larger, ballooning involvement in medical indemnity, which this side of the House would certainly not have supported. So the view that only the Commonwealth government is operating in this medical indemnity environment is a fallacious one.</para>
<para>The other comment made by members on the other side of the House is that more money has been paid into this solution than was absolutely necessary. To simplify what is a very complex law of insurance, I would make the analogy that the major provider of insurance was in diabolical straits in 2001. Whatever policy either side of this House agreed toâand I acknowledge that the opposition has usually, though sometimes begrudgingly, given us support for these billsâand whatever intervention was required for UMP/AMIL, it was always going to have to be a forward-leaning, positive, almost advantageous solution for that sector and it had to be in place until the environment was restored, at which point a bill like the one we are debating today would be absolutely necessary.</para>
<para>This bill to restore competitive neutrality should not be seen as an inappropriate policy response from two years ago. Something had to salvage the status of UMP. By having a positive impact on the course of UMP it was, at some stage, going to have to be switched off and corrected. That is what this bill does. It is not only timely; it is actually impressive that it occurs within a couple of years of the federal governmentâs first interventions into this crisisâand it did.</para>
<para>Since 2001 the government has rolled out a number of measures. With many of those, had I known they would be in place I may well have stayed in my former profession rather than considering a career here. The run-off cover indemnity scheme found a solution for those who were leaving practiceâthose who were either disabled or taking maternity leave. The High Cost Claims Scheme gave a solution to medical providers greatly concerned about payouts exceeding half a million dollars, and half of that payment was met by the Commonwealth government. There was the Exceptional Claims Scheme and the medical indemnity premium subsidy scheme, which effectively meant that those who were particularly disadvantaged only paid an indemnity of 7.5 per cent of their gross earnings and 20c in the dollar of the premium over and above that amount.</para>
<para>These measures were sensible and well received by industry, so when I hear from the Manager of Opposition Business that this has been an incremental, patchy or confused response, I turn to industryâand I think we hear something quite different. The great issue of three years agoâmedical indemnity: the crisis for which very few solutions appeared obvious thenâhas, as we look back in history, been addressed very effectively.</para>
<para>We all recall that in May 2002 the provisional liquidator, Mr David Lombe, was appointed. That followed the inability of UMP and AMILâwhich had deficiencies of net assets of nearly $50 million and nearly $40 million respectively, and an estimated IBNR liability of $445 millionâto meet the demands of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. It was then completely appropriate for the government to step in and support the medical profession and other health providers. Of course, that intervention could not have just come out of the blue. The perfect evidence for that is that under the watch of the Keating government there was no action either. I am sure that the Minister for Education, Science and Training will remember that this was a well-flagged crisis in the late eighties and early nineties. There was never any proposal then that a federal government would step in, act early and save money; there was a sense that there were multiple players in the environment and that the only solution would be for those to come together.</para>
<para>Before we say that the Commonwealth acted too late, let us just remember, without casting shadows on the efforts of state governments, just how slow, protracted and difficult negotiations were in 2001 and 2002 to bring state governments together to come up with a solution to tort law reform. They did that: they did it in different ways and at different speeds, but it would be completely wrong to believe what the Manager of Opposition Business has saidâthat everything was lined up for a solution and only a tardy Commonwealth government created the crisis that we know of now.</para>
<para>The idea that interventions have been ill-advised and incompetent or that we knew a crisis was coming is no cross to be borne by a government today. Merely calling for a Tito report in 1995-96 on the way out of government, at a time when the affairs of state were in crisis in almost every other areaâand, of course, there was no time to act on that reportâis, again, no excuse to criticise the Commonwealth for waiting for the time when all jurisdictions were prepared to step in and work together. The logical time for that to occur was when APRA came a-knocking and said to UMP/AMIL: âYou must be able to meet your obligations. If not, there needs to be a solution.â</para>
<para>I was interested to hear again, from the Manager of Opposition Business, that what was needed was, and I quote, âa series of more fundamental thingsâ. They centred upon solutions for catastrophic care, which I acknowledge has been a worldwide debate in the medical insurance and indemnity environment. But they also centred on a more concerning areaâthat we need to drive for quality as a solution to medical indemnity. To give you an illustration, it is like saying, âWe need to drive for quality in weather reporting to reduce the number of airline crashes.â</para>
<para>No-one disagrees that we need to be pushing for quality, and all the leading OECD countries are devoting enormous amounts of research to just that. Australia has an exceptional record in driving for quality in health care. But to say that it is a solution to medical indemnity is to not understand what it is like at the coalface of health care. We understandâthose who have worked thereâthat in many cases matching the expectation of the patient with that of the provider is one of the great challenges. It is not always about a clinical outcome. So to say that simply a push for quality would be a solution to the indemnity crisis is, I think, overly simplistic.</para>
<para>To say that we could ever have found a solution that might work for 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 years, as the Manager of Opposition Business said, also completely underestimates the complexityâthe mammoth actuarial taskâof determining a solution for UMP/AMIL. In fact, the only way that we could have appeased the Manager of Opposition Business was, in 2001, to have struck upon a single figureâa single, precise, financial figureâthat would have lifted UMP out of the diabolical straits it was in back to a perfectly level playing field and not a dollar more. We would have to have known that figure in 2001âa figure totally dependent upon tort law reform in each of the states and territories, rolled out at different times and having different impacts. It was an impossible figure to know, and that is why I defend an incremental process that we have seen from this government in finding a solution over a three-year period. Outcomes are managed from a clinical point of view. Quality means looking at patient satisfaction and expectation. But it is a complete oversimplification to say that, simply by focusing on quality, this country could have in any way reduced what was a burgeoning medical indemnity crisis, with a great deal of the solution requiring state tort law reform.</para>
<para>Following the appointmentâand I go through the history because it is importantâof the provisional liquidator, a series of measures were introduced in 2001 and 2002. The most unpopular of these was an immediate and potentially large levy on doctors. It became obvious that, because doctors had already had 50 per centâand in some cases, in specific professions, it was 123 per centâincreases in their premiums, a levy of an additional 50 per cent on top of that was likely to be unsustainable for members of UMP. That is why there was a moratorium. That is why there was some time to reconsider. At the time the moratorium was announced the government set up a policy review process. I think that was a case of cool heads prevailing and partnerships forming with state governments.</para>
<para>What they found was that, far from a $482 million, in net present value terms, liability to UMP/AMIL, there was a need for only a $261 million levy on doctors, with the balance made up by government funded payments under the High Cost Claims Scheme subsidies and exemptions. They also suggested that there should be a year-by-year arrangement, whereby a doctor who had only been a member of UMP for two years would only pay the levy for two years, and that there should be a cap of six years of total payments of that levyâand I will come back to why that is part of the legislation we are proposing today. There was then the opportunity, with the Medical Indemnity Amendment Act 2004, to reduce the amounts that doctors were required to pay. They also renamed those commitments âUMP support paymentsâ.</para>
<para>The substance of the bill today is that in 2004 UMP began to reduce payments to their members, and were particularly doing so in areas where they wanted to expand their business. That was the first market signal that UMP had recovered, and it was then an appropriate time to think about competitive neutrality issues. There is not much point worrying about competitive neutrality at a time when UMP were about to dissolve and sink without trace, leaving a major proportion of health providers without indemnity cover.</para>
<para>In addition to the recommendations of the bill, there is also a reduction in the UMP support payment that participating MDOs are liable to pay. This came directly from recommendations by the AMA. Immediately following the news that UMP premiums were going to fall, there was a review led by Graham Rogers into competitive neutrality. This process has been exceptionally timely. The government accepted that report and has acted in this bill today. The review concluded that specific assistance granted by the government to UMP resulted in that competitive advantage to AMIL and that the IBNR indemnity scheme had meant that the government had assumed responsibility for the legacy and had allowed UMP/AMIL to focus on the future and future business. Of course, those who did not benefit from those payments were disadvantaged.</para>
<para>So what were the solutions? They were threefold, as recommended. The first was that UMP/AMIL take back responsibility for the IBNR liability and raise the required amount of capital directly from the marketplace. The second was for the Commonwealth to provide an equivalent payment to those who were not benefiting from the levy. The third one, of course, and the one that we have decided to apply in this bill, is for UMP/AMIL to make a regular series of payments to compensate the Commonwealth for having assumed IBNR liabilities.</para>
<para>What are the positions of the significant interest groups in this area? The AMAâs great concern was that there should not be a winding back of government assistance, but that redistribution should occur in a way that does not disadvantage any particular player, that ensures that the premiums remain affordable for every provider and that, and I quote, âoptions to restore competitive neutrality should consider formulae for redistributing any maldistributed government assistance to reduce the indemnity costs of members obliged to pay the UMP support paymentââand that is exactly what has happened with this bill.</para>
<para>In accepting the findings of that review, there will be a series of repayments to government, and those funds will be used to reduce the payments of doctors under the UMP support scheme. If you look carefully at schedule 2 in this bill you will see that 7,000 out of 17,000 doctors, most of whom are GPs, are now exempt from that payment. For those who are expected to pay for up to six years, that will be reduced back to four years. There has also been a reduction of $1,000 in the amount of the UMP support payment that participating members of MDOs will make after 1 July 2005.</para>
<para>I conclude by reminding the House that the criticism of the paths taken to arrive at a solution to medical indemnity has been a little superficial when you remember the complexity of the task at hand. It is also enormously simplistic to say that a focus on quality in health care would be a solution to the medical indemnity crisis. Finally, I remind the House that a coalescence of events was required for the intervention that we saw, and it required state and territory governments to agree to take on that great issue of tort law reform.</para>
<para>The criticism that the government should have reacted in a timely way would only have invited a less precise response, a potentially more wasteful response and a response that would have mired the government in running medical indemnityâa situation that this country did not deserve. The solution was found, and this bill today acts promptly on the recommendations of the recent review into competitive neutrality. It will address the competitive advantage issues for MDOs who have benefited from the governmentâs IBNR indemnity scheme, and it will continue to ensure the ongoing health of medical indemnity provision in this country.</para>

</talker>
<para>âI am pleased to speak on the <inline ref="R2370">Medical Indemnity Legislation Amendment (Competitive Neutrality) Bill 2005</inline>âa very important subject. The availability of general practitioner services is vital for any community, and anything that threatens that availability is a matter of some concern which must receive the attention of the government and this House.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I have a habit of conducting a survey of general practitioners in my electorate every 12 months, and I completed a survey just last month. One of the questions I ask in the survey is how the general practitioners in my electorate feel about the matter of professional indemnity premiums and the IBNR issue generally. In the 2005 survey, 64 per cent of general practitioners in my electorate listed professional indemnity premiums as being the biggest problem facing general practitioners; 45 per cent of doctors in my electorate regard the situation of medical indemnity premiums as being âa serious threat to the continued operation of my practiceâ; and 36 per cent of doctors regard it as being a âworryâ.</para>
<para>Summing up the hopelessness of the situation, when asked to indicate how much medical indemnity premiums had risen in the last two years one general practitioner said, âI donât know, but I had to pay what they asked for.â The lowest premium rise recorded by doctors in my electorate over the last two years was 30 per cent, with a couple of doctors stating that their premiums had risen by more than 100 per cent. As I said, I conduct this survey annually and this yearâs survey matches the data from last yearâs survey, but last yearâs survey was even worse. Doctors in my electorate 12 months ago indicated in huge numbers, the vast majority, that their premiums had increased by well over 100 per cent. So last year they said that their premiums had increased by well over 100 per cent, and this year some of them have said that their premiums have increased by 100 per cent again.</para>
<para>So we are seeing evidence of continuing increases in premiums. Some doctors in my electorate said last year that their increase was around 200 per cent. So while we are seeing some improvement and are seeing premiums increasing by smaller amounts, we are kidding ourselves if we think this problem has gone away. The member for Bowman said that this problem has been dealt with and that we should talk to the industry to see whether it has been fixed. I have talked to general practitioners in my electorate and they have told me that it has not been fixed. This bill is another step in the governmentâs attempts to fix this problem, but frankly it is not an approach that has worked. As the opposition spokesman on health indicated in her address, it is not an approach that has been timely or appropriate.</para>
<para>This bill amends the legislation to address the crisis that has been facing the medical indemnity sector since 2002-03. The first of the main provisions relates to the scope of run-off cover. Specifically, these provisions seek to close the gap between the average cover of ROCS contracts and what the government will reimburse. Contracts must now cover all the periods that a doctor was insured and the range of things the doctor was insured for in their last contract. Doctors will not be covered for times when they were uninsured but will be covered for underinsurance if they have subsequently bought retro cover.</para>
<para>The amendments also specifically define the entry requirements for coverage under the ROC scheme. For example, what constitutes disability and maternity will be defined and, in addition, the ROC scheme will cover doctors for brief periods when coverage has lapsed. These amendments will also require that doctors covered by the scheme cease all work, not just medical work, undertaken in the private sector. Other amendments will extend the definition of the medical practice period so that public sector doctors who are otherwise eligible for the ROC will be covered by the scheme when they cease working in the public sector.</para>
<para>The second group of amendments will be made to the high cost claims protocols in the Medical Indemnity Act. These amendments are aimed at aligning the High Cost Claims Scheme with reinsurance protocols. The first of these will ensure that the applicable threshold is that which applied at the time of the incident that gave rise to the claim. The second will ensure that 12 months notice is given to insurers when the government makes changes to thresholds or percentages which have a detrimental effect on insurers.</para>
<para>As the member for Lalor indicated in her address on this bill, the Labor Party believes there needs to be a multipronged approach to ensure that there is a sustainable, long-term resolution to the medical indemnity crisis. This is not what we have seen from the government. We have seen from the government a series of ad hoc, on-the-run, urgent decisions which have had the effect of a bandaid. The government knew this crisis was coming. The former minister openly admitted that he did nothing about the crisis. At least he had some honesty after he left the parliament. He sat here after the Tito report, commissioned by the Keating government, was delivered and he did absolutely nothing.</para>
<para>This government was forced into action by a crisis. It did not take this action of its own accord. It did not take this action because it chose to. It took this action because general practitioners were going out of business, and this nation would have faced perhaps the biggest medical crisis it had faced in its history because communities would have had no doctors. The reason the then Minister for Health and Ageing took the action was that she was forced into it.</para>
<para>The honourable member for Bowman talked about a whole range of reasons why the government could not have taken action any earlier. He indicated that the states were tardy and that the states had not acted promptly. I almost fell off my chair to hear a member of the government in this House attack a state government. What a rare occurrence! When in doubt, attack the state government. They can take their pick. We have wall-to-wall state and territory Labor governments, so when in doubt they attack the state governments. For the federal government to attack the state government over the medical indemnity crisis really takes the cake. This government took no action despite several reports showing that a crisis was looming; yet the honourable member for Bowman, whom I respect, took the approach of attacking state governments across the country. I will come in a moment to the state governmentsâ actions in tort law reform, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland, which have had a dramatic effect.</para>
<para>The other policy area that deserves attention is the area of open disclosure. This requires changing the practice patterns of providers, such as hospitals or medical practitioners, so that they do disclose errors. For parties who, in the first instance, might be seeking something as simple as an expression of regret or a factual statement about what has happened to their loved one, this enables that to occur and may reduce the risk of litigation. We welcome any initiative which reduces the risk of litigation and which encourages people to be honest, open and up front about what may have occurred. As the member for Lalor said, mistakes do happen; every general practitioner, no matter how competent and dedicated they are, is going to make a mistake. I think that this nation, like many other nations, is facing a crisis of litigationâwhen in doubt, litigate. That is something to be regretted and to be avoided. So to move to a regime of open disclosure would be a major step forward.</para>
<para>Another area that requires further examination is that of long-term care costs for the catastrophically injured. Currently, those who are injured in medical negligence events have their costs borne by the insurance company. Those who are injured in other circumstances end up with an inappropriate style of careâcertainly not the sort of care that should be supported.</para>
<para>One of the social problems that we faceâit is a problem that I think is underreported but it is a national tragedyâis the number of young people in nursing homes in this country: people who have been catastrophically injured but find themselves in nursing homes. These are people as young as teenagers who find themselves not being able to get an appropriate level of care in hospitals or hospices or to get other forms of medical care. They find themselves in nursing homes with people who have problems that are much different from the ones that they haveâAlzheimerâs, dementiaâand with all the sorts of social and medical problems that we all know exist in nursing homes. I know that it would break the heart of every honourable member in this House to know that there are young people in nursing homes.</para>
<para>I interviewed a constituent of mine just last week whose husband is 55 and in a nursing home in Western Sydney. Her husband is fully mentally alert, but due to a problem like those we are talking about hereâa medical problem; an operation in a hospital that went wrongâher husband had to have both his feet amputated. Here he is at the age of 55 in a nursing home, presumably for the rest of his life. That is not the sort of care that we should be providing. That is not the sort of care that a modern, developed, caring society in the 21st century should be giving to people who have suffered a medical catastrophe as a result of a problem in an operation, or any other sort of problem for that matter. An examination of better models of care for the catastrophically injured would not only provide medical indemnity insurance with greater long-term stability but also improve the outcomes for people involved in these sorts of claims.</para>
<para>In February 2005 the Australian Medical Association expressed its support for a long-term care scheme as an alternative to the current fault based adversarial system, which results in lump sum payments but often does not result in the best care for the catastrophically injured or for the people who care for them. I know that people who are in this situation would support that. Many of them do not want a lump sum payment or a huge compensation payout; they want proper, appropriate and decent care for the people who have been affected, for their loved ones, for the rest of their lives. I encourage the government to further examine that and to do whatever is possible.</para>
<para>I also encourage the state governments to do whatever is possible to find a solution to this issue. This is not something that the Australian people want the federal and state governments to be bickering over. This is something that the Australian people would like to see their federal and state governments working cooperatively on to find appropriate levels of care for people who have suffered catastrophic injuries as a result of both medical negligence and other events.</para>
<para>The state governments control two of the most important levers in this debate. State governments control the tort law environment and they indemnify doctors for their work in public hospitals. This is something that the honourable member for Bowman referred to. He said that the state governments were tardy in dealing with tort law reform. He said the state governments were negligent, in effect, in not dealing with tort law reform. I draw the attention of the honourable member for Bowman and other honourable members to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 24 February 2005, which reports that the cost of large claims has fallen by 20 to 25 per cent thanks to the reforms introduced by the New South Wales and Queensland governments. The article also says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">UMP slashed the premiums it charges doctors by an average of 20.5 per cent from January 1 as a result of the lower payouts.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This deserves some attention. State governments have taken action in tort law reform; they have taken action in dealing with this issue. And it has had another effect. The profits made by the nationâs biggest medical insurer have skyrocketed since the introduction of tort law reform. UMPâs profit has increased by a substantial amount. This company was in liquidation just 18 months ago. It has now revealed an after-tax profit in the five months to November 2004 of $41.8 millionâmore than it was previously expected to make in all of the previous financial year. This issue of competitive neutrality is the issue that the honourable member for Lalor referred to.</para>
<para>The government, in its ad hoc, urgent and bandaid approach, threw money at UMP. As a result, it gave UMP a massive competitive advantage over other insurers, which the Treasury identified as an issue, and we now see UMP making huge after-tax profits that may be being passed on to general practitioners in some form or another such as reduced premiums. But the general practitioners in my electorate have attested that their premiums have continued to increase and to form a major threat to the continued viability of their practices. The majority of doctors in my electorate say that the medical indemnity issue is a continued threat to the very viability of their practices. These are not people who want to close their practices down; these are people who want to continue to work in the community but who are saying, âIf these increases in my medical indemnity premiums continue, then I will not be able to keep my practice running in any viable way.â</para>
<para>Treasuryâs review of competitive neutrality effects of the governmentâs intervention in the UMP collapse identified the importance of collecting data about pricing and medical negligence claims and the tort law experience in this new policy and legal environment. Specifically, Treasury encouraged the industry to continue to work on collecting claims data on a state-by-state basis so that state-by-state patterns could be analysed, particularly following extensive state law reforms. I referred earlier to the report of substantial reductions in premiums in New South Wales in particular as a result of tort law reforms in that state. In Victoria, the Bracks government probably now has the most competitive set of data on medical indemnity claims of most, if not all, governments in Australia as a result of working with the Medical Indemnity Protection Society. This is exactly the type of database that the federal government needs to work towards establishing in cooperation with state governments and medical defence organisations.</para>
<para>This is not a bad bill. This is not a bill that the opposition opposes. These amendments are largely procedural and they are necessary. But this is not a bill which the government should be proud of. It is a bill which is fixing anomalies in the original bill. This amendment bill shows the speed, the urgency and the bandaid nature of the governmentâs original approach. This bill fixes problems in the original bill which did not need to be there. This government knew the issue was coming, it knew there was a crisis looming and the previous minister did absolutely nothing. The current Minister for Health and Ageing is not entirely to blame in this. The previous Minister for Health and Aged Care, the former member for Chisholm, openly admitted that he did absolutely nothing about the medical indemnity crisis. He said: âItâs not fair to say I didnât do enough; it is fair to say I did absolutely nothing.â</para>
<para>He said that in his capacity as a consultant to the Royal College of General Practitioners. I think that is his current role. He did not say it in his previous capacity as the minister for health of this nation. If he had said it in his previous capacity he could have said: âIâve done absolutely nothing, but now Iâm going to do something about it. Iâm not going to leave it to the next blokeâthe poor old member for Warringahâto fix my problems. Iâm not going to leave it to him. Iâm going to do something now.â He was a long-serving minister for health in this nation and he did absolutely nothing. He could not claim that he did not know about it. The Australian Medical Association had been warning about it. The Tito report had been warning about it. Everybody who knows anything about general practice and the medical industry in this nation had been warning that this crisis was coming, but the Hon. Michael Wooldridge, the former member for Chisholm and the former minister for health, did absolutely nothingâand now boasts about it. He now goes out and boasts: âI did nothing about it. I didnât fix it and Iâm proud of it.â It is nothing he should be proud of; it is something he should be ashamed of.</para>
<para>I do not agree with the way the current minister for health has fixed it, but I do have some sympathy for him, having inherited this massive crisis. He inherited it not only from the former member for Chisholm but also from Senator Patterson. We all remember the mess that the portfolio was in under Senator Patterson. Minister Abbott came in and he raced down to the general practitioners. We had the TV cameras down there and he said, âIâm going to fix it,â and he had it all fixed, he said, in 24 hours. That is not quite true, because he rushed this legislation through, he rushed his reform through, and as a result he gave such a massive advantage to UMP that the Treasury got upset about the competitive disadvantage for other companies, and now we are seeing a massive profit for UMP while general practitioners in my electorate and other electorates around this country continue to pay massive premiums on their medical indemnity insurance. The government has not handled this issue well enough and it will take a Labor government to come up with a long-term and permanent solution.</para>

<para>âin replyâI thank members who have contributed to this debate on the <inline ref="R2371">Medical Indemnity (Competitive Advantage Payment) Bill 2005</inline> and cognate bill. I simply observe that the contribution of the member for Prospect was an interesting one. The fact that all he could find to criticise were actions other than this particular action makes me think that, in the end, this is really pretty good legislation. Obviously, with the benefit of hindsight, lots of things would be different. If we could see now what is going to happen in five, 10, 15 or 20 years time, there are lots of things that we would do to anticipate those things and perhaps to correct them. But the fact is that we cannot ever anticipate the future. All we can do is the best today for the things that we can reasonably anticipate might happen in our future. âSufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,â I can remember reading somewhere in the sort of book that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, might have delved into from time to time. I think that, on balance, the government has handled the medical indemnity crisis reasonably well. When something is unique, when something is unfolding, it is only natural that you will do some things today which tomorrow and the day after will need to be finetuned. So what we have today is a bill which finetunes the rescue package which the government put into place in stages between 2002 and early 2004.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As members would know, the immediate crisis was sparked by the collapse of the largest medical indemnity insurer, UMP. In order to ensure that doctors did not suddenly go uncovered, the government supported UMP with what has become known as the IBNR scheme or âincurred but not reportedâ liabilities scheme. We subsequently discovered that this gave an unfair competitive advantage to UMP. That was not all bad: it enabled UMP to emerge swiftly and strongly from provisional liquidation. But if it was not corrected it could easily have led to the kind of âdog eat dogâ competitive bunfight which, to some extent, brought us to the problems that we have had to deal with in the last few years.</para>
<para>This legislation is restoring a level playing field between the various medical indemnity insurers, and it is doing so in ways that benefit doctors. The money that this bill will take from UMP will be returned to doctors by way of a substantial reduction in the UMP support payments that doctors would otherwise be making. Instead of making these payments for six years, they will be making them for four years only, and the amounts that doctors will pay in years 3 and 4 of the scheme will be reduced byÂ $1,000 a year. This means that some 7,000 mostly GPs of the 17,000 doctors presently making payments under the scheme will have no liability whatsoever in years 3 and 4. This is good news for doctors and, ultimately, it is good news for the medical indemnity insurance sector because it means we can have competition on a reasonable basis.</para>
<para>The government will review the operation of medical indemnity insurance arrangements more generally. That review will start in the next couple of months and should conclude by the end of the year. Let me say, in fairness to all the various interest groups that have been involved, that our system has operated rather better than it often does here. As we all know and as we often lament, the different players in our health sector can spend far too much of their time blaming each other for problems. I should say, by way of giving credit where it is due, that the states have generally worked very cooperatively with the federal government to reform tort law. That is why the incidence of medical indemnity claims has dropped substantially. That has certainly helped all the insurers, particularly UMP, to restore their balance sheets quickly. The AMA has worked constructively with the government and with the states. On balance, IÂ think this is a difficult situation which has been pretty well retrieved by the government, by the states, by the profession, by the insurers and, if I am going to give credit where it is due, by the opposition because, except for some rhetorical flourishes, the opposition has supported the passage of the governmentâs medical indemnity insurance legislation through the parliament. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>âThe <inline ref="R2406">Human Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline> is poorly titledâit should be called the âHuman Services Legislation We Got it Wrong Amendment Billâ. It is also incomplete. It is missing an apology for the failure of what has been an ideologically motivated experiment that the government has carried out with Centrelink since 1997âa failed experiment which it is now in the process of reversing.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I have been doing a little web surfing to follow the governmentâs experiment with Human Services and I was surprised to find the information on the web keeps changing. The one constant I found was the link from the Human Services web site to Minister Hockeyâs personal Liberal Party web site. When you arrive there, you are greeted by a message asking you to join the Liberal PartyâI didnât take it up, MrÂ Deputy Speaker. When I first took a look at this site, what I wanted to do was to read all about the Department of Human Services. Under a section called âWho we areââthis is on Minister Hockeyâs private Liberal Party web siteâthere was a description of the Department of Human Services, explaining that it was established to improve the development and delivery of government services to the Australian people. It told me, âHuman Services will provide a consolidated focus on the efficient and timely and sympathetic delivery of Australian government payments and servicesâ.</para>
<para>All this, by the way, was also accompanied by the message on the side saying, âJoin the Liberal Partyâ together with an Australian flag fluttering in the breeze. Then it went on to talk about âour prioritiesââand at this point you are now scrolling down past the âJoin the Liberal Partyâ message, which I did. The priorities, we were told, included the delivery of 14 new initiatives announced prior to the 2004 election. Implementation, we were told, of all of these was on track. There was no mention of just what the 14 priorities were. Little wonder when I checked back to see whether Minister Hockeyâs web site had updated us on his progress with these 14 priorities that that particular page had been removed from his web site. Perhaps it was overloaded by people clicking on the âJoin the Liberal Partyâ buttonâI think notâwhen they were trying to learn about services provided by the Department of Human Services.</para>
<para>That page has gone, as also has a speech which previously appeared on the web site, which Minister Hockey gave to the National Press Club on 20 April this year. I suppose that you could understand that the mention of the 14 priorities might be scrubbed from the web site if in fact the implementation was not quite on track or on track at allâwhich, I guess, we can only suspect is the case. But what was it about the speech which would cause it to be removed? Quite remarkable. It may have been in the title: âMaking life easier: the role of Human Services in improving Commonwealth service deliveryâ. I never knew that making life easier was a Liberal Party goal. You could imagine a previous Liberal Prime Minister objecting to the idea of making life easier being a Liberal Party goal. Or it could have been Minister Hockeyâs early promise in the speech: âWe will improve accountability within the agencies.â Perhaps that is something which the minister no longer wishes to answer for.</para>
<para>The question here is: just how accountable is Human Services and its agencies? Let us take a closer look at Centrelinkâs performance. On 24 September 1997 Prime Minister Howard announced that his government had established Centrelink with a ânew corporate structure to enhance responsiveness and accountabilityâ. It has achieved neither. Under the Howard government the experiment with Centrelink has failed to achieve responsiveness to the Australians it serves or, as it calls them, its âcustomersâ. Centrelinkâs failures in management systems and service delivery have been documented in a litany of Audit Office reports and, if you ask any of the seven million Australians who deal with Centrelink just how responsive it is to their needs, you come up with some pretty negative opinions. We have seen many failures. We should have seen much greater improvement in service delivery in eight years but the complaints and errors continue to pile up unaddressed. They are unresponsive.</para>
<para>I will go through a few examples. The Auditor-Generalâs report No. 34 of 2000-01 found 49.1 per cent of claims forms were not fully completed in accordance with legislative requirements. Isnât it the job of Centrelink to make sure that its legislation is implementedânot half the time, all the time? No wonder there are so many stuff-ups in payments if the information collected at the first interview or application is incomplete. Then there was the Auditor-Generalâs report No. 26 of 2001-02, which found 22 per cent of applications for payments contained errors in the proof of identity process. This is quite alarming coming from a government intent on introducing a national identity scheme. Twenty-two per cent! Their largest payments agency cannot get it right for one in five of the Australians on which it collects private information.</para>
<para>Then there was the Auditor-Generalâs report No. 32 of 2004-05 on Centrelinkâs customer charter, which found that there were no measurable standards in the charter. It failed to implement one of the primary purposes of the customer charter as outlined in the governmentâs client service charter principles, which are apparently meaningless. Here we have got an arm of government supposed to be about serving the public but it does not want that level of service to be measured. I want to put the minister on notice that this needs to change and that, from the passage of this legislation, he can no longer hide behind a board. He is responsible. He is accountable. We will expect to see measurable standards of customer service and improving customer service.</para>
<para>Then there was the Auditor-Generalâs report No. 34 of 2004-05 into Centrelinkâs complaints handling system. It found, first, a low level of awareness amongst Centrelinkâs so-called customers of avenues to lodge complaints. Second, Centrelink lacked sufficient information about complaints. Third, many clients feared discrimination and retribution if they lodged complaints. Fourth, there was an absence of any guidance or procedures for Centrelink staff to advise customers about complaints procedures. Fifth, there was no provision for internal follow-up to address the risk of discrimination against people who lodged complaints. Sixth, there was a substantial risk that Centrelink data on complaints was inaccurate. Seventh, there was an absence of any record of other stakeholder complaints. Eighth, there was a failure to track multiple complaints on issues about staff members. Ninth, there was misleading presentation in annual reports about complaints and, 10th, there was an absence of an effective quality assurance mechanism for the handling of complaints. As Jack Little used to say on Channel 9 TVâs <inline font-style="italic">World Championship Wrestling</inline>, âAll I can say is wow.â What a demolition job the Auditor-General has done on Centrelinkâs complaints handling system. What a waste of time it must be to make a complaint to Centrelink. Perhaps that is why we as members of this House receive so many complaints about Centrelink.</para>
<para>What is more, the Auditor-Generalâs report No. 36 of 2004-05 into Centrelinkâs value creation workshops found the same customer complaints were raised consistently year after year about Centrelinkâs services but there was no implementation of findings from the workshops. The continued roll-out of these value creation workshops has certainly been lucrative for the consultants who run them. The Value Creation Group has earned at least $4 million of taxpayersâ money for these workshops. The Auditor-General found that when their contract came up for renewal in 2003, Centrelink incorrectly advised the Minister for Finance and Administration that the consultants had been selected originally as the result of an open tender. They were not. The Auditor-General also found that Centrelink omitted a whole lot of other evidence as well in seeking sign-off on a fourth contract for the Value Creation Group. Nice work if you can get it! The minister had better make himself better informed next time because he will be held accountable for some implementation and not simply the nice touchy-feely workshops.</para>
<para>Then there was the Auditor-Generalâs report No. 40 of 2004-05 which found that the Edge project, a family payments processing system developed in association with the Department of Family and Community Services, had failed due to governance problems between the Department of Family and Community Services and Centrelink and a failure to identify metrics for measuring outcomes. It sounds familiar: failure in governance, failure of one part of the bureaucracy to talk to another part and failure to measure outcomes. It is supposed to be the job of the Minister for Human Services to ensure that these mistakes are not made.</para>
<para>We can move on from Centrelink to the Health Insurance Commission, which has also been the subject of a number of adverse audit reports. The Auditor-General has criticised the Health Insurance Commissionâs information management systems, most notably in Audit report No. 24 of 2004-05, which found that up to 500,000âthat is, half a millionâMedicare cards were probably held by people who were dead. Audit report No. 54 of 2004-05 again dragged the HIC over the coals for poor administration of health care cards. The question here is obvious: what confidence can the community have in the Howard governmentâs management of sensitive personal information when the Health Insurance Commission and Centrelink are found to have messed up? The Health Insurance Commission is the agency that the Prime Minister might task to manage his proposed national identification schemeâthat is the kind of thing that has been reported in the media.</para>
<para>We also need to ask the government to respond to rumours circulating in the Health Insurance Commission about staff who are to be moved into the so-called talent pool, which they believe to be a euphemism for being moved out of the organisation. The question here is: is it correct that a failed information technology project, the business improvement project, has left the Health Insurance Commission with a debt to the department of finance in the order of tens of millions of dollars? Is that the reason staff have been told there will be restructuring and there will be cuts to staff numbers as a result of that restructuring? We need to hear from the minister whether this is true and whether it is a consequence of this legislation. The extent of the proposed staff cuts is unclear, the current climate of uncertainty in the Health Insurance Commission is appalling for staff morale and, notwithstanding the professionalism of its staff, it would be reasonable to expect that that would impact as well on the service which the Health Insurance Commission provides to the public. The Australian people are entitled to know from the minister: can he guarantee that customer service in the new Medicare Australia will be better and not worse as a result of the proposed restructuring of the organisation?</para>
<para>The government claims in the explanatory memorandum that there is no financial impact from this legislation, yet the Health Insurance Commission is to be rebadged as Medicare Australia. There is no doubt that we on this side of the House agree that Medicare is a very good brand. It is a Labor brand. But we wonder what the cost of this rebadging exercise is to be. Is this simply to provide an excuse for another multimillion-dollar government advertising campaign that the minister has foreshadowed supposedly to inform Australians of the services which agencies provide? We have already seen, frankly, way too much politically driven government advertising designed to advantage the government, advertising which should be paid for by the Liberal Partyâadvertising concerning the GST and the so-called strengthening Medicare campaign and the advertising we are seeing now about industrial relations. These things should be paid for by the Liberal Party. We do not want to see more taxpayersâ dollars spent on advertising which serves no purpose other than that of political propaganda.</para>
<para>The changes being proposed in this legislation are an acknowledgement that the accountability processes that applied to Centrelink and the Health Insurance Commission have been a failure. The legislation makes governance changes to Centrelink and the HIC as part of the implementation of the governmentâs response to the Uhrig report, <inline font-style="italic">Review of the corporate governance of statutory authorities and office holders</inline>. The changes are, firstly, the abolition of the governance boards of Centrelink and the HIC. Secondly, there is the replacement of the HIC, an authority with a separate legal personality to the Commonwealth, by Medicare Australia, a body that will form part of the Commonwealth. Thirdly, there is the creation of the office of chief executive officer, CEO, of Centrelink and of Medicare Australia, with statutory functions; and, fourthly, there is the establishment of new governance arrangements under which the CEOs will be directly accountable to the Minister for Human Services. The changes are an acknowledgment that the governance structures of both organisations have not provided adequate accountability to government for the important services they provide to the community.</para>
<para>The Uhrig review noted that a key characteristic of a board is its full power to act and its responsibility to do so, including such actions as appointing and terminating the CEO. In the face of Centrelink and HIC failures in management systems and service delivery, their boards were never in a position to act. The boards provided a buffer and a dilution of responsibility and accountability from where it belongedâthat is to say, with the Howard government. The Uhrig review noted that in such circumstances:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... it is unlikely that good governance will prevail ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The opposition agrees with that. The way that Centrelink and HIC were being run, it is unlikely that good governance would prevail. As we have seen, both Centrelink and the HIC have been criticised repeatedly in reports by the Auditor-General for inadequate management systems and service outcomes. Uhrig found:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Where statutory authorities are failing to perform adequately, the electorate will expect governments to act.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">We on this side of the House agree. Nine years in government: well beyond time for the Howard government to act to fix what has become a mess.</para>
<para>The appointment of a minister for human services was supposedly to drive improvements in service delivery, but the Howard government has not overcome any of the significant problems in its service delivery agencies. We have to ask the question: what has the Minister for Human Services delivered in his first year in the job? There is precious little to show but a continued stream of critical reports on the services he claimed would make life easier. This legislation provides an opportunity to put the spotlight on the minister and to hold him accountable. The opposition will, from the passage of this legislation, look to the minister to concentrate less on reworking his web site and more on fixing the problems with his agencies. In his second reading speech, the minister said:</para>
<quote>
<para>Our 20 million customers have little regard for sectoral and bureaucratic differences. Instead they just expect the government to deliver services in a timely, efficient, cost-effective and easily understandable manner.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">How true. But how painfully have many millions of those âcustomersâ, as the minister calls Australians, experienced the failure of this government over nine years to deliver services in a timely, efficient, cost-effective and easily understandable manner. Instead, they have had overpayments and the debt collector chasing them, underpayments and no recourse, inadequate information and inefficient administration.</para>
<para>Earlier this year we had the debacle of the family payment recovery removed twice from peopleâs bank accounts. In error, Centrelink removed overpayments twice, which could leave people in a situation where they had no money in their bank accounts and could not meet other bills. We have seen the working over of the Centrelink interpreters. They were contracted out in 1998, they lost their travel payments, they lost their entitlement to holiday pay and they have had no pay rises or CPI adjustment since then. Now, from 1 August, with that contract going to a new company, they have lost their superannuation, they have been put on monthly payments and their contracts go only for three months. Then we can turn to the Health Insurance Commission for reports and rumours of widespread sackings. We need to know what is happening here. We need to know what is going on and I intend to ask a series of questions about this during the consideration in detail stage. I hope the government is able to enlighten us on some of these things.</para>
<para>Labor will support this bill in the hope that it leads to something better. The governance of the human services provided to Australians needs to be betterâmuch better. Now, with this legislation, it is clearer than ever that the buck stops with Minister Hockey and we will hold him accountable to fix the problems. We will be holding him accountableâthere will be no more buck-passing and no more blame-shifting. Therefore, I move:</para>

<para class="block">I want to stress to the House that this is no mere rhetorical second reading amendment. This issue of accountability and the responsibility of the minister, in this case Minister Hockey, for the performance of Centrelink, for the performance of the Child Support Agency and for the performance of the Medicare offices cannot be stressed too highly. The No. 1 issue facing our democracy today is a loss of public trust and confidence in the political system. Governance of our society is seriously weakened by the erosion of trust in elected representatives. People do not respond well to government initiatives, they lose interest in politics and, over time, their respect for the rule of law is diminished.</para>
<para>This lack of public trust seriously undermines the capacity of politicians to perform effectively as elected representatives. It undermines our credibility in fulfilling the leadership role for which we are elected. The restoration of public trust in politicians and politics requires government leadership and it requires government to be dedicated to advancing the public interest and committed to high standards of integrity, fairness, accountability and responsibility. It is time that we took action to win back the trust and confidence of the public. It is time to restore and raise the standards of political conduct. In moving the amendment that we have and in supporting the bill in the way that we have done I hope that we will make a contribution to enhanced public accountability in the area of service delivery for these vital government and community agencies.</para>

</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">... serious concern about failed management systems and service delivery by Centrelink and the Health Insurance Commission ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This is the Australian Labor Party saying that the very good members and staff of the Health Insurance Commission and Centrelink are hopelessly incompetent. I think those people in Centrelink and the Health Insurance Commission ought to know that the Labor Party thinks that they are hopelessly incompetent. They are not. Those of us who know the forerunner to Centrelink, the Department of Social Security, will know just how far Centrelink has moved and how good it is these days as a customer service organisation. I can competently speak for my electorate and for the people in Centrelink in my electorate and, indeed, in the region and I can say that, under the leadership of Peter Doutre and his team, Centrelink delivers for its customers what the government expects it will deliver and it delivers it in a timely and professional fashion.</para>
<para>I will not stand for, or listen to, unfounded criticism of the good people in Centrelink and the Health Insurance Commission. That is not on, because they are doing a fantastic job for Australia. I am sure the minister will be very happy, in due course, to answer the detailed questions from the member for Wills, because the ministerâs fundamental philosophy is that this bill is about delivering appropriate customer service in an accountable and timely way. That is what the bill is about, and the government will ensure that it does that.</para>
<para>It is not widely understood that the Department of Human Services distributes something like $2,600 a second in every hour of every day of every year. That is a lot of money and it is a big job. Sure, the Auditor-General can find things that are not right. And it is right that the Auditor-General should look at those things. They should be addressed and they will be addressed, but by and large, in the total scheme of things, the way that the Department of Human Services operates is extraordinarily professional and, in my experience, it does things very well.</para>
<para>It is the job of the Department of Human Services to make peopleâs lives easier and more secure through simpler and more effective access to government services and benefitsâand the department does that. It is right that the government should bring legislation to this parliament to make sure that that philosophy continues. It is right that the minister should have more direct control over Centrelink and the Health Insurance Commission. In that way we can ensure that the outcomes that the government intends are delivered to the people of Australia. Those outcomes will be delivered to the people of Australia. We will, through the mechanism of the <inline ref="R2406">Human Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline>, which we are debating tonight, improve accountability within the agencies. The member for Wills talked about job losses and he was quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> today.Â  The article said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The shadow minister for human services, Kelvin Thomson, said the Opposition would be asking questions about what jobs were to go when the Human Services Amendment Bill went into the committee stage this week.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The member for Wills is welcome to ask questions but surely he is not going to dispute the facts of the matter. The facts of the matter are that the government have expanded Medicare services and opened eight new offices. We have introduced Saturday trading in more than half the Medicare officesâit has certainly happened in my electorateâand we have extended weekday trading hours in 54 offices. That does not sound like staff cuts to me, yet the opposition wants to run these lines to scare employees of the federal government. I do not think that is fair.</para>
<para>It is fair that there will be CEOs in Centrelink and the Health Insurance Commission, who will be responsible for the operations of those organisations. Those CEOs should report to the minister, and this bill will ensure that that will happen. It will also ensure that the highest levels of customer service are delivered in a cost-effective way. Cost-effectiveness does not require chopping staff, because staff are organisationsâ best assets. The government understand that but the opposition do not seem to understand it. This is reflected in other areas of government policy, particularly industrial relations, where the opposition question the governmentâs record. Goodness me, we welcome questioning of the governmentâs record, particularly on employment!</para>
<para>I guess all of us know that when the Howard government was elected in March 1996 unemployment was 8.2 per cent and it is now five per cent and heading lower. If we are able to bring landmark new changes and reform to industrial relationsâand I am sure we willâwe will get that unemployment figure even lower. The best thing you can do for a person in Australia is give them a job. Unemployment right now is at its lowest level since November 1976.</para>
<para>We are not going to embark on some crazy job-cutting exercise in Centrelink or the Health Insurance Commission just for the sake of it. We will allow the CEO of each organisation to look at the organisation and to deliver services with the highest levels of customer service possible, in the most cost-effective way. Those ideas are summed up in the philosophy that we have often heard the Minister for Health and Ageing repeat in this parliamentâand it is trueâthat, because of what we have been able to do, the government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had. And the government will continue doing good things for Medicare.</para>
<para>It is clear that the Health Insurance Commission cannot continue to be called the Health Insurance Commission, because it will no longer be a commission. That is why the government is suggesting that its name be changed, in this bill, to Medicare Australia. I am pretty proud of that, and I do not see why the opposition should be at all concerned that the name will change.</para>
<para>An advisory body which will advise the minister and the government will be established for both organisations. The Prime Minister announced late last year that it would be established so that the government can continue to receive advice from relevant sectors of the community about delivery issues and service improvement proposals in the human services area. The advisory board is going to report directly to the minister. That is a good thing. The board members will be selected on their ability to facilitate consultation and analyse the implementation of policy issues that affect all of the agencies. Work has commenced to establish the advisory board. However, it is expected that the first meeting will not be held before early 2006. The Uhrig report was supportive of the use of advisory boards to ensure the contribution of business and the broader community to improve implementation of government policy. This is all about making sure that we give the best possible customer service to people who deal with these federal government agencies. I compliment the staff of both Centrelink and the Health Insurance Commission on the wonderful, professional job they do for all Australians. The government appreciates their service. I recommend to the House that this bill be accepted.</para>

<para>âThere is no doubt that the <inline ref="R2406">Human Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline> is an acknowledgement that the Howard government has failed to deliver accountability processes that work in this very important area of government service. The bill makes governance changes to Centrelink and the Health Insurance Commission in response to the Uhrig review of the corporate governance of statutory authorities and office holders. These changes are: the abolition of the governance boards of Centrelink and the HIC; replacement of the HIC, an authority with a separate legal personality from the Commonwealth, with Medicare Australia, a body that will form part of the Commonwealth; the creation of the offices of chief executive officer of Centrelink and Medicare Australia, with statutory functions; and the establishment of new governance arrangements under which the CEOs will be directly accountable to the Minister for Human Services.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>These changes are an acknowledgement by the government that they have failed in the key area of accountability. It is clear that the systems put in place for both the HIC and Centrelink have failed to provide an adequate level of accountability to the government and, therefore, to the community. Let us start with Centrelink. The Howard governmentâs vision for Centrelink has failed. Its corporate structure has failed to provide accountability and, most importantly, has failed to provide better service for the community. These were the two things promised by the Prime Minister when he announced back in 1997 that he was setting up Centrelink. At the time, he said Centrelinkâs new corporate structure would âenhance responsiveness and accountabilityâ. In fact, it has done neither of those things. Many of the seven million Australians who deal with Centrelink, including around 50,000 people in my electorate, will tell you they continue to have difficulties in their dealings with Centrelink. Like many members of this House, I find that the bulk of constituents who come into my office have complaints about Centrelink. Make no mistake about it: this is not the fault of the staff; they do a great job. It is the fault of the management systems put in place by the government.</para>
<para>I would like to speak for a moment about the dedication of many Centrelink staff. They are dedicated, hard working and community minded. In my dealings with them locally, I have found them to be very professional and very committed. For example, recently a male person who had lost his memory came into my electorate office. He was suffering from some forms of mental illness and had great difficulty in establishing his identity and finding his way. Centrelink staff at Tweed Heads were incredibly helpful in giving assistance in very difficult circumstances to a person who was under a great deal of stress at the time. The Centrelink call centre at Tweed Heads has recently been named the top call centre in New South Wales, having won the Australian Teleservices Associationâs New South Wales award. I commend the staff for that. It is a great achievement by Centrelink staff who do a very good job under difficult circumstances. I also note that their morning tea club sponsors a little girl from Chad in Africa.</para>
<para>The staff are dedicated and do a hard job. But, as I said, it is the failure of the management systems put in place by this government that is putting staff under pressure and causing the difficulties and complaints we are hearing from the community all the time. This bill is an acknowledgement of the governmentâs mismanagement. I am pleased to support this legislation because it makes the government and the minister directly accountable for these issues. The government will no longer be able to blame its mismanagement of Centrelink on a board of directors. The minister will now have to take responsibility for the management of this important government agency.</para>
<para>I now want to look at the Health Insurance Commission. The management and accountability problems faced by the Health Insurance Commission will also be addressed in this billâand not before time. Again the government has bungled and mismanaged a very important agency which deals with sensitive personal and health information. Audit report No. 24 found that up to half a million Medicare cards were likely to be held by dead people. This is the level of success of the management system put in place by this government!</para>
<para>This same government allows entire communities to go without Medicare services. There is one issue I would specifically like to address, and it is in the Byron Shire in my electorate. Thanks to this governmentâs mismanagement, there is no Medicare office in the entire Byron Shire, which takes in the towns of Mullumbimby, Byron Bay, Ocean Shores, Bangalow, Brunswick Heads and the many surrounding villages and communities. It is a very large area which does not have a Medicare office. In fact, the closest Medicare offices are located at Ballina, Lismore or Tweed Heads, which means at least a two-hour round trip for most residents of Byron Shire. Because they cannot even afford this two-hour trip to a Medicare centre, some post their forms in to be processed and then wait two weeks or sometimes longer. These people cannot afford to wait. This wait is too long, and it is not right that there is no Medicare centre in this shire, one of the fastest growing areas in Australia. Every day people are telling me how desperately they need a Medicare office in this area.</para>
<para>At the last election, Labor promised to set up a Medicare office in Mullumbimby. The community responded very positively to this promise, because they knew how important such an office is. Mullumbimby would be a great location in which to have a Medicare centre. It is central to most places in the Byron Shire and it also houses many other services, such as the local council chambers. It would indeed be a great location for a Medicare centre given its proximity to and accessibility by all those residents of the Byron Shire who are desperately crying out for a Medicare office.</para>
<para>While the HIC would not provide essential Medicare services to areas like Byron Bay, with these changes to accountability, the government and the minister are directly responsible for the fact that Byron Shire has no access to a Medicare centre. As I said, this is an issue of much concern within my community, one that people raise with me on many different occasions. So I urge the minister, once this legislation has been passed, to immediately take steps to set up a Medicare office in the Byron Shire. It is ridiculous that the 30,000 people living in the shire do not have access to a Medicare office. I am pleased that the government has recognised the error of its ways, and I support what this bill does: make the minister accountable. I am pleased because the minister is now directly accountable to this parliament for decisions made in relation to the very important management of Medicare services.</para>

<para>âI rise to speak in the second reading debate of the <inline ref="R2406">Human Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline>. I would like to make the observation that, in his comments earlier, the member for Herbert was talking about staff cuts, but the shadow minister for human resources, the member for Wills, was obviously referring to the uncertainty which has been created in the Health Insurance Commission and Centrelink as to staff cuts under the new administrative arrangements. I say to the member for Herbert, and to other members on the other side of House who are in this place now: to provide the necessary reassurance for the staff of the HIC and Centrelink, let us hear directly from the minister, when he finally gets here, that there will be no staff cuts. Let the minister come into this place and say, âNo, there will not be staff cuts.â Let him give that assurance, but if he cannot give that assurance then we will know just what the governmentâs agenda is.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>On 23 June this year, the Minister for Human Services introduced this bill into the House. In his second reading speech, the minister summarised the changes to be made to the Health Insurance Commission and Centrelink which arise from this proposed legislation. In the interests of better corporate governance, the minister stated that these agencies need to âmove closer to government to ensure that their daily operations deliver the outcomes that government and taxpayers expectâ. The minister went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Indeed, it is important that the organisations be brought under strong ministerial control.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Following the changes to be made by the bill, the management of each organisation will be vested in a chief executive officer. Both CEOs will have direct responsibility for the performance of these organisations, reporting to the minister through the Secretary to the Department of Human Services. There will also be a name change for the Health Insurance Commission, which will be rebadged as Medicare Australia. As was said previously, that is a great Labor name. Rebadging is an expensive task and should be undertaken only at the lowest possible cost to the taxpayer. Unfortunately, as we have seen only too often, rebadging is yet another activity that often delivers undue benefits to the consultants, art designers and advisers involved, rather than to the taxpayers themselves. We urge the minister to keep a close eye on expenditure in this regard as it is not the best use of taxpayersâ dollars when there are so many clear deficiencies in the health service delivery system. We also ask the minister to keep the House informed of the costs of rebadging, to ensure that they do not become excessive. The opposition will be monitoring these costs very closely.</para>
<para>Those of us on this side of the House will support this bill, subject to the amendment moved by the shadow minister for human services which calls on the House to note:</para>

</item>
</list>
</quote>
<para class="block">The very fact that the government is proposing the changes in this bill is an indictment of the governance structure which the government has presided over for so long, but any moves which make the Health Insurance Commission and Centrelink more responsive to the needs of Australian citizens are welcome and obviously long overdue. The Auditor-General has exposed in a report a number of deficiencies in the operations of Centrelink and the Health Insurance Commission. The Auditor uncovered major problems in Centrelinkâs complaints-handling system which are clear impediments to improving the services provided to Centrelinkâs customers. Clearly, Centrelinkâs complaints-handling system needs to be dramatically improved if the system is to be more responsive to its customers. It is also hoped that under the new arrangements the CEO will initiate improvements as a matter of urgency.</para>
<para>In another report, the Auditor examined Centrelinkâs so-called âvalue creation workshopsâ and found that the major beneficiaries of the workshops were the consultants who ran them, rather than Centrelinkâs customers, as there was no implementation of any of the findings of the workshops. I must admit that I am very suspicious of the workshop approach to improving such services. The consultants who run such workshops invariably speak in a language of their own which can only be described as highly paid psychobabble. These types of consultants are all too often feeding at the government teat, often earning themselves fees greatly in excess of the value of the services provided. The very fact that the Auditor found that the findings of the workshops were pretty much ignored demonstrates the waste of taxpayersâ moneyâan easy $4 million for the consultants involved.</para>
<para>The Health Insurance Commission has also received bad report cards from the Auditor-General. Specifically, the Auditor criticised HICâs information management systems. It was found that up to 500,000 Medicare cards were probably held by people who have already passed awayâmany on the governmentâs frontbench might fit that category. A subsequent Auditorâs report was critical of the commission for the poor administration of health cards. If the bill being debated today delivers significant improvements to the services provided to Australian citizens by HIC and Centrelink, then it will be a positive step. It will be beholden on the minister to ensure that such improvements are delivered.</para>
<para>In my electorate of Swan, we have many concerns about the delivery of health services at the coalface. The major concern is that there is only one Medicare office in Swan, in Cannington at the south-east end of the electorate. I have raised this issue many times in the House over the last few years, but, unfortunately, the government and the Health Insurance Commission have failed to listen to my concerns and they continue to treat the people of Swan with disregard.</para>
<para>My electorate has a large number of elderly residents by dint of it covering many of Perthâs older inner city suburbs. One of the electorateâs major centres is the City of Belmontâone of the largest-growing local government areas in Perth. Currently, over 20,000 people live in the local area. The lack of a Medicare office in Belmont means that those living in that area must travel to an agency in East Victoria Park, around 10 kilometres away, or even further to Cannington to access the services of a full Medicare office. I do not need to inform members of this House that it is often the elderly who are particularly in need of efficient access to Medicare offices. To make things doubly hard, many of the elderly in the area are dependent on public transport, making it even more difficult for them to access Medicare services.</para>
<para>Despite pressure from the local community through me, our calls for Medicare to establish a full office in Belmont have been ignored by the Howard government. I have met with constituents who have told me that when using public transport from the Belmont area it takes them almost two hours to catch two buses to East Victoria Park, with a walk to the Medicare office at the end of the bus trip. Then the trip must be repeated to return home. It has truly become a day out for many residents of Belmont to visit the nearest Medicare agency. To visit the actual Medicare office in Cannington, which is often required for certain processing of doctorsâ and specialistsâ bills, is even more time consuming and inconvenient.</para>
<para>I believe that the case for a full Medicare office in Belmont is clear. Of the 20,000 residents I spoke of earlier, the Belmont area has about 7,000âwhether they be students, young families, people with disabilities, the elderly or othersâon low incomes who would stand to benefit considerably if a Medicare office was located nearby. As far as the government is concerned, these people are second-class citizens when it comes to access to one of the most basic services provided by the Commonwealth through the Health Insurance Commission. I draw the Houseâs attention to the Health Insurance Commission web site, which states:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">HIC is a customer-focused service organisation delivering national health programs to the Australian community with a world wide reputation for reliable, secure and innovative delivery of health claims, payments and information management.</para>
<para class="block">As one of the largest and most efficient health benefit and information processing agencies in the world, HIC has a connection with every Australian resident, every doctor and every pharmacy and with many other members of the health and IT sector.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">If the Health Insurance Commission is âcustomer focusedâ and has âa connection with every Australian residentâ, as it claims, then I ask: why has it failed to connect with those residents of my electorate who are denied convenient, easy access to a Medicare office? After all, the universal nature of Medicare should be a fundamental tenet of health policy in this country. According to the government:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Medicare is Australiaâs universal health insurance scheme which:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>makes health care affordable for all Australians;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>gives all Australians access to health care services with priority according to clinical need; and</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>provides a high quality of care.</para>
</item>
</list>
</quote>
<para class="block">When one considers the service availability to residents of the Belmont area in my electorate, it can hardly be argued that all Australians are given access to health care services.</para>
<para>I would like to contrast the experiences of those in my electorate of Swan with the happier experiences of those in Minister Hockeyâs electorate of North Sydney. According to the ministerâs web site, the services at the Medicare office in his own electorate have been upgraded. That is rightâit is a disgrace. It is a disgrace that the minister can upgrade services in his own electorate while those in urgent need of better access to Medicare in Swan are denied these improvements.</para>
<para>It is often said by those on the other side of the House that the government is the best friend Medicare ever had. Unfortunately, that depends on where you live. If you are in real areas of need, such as in Belmont in my electorate of Swan, you miss out. If you are fortunate enough to live in the ministerâs electorate, hey, guess what! He is going to improve your Medicare services. That is unacceptable and it is a disgrace.</para>
<para>The bill before the House seeks to address some of the problems and inefficiencies in the delivery of services through Centrelink and the Health Insurance Commission. As I said before, subject to the shadow ministerâs amendment, Labor will support this bill as at the very least it offers some hope that the administration of these organisations will be improved. I use the opportunity of this debate to raise in the House, yet again, the urgent need for the government to establish another Medicare office in the Belmont area of my electorate, as would have happened had Labor gained government at the last election.</para>

<para>âI wish to summarise the debate on the second reading of the <inline ref="R2406">Human Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline>. Of course, we are talking about the fantastic new Department of Human Services. On 22 October last year, the Prime Minister announced the creation of the new Department of Human Services, which brings together six service delivery agencies that administer $80 billion worth of human services each yearâI emphasise that: $80 billion. The new Department of Human Services brings together the agencies responsible for the administration of policy, including the Health Insurance Commission and Centrelink which are the subject of the Human Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The creation of the Department of Human Services and the principles in this bill reflect the strong commitment of this government to excellence in public administration and improving the delivery of services to the many Australians who have contact with these agencies. The new Department of Human Services has been charged with ensuring that the government is able to get the best value for taxpayers, and at the same time the best value for clients, as it delivers policy with an emphasis on continuous service improvement and a whole-of-government approach.</para>
<para>The Department of Human Services is already implementing service delivery improvements through agency cooperation, improved communication with customers and the use of technology to make access to health and welfare benefits much easier. These are far-reaching changes to the integration of services which touch the lives of so many Australians. This will occur in times of crisis, for example during droughtâwe have recently been experiencing one of the worst droughts on recordâor at times of great joy, for example providing payments on the birth of a new baby.</para>
<para>The Department of Human Services has an important role to play in the delivery of the governmentâs policy for encouraging people to move from welfare to work. Already, work has begun by improving the rate of referral of those on parenting payments to the Job Network, and more work is under way to help people through rehabilitation assessment and assistance in returning to work. The Prime Minister has also announced that the new department will ensure that the development and the delivery of government services are placed under strong ministerial control, with clear lines of responsibility. These initiatives of the Prime Minister are reflected in the bill.</para>
<para>I will summarise the bill. The bill amends the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 and the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Act 1997 to establish new governance arrangements which will bring both the Health Insurance Commissionâthe HICâand Centrelink closer to government and improve governance and accountability in both bodies. We have recently seen in the private sector the problems that can arise from lack of governance and accountability. Through measures such as those contained in this bill, the government has moved to ensure that such issues are not translated into the public sector.</para>
<para>The bill ensures the greater accountability of both the HIC and Centrelink in terms of the implementation of policy and delivery of services. For example, the bill provides that the Centrelink chief executive officer, rather than the chairman of the board, as is currently the case, will be accountable for Centrelinkâs expenditure. The bill will also bring the HIC and Centrelink closer to government by abolishing the governance boards of Centrelink and the HIC and by creating the new statutory offices of Chief Executive Officer of Centrelink and Chief Executive Officer of the new Medicare Australia, which will be directly accountable to the Minister for Human Services. The HIC will be brought closer to government by becoming part of the Commonwealth for financial purposes. It will become a prescribed agency for the purposes of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. As well, HIC staff will become subject to the Public Service Act 1999.</para>
<para>The bill is not about the politicisation of these two bodies. It is appropriate to bring these core government services closer to government in order to ensure that both the HIC and Centrelink have a clear understanding of the governmentâs intentions so they can best deliver government policy. As the HIC will no longer be a commission, it is appropriate to change its name. As I foreshadowed earlier in this speech, the bill will rename the HIC as Medicare Australia. The name Medicare is well known by most Australians, and the new name will help customers to identify readily with the organisation. The name change has resulted in a number of consequential provisions to other legislation, as set out in the bill.</para>
<para>Finally, the activities of the new Medicare Australia and Centrelink will not change as a result of the bill. Both agencies will continue to deliver quality services to the Australian public in a cost-effective manner. Transitional arrangements in the bill will ensure that governance changes do not disrupt service delivery to customers. Quite obviously, many of the customers of Centrelink, for example, are some of the most vulnerable in Australia and are dependent on regular government support.</para>
<para>Turning to the background to this bill: the Uhrig review was, of course, critical. The bill represents this governmentâs strong commitment to ensuring appropriate government principles, as I have said. The governance changes in Centrelink and the HIC in this bill are part of the implementation of the governmentâs response to the review of corporate governance of statutory authorities and office holders carried out by Mr John Uhrig. The objective of Mr Uhrigâs review was to identify issues surrounding existing governance arrangements and to provide options for government to improve performance and get the best from statutory authorities, office holders and their accountability frameworks.</para>
<para>One of the principal recommendations of the Uhrig review was that governance boards should be utilised in statutory authorities only where they can be given the full power to act. This has not been the case with Centrelink and the HIC. The Uhrig report recommended two templates to be used to assist current government structures: a board template and an executive management template. The HIC and Centrelink were both assessed under the executive management template. The changes made by this bill are, then, consistent with that template.</para>
<para>Another of the principal recommendations of John Uhrigâs report was that portfolio departments should provide the principal source of advice to ministers. In accordance with those recommendations, the HIC and Centrelink both now report to the Minister for Human Services through the Secretary of the Department of Human Services. This change is reflected in current arrangements, rather than in the bill itself.</para>
<para>The governance changes to be made by this bill will be complemented by other changes that do not require legislation. For example, as announced by the Prime Minister on 22 October 2004, a human services advisory board will be established to ensure that government continues to receive advice from relevant sectors of the community about delivery issues and service improvement proposals in the human services area. This is, of course, of critical importance in a country like Australia, where remote rural service delivery needs are so different fromâfor exampleâthe urban population on the eastern seaboard.</para>
<para>The Uhrig report was supportive of the use of advisory boards to ensure the contribution of business and broader community perspectives to improve the implementation of government policy. The advisory board will assist the Minister for Human Services by testing the potential impact of policies on the community and identifying opportunities to implement policy more effectively. The human services advisory board will report directly to the Minister for Human Services and the board members will be selected on their ability to facilitate consultation and analyse the implementation of policy issues that affect all human services agencies. We expect that the advisory board will hold its first meeting in 2006.</para>
<para>In keeping with the Uhrig recommendations, the government will publicly issue statements of expectations to the chief executive officers of Centrelink and Medicare Australia to clarify expectations, and the chief executive officers will reply with statements of intent. Uhrig indicated in his report that statements of expectations and intent should include those values central to the success of the authority, including those relating to relationships with outsiders. The statements of expectations and intent to and from the HIC and Centrelink chief executive officers will be made public towards the end of the year.</para>
<para>This government has high expectations for the arrangements that will come into force through the <inline ref="R2406">Human Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005. It moves forward with those expectations clearly articulated and agencies that are appropriately structured to implement the work that the government intends to see carried out in its current term of office and beyond.</inline>
</para>
<para>We have not had a very long debate on this billâthere were only three or four speakers. I would like to comment on the contribution of the shadow minister for human services, the member for Wills, who said he was concerned about the corporate structure. As I have just explained to the member for Wills, the Minister for Human Services will be more accountable for the responsiveness of Centrelink as a result of the amendments in this bill. This is, in fact, the purpose of the bill.</para>
<para>The bill will not require additional financial support from the budget. The costs of governance changes are being absorbed as business costs associated with the operation of Centrelink, as you would expect. A second reading amendment has been moved. Let me remind the House that Centrelink and the HIC deliver billions of dollars worth of services each year. Centrelink delivered some $63 billion worth of income support payments last year. Both agencies continue to work to address any problems that occur, and it is inevitable that they will occur from time to time. However, if you look at the volume of the work that these two agencies do, you will see that the level of error is very low. For example, Centrelink had a less than five per cent error rate in payments last year.</para>
<para>This bill is about the improved governance of Centrelink as recently recommended in the Uhrig report. The boards have served the agencies well by bringing experience and stakeholder views to the operation of the organisations. However, given that they have not had the full power to act, it is timely to evolve them so that we can move towards best practice standards in governance in the public sector. The measures in this bill are precisely drafted to ensure the accountability of the Minister for Human Services and to provide the structures for the minister to continue to improve the ability of the agencies to provide worldâs best services to Australiansâthe sorts of services that all Australians expect and deserve.</para>
<para>I refer to some comments by the member for Richmond. The changes are about improving the governance of HIC and Centrelink. We are not saying that this bill is about correcting some disaster or set of problems. This bill is about evolving a complex set of agencies with an enormous task to do on behalf of the Australian community, and as we stress with all our agencies it is about continuous improvement. As I have said, the bill will make the Minister for Human Services even more accountable and will make for a much more customer responsive agency.</para>
<para>The member for Wills referred to his concerns about Centrelink interpreters. Let me reassure him that the sessional interpreters referred to in recent media remarks by the opposition spokesman are in fact self-employed contractors. The management of these contractors was outsourced in 1999, and since then there have been three suppliers successively managing the contracts. Sessional contract interpreters have always been paid under contractor rates and conditions. In relation to superannuation guarantee payments, government contracts require that suppliers meet relevant legislation. The supplier is aware of this and has said it will comply with the law.</para>
<para>There are 204 sessional interpreters, a number many fewer than some of the media reports suggest. They are deployed in Centrelink offices where there is a significant demand for specific languages. I know that in my own local Centrelink offices in the Goulburn Valley there is a demand for dozens of different language interpreters. The government ensures that interpreters are provided where they are needed, and I can say from personal experience that many of them are excellent and available at very short notice. The greatest demand for these services is of course by newly arrived customers, particularly our refugee intake, who need interpreters urgently and promptly, and they are given excellent interpretation. Contract interpreters have always given Centrelink the flexibility to deploy resources according to changing needs to ensure that customers get the services they require.</para>
<para>Finally, I want to make some comments about drought assistance measures. Members of the opposition seemed to imply that drought assistance has been somehow wanting in this country. Let me remind them that Centrelink has paid over $417 million in income support, which is just one component of EC, to farming families in drought declared areas since December 2002. Over 6,800 farming families are receiving income support payments from Centrelink. That is an extraordinary reach of families, going literally from the tip of eastern Australia, down to Tasmania and across to Western Australia. Exceptional circumstance declarations are for an initial period of two years, and that may be extended for 12 months at a time. We have recently seen some of these declarations extended into a third year, which is quite an extraordinary circumstance for Australia but unfortunately urgently required.</para>
<para>We are already evolving the exceptional circumstances processes and certainly the process by which the potential participants hear about the program and how they engage with it. For example, there is a new communications strategy going out to highlight the changes made most recently with the Prime Ministerâs announcement of different asset test applications and off-farm income earning capabilities. Indeed, from 1 October 2005, Centrelink will issue exceptional circumstances certificates, which will simplify the application process for farmers. Let me say that, as the parliamentary secretary assisting Minister Hockey, I have the privilege of helping to administer the exceptional circumstances program. I can say, as the member for Murrayâwhere 100 per cent of the electorate is now drought declared in various industry sectorsâthat I could not give more praise than I do to Centrelink officers. They did an extraordinary job in getting information out quickly to desperate farmers, some of whom depended on food parcels and some of whom were in the most extreme circumstances of zero income, stress, their family having to leave schools and universities and losing their farm labour, leaving them without sufficient workers to do the task. I cannot praise Centrelink enough for the work they did in my electorate, and I know that has been the case in other places across Australia.</para>
<para>I commend this bill to the House. It is another example of the Howard governmentâs determination to have worldâs best practice when it comes to government policy delivery.</para>

<para>âI wish to use the consideration in detail stage to put before the government a number of questions, particularly relating to the Health Insurance Commission. It would have been preferable had the Minister for Human Services been here, but in his absence I will nevertheless put these questions to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration. Whatever responses we can receive to these questions would be welcome.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In the budget the Health Insurance Commission was allocated 100 fewer staff than last year. My first question is: what is the reason for the budget cuts to the Health Insurance Commission? Is it the case that the Managing Director of the Health Insurance Commission told staff in an email last month that the repercussions would go beyond temporary staff and natural attrition? What is the scope of the restructure taking place in the Health Insurance Commission? Are the cuts that are currently taking place limited to the 100 fewer staff, which was outlined in the budget, or could they be greater? Is it the case that 11 branch heads in the Health Insurance Commission have been told that they are to go? With how many staff have consultations begun on separation under the terms of the Health Insurance Commission certified agreement? Is it the case that these cuts are going to be limited to the Canberra headquarters or will there be cuts in regional offices as well? Had there been a previous promise by management to Health Insurance Commission staff that there would be no mass sackings? Is the parliamentary secretary able to tell us what is referred to in the Health Insurance Commission as the âtalent poolâ and how many staff are currently designated in the talent pool? Does the government envisage that this number will increase during the restructure? Is this situation a result of governance problems that this legislation is seeking to address? Was there a failure of budget management and oversight of the executive by the Health Insurance Commission board? Can the government provide us with a guarantee that staff cuts are not going to impact on customer service? Health Insurance Commission Online says that by 2005 the Health Insurance Commission expects to be receiving 60 per cent of its patient claims and 83 per cent of bulk-bill claims via electronic means. Is that on track? HIC Online also goes on to say that, by 2010, 100 per cent of claims are expected to be lodged electronically. What would be the expected impact on staffing were this target to be achieved?</para>
<para>We mentioned in debate the issue of the governmentâs intention to rebadge the HIC as Medicare Australia. We would like to know what the cost of that rebadging will be. We also hear that there may be a government advertising campaign on the rebadging of the organisation. The question again is: what will that cost be? I also ask the parliamentary secretary whether the government can outline the non-health services that the Health Insurance Commission is now carrying out for other agencies. What is the reason for the Health Insurance Commission taking on these roles?</para>
<para>Finally, now that we have a situation under this legislation where the minister is to be held accountable for the Health Insurance Commission, can we get advice on what action the minister has taken since the Auditor-General reported in January this year that up to half a million dead people held Medicare cards? What action has been taken to address this problem? Has the problem been fixed?</para>

<para>âThe member for Wills had a lot of detail in those questions. I think it would be best to respect his need for information with a detailed response. I will therefore take on notice, if I may, a lot of those questions. We will make sure that you have those responses quite urgently.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Let me just say that the Health Insurance Commissionâs total revenue funding for 2004-05 was some $594.2 million. In the next financial year, 2005-06, it dropped to $567 millionânot a significant reductionâand that revenue reduction was very much reflecting the timing of new policy proposals in recent years and increases in savings owed to government from prior year investments. But I want to stress that, like any service delivery organisation, the HIC has to be responsible in managing its budget while maintaining a high level of customer service. That is the challenge. In line with the governmentâs service delivery improvement agenda, some rebalancing of expenditure is now under way between the HICâs state offices and the national office so that it can build its capability and continue to deliver greater customer service.</para>
<para>All administrative costs have been reviewed to achieve savings, and resources are being directed to policy activities. Indeed, the HICâs managing director has issued a number of messages to staff. Of course, we wish to make sure that staff fully understand these evaluation processes. The key messages have included that living within the means and investing in our future are key and dual challenges and that there is a continual monitoring of all staffing and national functions and priorities throughout the year. There has been review, and there will continue to be review, of all administrative costs to achieve savings wherever possible.</para>
<para>As I said, the managing director has made clear in his messages that, where staff reductions are necessary, every effort will be made to minimise impacts on HICâs permanent staff. Use of natural attrition, review of fixed term and temporary staffing arrangements and other administrative cost reductions are some of the actions that have been taken to date. A restructure of the HICâs national office has also seen a small number of senior executive positions disappear. The HIC senior management are working with the affected people to support them through this process.</para>
<para>Human Services ensures a high level of customer service. Its job is to do that across all of Australiaâs government health and welfare programs. In the last 12 months the government has expanded Medicare services by opening eight new offices. It has also introduced Saturday trading in more than half of the Medicare offices and extended weekday trading hours in 54 offices. Often, in terms of staff employment and deployment, there is evolution and revolution going on as we strive to meet the demands of customers. Having just given that brief background, I will certainly make sure that the questions of the member for Wills are answered as he has presented them to us.</para>

<para>âThe <inline ref="R2292">Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2293">Building and Construction Industry Improvement (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2005</inline> were introduced in part by replicating, with some modifications, four of the chapters of the 2003 substantive bill. Labor opposed the <inline ref="R1922">Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003</inline> and is also opposed to the <inline ref="R2292">Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005</inline>. This bill, like its predecessor, is a flawed piece of legislation. It will not assist in the satisfactory resolution of industrial issues in the building and construction industry. It will in fact have an opposite and deleterious effect. The bill also potentially endangers the health and safety of employees in the building and construction industry by adding unnecessary complexity to the resolution of occupational health and safety issues.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As a general proposition, Labor is opposed to creating specific jurisdictions for specific industries. This bill changes the rules retrospectively and in a way which substantially penalises employees, unions and employers currently participating in making enterprise bargains in a legal and reasonable way. Again, as a general proposition, Labor is opposed to retrospective legislation, particularly where that imposes retrospective penalties. As well, the bill has defined the construction industry so broadly that employers and employees who have never previously considered themselves as part of the industry are covered by the provisions of the bill and thereby exposed to prosecution and penalties for participating in what they regard as, and what are currently, legal bargaining activities. The bill places further restrictions upon employees and their unions in exercising their right to strike and, as a consequence, brings Australia in breach of ILO convention 87 even more so than is already the case. In addition, the bill overrides state jurisdictions in a way which creates new complexities rather than provides simplicity. As a result, the above provisions of this bill combine to create massive uncertainty in one of Australiaâs largest and most important industries. As a consequence, Labor is opposed to the bill.</para>
<para>In passing, I note that amendments have been circulated. Those amendments run to over 30 pages. I, of course, have had no opportunity to examine the substance or the detail of those amendments. No notice of them was given and no courtesy was extended in a professional way from the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations or his office. On a day like today, when the Howard government gets all power under the sun with control of the Senate, we have seen another example in the course of the day of the arrogance which occurs when someone gets too close to the sun. I suspect that many of the amendments circulated were contained in the 2003 bill, and with a bit of luck I will have the opportunity overnight to consider the detail thereof and make some comments tomorrow in the consideration in detail stage.</para>
<para>The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations introduced the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005 and the Building and Construction Industry Improvement (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2005, which we are now debating concurrently, into the House on 9 MarchÂ 2005. When the legislation was introduced into the House, the minister announced that it would operate retrospectively from 9 MarchÂ 2005. The Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005 reintroduces in part the enforcement provisions contained in the governmentâs former Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003. That 2003 bill was passed by the House of Representatives on 4Â DecemberÂ 2003. It was referred to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee, which reported on 21 JuneÂ 2004. The 2003 bill lapsed when parliament was prorogued for the 2004 federal election.</para>
<para>The Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 was developed as the governmentâs legislative response to the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry. The Building and Construction Industry Improvement (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2005 provides for machinery additions related to the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005. Nine chapters of the 2003 bill have not been re-presented, together with some content of the remaining four chapters, thereby creating this substantive 2005 bill. As I mentioned, I suspect that some of the volume of amendments which have been circulated in the last hour or so will contain further provisions from the 2003 bill.</para>
<para>The bills as presented were never expressed to reintroduce the governmentâs complete legislative response to the Cole royal commission. It was always expected that that would occur at a later date, and that later date has potentially arrived. The Howard governmentâs primary motivation in bringing forward this version of the bill is to stymie attempts to negotiate new enterprise agreements prior to the expiry of the current round of agreements in the building and construction industry in OctoberÂ 2005.</para>
<para>The four chapters of the earlier 2003 bill included in this 2005 version of the bill are: chapterÂ 1ââPreliminaryâ, which defines the coverage of the bill and sets out a series of key definitions including the new retrospective date of effect; chapterÂ 6ââIndustrial actionâ, which clarifies when industrial action is lawful and when it is not; chapterÂ 12ââEnforcementâ, which significantly increases penalties for unlawful industrial action and provides immediate access to courts to pursue damages; and chapterÂ 13ââMiscellaneousâ, which provides for various courts to be conferred with the jurisdiction to deal with matters relating to the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005.</para>
<para>The bill introduces the following measures to apply retrospectively from 9 MarchÂ 2005. Firstly, the bill increases the maximum penalties to $110,000 for a body corporate and $22,000 for an individual where unlawful industrial action is taken. Secondly, the bill makes certain forms of industrial action unlawful and provides access to sanctions against unlawful industrial action in the form of injunctions, pecuniary penalties and compensation for loss. Thirdly, in particular the bill makes industrial action taken by unions prior to the nominal expiry date of certified agreements unprotected and as a consequence unlawful. Fourthly, if a union takes industrial action in support of its negotiations, it may be exposed retrospectively to fines of up toÂ $110,000 and uncapped damages; individuals may face fines of up toÂ $22,000. This is expressly intended to severely limit the ability to negotiate bargaining outcomes. And, finally, the bill shifts the onus onto employees to prove that a reasonable concern exists where action is taken based on an imminent occupational health and safety risk. This is a significant safety issue. The building and construction industry is one which is particularly hazardous. Over the last 10 years, for example, there has been an average of 50 workplace fatalities each year in the industry. This bill, by imposing financial penalties upon those employees who cease to work in what they regard as an unsafe environment, potentially puts the health and safety of employees at risk.</para>
<para>The legislation also encroaches on state industrial relations jurisdiction. The unlawful industrial action provisions will apply to industrial action in the industry taken by, or that adversely affects, a constitutional corporation and will override state industrial relations regulation. The Howard government has also indicated that it will consider on a case-by-case basis intervening in the public interest where employers use existing mechanisms under the Workplace Relations Act 1996. This is an unprecedented level of government intervention in support of employers in bargaining negotiations at the industry level.</para>
<para>Turning to provisions of the 2005 bill, the bill introduces specific measures regarding unlawful industrial action in the construction industry and replicates the unlawful industrial action and ancillary provisions of the 2003 bill. ChapterÂ 6 renders certain kinds of industrial action unlawful and amends what may be protected action for the purposes of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. âUnlawful actionâ is defined as all constitutionally-connected, industrially-motivated building industrial action that is not âexcluded actionâ. Only protected action under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 as amended by this bill and Australian workplace agreements industrial action will be âexcluded actionâ. âExcluded actionâ also encompasses action by an employee based on a reasonable concern about an imminent occupational health and safety risk where the employee does not unreasonably fail to comply with an employerâs direction to perform other available work. However, the onus is on the employee to prove the action is based on a reasonable concern.</para>
<para>Industrial action is not protected where the employment of employees is subject to a certified agreement, is taken to support or advance a claim and is taken prior to the nominal expiry date of an agreement. The unlawful industrial action provisions will apply broadly across the industry and extend to action in relation to industrial disputes, awards or agreements under the Workplace Relations Act 1996. The provisions will apply to industrial action in the industry taken by, or that which adversely affects, a constitutional corporation and thus will override state industrial relations regulation. Civil penalties of up toÂ $110,000 for organisations and up toÂ $22,000 for individuals will apply. In addition, parties who take unlawful action may be ordered by a court to pay substantial uncapped compensation to any parties affected by the unlawful industrial action.</para>
<para>The bill also provides for increased penalties for contravention of the strike pay provisions of part VIIIA of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. Actions against offending parties will be able to be brought by inspectors under the Workplace Relations Act including officers of the Building Industry Taskforce and the Australian Building and Construction Commission, once that is subsequently established by the government.</para>
<para>Under sections 226 to 229 of the bill, regulations may be made that prescribe other persons as eligible to make an application for a breach. This potentially enables an expanded class of persons external to the matter to seek to have penalties imposed even where the parties to the matter do not consider this a useful or beneficial course of action to take. As the minister made clear in his second reading speech, the provisions will allow for substantial uncapped compensation and the bill does not rely on an affected party to enforce the law. The bill will also confer additional jurisdiction on federal courts to hear matters under the act including the Federal Magistrates Court or state Supreme, District or County courts, as the case may be. As with other aspects of the bill, these measures will apply retrospectively from the date of introduction, namely, 9 March 2005.</para>
<para>The Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005 was referred to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee, which reported on 10 May 2005, some two months after introduction. The Master Builders Association and the Australian Industry Group, the AiG, the two most relevant employer associations in the industry, both made submissions supporting the bill. The AiG, however, called for a number of amendments to narrow the definition of building work and thus the application of the bill.</para>
<para>On the other hand, the New South Wales government opposed the bill on the following grounds: (1) that it is industry specific rather than having broad application; (2) it adds unnecessary complexity to the Australian industrial relations framework; (3) its provisions are punitive, heavy-handed and unbalanced; (4) it promotes a litigious, adversarial and costly approach to industrial relations which will hinder rather than assist good faith bargaining; (5) it breaches ILO conventions regarding the rights to organise, collectively bargain and freedom of association; and (6) it is retrospective with no demonstrated justification for the retrospectivity of the bill other than an attempt to prevent further enterprise bargaining negotiations.</para>
<para>The ACTU also opposed the bill. The ACTU summarised its reasons for opposition to the bill as follows:</para>

<para class="block">The Australian Democrat senatorsâ minority report referred to their previous report on the Building Industry Improvement Bill 2003. In that report the Democrats argued against the need for specific industry legislation. The Democrats also questioned how, if one of the key findings of the Cole royal commission was that there was a weakness in current enforcement mechanisms, creating new workplace relations laws would resolve this problem. The Democratsâ minority report said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We support one central proposition behind the Bills, that greater regulation and enforcement of workplace relations laws is necessary. We do not support the second central proposition behind the Bills, that industry specific legislation and sweeping new Workplace Relations Act 1996 provisions are necessary to achieve this aim.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Democrat senatorsâ report also noted with concern the confusing nature of the definition of the building and construction industry in the bill. The Democrat senators also opposed the retrospectivity of the bill. As Democrat Senator Andrew Murray commented:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">There are two elements of retrospectivity that the Democrats believe are important. The first is that there is the element of natural justice, where retrospective legislation offends against the principles of natural justice and trespasses upon the basic tenet of our legal system that those subject to the law are entitled to be treated according to what the law says at the relevant time and according to what the law means at the time, subject to courts interpretation. The second area is that of uncertainty, where retrospective legislation brings uncertainty to the environment in which the community and business operate.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Democrat senators concluded that they would continue to argue that the problems in the industry and in other industries would be far better addressed by enforcement of existing law and the creation of a well-resourced independent national workplace relations regulator. Government senators commended the bill and urged that it be passed without amendment.</para>
<para>Labor senators also opposed the bill. One reason was the poorly drafted definition of the âbuilding and construction industryâ. As Labor senators noted in their report:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">There are so many anomalies which result from the broad definition of the building industry that protracted litigation will be necessary to sort matters out.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Labor senators also noted that provisions of the bill overriding state legislation will cause uncertainty and confusion owing to the âpiecemeal exclusion of state laws from the national industrial relations regimeâ. Labor senators agreed with the observations made by Democrat Senator Andrew Murray that the overwhelming majority of bills with retrospective provisions either have a beneficial effect, make technical amendments or relate to taxation measures. No such argument has been made out here to mitigate the billâs retrospective effect.</para>
<para>The minister argues that the bill aims to promote respect for the rule of law in the building and construction industry. Yet this bill, if enacted, will compound Australiaâs ongoing disrespect for international labour law. Australia has repeatedly reaffirmed its obligation as a member of the International Labour Organisation, the ILO, and its commitment to ensure that its domestic laws provide for labour standards consistent with internationally recognised labour principles. The ILO Committee of Experts has repeatedly found that the Workplace Relations Act 1996 contravenes fundamental ILO conventions on freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining.</para>
<para>The bill selectively and unfairly targets building industry workers and excludes them from basic and universally applicable labour standards. All employees should have the rights and protections afforded by international labour law, irrespective of the particular industry in which they work. The building and construction industry should not be exempt from compliance with the fundamental rights to collective bargaining and freedom of association that are embodied in the relevant ILO conventions. The bill breaches these fundamental rights by rendering virtually all industrial action in the building and construction industry unlawful industrial action and by further restricting what kinds of industrial action can be protected action for the purposes of the Workplace Relations Act 1996.</para>
<para>This is a poorly drafted, excessively punitive and unfair bill. Labor believes that this bill is divisive in its application and will not assist in the satisfactory resolution of industrial issues in the building and construction industry. As a general proposition, Labor believes and I believe that we should utilise the general jurisdiction of industrial relations law and not create industry-specific specialised jurisdiction. Secondly, we should not, as a general proposition, engage in retrospective legislation particularly when that applies retrospective penalties. Thirdly, the most essential element in terms of the resolution of industrial difficulties or industrial disputation is to seek to resolve these matters in a cooperative fashion, generally in a tripartite manner which comes from the cooperation between employers, employees and government.</para>
<para>Labor does not support unreasonable or unlawful conduct. However, Labor also does not support the creation of laws which will effectively prohibit the taking of industrial action as this is in contravention of the fundamental rights to collective bargaining and freedom of association as embodied in the relevant ILO conventions. The bill, if passed, will further exacerbate Australiaâs industrial relations legislation contravention of these fundamental ILO conventions. This bill is politically motivated and has been designed to try and assist the government in its attempts to stymie the current round of enterprise agreement negotiations within the building and construction industry. The bill adds complexity to resolving occupational health and safety issues in the industry and thus potentially endangers employees.</para>
<para>The retrospectivity of this bill potentially substantially penalises employees, unions and employers currently participating in making enterprise bargains in a legal and reasonable way. The definition of the construction industry in this bill is so broad that employers and employees who have never previously considered themselves a part of the industry are captured and encompassed by this bill. Consequently, they will be exposed to prosecution and penalties for participating in what they believe is, and what is currently, legal bargaining activity. Substantial litigation will be necessary to accurately understand exactly what is encompassed by the definition. The bill overrides state jurisdictions, and creates a specific set of legislation for just one industry in such a way as to create complexity and confusion. The provisions of this bill combine to create massive uncertainty in one of the largest and most important industries in Australia.</para>
<para>A much better approach would have been to establish a tripartite building industry council charged with bringing about cultural change in the industry through cooperative measures. Labor believes that such a cooperative approach is far more likely to bring about real and lasting reform to the industry than the Howard governmentâs expensive and conflict driven approach. I underline Laborâs opposition to the legislation.</para>

<para>âI well remember when the government embarked on addressing problems on Australiaâs waterfront. We heard the same sorts of speeches from the Australian Labor Party as we have heard tonight about unfairness, complexity and how things might be done in a different way. But the Australian Labor Party at that time refused to recognise the problems on the Australian waterfront, as they refuse tonight to recognise the problems in the building industry in Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The government addressed the problems on the waterfront which previous governments had been trying to address for 50 years. The governmentâs response was to actually do something and to have the hard fight; to work hard to fix the problems that were obviously there. What was the result? The maritime workers said: âWe canât be any more efficient. Sixteen containers an hour is all that we can move. Itâll never be any better than that. Not worldâs best practice, but itâll never be any better than that on the Australian waterfront.â But the government insisted and, to John Howardâs and the Howard governmentâs credit, we now have a situation where employees got increases in pay and Australia and its exporters got worldâs best practice on our waterfront. We are now seen as a nation that has a reliable waterfront where shipping companies can confidently say their ship will arrive at such and such a time and depart at such and such a time, there will be no industrial action, everything will be done and things will work smoothly. It has been a great outcome. I know the former minister Peter Reith suffered enormously at that time, but he will go down in the nationâs history as having achieved something for Australia that has been most valuable.</para>
<para>And so it is that the government now brings back to the parliament laws to address the problems in the building industry. I note that the Australian Labor Party again denies the problems that are thereâit skirts around them. The Howard government works in Australiaâs interest. It is not beholden to any particular section of the economy, because it recognises that a productive and efficient economic Australia is the best thing to achieve for its people. Look at the problems that the Cole royal commission unearthed. We all knew they were there but it took the government to establish the commission to document the problems. I will give you some examples. The royal commission found there was regular payment of money by contractors and subcontractors to a union, in an endeavour to buy industrial peace or to be able to undertake contracted work under explicit or implicit threat of industrial action, including payment of union membership fees, donations to union approved courses or, in extreme cases, CFMEU T-shirts. On one occasion at a Melbourne building site a subcontractor paid $7,000 to the CFMEU so that he could work on a particular site. The receipt he received from the union stated the money was for T-shirts.</para>
<para>Other examples reported to the building industry task force included an employer being forced to purchase raffle tickets for $10,000 in order to keep the building site open. Other employers have been forced to pay for temporary union membership for their employees even though they worked on the site only for a short period of time. Not surprisingly, the number of membership tickets they pay for is often far in excess of the number of actual employees on the site. These sorts of rorts impact on the productivity of Australian workplaces. There has not been a word from the Australian Labor Party on this.</para>
<para>In December last year, under a giant front-page headline âRort cityâ, the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> reported the following rorts, rackets and threats on Melbourne building sites. Listen to this: at the Spencer Street Station redevelopment, now $200 million over budget, employers paid for 23 union officials to supervise the site even though none of them actually did any work on the site. Employers are paying the wages of ghost workers who do not even exist and these wages end up in the pockets of unions. Union officials are extorting $500 to $10,000 or payment in beerâcalled a âbig drinkââfrom developers and subcontractors. A glazier was being threatened with all of his glass on the site being smashed unless he agreed to union demands. There has not been a word from the Australian Labor Party on these widespread actions in the building industry. We just hear the shadow minister saying that it is unfair that the government singles out an industry. Well, it is that single industry where the problems are.</para>
<para>These problems affect all of us, not just the unions, not just the employees and not just employers but all Australians. Excessive building costsâand that is what is happening hereâmean Australian taxpayers are getting short-changed when it comes to things like schools or hospitals or even roads. It has to stop. That is why the government has introduced this legislation. The government is committed to reforming Australiaâs $50 billion construction industry. Problems in the construction industry deliver concerns for the whole economy. Problems in this industry mean higher prices, fewer jobs and a lower standard of living for all Australians.</para>
<para>I am aware that independent research by Econtech has shown that improving the industryâs workplace relations practices would boost Australiaâs economy by a massive $2.3 billion a year, but the Australian Labor Party stand against this, just as they stood against reform in the maritime area. The unions and the Labor Party have ducked and weaved and obstructed the governmentâs attempts and efforts to reform this industry. It is a terrible shame but you know why it happens. It is very clear. Since 1996 the CFMEU, one of the chief culprits in this, has bought the support of the Australian Labor Party with a donation of almost $5 million.</para>
<para>Everyone knows that the building and construction industry is different. It is a section of our economy where practices that would simply be unacceptable in other parts of the economy have been long tolerated. The rate of industrial action in the building industry in Australia just last year was 223.7 working days lost per 1,000 employees. That is five times the overall national average of 45.5. Nationally, 45.5 days per 1,000 employees are lost, but in the building industry it is five times that, at 223.7. It has also been estimated that the productivity in the commercial construction industry is 25 per cent lower than in the domestic housing construction industry. How could that be? How could that be tolerated? How could the Australian Labor Party defend that? In other words, it costs 25 per cent more to do the same kind of work on a large construction site as it does on a domestic home site.</para>
<para>Here is another point: small contractors are denied genuine freedom to work on their own terms and they are forced, sometimes violently, into deals done by unions and big building companies. I can attest to that from personal experience. Before I entered parliament I ran a contracting operation. I was working on the entire sound system of the Townsville entertainment centre. It was a very large project. My company had the contract to install all the electronics and sound systems in that entertainment centre. I was there working with my staff, as I have always worked with my staff. I had a pair of side cutters in my hand and this union official came up and ordered me to drop the side cutters. How dare I work alongside my staff on a job that my company had won? It is not on. The unions are not going to have that kind of thuggery. I certainly did not tolerate it at that time and it is not going to continue in this modern Australia.</para>
<para>The shadow minister raised safety issues. I have been on many large construction sites. I have recently been in the Pilbara in Western Australia. I have recently been on large mine sites where there is no union influence to protect the health and safety of workers because they are on AWAs. But health and safety is the single, No. 1, most important issue that both management and staff address. Both sides of the equation, the employer and the employee, know that it is in everybodyâs interest to have a safe work site. Nothing is spared to ensure that that work site is safe. In fact, I found myself thinking that sometimes they go overboard with some of their health and safety practices, but that is what they do.</para>

<para>âThe <inline ref="R2292">Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005</inline> is the latest bill in a long line of extreme legislation introduced by the Howard government to fracture Australian industry. At the outset I must say that I do not come to the debate with clean hands. I am pleased to say that I am the son of a building worker who, through the fifties, sixties, seventies, eighties and nineties, took part in the struggle to improve the lot of building workers in New South Wales and, as a result of those improvements, the lot of building workers in other states and territories of Australia. I am also pleased to say that my brother is the state secretary of the New South Wales branch of the CFMEU. He maintains the commitment to improving the lot of building workers and their families.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is about time we confronted what this legislation is about. It is about driving a wedge between building workers and their employersâdividing building workers, their families and their employers. It is a bill with one objective: to erode the hard-won rights of building construction workers and, in some instances, to hand back exclusive unfettered power to a small number of ruthless employers who have no regard to the health and safety, and wages and conditions of their employees. The bill was clearly born out of a political exercise. That political exercise was the royal commission headed by Justice Cole. Guess when it was calledâjust before the 2001 election, when the government thought they would need this bill rather than <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline>.</para>
<para>The facts show that at that time there was no major crisis in the building and construction industry. No-one asked for the inquiryânot the unions, the industry, the clients or the workers. Building activity investment at the time was robust. There was no attempt by the government to sit down with the unions, the industry and other stakeholders and talk to them about productivity, because this government is not interested in productivity; it is consumed with confrontation and hatred. I suggest to the House that the Cole royal commission was just another example of the governmentâs extreme approach in dealing with difficult issues. It is not prepared to do the hard yardsâto sit down with people and work through problems to reach consensus and find solutions.</para>
<para>The alternative approach was pursued by Labor in government, through the Construction Industry Development Agency, which extended across the departments of industrial relations and industry. That agency was about reform involving government, clients, investors, unions, building workers and employers. It put in place a new culture, which was not just about improvements in the building industry but, more importantly, about undertaking construction projects ahead of time and ahead of budget. The record shows it had a lot of success. The third runway at Sydney airport, the new Toyota plant at Altona in western Melbourne and the ABC headquarters in Melbourne are just a few examples of the success of the construction industry reform process pursued by the Hawke and Keating Labor governments. That compares with the approach of the Howard government, which is really about putting in place a legislative framework which enables bad employers and insensitive governments to ride roughshod over the rights of ordinary Australian workers who happen to disagree with them.</para>
<para>The government raises the question of where the opposition stands on the issue of cleaning up the building industry. Some people have short memories. I do not; I was part of it. I want to make it clear to the House this evening that I do not, will not and never have supported the corruption that was said to exist in the industry and was used to justify the establishment of the royal commission. More importantly, Labor in government delivered on that very issue. It was the Hawke and Keating Labor governments and the Cain Victorian Labor governmentâwith the support of the ACTU and its affiliatesâthat moved to clean up corruption in the industry in the 1980s and deregister the BLF. That was a pretty tough process which we took on on our own. We achieved significant improvements in productivity and the development of a new culture in the industry because we were prepared to do the hard yards.</para>
<para>I was directly involved in the campaign against corruption in the building industry, when I was a member of the ACTU executive and, in the later years, when I was president of the ACTU. I am very proud of our achievements in not only cleaning up the industry but also putting in place, whilst we were in government, a new culture and commitment to pursuing the issues which count in the industry. We solved the problems and that produced results for investors and building workers in Australia. Compare that to the approach of this government. I suggest to the House that this government has never been about cleaning up the building industry. Its real goal has been, and always will be, to smash the union movement and hand power back to employers who have no regard for the welfare of building workers and their families.</para>
<para>I also remind the House that, despite its inglorious end, the Builders Labourers Federation and a host of other construction unions have achieved a lot for working Australians over the years. It was under the leadership of people such as Pat Clancy of the Building Workers Industrial Union that the building industry was civilised through the fifties, sixties, seventies, eighties and nineties. Some people laugh at the suggestion that working in the building industry was tough. I intend to deal with some of the conditions of employment that building workers did not have during that period. I saw directly in my own household the sacrifices my parents made in just trying to make ends meet, because of the lack of decent working conditions for building workers in the post Second World War period. The struggle commenced on building sites. Yes, it was a struggle, and we are not ashamed of the fact that it was a struggle. It was about bringing to building workers a sense of decency and dignity at work. Building workers suffered the worst conditions and pay. It was not until the rise of unions and the prolonged economic boom after the Second World War that this began to change throughâguess what?âcollectivism and struggle by union officials, with the support of their membership, and a willingness by employers to sit down to negotiate and work out what was appropriate.</para>
<para>We should also not forget that the Cole royal commission did not uncover the so-called endemic corruption or criminality by union officials, which the government used as an excuse to set up the commission. But that is not important to the government! It was not important that it cost $60 million of taxpayersâ money to establish the royal commission. It was not spent on confronting the real issues that troubled the industry, such as trade shortages, health and safety, death on the job, transportability of trade qualifications across state and territory borders, reform of the workplace culture, stamping out cash-in-hand and illegal migrants. They were not key issues in the mind of the Howard government with respect to how to improve productivity in the building industry. The government spent $60 million with one aim: to create a political issueârather than trying to do something about apprenticeships, rather than trying to do something about skills shortages and rather than trying to do something about delivering on time and on budget in the building industry.</para>
<para>It is also worth while reminding the House that this government spent $60 million to set up a framework to erode the rights of building workers, to reduce their wages and conditions of employment, while spending only $30 million inquiring into the HIH collapse, where there was real corruption. But I suppose, when it comes to HIH, it was their mates at work. So the truth is that it is about time this government got its priorities right. Defeating the unions and eroding the rights of working men and women is clearly more important to the Howard government than Australiaâs biggest corporate disaster and the huge social inequities still suffered by our Indigenous community.</para>
<para>I now want to deal with some of the conditions actually won by building workers, which this government now wants to erode. I have experienced them first-hand as the son of a building worker. The effect of this bill is to try and ensure that building workers will be second-class citizens with weaker awards, less access to unions and a reduced right to protect their rights through industrial action. So let us deal with a little of the history. I want to take people back to the 1950s, when building workers were expected to go to work without any permanency of employment. You were hired for the time of the job. Your ability to feed your family was related to whether, at the completion of the job, you had the capacity to find another building job as soon as possible. There was no permanency. There was no guarantee of 52 weeks of employment a year. It is also interesting to note that, during this period, when it rained there was no pay. There was no wet pay, there was no sick pay and, in most instances, little attention was paid to issues of health and safety in the building industry. So we actually achieved through the fifties and the sixties the right of building workers to wet pay and sick pay.</para>
<para>With regard to annual leave, we had to set up a fund to enable workers to accrue annual leave by payment into a building industry fund. Long service leave was regarded as a right by most Australian workers, but building workers had to follow work from one job to another and were very rarely able to achieve a period of sustained employment with an individual employer in order to win a right to long service leave. So we had to set up a portability of long service leave scheme to guarantee to building workers what was received by all other workers in Australia.</para>
<para>One of the major achievements of the 1980s was the development of industry superannuation. Building workers never had access to superannuation, just as they never had access to long service leave, annual leave, sick pay or wet pay until we established schemes to meet the needs of these industries. Superannuation was put in place, but people should not forget that building workers traded other improvements in wages to achieve these benefits. Superannuation is a direct example. They traded improvements in wages to achieve, firstly, three per cent and then successive improvements in superannuation to achieve the capacity to retire with some dignity. One should not forget that the capacity of many building workers to work at their trade throughout what would be a normal working life does not exist, because of the nature of working in the building industry. Take bricklayers, for example. They have limited capacity to make big money because of the arduous nature of the job. They need these entitlements to guarantee some safety and protection and the right to give some security in life to their families.</para>
<para>Even with the improvements in health and safety in Australia, we still have an industry which sees over 50 deaths per year. It is a dangerous industry. These conditions are important to building workers, but more importantly they are about security for building workersâ spouses and families in the case of accident or, worse still, death on the job. Some on the other side smirk and think these issues are not important. I would like to see them suffer some of the conditions experienced by building workers and their families over what has been a long and extended period of achievement to bring some decency to the lives of building industry workers.</para>
<para>Finally they actually achieved the introduction of severance pay. Frankly, I think they are entitled to some severance pay, just as members of parliament receive severance pay when they depart this House, just as Australian public servants receive severance pay when they depart employment with the Australian Public Service and just as is the case with many employees throughout the length and breadth of Australia. The building industry unions actually achieved severance pay, just as they achieved all the other conditions I have referred to this evening. So I make no apology for the struggle of building unions over many years to actually bring a sense of decency to the lives of building workers and their families.</para>
<para>I also contend that we should focus on the issues that really count in the building industry. They are not all about the destruction of building industry unions by a government that is drunk with power. If you have any doubts about that, go chronologically through what the government has done since the last election to set up confrontation with the union movement, especially with building industry unions. I will take you back to the first act. The government, which supposedly believes in the right of choice, was re-elected on 9 October 2004. Employers actually chose to negotiate with building industry unions in Victoria, so what did we have the government doing on 28 October? It tried to intervene to stop the certification of CFMEU EBAs in Victoria and to limit the types of clauses that could be included in those agreements. So much for free and open negotiations between employers, their workers and their unions! I would have thought that would have been up to the parties. If they want extra annual leave or if they want extra superannuation, that is their business. It is not the business of government to say to those workers, âWeâre going to intervene in the EBA certification process and weâll determine what is in your EBA.â</para>
<para>On 29 October the government took a further step. What did it want to do? It wanted to legislate to stop unions renegotiating EBAs ahead of its new industrial legislationâand that is what it did on 9 December. On 11 November we see the states and territories on the Howard governmentâs hit list of whom it was going to have a war with on the industrial relations front. Take AusLink: you either sign up to the AusLink code of practice or you do not get Commonwealth government funding for, for example, the Pacific Highway or the Geelong bypass. It is not about sitting down and trying to work out what is possible; it is Big Brother from Canberra telling state and territory governments, âYouâll do what youâre told when youâre told,â with one objective: to cripple building industry unionsâ capacity to defend workersâ wages and conditions, to provide a fair standard of living for the workers and their spouses and to guarantee that at work they have a capacity for organisation to guarantee a safe workplace. One of the most important issues to me in employment is an expectation that when you go to work you know you are going to come home at night not having lost your life or without having encountered an accident or without one of your workmates having lost his or her life. Those are pretty fundamental issues, and in all surveys of workers those priorities always come up. The issues of health and safety and of having a safe working environment are the most important issues in workersâ minds when thinking about employment.</para>
<para>It is about time that the House confronted the fact that, if this government is really serious about the building and construction industry, about improving productivity and about working towards a culture which guarantees that projects are built ahead of time and ahead of budget, it will adopt an alternative agenda. My experience, having actually been part of the previous Hawke and Keating governmentsâ construction industry reform process, is that the issues are still there. These are the types of issues that need attending to on the job. I see smirks on the other side of the House over some of these issues. I do not think it is funny that, in terms of health and safety, there are still 50 lives lost per year on building and construction industry jobs around Australia. That is not funny; that is a very serious issue. Any loss of life at work is a very serious issue, something that all members of this House should be concerned about because fellow Australians are involved. They have a right to go to work and to undertake their work in a safe environment. It is not a laughing matter.</para>
<para>I come to the issue of training. What is jacking up the cost of building industry jobs at the moment is the competition amongst employers for skilled labour. We have a huge shortage of skilled labour. When you add that to the huge demand in Australia at the moment for raw materials, such as concrete and steel, you understand why construction costs are actually going through the roof. We have contributed to our own problems through a lack of apprenticeships, skill shortages and an inability to get trained workers when we need them. There have been problems between states and territories over the transportability of trade qualifications. This should have been fixed long ago. It should be one of the prime objectives of any reform process in the building industry to get this right once and for all.</para>
<para>We all should pay our taxes, but go around the building industry and see, unfortunately, the prevalence of cash in hand payments. If those people were pulling their weight and paying their taxes, we would be paying less tax. Unfortunately, the industry is ripe for that, just as is the case in some instances with the existence of illegal workersââItâs cash in hand. We wonât dob you in, in terms of your inability to actually work here legally, if you cop this amount of money in the hand and keep your mouth shut.â Tax evasion and productivity are all interrelated.</para>
<para>At the moment there are serious issues in the building industry that we have to confront as a community. As I said at the outset, I will never defend corruption in any institutionâand I was part of cleaning up the building industry when I was President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. It is about time that the government stopped being consumed with crushing the union movement and the state and territory governments and started to think about a serious reform agenda. Its own extreme view of life will not produce improvements in productivity on building industry sites nor will it create a culture which guarantees that we build projects ahead of time and ahead of budget. I do not support this bill. To me the historic fact is that building workers have rights to collectively organise and bargain. This bill is about eroding those rights and it will achieve nothing for building industry employers. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talk.start>
<para>Unfortunately, the member for Batman has fled the chamber, but in listening to the member for Batman one understands why the industrial relations climate in this country is as it isâin a malaise. It was like listening to the dinosaurs thrashing around the bogs of Jurassic Park in their last throes before finally being put to the sword. In their death throes the Labor Party are gasping for some relevance in this debate, yet they have objected to and opposed any reform in the building industry and the area of workplace relations since the coalition came to government. I find it very interesting that the member for Batman was trotting out his working-class credentials. We can all do that. I doubt whether he has actually ever got his hands dirty, but the fact is my dad was a builder. I know a bit about the building trade and the tough times they go through, so let us not have this claptrap from the other side about being part of ideological trench warfare. I am no silvertail; I come to this House from a working-class background. Probably unlike the member for Batman, I have washed my hands in Solvol, so I know what it is like to do a bit of work and so did my dad. So let us not go on about this.</para>
<para>At the end of the day, this legislation was introduced because of people like the member for Batman and the other ACTU presidents, from Bob Hawke onwards, who have come here to use this place as a retirement village. All it has brought to the opposition is the ideological time warp in which they are now suffering. The legislation seeks to make certain forms of industrial action in the building and construction industry unlawful and to provide for additional sanctions against such actions in the form of injunctions, financial penalties and compensation. I will largely speak about the problems in the construction industry in Western Australia because I am a member of parliament from Western Australia. We know that the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry found that Western Australia, along with Victoria, was the hot spot of industrial anarchy in this country, led by the CFMEU.</para>
<para>The bill was introduced in response to the intense industrial pressure being applied by the building industry unions to force contractors to sign up to union-friendly agreements. I will outline some of these. I am pleased that Sky Channel now broadcasts federal parliament. The issues that are current in Western Australia have probably only been exposed in Western Australia, but tonight the rest of Australia has the opportunity to hear some of the outlandish and absolutely extortive claims that are being made by the CFMEU in Western Australia.</para>
<para>To combat this extortion, thuggery and anarchy in the building and construction industry there will be the establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commissionâor the ABCCâand, I might add, the Federal Safety Commissioner. I am pleased that there will be a Federal Safety Commissioner, because the Cole royal commission showed us that the unions use safety issues in a bogus fashion to stop work and cause industrial unrest. I take the point of the member for Batman that nobody wants deaths in the construction industry, but when you cry wolf by using safety issues on the work sites to stop work and cause mayhem in the industry you are actually diluting the seriousness of industrial accidents and problems on building sites.</para>
<para>In Western Australia at the moment the CFMEU, led by Kevin Reynolds and his sidekick, Joe McDonald, have made this claim. The claim is extortive, as I said. By way of explanation, to try and force companies to involve themselves in this litany of claims, they are carrying out what is called a âblue fluâ campaign. In the last few weeks on the southern rail line in Perth we have found that the whole work forceâor 200 of the work force, or 50 of a particular part of the work force, which then cripples the whole projectâall catch the flu on the same day. When Kevin Reynolds, the CFMEU state secretary in Western Australia, was asked how so many people could get sick on the same day he said, âWell, theyâre all sick; theyâre all entitled to be sick on the same day.â That might be fine, but does anyone actually believe it?</para>
<para>I will be writing to the federal Minister for Health and Ageing to ask him to check on the medical certificates, because I believe there is the potential here for doctors who have signed these certificates to have entered into some form of fraud. If a doctor has signed medical certificates for 50 or 100 people from one group of workers, you would have to ask, âIs this man engaging in Medicare fraud?â I will be writing to seek information on that because, if I were the doctor who did that, I would be pretty concerned about what I had done.</para>
<para>Mr Deputy Speaker, just listen to this log of claims that the CFMEU have released. This is what they are extorting with the blue flu on the construction sites in Perth at the moment. They demand that workers do not actually have to be sick to receive sick leaveâthey get 10 days sick leave a yearâand that sick leave can be converted to cash if it is not taken. They want one paid rostered day off every second weekâin other words, 26 each year. They demand a reduction in the standard working week from 38 hours to 36 hours, at the same time receiving a 12Â½ per cent pay rise, and for all shift work to be paid at double time. Under these claims an employer will not have the right to sack an employee who is affected by drugs or alcohol if the employee agrees to counselling, regardless of how many times the employee attends the work site affected by drugs or alcohol. They want a productivity allowance of $1.20 per hour to be paid regardless of whether or not productivity levels are good. Employers will be forced to pay $23.80 per day for fares and travel allowance, even if the employee lives next door to the work site. So you walk across the road and get $23.80 for it. What a lurk that is! There is more.</para>

<para>âMr Deputy Speaker, how about this: the fares and travel allowance are to be paid even if the employee is on a rostered day off. So he gets a rostered day off and part of the claim is that he gets $23.80 and does not actually have to travel to work. I hope the television sets of Australia are focusing on this; it is not being broadcast enough to the rest of Australia because it seems to be a Western Australian problem. But this is what they would get away with if they could and this is what they are trying to extort out of their blue flu campaign.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The next part of the claim is that all employees finishing work after 11 pm must be provided with a hot mealâtoo bad if it is the middle of summer. Every subcontractor on siteâin other words, brickies, glaziers, carpenters, tilers et ceteraâmust employ a union imposed safety representative to be issued with one fully fitted out office. Employers will be forced to apply union negotiated wages and conditions to non-union workers to prevent employers from paying them more than union members. Employers will have to grant all workers additional paid leave to attend union training courses, with no limit on the number of times leave must be granted for these purposes. No limit! In other words, it could be every day of the week.</para>
<para>Employers must pay $72 a week per employee for a redundancy fund to be paid to the employee on termination, even if the employee has only worked for the company for one week. Redundancy pay also applies if an employee is sacked. It goes on: three per cent for personal accident and sickness, even if they have their own insurance; site allowances of between $2.40 and $3.50 to be paid for projects worth over $570,000; trauma insurance; and employees forced to join the union preferred superannuation fund known as the construction and building union superannuation scheme, or Cbus. This is a breach of the freedom of choice provisions in the industrial act. Union officials will be given unfettered rights of entry without notice onto work sites for no reason, even if non-union employees are on that site; and a full-time qualified nurse must be employed on work sites where staffing levels reach 50. We are short of nurses in any case; now we are going to have them on every work site with over 50 employees.</para>
<para>You might say that that is just an ambit log of claims, that they are out there trying it on. Not true! In Western Australia we know at the moment that over 100 companies have signed up and agreed to it. A hundred out of 400 companies in Western Australia have been coerced into it, and this is one of the reasons that we have had to establish the ABCC. Beautifully, Nigel Hadgkiss, the current executive of the task force, is going to concentrate on Western Australia in particular. He said: âOf the complaints we received, 52 per cent were later withdrawn because of fear. A lot of people are too frightened to speak up, but they have told my investigators that if we force them to answer the questions they will.â So this legislation gives him the power to coerce.</para>
<para>Â Those opposite will say, âOh, isnât this terrible, isnât this draconian, to force them to speak upâ? The ATO is able to do this. The ATO and other Australian government instrumentalities and bodies have power to coerce. They force people to tell the truthâbecause, as we know, these people are suffering fear and intimidation. To make sure that this enforcement actually works, there will be new fines of up to $22,000 for individuals and up to $110,000 for companies and unions, and the measure will be backdated to encompass the unlawful action that occurs now. We know that in Perth at the moment the CFMEU is going around heavying companies to sign up before it comes into effect later this year. That is why we are pleased that it will be backdated to March this year.</para>
<para>Of course, further powers will allow the courts to demand compensation and seize assets. The royal commission, in its state and territory overviews section, volume 12, at page 299, went through quite a number of reasons for the state of lawlessness existing in Western Australia. In Western Australia there has been a disregard for or breach of the enterprise bargaining provisions and a disregard for or breach of freedom of associationâit goes through them all. It is a huge volume but I recommend it to those who wish to read it.</para>
<para>Before the Gallop Labor government won office in Western Australia, the previous government had a task force called the WABITFâthe building industry task force. It was set up in September 1994. It did not really gain teeth, such as those provided in this Commonwealth legislation, until its head became a special constable, and he then had police powers to investigate alleged charges and to prosecute. Then there was a change of government. Along came the Labor government and, in 2002, it brought in the Building Industry Special Projects Inspectorate, or BISPI. That is a toothless tiger. At page 300 of its report the Cole royal commission states that in the building industry in Perth there is a strong perception that the BISPI, in contrast to the previous WABITF, is ineffective. It goes through the reasons: the CFMEU disregards it; it has no powers of coercion; and the state government will not enforce its rulings by seeing that it actually prosecutes.</para>
<para>I conclude by saying that, in this legislation, we require strong affirmative action against people who would flout and ignore the rule of law. For example, Joe McDonald, the secretary of the CFMEU in Western Australia, has said: âEven though they realise that they are going to be on the wrong side of the law, it is anticipated that some union officials will be jailed. Weâre not going to take a backward step in any way, shape or formâno matter what this legislation brings.â So before too long we are going to have people before the courts who have broken the law. Hopefully the strength of this legislation will see them prosecuted and sanctions will comeâeven to the extent of seizing property and assetsâby way of fines and jail for those who intimidate.</para>
<para>Finally, if members of the House do not think that any of this is serious, I draw their attention to an article in this weekendâs <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times</inline>. A union leader entered a building site without any right of entry and threatened to recruit members on that site. When asked whether he had any legitimate right to be there, he started using abusive language, making threats and using intimidation. He is an absolute thug, who frightens decent people who want to get on and earn money for their families.</para>
<para>This industry needs to be cleaned up, and it will be if this legislation proceeds. I am confident that the legislation will proceed because it is in the national interest. It will bring all the benefits that it is designed to bring for the productivity of this country in future, and for better wages and conditions. I commend those involved in seeing the legislation come before the House. It is high time that this essential legislation was enacted.</para>

<para>âTonight I want to address the governmentâs total incompetence in handling the David Hicks case, which puts at risk both the effective fight against terror and our commitment to upholding the rule of law in a democratic country. Mr Hicks is an Australian citizen who has been held without trial for almost four years at the United States base in Guantanamo Bay. He has been charged with very serious offences, including war crimes and terrorism. It is in everyoneâs interest for such serious allegations to be tried and tested, but by agreeing to a shonky process the Howard government has created a diversion and delay in prosecuting his case.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There are many who are convinced that David Hicks is a terrorist, so they say it does not matter whether he will get a fair trial. The fact that he might be a terrorist is a crucial reason that we should want him charged, tried and, if convicted, locked up for a very long time. But once we allow guilt to be assumed and the process to be rigged, we start to look more like a military dictatorship than a social democracy we can all be proud of.</para>
<para>Every single Australian needs to know that, if they get into trouble with the law overseas, the Australian government will always stand up for their right to a fair trial. No-one should expect that the Australian government will protect them from the consequences of their actions, but we do expect that the government will do what it can to ensure a fair process. If the process is dodgy or second-rate we might even compromise our security. The question mark over Mr Habibâs release, which seemed linked to his allegations of torture, highlights the potential that using abusive, inhumane or unfair processes might create public, legal and international pressure to release people and never test the evidence against them.</para>
<para>A conviction achieved through a fair process would be a rock solid basis to imprison Mr Hicks if he has been involved in these activities. A conviction achieved through a shonky process will always be open to attack. We will then get to the bizarre position where we risk Mr Hicks becoming a martyr and poster boy for the rule of law. Before too long there will be a clamour for Mr Hicks to be released whether he is innocent or guilty. This is the ridiculous and potentially dangerous situation the governmentâs incompetence has created.</para>
<para>The US, with Australian complicity, will try Mr Hicks in a military commission process which is not independent, lacks legally qualified personnel, has loose rules of evidence and no proper external appeals process. Several members of the military commission panel participated in the very combat in which Mr Hicks was arrested. Labor has argued for over three years that the process does not meet even the basic standards of criminal justice. Last week, Laborâs worst fears were confirmed in emails from three former members of the US military prosecutorial staff. Stunningly, they describe the process as âriggedâ and assert that the âmilitary panel will be hand-picked and will not acquit these detaineesâ. As well as these military insiders, an array of experts in Australia and overseas have agreed with Laborâs view that the process is unfair: Lex Lasry QC, who witnessed the process first-hand; the UK Attorney-General, Lord Goldsmith; Paul Willee QC, Australiaâs top military barrister; and even former High Court judge Mary Gaudron. The list goes on.</para>
<para>The United Kingdom, France, Egypt and Afghanistan have all protested to the US about their own citizens being held at Guantanamo Bay, but not Australia. The United States itself will not even use this process for its own people. United States citizen John Walker Lindh was tried through the regular civilian criminal justice system in the US. The Attorney-General has dismissed these experts and the views of other countries, and he persists in his unsupportable view that all is okay. The bottom line is that the Attorney-General has dug himself into a corner on this and stubbornly refuses to admit that he is wrong. He refuses to stand up for an Australian citizen and demand from the US a fair trial, even one in their own civilian system. He hides behind legal advice that Mr Hicks cannot be tried here. But this argument does not wash, and he is not pursuing other options either. Why canât the government consider demanding that the US prosecute Mr Hicks in their civilian courts, as they did their own citizen? Why canât the government make the simple demand that the military commissions adopt fair processes, fair rules of evidence and proper safeguards against bias or interference? This should not be too much to ask from a country that believes in the rule of law.</para>

</talker>
<para>âTonight I rise in the parliament to laud the opening of the new Maroochydore Medicare office, one of the first new offices opened by the Health Insurance Commission for our wonderful Medicare system for many years. I have been fighting for a number of years for a Medicare office at Maroochydore, to join the offices I already have situated at Kawana Waters and Caloundra in the electorate of Fisher.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In my early discussions with the Health Insurance Commission I was advised that I could arrange to have the office in Kawana Waters transferred to Maroochydore, but that of course would have left a gap at Kawana Waters in an area that has been well serviced by the Medicare office there for many years. The great thing about the office at Maroochydore is that it is situated at Sunshine Plaza, which is right in the heart of the central Sunshine Coast region, and it means that so many older Australians will be able to access the Medicare office by going and talking to the friendly, smiling staff. They will be able to hand their receipts for medical expenses across the counter and, most importantly, they will be able to receive a cash refund.</para>
<para>Over the years the government has improved access to Medicare by enabling the faxing of forms from certain pharmacies, enabling applications for refunds to be sent in through doctorsâ surgeries and a range of other initiatives. But the opening of the Medicare office at Maroochydore this week has been an important step forward in the provision of outstanding services to the well-deserving residents of the central Sunshine Coast region.</para>
<para>Because this is an area that has a very high retired populationâpeople move from the rust-belt areas of southern Australia to reside on the Sunshine Coast, the most desirable part of our nation in which to liveâit is necessary to provide for retired Australians. The office will be open for their benefit during ordinary working hours. Because we have so many young families on the Sunshine Coast, we have been able to arrange for the Medicare office to open on Thursday evenings and on Saturday mornings. That means that people in the paid work force will be able to access the excellent Medicare services provided by the Howard-Costello government during hours which are convenient to them. Those who work during the week will be able to go to the after-hours services and those who are not working will be able to go to Medicare during ordinary working hours.</para>
<para>I was particularly pleased to meet the manager of the Medicare office at Maroochydore. She is a gracious lady. I am quite certain she has worked for Medicare for a number of years. I must say I was particularly impressed by her attitude and her desire to bring about excellent service to residents who live in the central Sunshine Coast region.</para>
<para>I would also like to thank the Minister for Human Services for his cooperation in assisting me to bring this very important facility to residents of the central Sunshine Coast. Of course, we have had Medicare offices in my electorate on the Sunshine Coast for many years. The staff in those offices provide outstanding service to all of the people they deal with. However, with Maroochydore being the largest centre on the central Sunshine Coast, with hinterland regions and areas like Buderim close to Maroochydore, the fact that we now have open in Sunshine Plaza a Maroochydore Medicare office means that this government is continuing to bring services home to residents in their local areas. This is a very important initiative by this government. I am pleased that I have been able to deliver on one of my promises to my constituency in Fisher.</para>

<para>âI look forward to the assistance of the honourable member for Fisher to getting a Medicare office in the area of Sunbury in my electorate, where we are in desperate need of a Medicare office as well. This evening I would like to bring to the attention of the House a public meeting that I attended last Sunday in my electorate of Calwell regarding the governmentâs decision to build a new detention facility. The meeting was attended by a great number of local residents who are very concerned and opposed to this facility being built in Broadmeadows. My communityâs campaign to oppose this detention centre will focus on the theme of âLinks not locksâ and is best illustrated by the comments made by Mr John Rutherford, Secretary of the Broadmeadows Progress Association. He made a very valid point at Sundayâs meeting:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">History graphically illustrates that detention centres, whether they are called concentration camps, strategic hamlets, Indian reservations or aboriginal reserves, do not solve problems, but create new ones.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I want to join with my community and bring to the governmentâs attention that in my electorate we have many problems and issues without having to add more unnecessarily. We believe that the $120 million that is earmarked to be spent on building this facility would be better spent on addressing the many social, economic and infrastructure problems that affect the daily lives of people in Calwell.</para>
<para>We are therefore appalled by the lack of consultation from this government. The decision to nominate Maygar Barracks as a preferred site was taken without consultation with the local community. Whilst the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has now offered to work with council to consult the community, this process focuses on the nature of the facility rather than whether this is an appropriate site.</para>
<para>In light of this, Hume City Council commissioned a research report to assess community opinion of the detention centre proposal. It is a shame DIMIA did not undertake a similar activity, as the results were extremely enlightening. Some 69 per cent of those surveyed oppose the proposal to build the Broadmeadows facility and 80 per cent are opposed to the federal government spending $120 million to build a new detention centre altogether.</para>
<para>My community believes that there are far better uses for the land at Maygar Barracks, uses that would generate much needed employment and yield greater social benefits. This site on Camp Road is close to Melbourne airport, the Hume Highway, the Calder Highway and the P&amp;O operated inland rail/road freight interchange facility. An independent analysis of the site has highlighted the economic benefits of the site, which can generate substantially more employment than that generated by a detention centre facility.</para>
<para>The economic research also showed that the site is on a prime business and industrial site, which is linked by road, rail and air networks. It showed that a detention centre was not a good use of the land and it would generate only around 150 jobsâfar fewer than the 3,900 direct and indirect jobs that could be generated if the land were used for more strategic purposes and far, far fewer than the 8,000 direct and indirect jobs generated nationally if the land were used to develop a high-tech industry base.</para>
<para>My community is also concerned about the nature of detention policy and its human ramifications. At a time when the government is conceding that not all asylum seekers need to be detained, and with women and children being relocated into the community, it is unnecessary and inappropriate to allocate $120 million of taxpayersâ money to an additional 200-bed detention facility. This is a huge amount of money that could be far better spent for the benefit of the community. In my electorateâand in many, many othersâthere are critical issues that should be addressed with a higher priority than another detention centre. The government should be spending this money on increasing bulk-billing, providing more aged care beds, addressing the apprenticeships shortfall, funding more child-care places or reinstating as a matter of urgencyâcertainly to the people in my electorateâthe Commonwealth dental health scheme.</para>
<para>The Broadmeadows community vigorously opposes this proposed detention centre. It is inconsistent with the hopes and aspirations of our culturally diverse community, which is working hard to transform itself and its image. Broadmeadows is on the road to significant social redevelopment. We want government spending to aid that development, not stymie it. To that end, I have cosigned a joint letter with the Hume City Council to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, requesting a meeting with me and a delegation from Hume City Council to discuss this issue and to present the minister with a banner, signed by local residents, opposing this proposed detention facility. I do hope that the minister, Senator Vanstone, will accommodate this meeting and give my community the opportunity to raise with her concerns that are very legitimate. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âIn recent times we have witnessed disturbing statements from some Muslim extremists who live in this country, and I want to talk briefly about them in this House tonight. Brunswick Sheikh Mohammed Omran claimed recently that Osama bin Laden was âa great manâ. He disputed the involvement of bin Laden in âany evil actionâ in relation to the September 11 attacks or, for that matter, that of âany Muslim at allâ. With statements such as these from religious figures in our community, Australians rightly feel very concerned and worried that our age of innocence has well and truly passed.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>But more recently we have had the fighting words of Abu Bakr. His passport was recently revoked by ASIO on the basis that he would âengage in conduct that might prejudice the security of Australia or a foreign countryâ. In late June ASIO officers raided his suburban Melbourne home and took some papersâafter which, surprisingly, he cried foul. Is it any wonder that ASIO acted in this way? For a bloke who claims that âJihad is part of my religion,â and âMy religion doesnât tolerate other religions,â a mere security raid on his home seems relatively light-handed. Even more disturbing are Bakrâs claims that âThere are two laws: there is an Australian law and there is an Islamic lawâ and âThe only law which needs to spread has to be Islam.â If that is not disturbing enough, aside from support for suicide bombers, I do not know what is.</para>
<para>With these bombastic statements, one might legitimately question whether we want the people who are making such inflammatory and extremist comments in our country at all. Only yesterday we had a spokesman for Hizb ut-Tahrir, Wassim Doureihi, after defending jihad and the suicide bombers, claiming that the prevention of loss of innocent life could be dealt with by addressing original grievances. In other words, it is the Westâs fault again: we are at the root of all evil and we are causing all the excuses and all the reasons for suicide bombers to exist. This is unacceptable, and we cannot sit by and allow such ridiculous comments of hatred to go past uncommented on.</para>
<para>The Blair government needs to be commended, as it has recently confronted some of these issues. Soon Australian legislators, as the Prime Minister has foreshadowed, should do the same. Citizenship should come with responsibility: an unqualified and undivided loyalty. Citizenship should not be as trivial as a trinket in a cornflakes packet; it should mean something. It should not be a permanent convenience to receive taxpayer funded services and a passport well respected and accepted around the world. In Australia we value the separation of church and state. Religious figures can and often do speak out on all sorts of public policy issues. In a democracy, everyone can have a say. Freedom of speech and thought are ancient democratic principles, won in this country not through civil war or bloodshed but largely through peaceful governments and through our society.</para>
<para>Whilst we enjoy freedom of expression and diversity, this should not be confused with a conflict of basic values. So when radicals and zealots publicly espouse values and ideals that are anathema to our own, as we have seen with some extremist Muslim leaders recently, we should not be intimidated by some perverse sense of tolerance into remaining silent. We need to be vocal in telling these radical Muslim clerics and their followers that suicide bombing and terrorist attacks on innocent citizens are not acceptable processes for criticising government actions or formulating public policy. These extremists are breeding hatredâa dangerous hatred that aims to destroy the very pillars of this great nation.</para>
<para>The reality is that Australia remains the most free and most tolerant egalitarian and decent society in the world. Let us face it: now is not the time to walk on the eggshells of political correctness. Let us accept the fact that Muslim extremists live in Australia. They do not accept our open and democratic society. They think we are infidels and that we deserve what is coming to us in the form of terrorism. We must vigorously defend our democratic civilisation and our rule of lawâone law for all Australiansâand our way of life without fear or favour. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âFor the first time since the Fraser era 24 years ago, a Prime Minister now has control of both houses of the Australian parliament. With Senator Robert Hill already talking about diminishing Senate estimates powers, holding John Howard and his government to account will be challenging. Media reports suggest that holding the Howard government to account will be the domain of individual parliamentarians willing to step across the coalition âparty lineââimplying that Barnaby Joyce or National Party renegades will shape the government agenda.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>While they may be able to influence, it is important not to confuse horse-trading with accountability. A $2 billion or $5 billion pay-off to rural Australia might make National Party members and Barnaby Joyce feel better about selling out on Telstraâ</para>

<para>âSenator Joyce, I am sorryâbut it will not ensure service delivery obligations are met by a fully privatised Telstra. At best it may save some of their skins at the next election when, for ordinary Australians living in cities, towns or the bush, the internet will still be too slow, the mobile will still drop out, the wait for phone repairs will still take over three months and rental and call charges will increase unchecked by government regulation.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Accountability is a much more difficult process than trade-offs, rorts and vote buying. It involves rigorous scrutiny of all operations of government and their bureaucracies, whose complex processes can too often overwhelm ordinary Australiansâordinary Australians like Cornelia Rau, Vivian Solon or the 200 other people who may have been wrongfully detained by DIMIA. The government tried to hide these people under a bureaucratic curtain until exposed by public advocates, journalists and opposition members of parliament. After public outcry the Palmer inquiry was undertaken to investigate the actions of this government departmentâa department its report found to be âoverly self-protective and defensive, a culture largely unwilling to challenge organisational norms or to engage in self-criticism or analysisâ. All this was achieved with not a Senator Barnaby Joyce in sight!</para>
<para>In July, the ANAO released its damning report into the management of detention centre contracts, finding that DIMIA had no idea if the Australian taxpayer was receiving value for money for contracts worth around $120 million per year to American jailers Global Solutions Ltd. Worse, it found that the contracts gave DIMIA no way of knowing whether the basic needs of detainees are being met or their human rights are being respected. But Minister Vanstone is yet to be held accountable for her neglect.</para>
<para>Importantly, it was the Labor opposition that drew to the publicâs attention that Mick Palmer had vacated his position as Inspector of Transport Security to conduct the Rau inquiry, with no-one acting in his place. Similarly, alarmed by the allegations of systematic drug movements through passenger baggage at our airports, antics with camel suits at Sydney airport and a string of other security breaches, the Labor members of the Joint Public Accounts and Audit Committee successfully moved that the aviation security inquiry be reopened. Unable to hide from public scrutiny, the government initiated its own inquiry under Sir John Wheelerâjust in time, given the reminder from the tragic London bombings that there is no room for complacency when it comes to the safety and security of Australians in a world where terrorism must always be considered a risk factor.</para>
<para>As parliament returns there is an awakening amongst ordinary Australians that the greatly enhanced power of the government will now be turned against them in their workplaces. The Howard government suggests this new workplace relations front is part of the battle to save the Australian way of life. According to Howardâs way, the Australian way of life will be at risk unless working people lose as many minimum award standards as possible, such as meal breaks, holiday pay, penalty rates and the new maternity, paternity and personal family leave provisions; unless they do without a national wage case to set a liveable minimum wage and forgo their independent umpire. Moving people from secure permanent employment onto employer dictated AWAs will apparently make us more Australian! And the Prime Minister intends to spend much more than $20 million of our taxpayersâ money to wage this new war over the âAustralian way of lifeâ.</para>
<para>The Australian people do not live in a soap opera constructed by spin doctors and PR gurus. They live and work in families and in communities, all sharing the same goalsâto be able to do an honest dayâs work for a fair dayâs pay so they can make ends meet and be sure that their loved ones have the opportunities they so richly deserve. Now more than ever before, the checks and balances of parliamentary accountability will be brought to bear by the Labor opposition to make sure the governmentâs new power does not overwhelm ordinary Australians and undermine the quality of life hard-fought for and won by generations of working people of this nation. Senator Barnaby Joyce can get on board for the working people of Queensland if he likes.</para>

<para>âI want to report on a protest meeting held in Rouse Hill, one of the outer suburbs of Sydney, last weekend where 1,500 people turned out on a sunny Sunday afternoon to protest against some of the crazy, oppressive decisions they are being confronted with by the New South Wales government. These proposals deal with property rights of individuals who have bought their land and who are expecting a reasonable market value return on sale.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The New South Wales government has not changed the zone but has restricted the opportunities for the use of that land. Instead of that land being able to be used for future housing development, which is clearly stated on every title, the New South Wales government has restricted the use of that land to lifestyle and rural. It is called the lifestyle and rural green overlay. It means that if a farmer is using that land, they cannot increase their production or change their production. They have to get approval from the New South Wales government before they can vary it. If the land is not being used for primary production, then the use of the land is frozen. Natural treesâthat is, eucalypts and other indigenous species growing on the landâcannot be removed without appeal to the New South Wales government.</para>
<para>This has changed the outlook for many residents of a large section of Sydney. This provision does not just apply to north-western Sydney; this provision applies to land right around the fringe of the city. It applies in the federal electorates of Mitchell, Macquarie, Lindsay, Greenway and Macarthur. All these electorates and others are affected by this strange announcement that land will be frozen to its current use and no potential exists for development. The impact of this announcement is to have land values halved or reduced by 75 per cent, because instead of there being a speculative value for eventual development for housing, which may be many years away, that opportunity is being denied by these changes.</para>
<para>As I said, some 1,500 people from north-western Sydney turned out to protest against this. The meeting was arranged by local community organisations and chaired by Councillor Ray Williams. Speakers at the meeting included John Aquilina, the Speaker of the New South Wales parliament, Colleen Attard, John Brogden and Bernie Moriarty. They and a number of other speakers presented the case against these proposals of the New South Wales government.</para>
<para>Peopleâs investment has been absolutely destroyed as any opportunity of selling their land for real market value in their declining years has been removed. They now have a limitation unexpectedly placed on their land. This is the proposition that I would put to the New South Wales government: you have destroyed the opportunity and the potential for many people to retire with dignity, and the property rights of individuals have been destroyed with no prospect of compensation.</para>
<para>The Commonwealth Constitution requires us to pay market value for land which is resumed or on which the zoning is changed, but that is not necessary under New South Wales provisions. Zonings can be changed and land can be resumed without fair compensation being paid in every instance. Fair compensation should be paid to land owners in this instance or the state government should buy the land or this green overlay should be removed. There has been a cursory investigation of why the green overlay is required, but I suspect that the real reason is the current imposition of aÂ $65,000 charge per block of developed land imposed by the previous Carr government, carried on by the current government, which seeks to raise $65,000 tax for the New South Wales government from every property. I believe that at a later stage, after properties which have been devalued by this process have been sold to developers, the New South Wales government will change the overlay and allow the land to once more be used for housing. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>Following a fatal accident at Bankstown Airport on 11 November 2003, I wrote to the airport General Managers seeking their views on whether they considered that some enhanced form of fire fighting capacity would be appropriate or welcomed by the users. Advice from the airport operators was that their respective airports have adequate fire arrangements with the local fire brigade, and implementing an ARFFS would be too costly for the GA industry to bear, considering the low risk of accidents involving fire and the anticipated frequency of ARFFS responses.</para>
<para>I also directed the ATSB to investigate the fire fighting arrangements for Bankstown Airport, as they affected transport safety at that airport on 11 November 2003. The ATSBâs Report confirmed that if an ARFFS had been in place at Bankstown airport on 11 November 2003, it is unlikely that it would have improved the survivability of the accident.</para>

<para>Notes to the Statistics</para>
<para>These statistics relate to non-referred (general practitioner) attendances that were rendered on a âfee-for-serviceâ basis and for which benefits were processed by the Health Insurance Commission in the respective periods. Excluded are details of non-referred attendances to public patients in hospital, to Department of Veteransâ Affairs patients and some compensation cases.</para>
<para>These statistics are based on 2004 electorate boundaries.</para>
<para>The statistics were compiled from Medicare data by patient enrolment (mailing address) postcode. Where a postcode overlapped electoral boundaries, the statistics were allocated to electorates using a concordance file derived from population census data. This can result in some data being erroneously allocated to an adjoining electorate.

<para>Improving and protecting water quality in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is a high priority for the Australian Government, in demonstration of which the Prime Minister and Premier of Queensland signed the Reef Water Quality Protection Plan (the Reef Plan), a joint initiative to halt and reverse the decline in water quality entering the Reef within 10 years. Funding of some $24 million over the next three years is being provided from:</para>

<para>While there are other significant environmental issues to be addressed in the reef catchments, many of the remedial actions that need to be undertaken there (restoring riparian corridors and wetlands, re-vegetation works, development and implementation of farm management systems including encouragement of the uptake of Best Management Practice for agricultural industries), will have a positive effect on water quality entering the lagoon. The Government is therefore encouraging regional bodies to identify actions generating multiple benefits. The regional Investment Guidelines outline the Governmentâs investment priorities, and these include Reef water quality issues. In arriving at indicative allocations for regions, appropriate weighting was given to Reef Catchments in recognition of the additional activities they would have to undertake in relation to Reef water quality commitments.</para>
<para>The Government has also provided clear guidance for regional investments, through its Natural Resource Management (NRM) Module 19 for addressing the Reef Plan, on actions that should be given funding priority in regional plans.</para>

<para>The Government has determined the appropriate mix of reef protection and regional economic outcomes through the Reef Water Quality Protection Plan. The Reef Plan identifies that protection of the Reef is paramount, while recognising that improvements in Reef water quality are best achieved through cooperative arrangements with resource managers and landholders within the Reef catchment.</para>
<para>For the regional component of the Natural Heritage Trust (NHT) and National Action Plan for Water Quality and Salinity (NAP), all Regional Bodies for Natural Resource Management (NRM) are required to develop targets and priorities for regional environmental assets. For the six NRM regions within the Reef catchment, water quality targets must be consistent with the 10 year Reef Plan objective. Development of targets and priorities is to be done in consultation with regional communities, and with consideration of social and economic outcomes.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>The Government assesses each regional natural resource management plan against a number of requirements that include for example the Reef Plan Module 19, which was developed to provide specific guidance on the matter of water quality targets for regional plans to achieve accreditation, and the goal, objectives, strategies and actions of the Reef Plan. These plans and strategies have been reviewed independently by scientists and science panels in their development, especially through government agency involvement. For example, the development of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authorityâs Water Quality and Ecosystem Health Monitoring Program for the Reef Plan has been developed with the assistance of seven specially convened Expert Science Panels.</para>

<item label="(5)">
<para>Regional NRM plans must address the nationally agreed Minimum Matters for Target (e.g. water quality; estuarine, coastal and marine ecosystem integrity; nutrients in aquatic environments).

<para>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The regional planning process is iterative and requires regions to monitor and evaluate the outcomes of strategies and activities.

<para>(14) The NAP model built on regional NRM models already used in some States and addressed concerns about the effectiveness of the âsmall grantsâ model used under previous NRM programs. As applauded by the ANAO, it provides a nationally consistent framework for monitoring and evaluating performance across all regions. The process of developing regional NRM plans and investment strategies is an Australian and State / Territory Government process. The accreditation of regional plans provides quality assurance that the plans will achieve the Australian Governmentâs NRM priorities. The plans provide the basis for initial investment with scope for continuous improvement as the capacity of the region increases and more scientific information is developed.</para>

<para>âThe Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following answer to the honourable memberâs question:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>The CSIRO/Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) report states that âconsiderable progress has â¦ been achieved in establishing mechanisms for the uptake of science and technology in the development of catchment management planning proceduresâ. The report also notes that there is a need for greater capacity for understanding and uptake of science into the regional process.</para>
<para>The regional plans are developed by the regional bodies using the best available science against agreed accreditation guidelines (refer to Attachment A). The regional Natural Resource Management (NRM) plans are assessed jointly by State/Territory and Australian Governments against nationally agreed accreditation criteria. The guidelines state that plans should include âidentification of regional natural resource assets of international, national or state valueâ. In addition, some states seek input from independent expert panels. Once the plans are accredited, regions develop investment strategies. Agreement is reached between the State/Territory and Australian Governments and the regions on the priority elements in which to invest.</para>
<para>For example, the Desert Channels region in Queensland has received $185,000 in funding from the Natural Heritage Trust (NHT) to combat prickly acacia. The Mitchell grass downs of the Desert Channels region is badly affected by this weed, which is costing the pastoral industry more than $5 million annually. The Desert Channels are home to 25 rare and threatened species, which include the Julia Creek dunnart (Sminthopsis douglasi) whose habitat is being severely impacted on by the prickly acacia. Landholders and community groups are making the control of prickly acacia a community priority and are actively involved in a range of on-ground measures to identify and combat outbreaks of this pest.</para>
<para>The Natural Heritage Ministerial Board has further agreed to a set of principles to guide Australian Government investment:</para>
<para>1. The overarching principle in determining investment priority should be âreturn on investmentâ in terms of NRM outcomes where these are identified with respect to regional âresource condition targetsâ;</para>
<para>2. The value of the asset, for which resource condition targets have been established, is high in environmental, economic and/or social terms;</para>
<para>3. The nature, magnitude and trend of the threat to the asset for which resource condition targets have been established;</para>
<para>4. The scale of the outcomes arising from the investment; and</para>
<para>5. The rate of change in the underlying resource condition anticipated from the investment.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>Regional plans are developed and implemented in a consistent manner through a national accreditation process and the National Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) Framework. While applying a consistent framework this approach accommodates regional variations. For example, the CSIRO/BOM report acknowledges that the regions do not have to use all of the matters for target specified under the M&amp;E Framework. This allows for regional variations but also maintains a consistent approach to plan development.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>No. The NAP is implementing the National Water Quality Management Strategy (NWQMS).</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>The Australian Government continues to monitor expenditure against this target.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>One of the accreditation criteria states that the plans will âidentify processes to assess effectiveness in achieving intended results and identify who is accountable for delivering on commitments, financial management, and performance monitoring and reporting arrangementsâ. Each plan identifies matters for target that are to be monitored in particular regions.</para>
</item>
<item label="(6)">
<para>All plans must be consistent with a precautionary approach to addressing NRM issues, which means that action is taken on the best available information â action is not delayed until âperfect informationâ becomes available. Plans will be accredited provided adaptive management approaches are adopted and an appropriate process for continuous improvement of the plan exists.</para>
<para>It is recognised that knowledge of the potentially complex environmental interactions in individual regions is variable. Actions implemented under the investment strategies are based on the best available knowledge to deal with the identified threats and meet the established targets. In those circumstances where there is uncertainty about the effects of interactions between environmental conditions or other potential outcomes from an activity, these can be evaluated through appropriate monitoring regimes. Information derived from monitoring or other sources of new knowledge can be used to adapt management actions to minimise the risks of adverse outcomes and promote those activities that are demonstrated to be effective.</para>
</item>
<item label="(7)">
<para>All regional NRM plans must meet the accreditation criteria. A review process is built into all plans. The accreditation criteria state, âcontinuous development and improvement of the plan â¦ is expectedâ. They also state âthe process for developing and refining regional NRM plans must include clear requirements for periodic review against agreed milestones and updating to take account of new informationâ.</para>
</item>
<item label="(8)">
<para>The nationally agreed accreditation criteria for all regional NRM plans require the plans to be consistent with other agreed strategies. Guidelines for regions developing their plans specifically identify the NWQMS.</para>
</item>
<item label="(9)">
<para>The Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) report states that ârelevant national standards, such as in relation to water quality, could be better communicated to the regions as part of the evolution of the regional delivery modeâ. It does not state that the NWQMS is not being implemented.</para>
</item>
<item label="(10)">
<para>Maintaining the aquatic environment is considered beneficial in all regions. Specific consideration of environmental flows may be considered a lower priority in areas such as in the rangeland regions, or in high rainfall regions where water is plentiful and extraction rates are low.</para>
</item>
<item label="(11)">
<para>There is no overall set proportion of NAP investment for environmental flows. As an example, however, in the NSW NAP regions, approximately 5 per cent of NAP funding approved to date relates to improving environmental flows. It needs to be recognized that this investment complements investments under initiatives such as the Living Murray initiative, a commitment by Southern Murray-Darling Basin jurisdictions of $500 million over 5 years to address water-over-allocation in the Murray-Darling Basin</para>
</item>
<item label="(12)">
<para>The goal of the NAP is to motivate and enable regional communities to use coordinated and targeted action to prevent, stabilise and reverse trends in dryland salinity affecting the sustainability of production, the conservation of biological diversity and the viability of infrastructure, and improve water quality and secure reliable allocations for human uses, industry and the environment. The aim of the program is for all levels of government, community groups, individual land managers and local businesses to work together in tackling salinity and improving water quality.</para>
<para>The Inter-Governmental Agreement covering the NAP states that whilst compensation to assist adjustment where property rights are lost will be addressed in developing catchment/regional plans, such compensation is the responsibility of States and Territories.</para>
<para>Where it is agreed that adjustment or property amalgamation is necessary NAP funds and other relevant Australian or State/Territory Government programs can be used.</para>
</item>
<item label="(13)">
<para>The nationally agreed accreditation criteria require regions to take into account the identification of regional natural resource assets of national value. Following receipt of regional investment plans, Australian and State Government officials undertake a joint assessment of project proposals. A review of investments and their contribution to national NRM objectives (including matters of national environmental significance) is being undertaken by Australian Government officials. All potential investments are subject to relevant legislation, including the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.</para>
</item>
<item label="(14)">
<para>Investments under the NAP are being evaluated as part of the National Monitoring and Evaluation Framework. One evaluation is focusing on the content of the NRM plans, whether communities have appropriate levels of skills and knowledge to implement the plans, and to what extent the policy reforms in the bilateral agreements are being implemented. This evaluation is expected to be completed by August 2005.</para>
<para>Further evaluations are assessing biodiversity outcomes and weeds outcomes, and are expected to be completed in June 2005. Evaluations of salinity outcomes and sustainable agriculture outcomes are expected to be completed in August 2005.</para>

</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">

<para>Yes. The advice is sought from independent panels. Arrangements vary from State-to-State, but generally take the form of advisory panels to the Joint Steering Committees (JSC) established in each state and territory. Members of these panels have expertise in a range of natural resource matters; however, because they are established through the relevant state/territory, the actual composition and any remuneration arrangements are a matter for that jurisdiction.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>The accreditation criteria were developed and agreed by the Natural Resource Management (NRM) Ministerial Council. The aim of broad guidelines and criteria was to allow States and regions to develop plans that suited local needs and institutional arrangements within an overall agreed framework. At the State level, there is the additional input of independent technical advisory bodies, which provide another layer of quality control.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>Guidelines for regional plans were developed on a State-by-State basis in consultation with the regional bodies in particular States. It was necessary to develop broad guidelines quickly to ensure that regions were not unnecessarily delayed in the development of their plans.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>The accreditation process has provided a strategic framework for considering investments and is assessed jointly by State or Territory and Australian Governments. Accreditation by both the Australian Government and State Ministers confers their recognition that the plans are of an adequate quality to allow targeted investment to address priority NRM issues. An important principle included in every plan, however, is the need for continuous improvement.</para>

<para>The Australian Government is actively streamlining and reducing the red tape involved in its NRM programs. These efforts have focused, in particular, on reducing the turn-around time for accrediting the NRM plans developed by the regional bodies. The current reporting requirements for the regional bodies are also being evaluated with a view to improve the reporting processes to focus more on outcomes, reduce the burden of reporting, whilst maintaining accountability of public funds. Streamlining the funding process and providing more certainty by continuing to work with the States and regional bodies to introduce three-year investment strategies is also a key priority.</para>

<para>âThe Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following answer to the honourable memberâs question:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>The risk management plan was initially developed in September 2003. It has the status of a working document, and has therefore been progressively refined since that date.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>The National Water Quality Management Strategy (NWQMS) is a guide to all regional bodies that have identified water quality as a priority. As State and Territory Governments have direct responsibility for the management of water resources, it is clearly also prudent for regional organisations to access the information resources provided by those governments. Where specific actions are required in a region under the NWQMS these need to be included in the regional National Resource Management (NRM) plan.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>The intended outputs of the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality (NAP) and their implementation arrangements are included in the regional NRM plans and investment strategies. Links to these documents are on the NRM website www.nrm.gov.au and the documents are also available from regional organisations.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>The risk management plan is a living document which was commenced in early 2003. In the early stages of the NAP implementation risks were managed on a case-by-case basis. This reflected the exploratory nature of these stages, including difficulties in sensibly identifying the full range of feasible risks for a new program of this kind. However, as the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) noted in its recent review of the NAP, âMinisters were advised of some of the potential higher order risks in the early stages of the programâ and these were addressed accordingly.</para>
<para>For instance, the timing of program expenditure was recognised as both critical to the success of the NAP and âquite uncertainâ, given its dependence on factors such as the length of time needed to progress regional initiatives (see para. 2.20, ANAO report). The ANAO also noted (para. 2.50), that âthere was little scope for the Australian Government agencies to have accelerated the implementation processâ in the early stages of the program, given delays in reaching agreements with State and Territory governments. These delays exacerbated uncertainties relating to program expenditure.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>The risk management plan covers the types of risks identified in the question. Risk management entails identifying all possible risks and focussing on those that are within the program managersâ control and are some combination of high impact or high likelihood. Treatments for these types of risks have been included in the management, administration and reporting arrangements for the program.</para>
</item>
<item label="(6)">
<para>and (7) The ANAO report states that it âintends to conduct a follow-up audit prior to the current NAP completion date of 2008 to provide Parliament with an assessment of the administrative effectiveness of the programâ. Questions about the ANAOâs audit and work programs should be directed to the ANAO.</para>
<para>(8)Â Â  (a) The risk management plan is reviewed as part of the annual planning cycle for the Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF) and the Environment and Heritage (DEH). (b) The plans have not been presented to Ministers. They are a normal part of departmental administration of Government programs. (c) Given its iterative nature, and the status of the NAP/NHT risk management plan as an internal working document, Ministerial approval is not sought. (d) The plans are considered by Senior Executives of the Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Environment and Heritage. (e) The risk management plan for the NAP/NHT was based on the Australian/New Zealand Standard for Risk Management by Standards Australia (AS/NZS4360:2004). The plan was also guided by the DAFF Risk Management Framework and the DAFF Risk Management Toolkit, the DEH Risk Management Handbook and the DEH Chief Executive Instructions (CEI) No 7.1 and DAFF CEI No. 24 on risk management.</para>

<para>The Australian Government recognises the considerable time and effort NRM groups are putting into their work. The Government is assisting regional groups in the transition from shorter-term, output-based projects to the integrated catchment scale planning through specific financial support for the preparation of plans, and broader capacity-building initiatives.</para>
<para>The ANAO report recognised that, although the transition to the regional delivery model has been challenging, the model has âmany strong design features, including the flexibility to meet the needs of different regions with appropriate action and to empower local communitiesâ. The ANAO also found that respondents from regional groups surveyed as part of its review were âoverwhelmingly positiveâ (para. 2.54 of the ANAO report) in response to the statement âthat the NAP is a well-designed program that is appropriateâ for regional needs.</para>

<item label="(10)">
<para>Resources for regions are considered in the context of the investment required to achieve the outputs and outcomes being sought. The Australian Government is currently working with State Governments and regional bodies to improve the governance arrangements of regional bodies, particularly in relation to their capacity for financial management, management systems and risk management. The evaluation is expected to be completed in August 2005.</para>
</item>
<item label="(11)">
<para>As noted in the response to Question 10, an evaluation of governance at the regional level is due in August this year. Additionally the Community Forum, involving the chairs of all regional bodies, discussed governance arrangements at its meeting in April 2005.

<para>Three year funding cycles provide certainty of funding for projects that may take time to plan, develop and implement. It also streamlines the development and approval process. (b) Three-year funding may also suit other Natural Resource Management (NRM) projects and programs and within budgetary planning arrangements is considered where necessary.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>Because the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality (NAP) is a joint program with states/territories, arrangements for the distribution of investments across regions are determined jointly with the relevant state/territory. The distribution of those funds between regions varies across the jurisdictions and is a process that involves a joint assessment of relative need, the capacity to make a difference and relative expected return.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>Yes. The Australian Governmentâs investment priorities for regions were pursued with the regions and the jurisdictions in the development of regional NRM plans and investment strategies. Plans and investment strategies are available through the website www.nrm.gov.au.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>All regions either have three-year investment strategies in place or are moving towards them. There is capacity to adjust the investment strategies to take account of new or emerging priorities through an annual review process.</para>

<item label="(5)">
<para>The group referred to is the Mt Lofty Ranges and Greater Adelaide INRM Group. This group is established as a sub committee to the Board of Management of the State-administered Mt Lofty Ranges Catchment Program and is therefore not an incorporated body. The members are ministerially appointed and the group operates under the aegis of the South Australian Department of Water, Land and Biodiversity Conservation. Therefore the financial management and accountability obligations of the Group were appropriately reflected in a financial agreement to which the State is bound and payment was made accordingly. This group will formally operate until 30 June 2005 when new arrangements will be put in place in line with the new South Australian Natural Resource Management Act.</para>

<item label="(6)">
<para>The Australian and State/Territory governments have allowed 5 per cent of NAP funds for administrative costs. The Natural Heritage Trust (NHT) administration cost was 6.6 per cent of program funds.</para>
<para>(7)Â Â  (a) and (b) Payments under the NAP and the NHT have not, over the life of these programs, been assembled in the manner requested by the honourable member.

<item label="(8)">
<para>Specific issues relating to the timing of NAP payments need to be considered in the overall context of NAP investment arrangements. Investment decisions under the NAP are made bilaterally between State/Territory governments and the Australian Government. Investment decisions are overseen by Joint Steering Committees, consisting of State and Australian Government officials, in each jurisdiction, and are then considered jointly by State and Australian Government Ministers.</para>
<para>Once a joint investment decision is made, State and Australian Government funds are provided to state-held single holding accounts through funding agreements. The State is responsible for negotiating a contract with the organization that will administer the particular investment. State and Australian Government funds are provided based on the cash flow estimated by proponents. Once investment strategies are agreed, the initial funding is provided six months in advance. Following this, quarterly payments are made to regional bodies.</para>
<para>Therefore, payment of Australian Government funds into the single holding account should occur when proponents are ready to receive their funds. However, logistical delays can occur as a result of matters such as the need to negotiate arrangements with jurisdictions and regions, negotiations between regional organisations and service providers, and resourcing issues such as the recruitment of project staff. Delays can also arise from climatic and other environmental factors influencing project progress.</para>
<para>(8)Â Â  (a) The five-month delay in a payment from the single holding account to a proponent, noted by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO), did not overlap two financial years. (b â c) Australian Government financial systems reflect payments into single holding accounts. As States and Territories are responsible for directing individual projects, the Australian Government does not record information in a manner that enables a definitive response to the honourable memberâs question. (d) As noted above, payments are made from single holding accounts on a quarterly rather than on the monthly basis requested by the honourable member. As it is unclear what benefits can be derived from conducting a highly resource-intensive monthly analysis at this stage in the life of these programs, I have not provided the tables requested by him.</para>

<para>(a) Actions to address NRM outcomes in the Collie River catchment are a priority at the regional and state level and are specifically recognised in the bilateral agreements between the Australian and Western Australian governments for the delivery of the NAP and the NHT. (b) The key attributes of the Collie River catchment initiative are the: reduction in salinity in a major water way and water catchment in WA; improved water quality for drinking, irrigation and recreation purposes; reduction in threat to biodiversity from improved water quality and reduced salinity in waterways associated with the Collie River and Wellington Dam; improved productive capacity of the land leading to improved economic outcomes in irrigation and related industries. (c) The Collie project is being funded in addition to the regionâs investment process and indicative allocation, but this additional funding is within the overall Western Australian allocation. (d) Priorities identified in the draft natural resource management strategy include improvements in water quality in a number of rivers and wetlands and reducing the impact of rising water tables on agriculture and public land. Specific details of the draft strategy are available from the following website www.swcatchmentscouncil.com. (e) The Collie is a high priority. This will be a substantial investment in a large scale action which is supported by many years of technical and scientific investigation. There has been considerable involvement with local stakeholders and the project is well planned and ready to be implemented. The investment plan for this region is expected to be finalised by June 2005.</para>

<item label="(11)">
<para>(a) No. Investments take account of the likelihood of being able to make a difference. Where an irreversible problem exists actions might relate more to protecting assets of highest value and preventing the problem getting worse where this is possible. (b) Investments are targeted to achieving outcomes that on the information available best achieve a range of environmental, economic and social outcomes. Greater resources will tend to go to those actions that protect assets and provide outcomes of greatest value.</para>

<item label="(12)">
<para>Investment decisions are made jointly by the Australian and State / Territory Governments and the regional body. It is expected that investments will continue to be made to both prevent future damage to high value assets, and to improve degraded areas where it is cost effective and where valuable environmental services, NRM targets or high value assets can be protected.</para>

<para>Public investments are targeted to achieving public benefits. Investments may be made on private land where there are public benefits; where public and private benefits accrue from a single investment, appropriate cost-sharing arrangements are sought.</para>

</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>The valuations provided to the South Australian Government and South Australian local councils by the South Australian Valuer General are calculated as of the beginning of the previous financial year. They would currently be providing January 2004 values for the 2004-05 rates, taxes and levies. The Australian Valuation Office, Centrelinkâs official valuer, provides the current market value of the property. In an environment of rising property values, we would expect to see differences in the valuations from these two agencies.</para>
<para>In addition, some South Australian councils are using âsiteâ (unimproved land) values from the Valuer General, rather than market values. Social Security legislation requires the current market value of the entire property.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>Prior to reviewing customersâ real estate asset values, Centrelink sends customers a letter and form, which lets them know their real estate asset value is being reviewed. This letter and form gives them an opportunity to provide Centrelink with their estimate of value.</para>
<para>When customers provide their own estimate of value in response to the letter and form from Centrelink, a decision is made whether to accept it or seek a valuation from the Australian Valuation Office. The decision is based on local knowledge and a valuation-testing tool that the Australian Valuation Office provides. The period between the customer receiving our letter and form and Centrelink applying a new valuation in their assessment could vary between three (3) and six (6) weeks.</para>
<para>Once Centrelink has received the new valuation from the Australian Valuation Office, that new value is applied immediately. If the new valuation affects the customerâs entitlement, Centrelink sends them a second letter. The letter tells the customer what real estate asset was updated, the new value and what effect this has had on their payment. In this letter, customers are also given information about the Pension Loans Scheme, the Assets Test Hardship Provisions and Centrelinkâs Financial Service Officers.</para>
<para>Commonly the second letter would arrive immediately before the change in payment but, in some cases it may arrive on, or after, the day the change is applied. This will depend on the payday chosen by the customer, the day the change is applied and postal delivery times.</para>

<para>Notes to the Statistics</para>
<para>These statistics relate to non-referred (general practitioner) attendances that were rendered on a âfee-for-serviceâ basis and for which benefits were processed by the Health Insurance Commission in the respective periods. Excluded are details of non-referred attendances to public patients in hospital, to Department of Veteransâ Affairs patients and some compensation cases.</para>
<para>These statistics are based on 2004 electorate boundaries.</para>
<para>The statistics were compiled from Medicare data by patient enrolment (mailing address) postcode. Where a postcode overlapped electoral boundaries, the statistics were allocated to electorate using a concordance file derived from population census data. This can result in some data being erroneously allocated to an adjoining electorate. Data for people using post office boxes or private mail bags is excluded from electorate reporting as this cannot be appropriately allocated. Data have also been excluded if postcodes were not present on the concordance file.</para>
<para>Average out-of-pocket costs relate to non-hospital patient billed services and are the difference between aggregate fees charged and aggregate benefits paid, divided by the number of services. It is not possible to compile accurate statistics on the average patient contribution per service for patient billed services in-hospital, since the Medicare system does not record gap payments under private health insurance arrangements.</para>

<para>Notes to the Statistics</para>
<para>These statistics relate to non-referred (general practitioner) attendances that were rendered on a âfee-for-serviceâ basis and for which benefits were processed by the Health Insurance Commission in the year in question. Excluded are details of non-referred attendances to public patients in hospital, to Department of Veteransâ Affairs patients and some compensation cases.</para>
<para>These statistics are based on 2004 electorate boundaries.</para>
<para>The statistics were compiled from Medicare data by patient enrolment (mailing address) postcode. Where a postcode overlapped electoral boundaries, the statistics were allocated to electorate using a concordance file derived from population census data. This can result in some data being erroneously allocated to an adjoining electorate. Data for people using post office boxes or private mail bags is excluded from electorate reporting as this cannot be appropriately allocated. Data have also been excluded if postcodes were not present on the concordance file.</para>
<para>Average out-of-pocket costs relate to non-hospital patient billed services and are the difference between aggregate fees charged and aggregate benefits paid, divided by the number of services. It is not possible to compile accurate statistics on the average patient contribution per service for patient billed services in-hospital, since the Medicare system does not record gap payments under private health insurance arrangements.</para>

<para>The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service examines all inbound containers externally as they leave the wharf and arranges for them to be examined internally once they arrive at container parks/depots. AQIS and industry have long-standing arrangements with Customs to report anything suspicious. These arrangements have proved effective in reporting anomalies. Customs has completed several risk assessments on empty containers. Over the years these assessments have all found empty containers to be low risk. Customs puts some empty containers through the container x-ray on an irregular basis to test this finding.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>Customs specific legislation contains no explicit obligation to inspect and examine empty sea cargo containers. Current policy regarding the inspection of empty sea cargo containers is that inspections occur on an as needs basis. Customs conducts saturation exercises inspecting all containers on vessels from time to time and regularly reviews its assessment of empty containers to ensure that appropriate measures are in place. It also monitors overseas trends.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>There are no specific guidelines established for the screening or examination of empty containers as a separate category. Customs treats empty containers no differently to any other category of cargo container. It checks according to the level of risk generally, and also acts on specific information.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I am aware that the Honourable Member has directed a variety of questions concerning broad maritime issues to a range of Government departments. The Australian Government provides extensive maritime security capacity building assistance to countries in the Asia-Pacific region. In developing this assistance, the Government regularly discusses maritime security and related counter-terrorism matters - at ministerial and officialsâ level â with regional countries, including those identified. A range of government departments, including DFAT, participate in such discussions.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Over the past 12 months, I and my Department have used ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) meetings to advocate increased cooperation on maritime security issues, with particular regard to South-East Asia. ARF members include Indonesia, Malaysia, PNG, Philippines and Singapore. Key ARF meetings at which maritime security has been raised include the ARF Ministerial in Jakarta on 2 July 2004, the Phnom Penh Intersessional Meeting on 26-28 October 2004, the Potsdam Intersessional Meeting on 22-23 February 2005 and the ARF Senior Officialsâ Meeting in Vientiane on 20 May 2005. Australia has also held discussions with Singapore, under the auspices of APEC, about working together to build capability more broadly in the region. DFAT is also an active participant in the APEC Counter-Terrorism Task Force which promotes cooperation in a range of counter-terrorism areas. One of its priorities is maritime security. The Australian and Singaporean Governments have agreed to jointly deliver a series of maritime security workshops in APEC focusing on improving and enhancing maritime port and security. The workshops â to be held in Singapore from June to November 2005 - will focus on how to conduct security training, drills and exercises relating to port security.</para>

<para>to (5) Consular officials seek to visit arrested Australians as soon as possible after notification of their arrest and permission has been received by the relevant local authority. At that visit, consular officials provide general information about consular services the Government can provide including a list of local English-speaking lawyers and, if required, a list of interpreters and translation services. Longstanding practice is that the Australian Government does not provide funds to cover the cost of interpreters or translation services and their engagement is for the individual or their legal representative to determine, but consular officials can facilitate contact with such services if requested.</para>

<para>âThe answer to the honourable memberâs question is as follows:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Australia supports the approach agreed by the Monterrey Consensus that progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) requires a partnership between developed and developing countries with policies and actions required of both. Developing countries themselves are responsible for leading their own strategies for development based on their individual circumstances, and for creating an enabling domestic environment, including through improving good governance, economic reform and openness to trade. Developed countries have an important role to provide well-targeted and effective aid, appropriate debt relief, duty-free and quota-free market access to goods from the Least Developed Countries, and promote and support global economic growth, including through more liberalised world trade.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Australiaâs aid program supports developing countriesâ progress towards the MDGs by providing well targeted and effective aid. The aid program focuses on the essential blocks for achieving that progress â namely governance, growth and stability. Australiaâs aid program also provides direct assistance for health, education, water, sanitation, environment and communicable diseases including HIV/AIDS.</para>
<list type="loweralpha">
<item label="(a)">
<para>The overall objective of Australiaâs aid program, which encompasses the first MDG, is to advance Australiaâs national interest by assisting developing countries reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development, particularly in our region. To support this, Australia will provide an estimated $2.491 billion in Official Development Assistance (ODA) in 2005â06 - an increase of $358 million on the 2004-05 Budget Figure and a real increase of 11.7 per cent. This marks the fifth successive budget that the Government has delivered real growth in ODA. The ratio of Australiaâs ODA to Gross National Income (GNI) for 2005-06 is estimated at 0.28 per cent. This places Australia above the weighted average for OECD donors which was 0.25 per cent in 2004.</para>
<para>As a whole, the Asia-Pacific region (incorporating East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific) has made significant progress towards reducing extreme poverty and hunger. Much of the success has been due to strong economic growth along with sound economic management and significant investments in health and education. Effective economic policies and institutions have played a major role in explaining the downward poverty trends seen in the Asia-Pacific region, where the MDG of halving the 1990 $1 per day poverty rate by 2015 has already been achieved.</para>
</item>
<item label="(b)">
<para>Increasing access to basic education and training, improving its quality and relevance, and making it more accessible for the most vulnerable in developing countries are a major focus of Australiaâs aid program.</para>
<para>From 1999 to 2004, Australia allocated $279 million in ODA for basic education and more than $1.3 billion in total education. In 2003â04 access to primary and secondary education was improved for 1.1 million children in the Asia-Pacific region as a result of Australian assistance. Since 1999 Australia has trained almost 45,000 primary and high school teachers in developing countries in our region and has built or refurbished at least 1200 schools and education centres.</para>
</item>
<item label="(c)">
<para>Gender equality is a crosscutting issue in Australiaâs development policy and assistance. Australia recognises that, while gender equality is an important goal in itself, it is also essential for progress towards the other goals. A major constraint faced by many countries trying to escape poverty is a lack of capacity, capability and skills. Gender inequality is often a major contributing factor.</para>
<para>Australia assists partner countries to promote gender equality and seeks to mainstream gender equality in country, sector, program and activity strategies. The aid program works with partner countries to ensure equal access to education and health. Educating girls is the single best investment that can be made in reducing child mortality and ensuring mothers will in turn educate their children and achieve better family health.</para>
</item>
<item label="(d)">
<para>and (e) Maternal and child health programs, together with education for women and girls, have proved to be among the most cost-effective development efforts to improve the quality of life of families in developing countries.</para>
<para>In 2003-04, Australia provided an estimated $247.5 million for health related programs, including building or refurbishing more than 1000 hospitals, clinics and outreach services and the immunisation of more than 14.5 million children. Australia is working with partner governments to significantly strengthen healthcare. In Indonesia, for example, Australia is contributing to a national health program to improve healthcare. In Papua province, a safe motherhood program is giving mothers and their babies access to better services in district, sub-district and village health facilities with trained midwives and local health personnel and medical supplies.</para>
<para>In Nepal, Australia together with other donors is helping to avert an estimated 35,000 child deaths a year through the community-based Integrated Management of Childhood Illness Program and the National Vit-A Program. Child mortality in Nepal has been reduced by 22 per cent from 1996-2001. In 2005-06, Australia will provide an estimated $298 million on health related programs.</para>
</item>
<item label="(f)">
<para>AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria are three of the worldâs most devastating diseases. Australia is extremely concerned at the growing incidence of HIV/AIDS, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. Consequently addressing HIV/AIDS is a major priority for Australiaâs aid program. Australiaâs international HIV/AIDS strategy, âMeeting the Challengesâ, builds on the six-year $200 million global HIV/AIDS initiative announced in 2000. This commitment has since increased to $600 million by 2010 and includes bilateral HIV interventions in the Asia-Pacific region, enhanced contributions to multilateral programs and support for non-government activities. Implementation of Australiaâs international HIV/AIDS strategy includes appointing a special representative to strengthen Australiaâs advocacy for HIV/AIDS to coordinate our efforts in the Asia-Pacific region.</para>
<para>The World Bank recently concluded that the future of the global HIV/AIDS pandemic will be determined in Asia. The current and potential impact of the epidemic in the Asia-Pacific region is still not commanding the attention it merits from all parties and governments. If current trends continue, the Asia-Pacific region will account for 40 per cent of all new HIV infections by 2010. As a result, achievement of this MDG is at risk without substantially increased efforts from the development community.</para>
</item>
<item label="(g)">
<para>Australia continues to be a major supporter of the sustainable management of natural resources. Such management together with sound agricultural practices are vital for long-term prosperity and reduced poverty in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly for small island developing countries. Australian assistance is improving environmental management and governance and supporting the livelihoods of poorer rural communities.</para>
<para>Australia ensures that environmental concerns are mainstreamed within the aid program and that aid activities continue to be based on internationally recognised âbest practiceâ principles of environmental assessment and management, through adherence to rigorous environmental management guidelines. In 2005-06, the aid program is contributing $152 million for better water and sanitation and $305 million for environment-related programs, including support to the Global Environment Facility and the Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund. Through the aid program, 800,000 people were provided with access to an improved water source in 2003â04.</para>
</item>
<item label="(h)">
<para>The eighth MDG is to Develop a Global Partnership for Development and covers the contributions which need to be made by developed countries to support the creation of a favourable international climate to help developing countries achieve progress towards the MDGs.</para>
<para>Australia is advancing this MDG by providing well-targeted and effective aid, appropriate debt relief, duty-free and quota-free market access to goods from the Least Developed Countries, and by promoting and supporting global economic growth, including through more liberalised world trade.</para>
<para>Australia, through the Cairns Group, has long supported efforts in the Doha Round to eliminate agricultural export subsidies, significantly reduce trade distorting domestic support and remove barriers to market access â all of which will substantially benefit developing countries. Australia has also put in place one of the most generous and comprehensive access schemes for Least Developed Countries (LDCs), applying zero tariffs and zero quotas to all goods originating in the 50 LDCs, without exception or phase-ins.</para>
<para>Australia is also a strong supporter of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. Australia has pledged over $110 million to finance HIPC debt relief by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), including a new three year, $34.8 million commitment through the 2005-06 aid budget. The Government is also committed to provide 100 per cent bilateral debt forgiveness for countries that qualify for HIPC debt relief. Last year, the Government forgave the bilateral debts owed to Australia by Ethiopia and Nicaragua.</para>
<para>The Government has also committed debt relief funds through the Paris Club of bilateral creditors. For example, at a meeting of the Paris Club on 10 March 2005, the Australian Government joined with other creditor countries to offer the governments of tsunami-affected countries, including Indonesia, a moratorium on scheduled debt repayments for 2005.</para>
<para>Australia is producing a report on âA Global Partnership for Development: Australiaâs contribution to achieving the Millennium Developing Goalsâ. The report will outline key partnerships for development and show how Australia is helping developing countries achieve progress towards the MDGs.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">On 3 December 2004, I welcomed the report of the UN Secretary-Generalâs High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, released in New York on 2 December 2004. The ambitious report tackled many of the urgent and critical threats facing the world in the 21st century. Australia has long advocated reform of the multilateral system and strongly supported the work of the Panel. I welcomed the Panelâs focus on action to combat the threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including the potential for terrorists to acquire such weapons, and the Panelâs proposals on the use of force, including in response to humanitarian crises. I also welcomed the Panelâs bold proposals for assisting failed and failing states, notably through the establishment of a Peacebuilding Commission.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Panel proposed two methods of expanding the UN Security Council. Model A involves the creation of six new permanent seats and three non-permanent seats. Model B involves the creation of a new class of four-year renewable term seats (eight of these) and one new non-pemanent seat. Australia has long supported expanding the permanent membership of the Security Council to make it more attuned to current geopolitical realities, including through the addition of Japan, India, Brazil and appropriate African representation.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">On 22 March 2005, I also welcomed the March 2005 report of the Secretary-General, In larger freedom, which contains a package of ambitious measures for consideration by member states ahead of the September world leadersâ summit.</para>

He indicated he would examine sympathetically the granting of duty waivers on a case-by-case basis for imported relief items already sent to Sri Lanka from Australia, where requests for such consideration are made to the Minister through the Australian High Commission in Colombo.</para>

<para>Yes.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>Six rounds of peace talks were held between September 2002 and March 2003, when the LTTE suspended participation - mainly owing to dissatisfaction with the pace of progress towards granting interim regional autonomy in the north and east. The peace process remains suspended but the ceasefire continues to hold despite numerous violations (mainly by the LTTE).</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>The Government, through our High Commission in Colombo, has urged the parties to restart the peace process without further delay and to negotiate constructively towards a durable settlement that safeguards the interests of all Sri Lankans. We have maintained regular dialogue with the Norwegian peace process facilitators and consistently spoken out in support of their role in negotiations.</para>
<para>The Government provides practical support to peace-building in Sri Lanka through the aid program, which has more than doubled since the signing of the cease-fire agreement. In 2005-06, our aid program will provide an estimated $29.1 million to Sri Lanka, the bulk of which will be dedicated to a range of initiatives in support of the peace process.</para>
<para>This includes funding to UN organisations, such as the World Food Programme, UNICEF and UNDP, to feed communities affected by the conflict, support health and education initiatives for women and children, and rehabilitate basic infrastructure destroyed by the conflict.</para>
<para>Australia has also funded landmine clearance operations, and through the International Refugee Fund, Australia has supported the reintegration of refugees and internally displaced people back into their communities following the cease-fire agreement.</para>
<para>Finally, the Australian Government supports the proposed creation of a joint mechanism for tsunami reconstruction between the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE. Both the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE have made efforts to reach a negotiated settlement on this issue. The creation of a joint mechanism has the potential to provide renewed momentum to the peace process.</para>

<item label="(2)">
<para>Mrs Skase did not renounce her Australian citizenship but lost it under the now repealed section 17 of the Act when she became a citizen of the Commonwealth of Dominica. Section 17 provided that an Australian citizen who had attained the age of 18 years and who did an act or thing, the sole and dominant purpose of which and the effect of which was to acquire the nationality and citizenship of a foreign country automatically ceased to be an Australian citizen on acquisition of that citizenship. Section 17 was repealed on 4 April 2002. Since then Australian citizens acquiring the citizenship of another country have not lost their Australian citizenship.</para>

<item label="(3)">
<para>$26,993.90 was paid to external counsel for the purpose of defending, in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the decision to refuse Mrs Skaseâs application to resume her citizenship.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>No.</para>
<para>The resumption provisions in the Act do not provide for consideration of the reasons why people renounced or lost their Australian citizenship. They do, however, require people seeking to resume their Australian citizenship to be of good character. The good character requirement is quite broad and allows for consideration to be given to the circumstances in which someone seeking to avoid arrest or extradition to Australia may have renounced their Australian citizenship.</para>
<para>Extradition law, which varies from country to country, sets out the circumstances in which a government will agree to hand over to another government a person suspected (or convicted) of committing crimes in the petitioning countryâs jurisdiction. A personâs liability for extradition to Australia would usually be more dependent on whether they hold the citizenship of another country than whether or not they are an Australian citizen. The more relevant consideration would be whether the laws of the country in which they are located permit their extradition to Australia. Some countriesâ laws prevent the extradition of their nationals to other countries, and some of these countries have laws providing for the prosecution of their nationals for offences committed in other countries.</para>

<para>On 17 January 2005 the Classification Review Board, in a 3:2 majority decision, classified the film <inline font-style="italic">9 Songs</inline> R18+ with the consumer advice âActual sex, high-level sex scenesâ.</para>
<para>In the Review Boardâs majority opinion, the film warrants an R18+ classification because, while some scenes may offend some sections of the adult community, the actual sex scenes are justified by the context, narrative, tone and artistic merit.</para>
<para>In the view of the Review Board, âwhile the overall impact of the material was âhighâ, there was not sufficient strength in the film to cause a higher level of impact for any individual scene or cumulatively.

<para>Additionally, the National Classification Scheme provides for classification categories that are legally restricted. Sexually explicit material classified X is restricted to adults and is only available for sale or hire in the Northern Territory and the ACT. Material classified R18+ is legally restricted to adults. Children under 18 are not permitted to view R18+ films in cinemas, or rent or buy them on video or DVD.</para>

<item label="(6)">
<para>The Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 (the Act) states that the maximum number of positions permitted on the Classification Board is not more than 20.</para>

<para>The Act requires that, in appointing members, regard is had to the desirability of ensuring that the membership of the Boards is broadly representative of the Australian community. It also requires the Attorney-General to consult all States and Territories regarding proposed appointments.</para>
<para>Biographical information regarding the members of the Boards is published on the Office of Film and Literature Classification website (www.oflc.gov.au) and in the annual reports of the Boards.

<item label="(9)">
<para>The Boards are comprised of individuals who collectively are broadly representative of the Australian community.</para>
<para>The Act provides the greatest opportunity to achieve this by not proscribing or limiting who may be appointed to the Boards. Members of both Boards are appointed following an open merit-based recruitment and short-listing process. Whilst having regard to the desirability of recruiting a broadly representative Board (as required under the Act), the rigorous selection process also ensures that highly competent people with the practical skills and personal attributes to enable them to undertake the duties of Board members are appointed.</para>
<para>Appointments to the Boards are generally for three to four years and membership cannot exceed seven years in total. The regular membership changes ensure that new individuals from different backgrounds are joining the Boards on a routine basis.</para>

<para>âThe answer to the honourable memberâs question is as follows:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>Yes. In two separate decisions, the Commonwealth Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) has determined that such ioniser anodes do fall within the definition of an âagricultural chemical productâ as defined in s 4(2) of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code, and that consequently they require registration by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA). Suppliers are expected to seek registration of their anodes before such products are supplied in Australia.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>No. The APVMA only regulates those products that are included in the scope of its governing legislation. The AAT confirmed in June 2004 that these products required registration by the APVMA. At this stage, given its high level of concern over the safety of these products the APVMA would not exempt such products from regulation. The APVMAâs specific concerns for the public health in relation to pool sanitisers are addressed in Question No. 5 of the APVMAâs Frequently Asked Questions document relating to pool sanitisers.</para>
<para>http://www.apvma.gov.au/qa/poolspa_FAQ_May2005.shtml.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>No. Given that the weight of evidence available to date does not demonstrate that silver and copper ions alone will adequately control human pathogens (some of which can be fatal) in pools and spas, the APVMA has an obligation to communicate its concerns objectively in the interests of public health and safety.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>The study reported conclusions that were inconsistent with well established facts from many other studies reported in the scientific literature over the years (and which form the basis of publications such as the WHO guidelines). However, because the APVMA was not given access to the raw data of the study or full details on the methodology, which is essential for the APVMA to make a sound conclusion that could contribute to supporting a regulatory decision, it could not be considered in making this particular decision.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>Key scientific information and data on which the APVMA has based its regulatory actions is given in the response to questions 1408 and 1409.</para>
