</talker>
<para>âI welcome the opportunity to speak on the <inline ref="R2409">Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005</inline>. It is an issue that has caused me a great deal of concern in recent times. The importance of reform to the migration litigation process in Australia has become more and more apparent in recent years. This bill deals directly with two areas within the overall mandatory detention policy. The first issue is that of children in immigration detention. The second is the unacceptable time that several long-term detainees have spent in detention centres throughout Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Many of my constituents have expressed their concerns to me about long-term detention, and for some time I have shared some of these concerns. But I have not been alone in this process, and I have spoken on this issue in the past in the House. Other coalition members have also called for a degree of change to our immigration policy, and I welcome the recent debate that was stimulated by the member for Kooyong to bring about the recent changes.</para>
<para>With this in mind, and with a growing sense of concern, earlier this year I organised a visit to the Baxter immigration detention facility in South Australia. I was joined on that visit by the member for Kooyong and the member for Cook. Following that visit, I was convinced even more that the government could strike a balance between the two often competing demands of a compassionate response combined with control and retention of the fundamental principles of mandatory detention and border control. What also struck me during that visit was the psychological and emotional degradation that takes place with long-term detention. While I am not an expert in immigration visa applications and I cannot attest to the veracity of the various cases and the individuals whom we met, certainly I did walk away with a concern about the mental state of many of those whom we met.</para>
<para>While the government has made genuine progress in recent years, the system has proved unable to process all visa applications in a timely manner. There have been many causes for these delays. In particular, there has been a long and often protracted legal process that has often dogged the systemâand this is an issue that has been discussed at length by many in this House.</para>
<para>Australiaâs policy of mandatory detention has been a success. I know that there will be those who will dispute that fact. Even the more moderately inclined members of the Australian Labor Party have accepted this point. The system has been a key plank in deterring the immoral and callous trade in people smuggling. But the time has come, with the reduction in the number of boats and the stemming of the people-smuggling trade, for us to look at the detention policy with renewed interest. I am very pleased with the changes that are before us today.</para>
<para>I draw a strong sense of pride from the fact that this government is committed to helping some of the worldâs hardest-hit humanitarian refugees. Indeed, just a few months ago, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs announced that the government will maintain the intake of genuine refugees at 13,000 new places in 2005-06. While the governmentâs commitment to genuine refugees remains strong, the stance on illegal immigration has been beneficial. As I say, this has reduced the number of boat arrivals. It would be remiss of the parliament to overlook the recent positive progress that has been made. In recent years, the government has introduced changes to ease the visa processing period. The implementation of the residential housing projects and, more recently, the return-pending visa has helped to bring about a greater level of homelike living conditions. This is especially the case for women and children who have taken up those opportunities.</para>
<para>The issue of children in immigration detention is a difficult and multifaceted one. The government has worked in recent times to remove children into residential housing with their mothers. However, this has presented the dilemma of separating young families from their fathers. Through this bill, we now have a further enhancement of the compassionate response to handling children in detention by affirming as a principle that a minor shall only be detained as a measure of last resort. I am pleased to see that this bill will ensure that, when possible, the detention of a child will take place within the community. I welcome this move and the provision for additional power for the minister to specify the arrangements for families that are waiting for visas to be processed. I know that there are some in this House who will be concerned about the minister having a non-compellable discretionary power, but this is a step in the right direction.</para>
<para>More than anything, these changes are about fairness. On the one hand, it is fair for an orderly immigration system to process people wanting to come to Australia, including genuine refugees. On the other hand, it is only fair that peopleâs visas are processed in a timely and appropriate manner. An alteration to the act will bring a three-month time line for the processing of primary protection visas. I am encouraged by this move and by the further three-month time line that will be imposed on cases before the Refugee Review Tribunal. While no-one disputes the need for an immigration appeals system, it is surely counterproductive and totally unreasonable for the system to allow immigration detention for up to 6Â½ years.</para>
<para>While 1 am proud of the strong stance against people smuggling, the growing issue of long-term immigration detention in Australia has caused me a great deal of concern. I have always sought to provide an informed and insightful contribution to the debate on immigration detention. I have personally visited refugee camps overseas as well as the detention centres here in Australia. These experiences have always resonated in my mind. We need a robust and fair immigration process in Australia.</para>
<para>One detainee whom I was keen to meet was Mr Peter Qasim, who came to Australia from the disputed territory of Kashmir. Like many other Australians, I have been touched by Mr Qasimâs story. I was fortunate enough to meet with him during my visit to Baxter. Ironically, he was in relatively good spirits and I was buoyed by his positive attitude on the day. Mr Qasimâs case is unique. After more than 6Â½ years he simply wants to be out of detention, be that here in Australia orâin more recent timesâback in India. Many in this House would be aware of Mr Qasimâs story. He is a native of the disputed region of Kashmir. Mr Qasimâs journey took him through Pakistan, Singapore and Papua New Guinea before arriving in Australia. Since then he has spent time in the Port Hedland, Woomera, and Curtin detention centres before arriving at the Baxter facility. His time in detention has also included a brief stay in prison after escaping the Port Hedland facility.</para>
<para>This protracted process has lasted in excess of four years, which appears to have been to the detriment of Mr Qasimâs health and mental wellbeing. I was particularly concerned to hear reports the other day that Mr Qasim has been moved to treatment at the Glenside Hospital in Adelaide because of his deteriorating mental condition. The possibility that Mr Qasim may be released on a return-pending visa is an outcome that I welcome wholeheartedly. I look forward to Mr Qasim taking up the offer.</para>
<para>The campaign that was waged against me on the issue of mandatory detention by so-called local âaction groupsâ within my electorate of Deakin prior to last yearâs election was ferocious. Many within this group called for âchange within the federal seat of Deakinâ. Fortunately, it did not happen. I was horrified by some of the antics that were proposed. Most abhorrently, a prominent Melbourne newspaper columnist and Greens supporter proposed placing caged children outside my electorate office as a way of generating publicity for the cause. That proposal horrified me and certainly I know that reasonably minded individuals in my electorate would have been appalled by it. It is ironic that some refugee advocates are now calling for a change within the Australian Labor Party following the ill-advised comments of the member for Reid in reference to Peter Qasim being offered a return-pending bridging visa.</para>
<para>I do not want to go on at great length on the ALPâs position. There have been positions all over the place on this. I am particularly heartened by the fact that the changes that have taken place have been because of the voice that has been expressed on this side of the House. The voice that has been expressed by coalition members has created change. Throughout the whole process the Australian Labor Party has basically been made to look irrelevant in this whole debate. This can no better be demonstrated than by a comment that was made to me following my visit to Baxter. There was some publicity in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> and one prominent ALP backbencher said to me, âKeep it going, guys. Youâre making us look totally irrelevant and are embarrassing us with your stance.â I am pleased to see that other voices on this side came through and supported the need for a more compassionate response.</para>
<para>The changes within this bill are sensible and have been largely brought about following the discussions in the party room. I would like to acknowledge those coalition MPs who have expressed their views. More importantly, I would like to acknowledge the Prime Minister for his availability to listen and for providing every member of the coalition who wanted to express a view with a chance to do so. In return, the Prime Minister responded in the manner we have seen in the last three or four days and in the bill before us today. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>âIn rising to speak in this debate on the <inline ref="R2409">Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005</inline> I want to start by congratulating the government on finally recognising that all is not well with its immigration policies. The changes currently before the House are long overdue. I welcome anything, no matter how small, which can potentially provide relief to the many individuals who are suffering the horrors of unnecessary detention. But, to be honest, it simply is not enough. In my first ever speech in this place in 2001 I made no secret of my determination to find ways of changing immigration policy. I predicted then that the other side of this House would find the mess they have made of our immigration program sticking in their throats. I am saddened but not surprised to see that that prediction has come horribly true, if only for a scant handful.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>These proposed changes are the most impressive example I have ever seen of the expression âtoo little, too lateâ. Ask Peter Qasim if this amendment will do anything to repair the severe mental illness which his seven years of detention have left him with. In fact, ask Peter Qasim if this amendment will guarantee that nobody else faces the same circumstances. It will not. In a press conference a few days ago the Prime Minister said, âThe more I have delved into this issue, the greatest areas of complaint really arise around the issue of time.â I remind the House that since 1997 there have been over 40 amendments to migration legislation and not one prevented Naomi Leong from spending her entire life behind razor wire. This government has had ample opportunity to show compassion to asylum seekers and to make the changes it is now proposing, but it has consistently chosen not to.</para>
<para>Of course, these changes are not genuinely driven by compassion on the part of the Prime Minister but by political expediency and a desperate bid for damage control. Four Liberal MPs finally spoke up after months of increasingly shameful stories had pricked their consciences. Condemned by one of their own as political terrorists, they nevertheless stuck to their guns, only to be bullied into accepting a massively watered down version of what they had really wanted. And now the government is preening in the press, patting itself on the back and claiming some moral high ground when it has presided over one of the most shameful periods in our history.</para>
<para>Well, Prime Minister I am not fooled. Compassion is not a convenient cloak that you wrap yourself in, only to discard when the weather turns fair. It is something you either have in your heart or not, and frankly I can only see the image of the Prime Minister puffing out his chest, trying to build himself in stature, roaring out to his adoring audience, âWe will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come.â</para>
<para>The government has had ample opportunity to put balance back into the immigration system. In 2002 Labor presented a policy of a more humane, open and accountable mandatory detention system. In 2003 the then shadow minister for immigration introduced a private memberâs bill which would have seen children removed from detention. That was in 2003. Here we are in 2005 finally trying to do something about it. Members of the House would know that every single attempt by Labor to have children removed from detention was defeated by this government. The amendments to this bill moved by the Leader of the Opposition are sensible and reflect a more balanced and accountable approach than the watered-down compromise that is being offered by this Prime Minister. They are not amendments that we have just dreamed up overnight, which is what the government has done in cobbling together this bill. They came out of an extensive period of policy development. It is a policy based on hours of consultation with asylum seekers and refugee advocates, and extensive consultation and work within the party itself. I myself deliberately visited a detainee in Maribyrnong detention centre prior to our national conference so that I would be informed about the decisions that I was making and that would affect him. Unfortunately, two years later that man is still behind bars in Maribyrnong detention centre.</para>
<para>First and foremost, Labor wants to make the process transparent and independent. Under this bill it is an assumption that the best way to protect those in the departmentâs care is to give the minister more discretion to make decisions on detention. Frankly, it is a bit like giving the school bully the right to decide who gets the cane. The recent track record speaks for itself. Since Minister Vanstone effectively handed over the power of ministerial discretion to Minister McGauran, he has exercised his ministerial discretion in only four per cent of cases. Certainly the former minister, who many considered to be quite a harsh minister, had a better strike rate than the current minister, Mr McGauran, has in relation to ministerial discretion. Ministerial discretion puts the power of decision making into the hands of a single individual, and this bill means that decisions cannot be reviewed or challenged. This reads like a recipe for, at best, mistakes and, at worst, absolute abuse.</para>
<para>It has become clear recently that the department is in crisis, with even the secretary of the department admitting it needs a massive cultural change. When we have seen 200 cases of wrongful detention being referred to the Palmer inquiry, and accusations of brutality and assault on a regular basis, you would be naive and disingenuous to pretend that these problems have nothing to do with the minister and nothing to do with DIMIA. Nobody could feel totally confident that a system giving complete power to one person provides a fair and transparent process for every individual seeking refuge in Australia. The culture operating in DIMIA gives me absolutely no confidence that we have not sent genuine refugees back into areas where they will face persecution.</para>
<para>Labor wants to provide certainty about the removal of children and their families from detention. I support the proposal that was originally put by the member for Kooyong that children under 18, regardless of the detention period, should be released into the community with their parents and siblings once an independent assessment shows that they are not a security risk. The government, on the other hand, in this bill proposes that children be released if the minister says soâonly if the minister says so. To date we have seen clearly how ministerial discretion has been applied, in an ad hoc fashion, without transparency or any apparent system. This bill also retains the ability to detain children as a last resort. What does that mean? What does âa last resortâ mean? Under what circumstance does the detention of a five-year-old ever become justified? It simply does not.</para>
<para>The amendments moved by the Leader of the Opposition contain a better model for processing of visas for persons in detention. Our model removes the delays and potential unfairness involved in the use of a non-reviewable ministerial discretion by substituting an independent assessment of any compelling special humanitarian claim. The governmentâs proposed amendments simply provide non-compellable power to the minister to grant a visa to a person in detention. There is no proposal for independent or reviewable assessment, and there is no provision for dealing with exceptional circumstances. Further, the amendments provided by the Leader of the Opposition introduce other elements of Labor policy. Labor will create a new independent tribunal, called the refugee status determination tribunal, for managing processing. The government changes, on the other hand, keep the process in-house and continue to avoid transparency and accountability. Then there is the governmentâs proposed review process. The department is to report to the Ombudsman, who will then report to the minister, who can then choose to ignore the report anyway. It is difficult to see how this process will do more than provide bureaucrats with more paper to shuffle.</para>
<para>But of more concern than the deficiencies in the governmentâs bill is the significant number of issues that remain unresolved. There is no provision for handling stateless persons. Aside from catching the minister in a good mood, there is no solution for those detainees who have been rejected by their country of origin. This is the true test of compassion andâlet us face itâof commonsense. The case of Eidress Abdulrahman has provided us with a model example of how not to manage the plight of a stateless person. The government paid thousands of dollars to try and deport him, only to have him turned away because he had no country that would accept him as a citizen. He remains in detention today. There is no logic to keeping a person in detention until we effectively drive them madâand that is what we have been doing as a country. Stateless detainees whose identity and country of origin are clear should be granted permanent residency. To do anything less persecutes them for just the sake of it. It is inhumane and capricious.</para>
<para>The governmentâs bill says nothing about returning management of detention centres to the public sector. Despite the clampdown of information coming out of detention centres, it is becoming increasingly clear from recent comments by both detainees and former staff that all is not well behind the walls. In the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian</inline> on 18 June, Elisabeth Wynhausen reported on some serious problems with Global Solutions Ltdâs running of the detention centres. I was interested to read that GSL will be fined $5,000 if officials are found to have ignored the advice of a body referred to as the âhealth advisory panelâ. I was bewildered to further read that, although GSL has been running the detention centres since the beginning of last year, the panel is yet to even be set up. The contract to run our detention centres is one of the largest documents of its type in the world, but at the moment neither the House nor the taxpayers whose money pays for it can actually inspect it. This has always been, and will continue to be, a fundamental problem where soâcalled commercial-in-confidence secrecy creates doubt and undermines confidence. Labor will return the control of detention centres to the public sector and regain that confidence.</para>
<para>The governmentâs bill does not provide certainty for temporary protection visa holders. It proposes a time frame for primary assessment, but the reality is that TPV holders will still be in limboâunable to form long-term relationships or plan for their future or that of their children. The governmentâs bill does not make provision for health services in detention centres provided by independent medical professionals, nor does it provide the ability for those professionals to speak out on issues. We have seen the disastrous effects that the lack of access to proper health care has had on the mental health of many detainees. The family of Cornelia Rau have stated clearly that her custody in Baxter was punitive, prejudicial to her physical and mental health, and brutal. Let us not forget that the treatment meted out to Ms Rau may be a shared experience for other detainees. But without independent and reportable access to health professionals, how can we know for sure?</para>
<para>Labor would make provision for independent medical professionals in detention centres, and we would not gag them. The governmentâs bill does not provide media access to detention centres. Clearly the habit of secrecy is not in the interests of detainees. Labor would provide media access via agreed protocols to protect the interests of both detainees and national security.</para>
<para>In conclusion, we are not convinced. The introduction of this bill by the government sends a clear signal that they know they have got this policy wrong. But it does not go far enough, not by a long shot. Labor, on the other hand, have worked hard to create a humane, accountable, fair and balanced system for migration. If you want a serious change that introduces a balanced immigration system then you will not have that delivered by the Howard governmentâno matter what four Liberal MPs with some elements of compassion might be able to achieve on their side of the chamber. I commend to the House the amendments moved by the Leader of the Opposition.</para>

<para>âAustraliaâs immigration policy has a heavy responsibilityâit has to balance the need to secure our borders and ensure the protection of the integrity of our immigration policy with the need to deal with those seeking asylum in a compassionate and humane fashion. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs administers one of the largest immigration programs in the world relatively speakingâpart of which is the second-largest refugee intake program relative to population in the world. Most of the refugees Australia accepts have been chosen from amongst the poorest and most oppressed people on earth. More than 70 per cent of them come from African countries such as the Sudan and Ethiopia, where finding the funds to travel to Australia by any means is utterly inconceivable. Last year nearly 14,000 visas were granted under DIMIAâs humanitarian program. Of these nearly 12,000 were granted to people overseas, with the balance granted to persons applying within Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Our offshore refugee program therefore is one of great generosity and compassion, but it has been overshadowed in the public eye by the management of refugee cases within Australia. Hundreds of my constituents, since I announced my candidacy for parliament, have contacted me on the streets, by letter, by email and by telephone about this matter. Their overwhelming concerns have been focused on two issues. The first is the detention of families and children in detention centres. I have shared that concern and have expressed it to the minister and other members of the government. The second focus of their concerns has been the inordinate time it takes to process applications. That delay comes about through departmental reviews, reviews of the Refugee Review Tribunal and of course the extraordinarily tortuous process that these applications take through the courtsâwhich is being addressed, I should note, by the the <inline ref="R2294">Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005</inline> that was debated in this chamber only a little while ago. Those delays wreak great injustice and great hardship. The hardship they wreak is obvious for people who are in detention. Plainly, if someone is in detention pending the outcome of an application, the longer that application is pending the more hardship they suffer.</para>
<para>These long delaysâsome of them of almost Dickensian proportionsâalso wreak great injustice and hardship on people who are living in the community who are not under any form of detention, because the longer they live in Australia the more connections they make with the community. They have children and their children go to school. They make friends and connections. If, at the end of the process, it is concluded that their application should be rejected then the hardship of them being removed from Australia is even greater. So there is an enormous interest, both in terms of efficiency and humanity, to have applications dealt with expeditiously. That is why a feature of this packageâwhich is not actually part of the bill before the House todayâthat was announced by the Prime Minister last week is to have the first review, the consideration of the application by the department, concluded within 90 days and then the review by the tribunal, if a review is sought, completed within a further 90 days. Those timetables are important. It would be desirable if they could be even shorter. In an ideal worldâand I repeat what I said in this chamber on the Migration Litigation Reform Billâthere would be a departmental review followed by one hearing, or one review. The complexity of the process that we currently have is not required by any concept of natural justice. It is certainly not required under international obligations and, as I said, it wreaks great hardship.</para>
<para>I see that the honourable member for Kooyong is in the House. I compliment him and his colleagues on their efforts in advocating reform. We have had a very productive debate within our party, a very open debate. That was a debate to which many members of the coalition contributed and to which many thousands of Australians contributed. This has been a great exercise in democracy and a great refutation of the suggestion by the Clerk of the Senate that parliamentary democracy is dead in Australia. I think we have seen in the last few weeks that it is very much alive and productive.</para>
<para>The most important change for most Australians will be the statement that a minor shall only be detained as a measure of last resort and a provision that enables the minister to arrange for families to make a residence determination and so to arrange that families be allowedâor any person in fact but it is intended to be applied particularly to familiesâto reside in a place in the community which could be anywhere in the community as opposed to being in a detention centre or a residential housing project. This added flexibility is designed to enable families with children to live within the community with some reporting requirements and, as the explanatory memorandum says, with âminimal direct supervisionâ.</para>
<para>The legislation before the House grants the minister additional flexibility and discretion, and that has been criticised by the opposition. Flexibility and discretion are highly desirable. In fact one of the defects of the legislation to date has been a lack of flexibility for the minister to administer the department in a more responsive and humane fashion. Discretion can obviously create concerns if it is misused, but discretion which is accountable is a very valuable combination. There are provisions for reporting by the Ombudsman both to the minister and to parliament. The Ombudsman of course has considerable powers to investigate, to compel witnesses and to compel the production of documents, and his oversight of this program will ensure that the discretions are exercised in a way which is accountable and transparent. If honourable members consider that these discretions have been exercised in a way that is unsatisfactory they will have all of the information before them to challenge the minister and call for those discretions to be exercised in a different way. I am delighted that this legislation has been presented to the House. It is a great step forward, as is the rest of the package announced by the Prime Minister. It will make our immigration system more efficient, more compassionate and more accountable. I know that the overwhelming majority of my constituents in Wentworth are as delighted as I am by these reforms.</para>

<para>âI wish to speak briefly on the <inline ref="R2409">Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005</inline> today to associate myself with the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition and with the second reading amendment which he has moved and to concentrate in some respects on a brief history of how we have got to where we are today. I think it is true to say that the measures contained in this bill can only be described as incremental. They make incremental improvements to the system but they do not do the fundamental thing which is required: they do not set the system up for the future to ensure that the terrible things which have occurred in this area will not occur again in the future.</para>

<para>From March 1996, 221 boats carrying nearly 12,000 people, generally from Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan, arrived on our shores. From the end of 2001 only four boats arrived carrying less than a couple of hundred. The reason for the boats coming and the boats stopping were all to do with what we describe as âpushâ factors, not âpullâ factors. The fact that there were no longer great civil wars in Afghanistan and that the circumstances in Iraq had seen Saddam Hussein removed saw those push factors recede, if not eliminated. That saw the consequent ebbing of the flow of people coming to our shores. These factors are described correctly by the academics as push factors. It is not the pull factors which see people coming to a nation seeking asylum or refugee status; it is the push factors. In the coffee shops of Afghanistan and Iraq and Iran they did not stop coming because they were concerned about mandatory detention or the excision of islands or offshore processing in Australia; they stopped coming because of changes in circumstances in their own countries.</para>
<para>As a consequence of those arrivals from March 1996 to the end of 2001, in the last parliament, 2001-04, we had to focus very much on the circumstances of the detention of those people, the processing of those peopleâs claims for refugee status and how we treated and dealt with temporary protection visa holders in the community. Labor addressed our policy approach seriously in that parliament because it was clear that our previous approach had been deficient. Together with my predecessor, the shadow minister for immigration, the member for Lalor, I was heavily involved in the last parliament as shadow minister for immigration in Laborâs changed policy approach. At our January 2004 conference I gave an address that said in part:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Labor believes in an orderly immigration system, a system based on the rule of law, a system of integrity which the Australian people will have confidence and trust in.</para>
<para class="block">For the Australian people to have confidence in the administration of our immigration system, it must be built upon rigorous procedures and processes, which protect our national interest and our national borders.</para>
<para class="block">We must also treat individuals fairly and with dignity. To treat individuals fairly requires that they are dealt with in a speedy and efficient manner, where decisions are based on fair procedures and subject to appropriate review.</para>
</quote>
<para>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It is also in our national interest to conduct ourselves as a good international citizen, to do our fair share for those who are subject to persecution and who need protection.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">As a result of that general approach that conference adopted some detailed policy proposals which are relevant to the debate today.</para>
<para>As far as mandatory detention was concerned, we said that we believed mandatory detention should be maintained but that we wanted to remove children from detention centres. We said that we wanted to make sure that detention centres were managed by Commonwealth officers on Commonwealth territory as a strict line of accountability and that that would see the end of the so-called âPacific solutionâ. We wanted 90 per cent of claims to be determined within 90 days. We wanted to provide an independent review of the claims not determined in 90 days with the goal of processing all claims within 12 months and we wanted claims processed quickly through a new refugee determination tribunal, with appeals to federal magistrates. We wanted to make substantial changes to the temporary protection visa system to ensure that there was some certainty given to those people who had been placed on temporary protection visas. I will elaborate on that matter in the course of the committee stage debate.</para>
<para>All that saw a Labor policy which was aimed at doing two things. It was to deal with the backlog of people who had come during the period from March 1996 to the end of 2001, whether that backlog was in detention centres, whether that backlog was in the administrative or judicial processing of these people or whether that backlog was in respect of temporary protection visas in the community and future requirements as to temporary protection visa holders. It was a two-pronged approach to deal with the backlog and to then set the system up for the future so that the terribly adverse things which we have seen over this recent very regrettable period will not occur again in the future. Those aspects of the policy approach which are relevant today are reflected in the second reading amendment: Laborâs now long-standing policy approach of access to detention centres for independent medical personnel, an inspector-general of detention, processing of claims within 90 days and, where that is not met, monthly reports thereafter, and children out of detention.</para>
<para>In 2004, in debate on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, I caused amendments to be moved to that bill in the Senate. That amended bill was returned to the House on 1 April 2004. Those amendments contained provisions to remove children from detention and to change the processing of temporary protection visa holders. Regrettably, the House rejected the Senate message on division. Regrettably, on that occasion the member for Kooyong and the member for Pearce voted with the government. I make this point in passing, and it is just a gentle criticism because it is always hard for an individual to make a stand against a long-standing policy of their own party. The member for Kooyong, the member for Pearce and others in this place who now claim credit for these changes were given plenty of opportunities in the previous parliament to make the stand that they have now taken. On every occasion they declined to take those opportunities. So if you are seriously interested in setting the system up for the future, you need to note that members of this House have had more than one occasion since 2001 to make changes along the lines that are currently being referred to.</para>
<para>I also make this point in passing. It is a matter of historic record that the government won the 2001 election on a combination of border protection and national security. In the 2004 election this issue was not of quite the same order, but that did not stop the Howard government going to the electorate with its so-called stronger border protection and immigration policy, which was precisely the same policy approach that it took into the 2001 election. Interestingly, this border protection and immigration policy was not launched by the current Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; it was launched by the Attorney-General and the former minister for immigration, Mr Ruddock, who had made himself so infamous in the course of the 2001 election and thereafter. So those members opposite had plenty of opportunities between 2001 and 2004 to support the changes Labor outlined which would see two things occur: proper addressing of the backlog of people who had come to our shores seeking asylum and setting the system up for the future so that the terrible things which had occurred could not occur again. They declined every opportunity, and the formal policy approach which those opposite took to the last election was for no change in this area.</para>
<para>I welcome the fact that, as a result of finally and reluctantly responding to political pressure, the government are making some incremental changes in this area. But they should also stand back and make some fundamental changes which will set the system up so that, if there were ever to be an influx of asylum seekers to our shores in this way again, we would not make the same mistakes that were made on the governmentâs watch during this period of time. We would treat people fairly and with civility and we would process them efficiently and effectively. When you look at the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report which was delivered to this House in the last parliament, you see that all the ills that we find in this area come from one single factor, lengthy detention, so everything we do in a policy sense should be aimed at ensuring that people are not held in detention for unnecessarily lengthy periods. That is why if the government had adopted Laborâs policy approach of an independent inspector-general of detention, 90 per cent processing in 90 days with a monthly review thereafter and independent access to medical professionals, the Rau scandal that we see now would not have occurred. That is the truth of the matter. Over the previous parliament this government ignored the suggestions that we made to them, and all members opposite, on more than one occasion in the last parliament, voted against amendments moved by Labor to remove children from detention and to establish a TPV system which would have set the system up for the future in a much fairer way.</para>

<para>âI believe that the immigration policies of this country have been forced to follow the policies of the Australian Labor Party simply because of the dog in the manger attitude of the Australian Labor Party to consistently refer back to their old policies, thinking that they were the best since sliced bread was invented. Members opposite know that. The shadow minister, the member for Perth, has just admitted that ALP policies were deficient. It was not until six years after this government came to office that the Labor Party admitted that and went to the ALP National Conference to change them. The coalition won elections time after time, seeking to change the immigration program, to set up a program which is quick, efficient, fair and compassionate, but the Australian Labor Party insisted on living in the past, living with policies that proved to be a failure, and insisted that this country should keep outdated, worn-out, immigration policies. Through an obstructive Senate, they were seeking to impose on the nation irrelevant and out-of-date attitudes.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Time and again, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs at the time, Philip Ruddock, brought amendments to this House which were, in turn, rejected by the Senate. On 40 occasions, as far as I know, he attempted, in a patient way, to achieve changes that would result in quick processing of people who arrived as asylum seekers. Time and time again, those approaches were rejected by the Labor Party in the Senate, which was living in the past. That has led to lengthy detentions and to many of the problems we see today.</para>
<para>The <inline ref="R2409">Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005</inline> has come about because of Labor Party policies and the inability of the government to have its way in the Senate. Those things are changing and I believe that, despite the activity of four of my colleagues, many of these changes would have come about following 1 July when the processes of the parliament will be in balance and the governmentâs policies will be truly implemented. The most notable process, in my view, will be the additional non-compellable power of the minister, acting personally, âto specify alternative arrangements for a personâs detention and to impose conditions to apply to the detention of that personâ. If we look in the explanatory memorandum at the concept of non-compellable power to grant a detainee a visa, we see that the minister will be provided with:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... a non-compellable power to grant a visa to a person who is being held in immigration detention where the Minister is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so. In the exercise of this power the Minister will not be bound by the provisions of the Migration Act or regulations governing application and grant requirements. The Minister will have the flexibility to grant any visa that is appropriate to that individualâs circumstances, including a Removal Pending Bridging Visa where the detainee has no right to remain in Australia but removal is not practicable in the foreseeable future.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is a sensible provision. When the Australian Labor Party first came to change the Migration Act, it insisted on the codification of every aspect of that act. Under these provisions, the discretion of the minister is a justifiable discretion, where the minister has the right and is given the legal power to exercise judgment. I do not know why the Australian Labor Party feels that every aspect of the Migration Act needs to be codified. That is not the case. During the leadership of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating, ministers, for a good part, exercised judgment. They made decisions on individual cases based on information provided by their department and by other professionals. Ministers are appointed to make decisions. It was Senator Robert Ray who decided that this was all too hard and too much and refused to continue this process. It was he alone who said, âWe must codify the lot.â Look at the mess we have.</para>
<para>I will trust Labor ministers and Liberal ministers to make decisions to the best of their ability. If they fall down in making decisions, that is seen publicly. If they make a bad decision, that is seen publicly and they are criticised for it. If they make good decisions, there is no criticism. The exercise of discretion in difficult immigration cases is something which I believe ministers need to do. Ministers are appointed to do that. I am thankful that the capacity to make a discretionary judgment is now back in the legislation, albeit in a limited way. There are a number of reasons whereby and circumstances in which the minister can exercise this discretion, but they relate to whether or not there are children in a family. The one aspect of all this change which I think is regrettable is that it focuses on children as being the prime reason for a change in circumstance. Children are not the prime applicants for immigration to Australia; parents are. That is the problem.</para>
<para>With this legislation, we have shifted the real cause for immigration and for possible change in visas to the fact that there are children involved. I believe this process will encourage people, wherever possible, to have children, be they in detention or not. Children will become the focus for seeking a change of status. Smart lawyers will be encouraging people to have children in Australia and to be put into detention. That will be the way through in future. I do not think anybody has contemplated the way in which these factors will be abused by those seeking, for whatever reason, to gain permanent residency.</para>
<para>Australia is a most desirable country. If I were in poor circumstances and locked out of this nation, I would do everything possible to gain access to it and to gain permanent residency. If I had a family, why would I not do that? If we have a program which is responsible and economically based in part, which in part allows for reunion of immediate family, and which has a significant part for the special humanitarian and refugee element, then we need to be genuine in the way in which we approach that compassionate element. We need to be sure that those who have a claim to come here as refugees or under special humanitarian circumstances are genuine and that there is a proper process of assessment.</para>
<para>One only has to talk to the refugees from Sudan to understand that their circumstances are not quite like those of many from the Middle East who are seeking to get to Australia. One only has to look at the carnage and at the millions who have been slaughtered in Sudan and in nearby regions to understand that it is traumatic, life-changing and damaging. They are the people most in need on the face of the earth at the moment. I believe Australia will continue that policy, but we need to remain focused on giving aid and sustenance to those most in need, not to those who make the loudest claims.</para>

<para>âI rise to speak in this debate on the <inline ref="R2409">Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005</inline>. This bill contributes to fostering hopelessness in the law. As Sydney PEN says, âThe fostering of hopelessness is law.â That is the tragedy of the bill before the House. While I want to praise it and say good things about the courageous band on the other side who have led this debate, I feel a slight despair because it is all about maybes. It is not about sound legislation. It is not about enshrining in law how things will be dealt with. It gives greater discretion to a minister who has already failed to act and has led a department that has accorded terrible atrocities to these people.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>A collection of poems by asylum seekers was recently published by PEN. It gives an insight into another world, another countryâone of greater uncertainty, without hope, without dreams or trees and where children are placed behind barbed wire. I desperately want to praise the efforts of the rebel moderates on the government back bench, but I cannot fathom all the excitement about a bill which legislates uncertainty. I express my thanks to their ringleader, the member for Kooyong, for his persistent courage in trying to create a more humane world for those who come to our shores seeking asylum from terrible oppression and tyranny. But, tragically, what keeps ringing in my head is the Monty Python phrase, âHe is not the Messiah, just a very naughty boy.â And that has been exhibited by some of the outrageous comments from the Liberal members opposite.</para>
<para>At the beginning of the year I was on <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> with the member for Indi, Sophie Panopoulos. Prior to her outrageous comments, she referred to Petro as âthe one that all families have to haveâ. She said of his stance on this issue, âOne swallow does not a summer make.â I shudder in despair to think that, in the supposedly broad church of the Liberal Party, where all views are meant to be heard, the views of moderates are apparently condemned in this way.</para>
<para>Where were the member for Kooyong and his merry band of four when the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission handed down their report <inline font-style="italic">A last resort?</inline> in which they described the effects of detention on the physical and mental health of children. The Convention on the Rights of the Child states that all children living in Australia have a right to the âhighest attainable standard of healthâ and that children escaping conflict, torture or trauma have a right to special hope to recover âin an environment which fosters the health, self-respect and dignity of the childâ.</para>
<para>In its report <inline font-style="italic">A last resort? National inquiry on children in immigration detention</inline> the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission found that child detainees had experienced, among other things, clinical depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and various anxiety disorders. Children in detention exhibited symptoms including bedwetting, sleepwalking and night terrors. At the severe end of the spectrum, some children became mute, refused to eat and drink, made suicide attempts and began to self harm, such as by cutting themselves. Some children also were not meeting their developmental milestones. The report found that, although more than 92 per cent of child detainees were refugees, the trauma experienced in their countries of origin âdid not account for the extent of the mental health problems they demonstrated in detentionâ.</para>
<para>A study by mental health professionals, the 2003 Steel report, found that all but one of the 20 children who had been detained in a remote detention centre for an average of 28 months were diagnosed with a major depressive disorder and half were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. The symptoms of PTSD experienced by the children were almost exclusively related to experience of trauma in detention. The children described nightmares and many would scream in their sleep or wake up shouting.</para>
<para>In April 2002 the South Australian child welfare authority reported on the condition of a 13-year-old boy who had been detained for more than a year:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">[He] is very withdrawn and lethargic. Since entering Woomera he has been suicidal and very sad. He reports nightmares nightly, seeing himself dead, or unable to move with people carrying his body. He reports waking screaming and finds trouble falling to sleep. He reports a diminished appetite. He has little memory of past events and no hope for the future. He refuses to make new friends because he believes they will be released but not him. He engages in constructive day time activities but spends hours sitting staring vacantly.</para>
</quote>
<para>Despite all the effort that went into the report, which was released in May last year, the government did nothing. And it will do nothing now. This legislation states that the minister may grant a visa to a detainee to allow them to live in the community if the minister thinks it is in the public interest to do so. But the minister does not have a duty to consider whether to exercise the power and is to exercise power personally. It is up to the minister personally to decide whether or not these children are released. She has that power already and has failed to use it.</para>
<para>Many media reports have stated that all families with minor children will be released into the community. I would tell them not to count their chickens before they hatch out of Villawood, because the minister is under no obligation to do any such thing. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has remained silent on this legislationâno media release, no doorstop, no interview. The last we heard was that she thought making any concession would completely undermine Australiaâs immigration policy. If that is what she thinks, will she really exercise these new discretionary powers? Will the minister release the bar-code kids from detention centres around Australia? Will she release child VW4977? Will she release child VW8238? Will she release child VW8740? Will she release child VW8741? I could go on.</para>
<para>The Prime Minister has stated that children will now only be held in detention as a last resort. As Australia is a signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, this should always have been the case. The Prime Minister needs to clarify his definition of âlast resortâ. Labor believes that children should only be detained for health and security checks when they arrive in this country as asylum seekers, and even then it should be for only the shortest time.</para>
<para>So I ask: where were the courageous four when HREOC handed down its report asking for the immediate release of children a year ago? Where were these courageous Liberals when Labor moved an amendment in 2002 to the <inline ref="R1506">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline>, which sought to modify the legal power to detain asylum seekers so that children could not be held in high-security detention for long periods? This amendment was to compel the government to put unaccompanied children into foster or community care arrangements and to allow children to live in accommodation such as the Woomera alternate detention trial. Where were these members when the member for Gellibrand introduced a private memberâs bill to remove all children from detention in December 2002? They were voting with the government to oppose these measures.</para>
<para>This is institutionalised hopelessness and more discretion to an incompetent minister and her department. Hope is what these people are seeking. I want to commend the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, who is currently at the table, for giving hope to a Lebanese migrant in my electorate. He did come through at the end of the day, but it took weeks and weeks. I understand that these things are difficult but there was much uncertainty and trauma for that family, with my having to send this individual each week to get another bridging visa from the department and to go and purchase a ticket to go back to Lebanon just in case the intervention did not come through. Each week we were told that it would be all right, and it was. As I say, I want to thank the minister for his sound intervention in that matter. But there was hopelessness and trauma for this individual who had mistakenly taken wrong advice from a migration agent and put in an inappropriate claim. He should have applied for a spousal visa because he is here and married to a lovely 25-year-old and has two childrenâone is two years of age and has severe cerebral palsy and the other is 10 months old. Sending that father back to Lebanon would have seen that family collapse. Again, it is the hopelessness and the institutionalised uncertainty that is sending these people mad.</para>
<para>I was recently approached by a senior academic at one of the universities in my electorate. They are sponsoring a student on a TPV visa who was recently called into the immigration department for an interview. He was told that he cannot discuss with anybody what the interview was about, so he has not. But the trauma of that interview has sent him into absolute apoplexy. He is an individual who has already suffered persecution and torture in his own land, and his father was executed. Again, it is the uncertainty surrounding this. Why was he interviewed? What does it mean? What is going to happen to him? He cannot get on with his studies and he cannot get on with his life because he is living with a sense of uncertainty.</para>
<para>In my doom and gloom I want to add that this bill will improve the lot of those behind barbed wire, but only if the minister actsâI wait to see that. The bill is all about what the minister might or could do, and well she could have up until now but she has not. I want to commend all those involved in the various asylum seeker groups who have kept the faith and the pressure on us so that we saw a shift in public opinion. I want to thank those who have written, emailed and rung me to tell me to do more to see this debate through. We the legislators have followed public opinion in this debate and I want to commend those people to you. Legislation should be sound and need ministerial discretion only as a last resort. This bill enshrines the âmayâ of the minister.</para>

<para>âMost people will recall that I was born in Holland during the tail end of the war. I still have nightmares about the stories of horrific war crimes and the underground activities that took place. The vision of barbed wire detention centre fences appalls me still to this day. So anything that can change the culture, whilst still keeping our mandatory detention policy, has always been something to work for with likeminded colleagues.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In Australia there remains a vestige of an era when there was distrust of someone who appeared a little different. One thing that is different is that, as Australia prospers, it becomes more attractive to those who seek a new life but who must compete in a market where more people want to come than is possible to sustain. Little wonder that there has been a growth in illegal immigrants. Many want to jump the queue and are not prepared to follow the rules, hoping perhaps that the weight of public opinion will sway the lawmakers.</para>
<para>I am not certain whether there were too many boat people when the European migrants came over; I think we were first introduced to this phenomenon after the Vietnam War. I recall that, initially, we put our hand out because those people were seen as genuine refugees. After all, we shared a common enemy. After a time the flow became a flood and our attitudes hardened. Long after the Vietnam War finished, it was becoming apparent that these people were not refugees from oppression but were looking for economic opportunities. Nevertheless, with the passage of time, we became generally accepting of these ânewâ Australians. If nothing else, we Australians are a forgiving people, generally fairly tolerant of others, and we pride ourselves in a selfperception of equality. Perhaps in our laconic and tolerant way we allow others to take advantage of our good nature. If so, surely that is grist to the mill.</para>
<para>Looking at the problems that other countries are having with illegal immigrants, Holland being one such country, and seeing what we have achieved here, it is little wonder they are envious of our policies. However, that does not mean we cannot move forward and make changes as they become apparent. Thanks to the consistency of our approach, the flood has slowed to a trickle and it is time to make those changes for long-term detainees, and in particular for the women and children in detention.</para>
<para>I know it is probably politically incorrect to call people âillegal immigrantsâ, but we must remember that they did break the law in the way they chose to arrive. It strikes me as peculiar that many of these so-called refugees bypassed many safe havens and came on to Australia. I have no hesitation in saying that mandatory detention must remain as the cornerstone of our national policy. It is really the only effective deterrent that demonstrates to the world, and in particular to those who are making money from this illegal trade of human cargo, our resolve to choose who we let in, a policy widely supported in Gilmore.</para>
<para>However, the time is overdue to make substantial changes, and with the thread of this bill we can afford to be more humane. I also believe we need to streamline the law so that the legislative rights available to everyone under our system of justice and law are not used as leverage to squeeze public sympathy and guilt. The time has come also when the Migration Act 1958 can be further amended to reflect contemporary expectations. I applaud the fact that it is this government that has made these changes. Whilst we in the House may understand the processes that take place, some in our electorates do not.</para>
<para>Could I state up front that I have visited all the detention centres, except for Nauru, and am on the record as saying that detainees are often treated better than our own elderly citizens, which is not something I am proud of. They get access to timely medical and dental care, education, specialised meals, recreation and so forth. That is not to say that being a detainee is a bed of roses emotionally. It is not, but it has to be remembered that not all of these detainees are genuine refugeesâa fact that has been well illustrated. They have to be checked out and their claims validated. This takes time as each appeal further prolongs the process and, unfortunately, is in turn used as a basis to legitimise a future claim for permanent residency.</para>
<para>I am also very conscious about sending out the wrong message, particularly to those who profit from illegal activities. The concern I had was the issue of women and children in detention. The model that I saw being used at Woomera of the community living in group homes was a good example of how to do it better and more humanely. Detainees were able to shop locally, volunteer with community groups and go on outings, and children attended local schools. There are many in Gilmore who are very anxious about allowing these detainees into the community, with them taking jobs and welfare support ahead of others, before they have been declared genuine. This process has taken far too long and will certainly be changed by this bill.</para>
<para>Then there are those who are prepared to encourage resettlement, and this is where the rural Australian Refugee Association come in very handy. They are very active, especially in the Southern Highlands. I applaud their work and, as always, I will assist where I can. I know I have been criticised by some groups claiming that I should have revealed my voting intention earlier, but my response, both public and private, has always been that both sides of the debate need to be heard first. Those who know me and kept in contact will know I always said that changes were on the way, but, unfortunately, in being a politician people tend to regard you with suspicion.</para>
<para>To me, that is the most distressing downside of being in parliament, and we really have to lift our game to earn the respect of the people we represent. As guilty as we are sometimes made to feel about our attitude to illegal immigrants, I am proud that with these changes we have balanced the previous hard line to protect our borders with a more acceptable arrangement by reducing waiting times and time spent in detention, especially for women and children. Things do change, and in an increasingly volatile world I know there are many in Gilmore who supported our policies but now want to see a change in direction.</para>
<para>This bill is a compromise between the resolute defence of our interests, which has held us in good stead, and the national psyche of the Australian people, which says, âFair crack of the whip.â Yes, there will be criticism on both sides of the debate, but I wonder whether that criticism is driven by practical considerations or pure emotion. The fact is that we have demonstrated that we are prepared to bend and make changesâthat we are flexible but not a pushover. If results show that we have misjudged the situation, let us be prepared to be equally flexible in responding to that situation. This bill is evolutionary, not revolutionary. The amendments reflect the will of the Australian people, and that is that mandatory detention is an acceptable and successful deterrent and must stay in place. But we must temper this with compassion, and this bill contributes to that end.</para>
<para>I would like to acknowledge some people who have been of great support in this difficult time and have always maintained their determination to see changes made yet have done so with great dignity, extraordinary support and understanding. Those people are the members of Amnesty International, and the Kiama branch in particular, especially Brian and Gerda Keast, Libby Turnock of Kangaroo Valley, who has taught me so much about human nature, and Isabelle McCallum, as well as the many in our community who were open to a balanced view of the debate. But I give a special thankyou to the students of Ulladulla High School, who allowed me to visit them a few Fridays ago as they staged a detention âsit-inâ. I found them to be well informed and they asked some excellent questions.</para>
<para>No doubt there will still be many questions to answer and, as always, I will be happy to address these either individually or in a forum, as I have done many times. To the Prime Minister and all of my colleagues, the debate we had was conducted with dignity and respect for other points of view. It makes me feel proud to belong to a party that not only allows such a debate but also listens and has the guts to make changes when they are needed.</para>

<para>âThe <inline ref="R2409">Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005</inline> provides a number of small but significant changes to the Howard governmentâs harsh and inhumane mandatory detention system. The changes are a long way short of the proposals in the original bills put forward by the member for Kooyong and, indeed, a long way short of Laborâs policy on these matters. Nonetheless, these changes are welcome. They signal a turning of the tide on an extremely important issueâsomething that is of great concern to many Australians.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The bill empowers the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to order the release of children and their families and, in some cases, long-term detainees from detention. It provides for three-month deadlines for DIMIA decisions with respect to asylum applications, for the Refugee Review Tribunal to review some of those original decisions and for the Ombudsman to inquire into the detention of people who have been in detention for longer than two years. It also contains some other provisions regarding the processing of TPVs.</para>
<para>These changes are relatively modest, but they are significant. It is a good sign for this country that we are finally starting to soften this harsh, inhumane system. I remind the House of Laborâs policy in these areas. Labor want to see people out of detention after 90 days. For those for whom security, health and identity checks are continuing beyond that time, Labor propose an independent monthly review by an expert committee around whether or not they should remain in detention. Labor want all children out of detention, not on the basis of ministerial whim but on the basis of right. We want to end the outrageous Pacific solution and ensure that temporary protection visas operate for two years only and are one-off and that, beyond that time, the individual concerned will have their case for permanent protection assessedâwith the assumption being that, unless it is demonstrated otherwise, they have a legitimate claim.</para>
<para>I look forward to the time when Labor policy will be in advance of this and when Labor will commit itself, as the bills originally put forward by the honourable member for Kooyong did, to abolish temporary protection visas altogether, because the ultimate rationale behind temporary protection visas is that people are discriminated against on the basis of the mode of transport that they use to get to Australiaâhardly an intelligent basis for determining the right to asylum.</para>
<para>The real significance of this bill is that it reflects a major change in community opinion in Australia. Finally, we are seeing the middle ground of genuine, caring, decent, honest Australia starting to assert itself. After years of appalling group vilification of asylum seekers by the government with thinly veiled appeals to racial prejudice, after years of hearing sick and deranged people ringing talkback radio programs saying things like, âSink the boats,â and, âJust shoot them,â and after years of abuse, denigration and name-calling of people who have taken up the cause of asylum seekersâbeing called âbleeding heartsâ, âthe caffelatte setâ and the like by people in and associated with the Howard governmentâfinally good, ordinary, decent middle Australia is stirring. This major revolt that we have seen in the parliamentary Liberal Party is an illustration of how strong that sentiment is becoming and how much the attitudes in our community are changing.</para>
<para>The cynically manufactured hysteria of 2001 has receded, thankfully. The boats have largely stopped coming because of the fall of the Taliban, the fall of Saddam Hussein and the much stronger cooperation on the part of the Indonesian government, not because of the fabled deterrent effect of the harsh detention system. People have begun to realise that having children born and raised in prison is simply grotesque inhumanity, that indefinite detention for years for people who have committed no crime is simply tortureâit cannot be described in any other termsâand that asylum seekers, however weak or strong their individual cases, are almost invariably fleeing a dangerous, deprived and miserable existence and are aspiring to only one thingâto become an Australian, like millions of other migrants and refugees have done before them.</para>
<para>It is time we stopped imprisoning people for the crime of wanting to be Australian. It is time we stopped jailing small children. It is time we rebuilt Australiaâs claim to be the land of the fair go. We are seeing a significant shift in community opinion on these issues, and I congratulate the member for Kooyong and those who have supported him on playing a role in this. They could have perhaps done it earlier; they could have perhaps done it stronger; they should have stuck out for more; but ultimately they are reflecting a major change in community opinionâsomething that is long overdue but most welcome.</para>
<para>Decent caring Australia is finally awakening, finally asserting itself and finally saying that this inhumane, harsh system of detention goes way too far and that, although we all accept that we have a need to manage our immigration system, we accept that not all people claiming asylum have genuine cases. We all accept that any nation must and will control and regulate its borders and must and will determine who is to live within those borders. The way that this has been done in Australia in recent years is simply outrageous. It is simply inhumane and no policy justification or policy objective of any government justifies imprisoning small children. No objective can justify that. No objective can justify having people such as Peter Qasim in indefinite detention for years when they have committed no crime. These issues are finally awakening community sentiment in this country. It is pleasing to see that, in spite of John Howardâs rhetoric and in spite of the governmentâs formal position, they are starting to soften their approach.</para>
<para>The Right is clearly in the ascendant in Australian politics, as it was in the mid-1960s. It was subsequently crippled for a generation by the Vietnam War. For all the vile, arrogant, nasty, rabid ranters of the Right that we have to tolerate, such as the member for Indi, I offer this warning: your appalling treatment of asylum seekers, your cynical manipulation of racism and your deliberate fostering of division within the Australian community will hang around your necks in Australian politics long after John Howard has exited the stage.</para>

<para>âIn the very short timeâfive minutesâthat I have to speak on the <inline ref="R2409">Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005,</inline> it is very difficult to make a meaningful contribution to the debate. So I would like to put on record today my thoughts on one area that needs to be covered and that has been covered by many in this debateâthat is, the courage and conviction of the members of parliament who have remained committed to the cause.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Whether you agree or do not agree with this amendment bill or its intentions, you must admire the courage of these parliamentarians under fire. You must also admire their ability for conciliation, discussion and their meaningful and purposeful intent to be able to resolve a very difficult issue. You must admire the thought and ability of the Prime Minister and these members of parliament to be able to sit down and rationally discuss this issue and to come to a very sensible resolutionâsensible not only for future policy making decisions but also for those people who have unfortunately been in this position for far too long.</para>
<para>When you come into the House to speak on an issue, you always try to introduce something new into the debate, but it is very difficult with this issue because it involves particularly personal and emotional points of view. But one thing that this kind of demonstrated democracy has done is reinforce the commitment of members like me and other members in the House to acknowledge what is just and what is unjust. The people who will benefit from the very brave and courageous amendments that the government have put forward in the bill will see this for the rest of their lives as the beginning of their lives. The day that they can get the benefit of the amendments that these members of parliament have negotiated will be the day that they can begin their lives. Wherever they begin their lives, it will be a meaningful day for them.</para>
<para>One can only imagine what it must feel like to be a victim of people traffickers. Make no mistake, the people who have come here are mostly genuine refugeesâand have been recognised as such. They have been victims time and time again. They were victims in their own countries. They were victims of abuse and violence and death threats to their families. They became victims of people traffickers and people smugglers and then they became victims of a set of rules that treated them as though they had committed significant or horrendous crimes when in fact the only crime that they had committed was to try to remove their family from these circumstances. I would believe that, given the same conditions, I would make the decisions that many of these people have made. There is no doubt that if somebody threatened the life of my familyâmy sons, my grandchildrenâI would be willing to make any sacrifice or take any risk to ensure their safety and their wellbeing.</para>
<para>I kept coming back to this issue when this was being discussed. I have a very dear Ethiopian family in my life. I fought for five years to reunite in Australia a genuine refugee with his children. He came into Australia in 1991 and had the most horrific story to tell. It would reduce the hardest of people to absolute tears. When he was fleeing his village and trying to get to a safer place to which he could then bring his family, what he experienced was just grotesque. Yet he survived, went to Egypt and finally made it into Australia as a genuine refugee. To then try and get him reunited with his family was the most difficult task I have ever undertaken. But after five years of hard work he was reunited with his family, and they are a very important part of my family now.</para>
<para>If people had not believed him in his plight along the way in his country, if people had not provided him at times with shelter from those that were pursuing him and if it had not been for the person who picked it up at the end and decided that he was well worth saving, then I know that this wonderful family would never have had an opportunity. So it is with these people, this family that is so close to me, in mind that this bill is very close to my heart. I commend the <inline ref="R2409">Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005</inline> to the House. I think it is the beginning of life for many people and I again congratulate those members who have had the courage of their convictions to lead us, show us the way and show us what it is like to be a true and committed member of the House of the Parliament of Australia.</para>

</talker>
<para>âI will speak briefly to the <inline ref="R2409">Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005</inline>. I am aware of some of the arrangements that the House has made to expedite the passage of this bill. I would like to congratulate the member for Kooyong, in particular, and his three comrades on the stance that they have taken. It has received a lot of support from people within the electorate of New England. It is one of those issues that have touched the hearts of many, and many people have wrestled with the broader problems in trying to come to grips with solutions and in taking a more compassionate approach.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Success has many fathers. A lot of people are trying to grab hold of the coat-tails of this change in policy, but I have absolutely no doubt that the four people who led the charge in the Liberal Party are the ones who need the acclamation of all of us because they have been prepared to stand up for this under what have been, at times, fairly strenuous circumstances. I have no doubt that some of the private meetings that took place and some of the comments that were made, privately and publicly, would have subjected those individuals to quite a lot of pressure. So I have great admiration for those people who have been prepared to stand up for something that they believe in. I would encourage others in this parliament, if they believe in something quite strongly, to stand up and say so. I think it is a good thing for democracy when the broader community can see people standing up on matters of principle, irrespective of whether it causes some damage to their personal political careers.</para>
<para>I think many of us were offendedâas I am sure the member for Kooyong and his colleagues were offendedâby the terms that were used by another member of parliament, who referred to them as political terrorists. That is an abuse of the language and an abuse of the principles and the particular view that those four hold on this matter, and I believe it is to the detriment of the individual who made those comments. They were comments that were very good to be in the paper for a day or two, but I think it is regrettable that they were made.</para>
<para>I would be the last to say that I have led this debate, because, like many Australians, I recognised that there was a problem but, like many of us, I really did not know what the solution was. I am pleased to see that some people within the government while possibly not curing all of the problems, have made the system much more compassionate. I refer to my maiden speech on 14 February 2002 when I entered this place. It was after the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> incident. I made this commentâand it was an unwritten speech, so it was a bit all over the place:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The process that we are going through at the moment with the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> is a disgrace. Locking people up for two or three years indicates to me that the process is not working. That does not mean we open the borders up to everybody but we have to develop a different process that does have a more compassionate approach to it.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">What we are seeing today, under the leadership of the member for Kooyong and the three others, is a move towards a more compassionate approach to an issue that I think has touched the hearts of many, and I congratulate the government and the House on accepting the very well-meaning thoughts of the member for Kooyong and the others.</para>

</talker>
<para>âI wish to thank all members who have contributed to this debate on the <inline ref="R2409">Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005</inline>, although I would score their contributions quite differently. Some members of the opposition have used the opportunity to again run tired, old and even discredited criticisms of the government and its immigration policy, but I am not going to get bogged down in what is old news and political opportunism of the worst kind. Instead, I want to address the substantive issues, because this is, at the risk of stating the obvious, enormously important legislation before the House of Representatives. In doing so, I am going to commence with a brief summation of Australiaâs refugee and humanitarian program. I am the minister responsible, together with Senator Vanstone, for the settlement of our refugees and I am therefore extremely familiar with the program.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Sadly, very few members of even this House, let alone the general public, are aware of what Australia does for the most deprived and vulnerable refugees in the world. We have a program of taking each year 13,000 refugees and humanitarian arrivals, mostly from the Horn of Africa countries: Eritrea, Ethiopia, the Congo, Sudan, Burundi, Liberia and Rwandaâthe most war-torn and impoverished countries in the world. We take refugees from the camps in Tanzania, Kenya and Egypt, and they have often been in those camps for several years. We are one of only three countries in the world who do it. There are but three countries in the world with an organised refugee and humanitarian programâthe United States, Canada and Australia. So do not give me this âI am ashamed to be Australianâ stuff that you here repeated every now and then. As soon as someone says that, forget it. That is just moral proselytising; that is just self-righteous reinforcement. Australia has one of the proudest records with regard to refugees anywhere in the world bar none. Actually, after the United States, we take the most numberânot per capita but in actual terms. The United States has a program for about 28,000 refugees, ours is 13,000 and Canadaâs is slightly lower than ours. And we increased it. It was 12,000 a year ago; it is now 13,000.</para>
<para>Our settlement programs, where we meet migrants at the airport and give them intensive assistance with accommodation, employment, education and integration in the community, are studied throughout the world. People come here and look at how we do it. Canada and the United States will, in all humility, study our programs to see how to do their settlement better. So the Howard governmentâs refugee humanitarian policy is amongst the best in the world. We rely on the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to nominate those refugees. As I say, it is dominated by Horn of Africa countriesâpeople escaping the worst imaginable human circumstances. If they have not themselves suffered physical abuse, then they have certainly witnessed it. So there is a lot of trauma- and torture-counselling issues in the settlement also needed for them. We should be proud of that. We should be talking about it. Instead it gets swamped by media reports about unlawful arrivalsâthe asylum seekers of the past few years.</para>
<para>Let us understand this: our international responsibilities are to political refugees, not economic refugees. The United Nations tells us that there are 17 million refugees identifiable throughout the world. Eight and a half million are the most vulnerable and the most depressed. Australia does not accept economic refugees. We have an orderly program. By the way, can you believe that only five countries in the world have an immigration program: the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Israel and Australia. Australiaâs program is in the national interest. It is a program of 140,000 people, 95,000 of whom are business or skilled migrants. On top of that we take 13,000 refugees. We do not take economic refugees. To the best of my knowledge, no country in the world does. We take political refugees. When people arrive here unlawfully by boat then of course we have to assess their claims. And that is why you have mandatory detentionâa Labor Party policy that we have continued in government. There is nothing unreasonable or wrong about the policy at that point, at the starting point, where we determine their identities and examine their claims for political asylum. The simple fact is that a lot of unlawful arrivals are not going to assist in the establishment of their identity because that might place them as economic refugees rather than as political refugees. It takes time to work through the absence of material or the misleading material available to us.</para>
<para>Let us put this in context. Australia has every right, as the general public well know and understand, to determine the identity of people who arrive here unannounced and unlawfully, particularly when we are bringing in so many refugees and are so dedicated to assisting themâwith their most troubled of experiences, background and pastâto settle in Australia as quickly as possible. We want these people to realise their ambitions and their hopes for themselves and their families as quickly as humanly possible.</para>
<para>That is the starting point. We have to compassionately, sympathetically and speedily process people who are in detention. We agree with that and we have endeavoured to do that at all times. Now we have legislation before the House that softens some aspects of mandatory detention. I do not want the House or the public believing that this is an overnight revelation. For some time now, the government has been softening its detention policy. We have established alternative accommodation for families, for children especially, outside of detention centres.</para>

<para>âOver a period of time, as numbers have decreased, we have been able to soften it. There are interjections from the opposition. Let us turn to the opposition because I want to place on the record the framework within which the government operates and the very compassionate, humanitarian and generous program we have for refugees. Did you know that in 1994 the Labor Party had 342 children in detention? Did you know that the year we came to government, 1996, they had 191 children in detention? There was no residential project then. There was no community housing for them. The Labor Party, in the six years since they introduced mandatory detention, never softened it and never provided choice to apply for alternative arrangements for families and the like.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The Labor Party have this chant and the Leader of the Opposition led it: children behind razor wires. They have practised it, they have worked it, maybe they have even focus-group tested itâchildren behind razor wires. If you read the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> from yesterday, you will see the Labor members have all been told to get that up to morally blackmail the government. There are 53 children in detention as of today compared to the Labor Partyâs hundreds of children in detention. It is remarkable, isnât it? The Labor Party have no credibility on this issue.</para>
<para>I will not go through each memberâs contribution; time will not allow it. The contribution I will concentrate on was that given by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday. This is the man who holds himself out to be the alternative prime minister. A more superficial and contrived presentation you would never find. Leaving aside the deficiencies of the Leader of the Oppositionâs presentation, the aspect I would like to concentrate on is his slanderous and totally unfair attack on the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. A basic rule in politics is that you never repeat a negative because that is just kicking an own goal, but I am actually going to quote the Leader of the Opposition, even though it is an attack on the department because the air needs to be cleared in regard to his allegations. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... the bungling, disaster prone Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs presumably continues on its merry way, detaining Australian residents, deporting Australian citizens and keeping women and children behind razor wire ... A department out of control, rocked by scandal after scandal, without any scrutiny or check from a judicial review process, emerges unscathed.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is a cowardly attack on overwhelmingly dedicated officials of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. Firstly, there are eight million transactions or contacts by the department over the course of a year. Almost all of them are done professionally with care and attention and as quickly as circumstances will allow. Given eight million dealings with the public, you would think there would be tens of thousands of complaints. But, in actual fact, there are very few, particularly as they relate to detention. There were 88,000 persons detained last year for overstaying or for working without the correct visa or the like. Some of those detentions might have been for a few minutes; some of them might have been in the foyer of the office of the departmentâit is not that they went into detention centres. Of those, we have referred 201 cases to the Palmer inquiry for consideration. I actually believe a number of those 201 will show that the department acted reasonably. If you raid a brothel or an orchard, which is the standard practice of compliance, people for good reasons are not going to immediately offer their identity or do not have the papers with them. They do not carry their passports or their visas with them. Of the 201, I believe in a number of them it will be found that the department acted reasonably. But that represents 0.2 per cent of detentions. Forget your eight millionâlet us just look at the 88,000 detentions each year. We have raised a query about 0.2 per cent of detentions and we want the Palmer inquiry to advise on them. That is a remarkably small number.</para>
<para>Instead the Leader of the Opposition is using hyperbole, exaggerating and misrepresenting, because he talked in the pluralââdetaining Australian residents, deporting Australian citizensâ. We have the Rau and Alvarez cases. They are singular; they are not in the plural. The Rau and Alvarez cases are a tragedy without doubt, and reform has already taken place in identity processes, but the issue also involves a number of state government agencies and also the difficult and complex issue of mental health. I believe the Alvarez and Rau cases are more revealing about mental health treatment and identification than they are about detention. But I will wait for the Palmer inquiry.</para>
<para>The Leader of the Opposition then talked about the department being without any scrutiny or check from a judicial review process. My heavens! Without check or judicial review! DIMIA is the most scrutinised, accountable department in the entire Commonwealth Public Service, I would think. There is the Ombudsman and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner, all of the courts and parliamentary oversight committees. There is a steady stream of people going through detention centres, and always has been, checking the levels of service, accommodation and the like. But the point is: this is a difficult, challenging area for any government. When I talk about 0.2 per cent of detentions being referred to Palmer for consideration, as I stress, I believe that not all or even a majorityâI do not know; I am speculatingâwill be found to be of concern. I am told that was the same as when Labor was in power. This is a difficult area.</para>
<para>As Mr Cadman, the member for Mitchell, said earlier on, Australian citizenship is the most prized in the world. Of course people are going to come here and do their level best. The member for Mitchell said that he has no hostility towards somebody trying to use the system or whatever legal rights or avenues are available to acquire Australian residency. Why wouldnât people do that if it is the best social security, education and health system in the worldâeven as we strive to improve them? There is no inbuilt hostility towards people seeking to become an Australian citizen.</para>
<para>On the other hand, we are trying to run an immigration policy, and rules are rules. Listening to some members of the opposition, you would think they are saying, âLetâs tear up the rule book.â For instance, the member for Chisholm, talking about a case I am very familiar with, complained about a Lebanese man who applied for a spouse visa because he is married to an Australian citizen. Fair enough, but the rules are that you have to apply offshore unless there are special circumstances. In this case, because the child was seriously ill, I intervened using my powers under the act. I am very familiar with this case. That man deliberately and knowingly avoided the rules. The member for Chisholm complained that it took time to decide this issue. You bet it takes time. He knowingly avoided the rules. If you look at his immigration history, it will verify this.</para>
<para>Do we have a rule book or not? Do not confuse the visa overstayers with the unlawful arrivals or the asylum seekers. That is part of the ignorance of members of the opposition. Many of their contributions are riddled with it. There is a big difference between visa overstayers seeking a migration outcome via political asylum and people who are genuine political refugees from Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran and the like.</para>
<para>The member for Reid knows this. I see that the shadow minister for immigration is subject to some criticism. I have a lot of sympathy for him. All he has tried to do recently is discuss some of the realities of immigration policy. When you have millions of inquiries from people wanting to come to Australia and hundreds of thousandsâapproximately 450,000âapplications a year, you have to have some rules. You have to have some criteria and you have to do the right thing. That means applying offshore. We do have unlawful arrivals and we must deal with them. We do so as compassionately as possible, as does DIMIA.</para>
<para>The contribution of the Leader of the Opposition was not a contribution by an alternative Prime Minister. This was a contribution by somebody who was seizing the political moment. The Leader of the Opposition does himself no credit. His generalised slurs and slander against DIMIA are most unfair. Above all else, they are utterly incorrect. What we need from people of seniority like the Leader of the Opposition is thoughtful contributions. He will set the tone for his backbenchers and his shadow ministers. A person as politically beleaguered as he is will seize on any opportunity to turn it to his political advantage.</para>
<para>In regard to the Leader of the Oppositionâs second reading amendment, the first paragraph of significance is:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... an Inspector-General of Detention should be appointed ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is just a duplication of the role of the Ombudsman. It is another bureaucracy. The Labor Party will always revert to bureaucracy and complicated internal processes when devoid of real, meaningful ideas. It is an absurd suggestion when you have the Ombudsman already in this field. The second aspect of major interest is:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... the Ombudsman should report monthly on the continued detention of all detainees held for 90 days.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Ninety days! That is an administrative nightmare, as the member for Reid, with a good understanding of immigration operations, will tell you in a moment of honestyâin private. He will not say it publicly. You cannot have the Ombudsman reporting on detention after 90 days. It would be an administrative nightmare that would be utterly unworkable.</para>
<para>All in all, I have to say that I am disappointed in most of the contributions by members opposite, particularly in the contribution by Mr Beazley, who in his attempt to discredit DIMIA only discredits himself. Like my colleagues, I am proud of the legislation we bring to the House. We believe it is line with public expectations. It will win wide public support. It is the result of considered and, for the most part, harmonious party room deliberations. I thank all members of the government for their constructive contributions that have allowed us to reach this point, which is to soften and introduce a more flexible and orderly detention policy. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para class="block">In what was unfortunately a singularly ill-informed contribution, the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs denigrated this amendment by saying that it was just a matter of creating another bureaucracy. He tried to minimise the crisis affecting this department by saying repeatedly that there had been a single case of illegal detention of Australians. Once again I say it is singularly ill-informed. He seems to think that the Iranian man detained for two weeks in WA who had obvious psychiatric problems and was not an Australian should not be counted. He said that there were only 200 cases referred to the Palmer inquiry. I hope he understandsâI hope he was not trying to misleadâthat there are another 928 cases being looked at by the department to see whether they should be referred.</para>
<para>We have here a singular need for oversight and for transparency in this area. We are a long way from the comments of the Prime Minister in 2002 when he could credibly say in his mind that until he had evidence of bad administration or systemic failure he was not going to do anything other than support the department. That comment, of course, is very much under the hammer at the moment. We have seen over many months of exposes the urgent need for oversight. We have a situation where male guards are observing women in Baxter and the contractor can give no assurance that that will be avoided. We have a situation where the nature of Red 1, the specific detention monitoring system inside, has had to be taken out of operation because of public criticism. We have the reality that, many months before it became a national issue, people at Baxter gained the impression that Cornelia Rau might be an Australian. It did not go up the food chain. No-one was advised. She languished there.</para>
<para>Justice Finn has commented that âit is imperative that the Commonwealth conduct regular and systematic performance auditsâ of the contractors. That has not been the case. There is no effective review of these operations. The government has been dragged to provide better psychiatric assistance, conceding that it has been inadequate. We have the reality that Cornelia Rauâs condition was essentially only driven forward by the pleas of the detainees in the centre. They could see a psychiatric state; they could see the need for assistance. To say that all is well, that we do not need any oversight and that it is bureaucracy is an insult to that which has been exposed over recent months. It is neglect of the interests of the people in detention. We know that Justice Finn in that very important decision of the two Iranian detainees who had not been given psychiatric assistance for 12 and 17 months respectively said that there had been culpable neglect by the government, the department and the contractors.</para>
<para>To say that we do not need any oversight, that we do not need any transparency, that we do not need more accountability and that we do not need the reduced possibility of wrongful detention is preposterous. But that is the kind of argument that was put forward by the minister for multicultural affairsâthat all is well, that we do not need any oversight, that these things will sort themselves out, that there are no problems. Quite clearly there are. Kjell Liljegren, a former detention guard who had been there for seven years, commented:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It was more obvious that they wanted to run the centres more like prisons than actual detention centres which are meant for administrative purposes only. Most of the time it was based on control and restraint.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">We have a federal immigration officer commenting in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of 13 March 2002:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The detention centres are now a cross between a jail and a lunatic asylum.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So to say that there is no need for oversight is spurious. Over many months inadequacies have been found. The less the service and the cheaper you can provide it determines how it operates. There is obviously great criticism of the subcontractors in the medical and psychiatric areas. People, it seems, who do not have proper professional credentials have been working there. The actual service up until very recentlyâlong after the Prime Minister made these comments about how great the system wasâtook six to eight to nine weeks. The government has relented. It has surrendered because of public criticism by the opposition to provide a more adequate, swifter and more available service. We have a contractor, GSL, that seemingly has a culture of prison. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThis is the opposition that boasted yesterday, in the course of the second reading debate, that they had actually been the forerunners on a number of the reforms, at least in general terms, which the government introduced yesterday. They are so prepared and they have got so many ideas and so much legislation in the top drawer that they just have to open it up and present themâso why do I get the amendments four minutes before I am to rise to my feet to make as sensible a response to the oppositionâs amendments as is possible? Maybe the opposition are paying me a compliment I do not deserve but I cannot absorb them so quickly in such a short time frame as the opposition have given us, so that is disappointing.</para>

<para>âAt four oâclock yesterday afternoon the opposition was provided with a briefing on the governmentâs migration amendment legislation, so the Labor Party members who are sitting here have had to formulate our amendments based on that briefing yesterday at a very late period of time in the day.</para>

<para>In speaking to our amendment proposing an inspector-general of immigration detention centres, I want to make a number of comments on the negotiated settlement between the Prime Minister and the member for Kooyong in relation to mandatory detention. Whilst the compromise is welcome and certainly an improvement on the inhumane conditions so many refugees have been subjected to, we on this side of the House do not believe that the changes go far enough to address the fundamental wrong of incarcerating people in the desert without charge. Laborâs position goes so much further than what the Prime Minister was prepared to give in to. I have been promoting Laborâs policy on asylum seekers since its endorsement at the 2003 ALP National Conference in Sydney. It has an appropriate system that still retains administrative detention but removes its punitive nature.</para>
<para>Under the Prime Ministerâs amendments to the act, the minister will be able to specify alternative detention arrangements but will not be compelled to do so. Hopefully, the inspector-general amendment will be accepted to ensure that, in all cases where there is a threat to a detaineeâs mental or physical wellbeing, the detainee will be released into appropriate alternative accommodation. The inspector-general will ensure that 90 per cent of all claims for asylum will be processed within 90 days. The governmentâs amendments are intended to have all primary visa decisions made by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs within three months and the reviews made by the Refugee Review Tribunal in a further three months. The Howard plan does not take into account many crucial measures which have been addressed by Laborâs position. They have been out there, Minister, for the past two years. The inspector-general would allow health services in detention centres to be provided by independent medical professionals and would ensure that these aspects would be carried out. These professionals would be free to speak out on issues, the need for which has been emphasised by the recent tragic cases of Cornelia Rau and Vivian Solon.</para>
<para>The Prime Ministerâs measures do not create an independent inspector-general of detention centres nor, as we will hear, do they allow media access to detention centres or resolve the problems associated with lengthy waiting times for court appeals. The inspector-general would oversee the availability of appropriate community housing facilities onshore and offshore. The government proposals do not indicate where community housing will be coming from. Crucially, the Prime Ministerâs compromise position on immigration detention does not resolve flaws which lead to people remaining in the system for unacceptable periods.</para>
<para>Labor believes in an orderly immigration system based on the rule of law, a system of integrity in which the Australian people will have confidence and trust. We must treat individuals fairly and with dignity and civility. To treat individuals fairly requires that they are dealt with in a speedy and efficient manner, where decisions and procedures are subject to appropriate review. It is in our national interest to conduct ourselves as a good international citizen, to do our fair share for those who are subject to persecution and need protection. Labor in government will ensure that our borders are secure and that the processing and detention of asylum seekers is fair.</para>
<para>I am sure that all members in this place have been inundated with letters, emails and phone calls from constituents calling for changes to the inhumane system of mandatory detention. This grassroots campaign has at least brought about some softening of the arrangements. I commend all Australians who have taken the time to get in touch with their politicians urging change. If we had more grassroots activism, Australia would improve for the better. I specifically wish to record my appreciation of local Lake Macquarie and Hunter based organisations such as Amnesty International Newcastle branch and the Newcastle Action for Refugee Rights group and the campaign they have waged over many years to bring about decent changes. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThis proposal, opposition amendment (6), inserts another review process. The opposition claim that their proposed amendments streamline and make the legislation fair and compassionate. So what do they do? The first amendment they move puts another review process in train, creating a new office of inspector-general, who will be sent around the traps to look at the circumstances of detainees. The lawyers will not stay at homeâthere will be legal process involved. This amendment merely creates another review for the inspector-general who will take legal advice from representatives of the department and of the detainee. It sets out to do exactly the opposite of what the Australian Labor Party claim they are supposed to do.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The secretary appoints the inspector-general whose functions are to receive and make determinations concerning submissions and complaintsâthere is a whole list of things the inspector-general can doâand to âpay particular attention to the needs of childrenâ. What does that mean? It will mean that psychologists, educators and medical people get in on the event and the whole process becomes another grand overview, a second hearing of all the elements already previously gone through. This is a ridiculous proposal. Instead of streamlining the process, the Australian Labor Party are proposing another complication.</para>
<para>The secretary is also to âensure that the Inspector-General is given unrestricted accessâ to all centres and to all people. He will cart the media along as well. So the person with the best publicist will get the most attention. What a crazy way of making decisions. The first of the proposed opposition amendments says that the media has to have access to everything. It will be trial by media. You can see it now: the inspector-general will go into a detention centre, there will be cameras everywhere, he will listen to the claims of the detainee, the lawyer, the child psychologistâall and sundry. The media then can publicise exactly what is being presented to the inspector-general. This is a strange and very unusual process.</para>
<para>We ought to go back to the ideas of the member for Reid, Laurie Ferguson, rather than these strange ideas. In 2002 or in 2004, his ideas were dumped and the Labor Party moved into a new era of enlightenment and fairness! This is crazy stuffâthat an inspector-general can wander around detention centres, is given open access to everything, can take complaints and submissions from all and sundry, including lawyers, and have the media there to help him along. It is no wonder the government has no intention of voting for this issue. There is no intention on our side for this proposal to get up.</para>
<para>If you want to check on conditions within detention centres, an elite group of people, including Gerry Hand, have been travelling to detention centres and reporting to the minister on conditions in those centres. I take it the inspector-general is not going to do that. His or her role will be to take specific submissions from people in the centres.</para>
<para>I do not know where the Australian Labor Partyâs brains are on some of these issues. Its former policies were bad enough, but this is moving into the arena of the strange and the terrible. It will be trial by media, by publicity. The person with the best publicist will get the most attention. Because the minister will grant access to the media, he will be influenced by public opinion rather than by the facts of the case.</para>
<para>I cannot believe that you would want to bypass the proposition of the government that the Ombudsman should reassess things and report to parliament. What could be better than having the OmbudsmanâI do not purport that we should start the case all over againâlook at the facts and report to parliament. That way, everything is open and transparent and everybody knows the circumstances. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI guarantee there is an Ombudsman in New South Wales as well. These people are not prepared to provide external oversight of what is going on in these institutions. They want to have an interdepartmental committee, with no power and no responsibility, to give advice to the government. That committee will be asked to report to the government backbenchers on a fortnightly basis. That is how much confidence they have in this process. We need an inspector-general who will be able to receive and resolve individual complaints from detainees, be empowered to enter detention centres and immigration processing facilitiesâincluding on Christmas Island, which is part of my constituencyâmeet with detainees as necessary, question detention centre staff, view relevant records, receive complaints and inquire into and resolve such matters, pay particular attention to ensuring the needs of these children in community care are being met and be able to inquire into more systemic problems on his or her own motion.</para>

<para>I ask members opposite to go to the questions without notice from Senator Kirk to Senator Vanstone on the issue of Cornelia Rau. If you want an example of why we need an inspector-general, read <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>âbecause it makes it very clear that the role of the staff in the detention centre was the only reason that Cornelia Rauâs case was brought to the attention of the government. If there had been external oversight by an inspector-general, I am sure that this would have come to light a lot earlier. I have spoken to Dr Frukacz, the psychiatrist involved in that particular case, and it is very clear that the bell was rung but nobody took any notice. Had there been an inspector-general, I am sure that would not have been the case.</para>
<para>If we are to have an immigration detention policy, we have to make sure our procedures for detaining people are entirely above board. This is particularly important when government policy appears to beâand isâto hire private contractors to manage and staff the detention centres. I believe it is very important that the inspector-general be empowered to assess the recruitment, training and professional development standards for staff as well as the conditions for detainees. We need to be sure of the staffing arrangements in these detention centres. These problems arising from privatisation will be further exacerbated if the border protection legislation goes through, because it will add more contractorsâthis time to AMFAâto the list of persons authorised to detain. These may not be strictly detention trained staff, but the inspector-general should insist on training and skill levels consistent with those required for the larger detention centres.</para>
<para>Detention centres have been described by an individual as a cross between an asylum and jail. What does that say about the standards that are being applied by those who are running these detention facilities? To supplement Coonawarra in the Northern Territory, further temporary detention points at Gove, Broome and Horn Island to look after foreign fishermen were announced in the budget. In my view, this will add to the need for the inspector-general to operate under a very broad canvas to ensure that standards of treatment are consistent across the different centres. There has to be someone who can answer the question: quis custodiet custodesâwho guards the guardians? That is the point. I do not believe that anyone on the government benches honestly and sincerely believes they should not be supporting this amendmentâno-oneâbecause it is logical, fair, reasonable and says we have to have standards. In his earlier intervention the minister said, âWe were only given these amendments yesterday.â</para>

<para>âThe member for Reidâs interjection would be more interesting if I could hear itâwhether it is because of the distance or because of my own capacities, I do not know. Amendment (6) seeks to impose an inspector-general of detentionâI will come back to thatâand to change the reporting times in the new part 8(c) of the bill such that reporting to the Ombudsman would be done after 90 days instead of two years and ongoing reports would be given every month instead of every six months. I think I have correctly captured the essence of the amendment.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I believe that everyone of goodwill agrees that the critical need is for the immigration department to administer its refugee policy with efficiency, humanity and compassion. The fundamental requirement is that the administration of the policyâthe execution, if you likeâbe done in a way that meets our expectations of compassion and efficiency. Imposing more and more third party oversight can often be very counterproductive. We already have in this bill a provision for an established office bearer with a role in oversight and review of administrative actionsâthe Commonwealth Ombudsmanâto be reported to regularly about persons in detention. As I said earlier today, this office bearer has very extensive powers to subpoena witnesses, procure documents and interview anybody in the course of investigating the matters under review.</para>
<para>This obviously is a considerable increase in accountability to the public and to the parliament. The question has to be asked: what is really added by appointing an inspector-general? What is the inspector-general going to do that is not currently open to the parliament through the joint parliamentary standing committee, through the UNHCRâ</para>

There is already a considerable amount of attention paid to conditions in detention centres and, arguably, we might not be having this debate today if there were not.

<para>The change to the role of the Ombudsman is to bring the reporting periods down to very short time frames. It is difficult to say whether, in the light of experience, reporting after two years, with an update after six months, as is comprehended in this bill, will be timely enough. Experience will tell. The government has demonstrated that it combines both a big heart and a hard head in dealing with immigration, and that was demonstrated by the Prime Ministerâs presentation of these reforms last week. If the time frames prove to be inadequate, no doubt they will be reviewed. But to arbitrarily, and just for the sake of putting up an amendment, foreshorten them in the way they do now is really just proposing an amendment for the sake of having something to say. The ministerâs bill is an outstanding reform, and it is one that we should all wholeheartedly and without any reservations or amendments support.</para>

<para class="block">I stated last night that, whilst I think this immigration debate is long overdue, it is pleasing that the House has the opportunity to debate the national disgrace which is our immigration system. We have heard many contributions over the course of the debate. People have addressed serious concerns regarding a number of issues in our system, such as the plight of those on temporary protection visas, independent medical access to our detention centres and, of course, the unacceptably long time that we are detaining people who are awaiting processing.</para>
<para>But I would like us to now focus on one single issue which I believe stands above all othersâthat is, children do not belong in detention centres. It is time that we address that in this parliament and ensure that it no longer continues. As I said in the chamber last night, Labor wants children out of detention. These amendments moved by Labor will do just that. There was much expectation when the member for Kooyong proposed his two initial bills as they had provisions for removing children from detention and placing them in community homes. The Prime Ministerâs watered down compromise does not go this far. It does not enshrine in legislation what I and many Australians believe, which is that all children should be removed from behind the razor wire. The Prime Ministerâs bill leaves it at the discretion of the minister. This is not good enough.</para>
<para>I think the Australian people have an expectation that we are finally going to act on this important issue and ensure that, from this day forward, no child will grow up in a detention centre in this land. That is what these amendments seek to do. Children in detention is probably the most emotive issue associated with the detention of asylum seekers. Many people find it unconscionable to keep children behind the razor wire. At this point I will talk about one of the things the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs brought up. He said that members on this side of the House keep using emotive language such as âchildren behind the razor wireâ, and he suggested that we had perhaps been told that we had to use this language. Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I point out to the minister that the reason we use emotive language on this issue is that on this side of the House we have emotions, which means that when we are talking about children growing up behind bars we get worked up about it and we use emotive language. My question is: why is that not the case on the other side of the House?</para>
<para>Last night I quoted a GP from my electorate who summed up the social, physical and psychological impact of detention on children. The doctor wrote and explained simply that âthe effects of long-term detention are disastrous in every way, especially upon childrenâ. We need to debate here this morning whether we really want to be responsible for these effects on children growing up on Australian soil. The governmentâs bill leaves to the discretion of the minister whether children are removed from detention. It provides for a non-compellable power for the minister to specify alternative detention arrangements. This is not good enough. It is not acceptable to me, to the GP who wrote to me or to the many other people who have contacted me, and indeed have contacted us around the country, about this issue. The specifics of Laborâs plan would see children removed from behind the wire and placed in the care of foster families after a health check. Unlike the Prime Ministerâs bill, under Labor additional ministerial powers are not required for this to take effect.</para>
<para>I have mentioned that I recently visited Baxter. I point out that it was May when I made the trip to Port Augusta, yet it was still 35 degrees there. I found my trip to that detention facility a truly awful experience. While I have no doubt that the staff there are working hard and trying to do their jobs, it is an awful place and is certainly absolutely no place for children to be growing up. It would perhaps be helpful at this stage to point out that these amendments do not amount to policy on the run. The Labor Party since its national conference has consistently argued in support of removing children from detention. This was announced on Australia Day 2002. To this end, Labor moved amendments to the Migration Act in 2002 and 2003 to remove children from detention. It is strange, then, that some members opposite continue to run the line that Labor has been silent on the issue. Labor has not been silent on this issue and Labor will not be silent until we get children out of detention. We have had good policy, we have been very vocal about it and we will continue to be.</para>
<para>Whilst I am glad to be finally having a chance to debate this issue in parliament, I am saddened that the potential to remove children from detention, as envisioned by the member for Kooyong in his initial bills, has not been realised by the government. It has fallen, once again, to the Labor Party to right the wrongs of the detention system in Australia. I urge all members of this House to support these amendments, to do something that we can all be really proud of and get children out of detention centres. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThe first amendment the opposition moved at the consideration in detail stage of the bill proposed another bureaucracy. It dealt with the introduction of an inspector-general of detention, who would oversee the conditions of detention. And now we have a judicial assessor. As my friends and colleagues have already made perfectly clear with regard to the role of the inspector-general of detention in overseeing detention, how many more overseeing individuals, bodies and organisations do you need? Have a look at the long list. We have the Ombudsman, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, parliamentary committees, advocates who visit on a regular basis, non-government organisations, as the member for Wentworth mentioned, and legal advice. For every detainee who requests it, DIMIA is obliged under the Migration Act to provide legal advice.</para>

<para>âThe judicial assessor will have authority to decide which children remain in detentionâyet another bureaucracy. What are the questions that immediately leap out of the recently drafted amendments? Is the assessorâs role conducted in a personal, administrative or judicial capacity? Which is it? After all, it was the member for Lingiari who boldly made an assertion earlier in impressive Latin. I was very taken aback by the scholarly skills of the member for Lingiari; I could not hope to repeat it. It is a little unusual for a Northern Territory boy to be quoting Latin in the parliament.</para>

<para>âAll right, I did learn Latin in school; I just do not recall itâI did not take it all that seriously, I can say. Translated, what the member for Lingiari said was: âWho guards the guardians?â We have an answer to that: we guard the guardians as a parliament and as an executive, and there are numerous bodies involved in decisions about the release of people from detention, especially children. The member for Lingiari said the government should have answers to all of the issues raised in the amendments because they have been Labor Party policy for a long time. All right, if they have been slaving away on their policy they can answer these questions regarding the judicial assessor. What capacity is the judicial assessor acting in, because there are significant incentives to encourage further litigation? We are going to go back to the old days of lawyers making a meal out of the asylum seekers and establishing an industry which will delay final decisions as to their standing and status, invariably not to their advantage.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Another question: under the Labor Partyâs amendment, what does âsignificant riskâ mean and what factors are relevant for assessing this? What is the answer to that? It has been Labor Party policy for years; can we have some answers? Why arenât these answers available? Because they are making policy on the run. The Labor Party are trying to find differences with the governmentâs exemplary legislation. How is the judicial assessor to assess whether a person ârepresents a danger to the safety and welfare of the Australian communityâ? What is the answer? What is the answer to the question of whether or not the person would be available if required? We have the Ombudsmanâs powers and we are increasing the resources. It is transparent; it is accountable. We have the interdepartmental committee headed by the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. We are serious about a more flexible and softer detention policy. The Labor Party are only serious about political advantage.</para>

<para>âI second the amendments moved by the member for Adelaide and I am very proud to do so. The Labor Party have previously put forward two bills in this House, in 2002 and 2003, which would have seen all kids out of detention. Today we have been flexible. In this amendment we have actually used the words of the member for Kooyongâs proposal because we believe that this is a critical issue. I give credit to the member for Kooyong, the member for Pearce and others, who have put a human face on these issues and who acknowledge that we are dealing with real human beings. Today I remind the House of a very stark reality of the impact of the governmentâs attitude towards detention and its immigration regime.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Last week I spoke about an incident where two young children were forcibly removed from their classroom at Stanmore Public School. Ji Hee Han Hwang, known as Janey, was born in Australia in 1998 and was enrolled in kindergarten in 2004. In Yong Han Hwang, known as Ian, was born in 1993, was enrolled in kindergarten in 1998 and was in year 6 at Stanmore Public School. On 8 March 2005, DIMIA officials went to their classroom, banged on the window and dragged them out of that classroom to lock them up in Villawood detention centre. The impact on those kids and on every kid in that classroom is a disgrace and should not be allowed to happen in Australia. That is the reality of the way that DIMIA is run in this country in 2005. It occurred without the presence of a legal guardian and without prior notice to the department of education. These Gestapo tactics might be defended by some opposite, but they are not the Australian way. It is completely unacceptable that two young children, one of whom was born in Australia, could be forcibly removed from their classroom. It is wrong that these children were removed in this manner and it is wrong that these children remain behind barbed wire.</para>
<para>The immigration department is clearly out of control. It has lost all sense of decency. It is fundamental that we treat children with kindness. All kids should be out of detention, out from behind barbed wire. Australia is the only country in the world where asylum seekersâadults and childrenâare detained for the duration of their processing. Currently 53 children are in detention centres, and on average they have been detained for over 12 months. Only half of these children have access to external schooling.</para>
<para>In late May 2005, three-year-old Naomi Leong was released after spending her entire life in Villawood detention centre. Her only exposure to playing with, and learning from, other children was when she was allowed to attend a child learning centre for three hours. While inside Villawood, Naomi would bang her head against the wall. Naomi was so isolated and alone and so confined that her only method of coping was to copy her motherâs emotional state. The psychiatrist who assessed Naomi and her mother has acknowledged that the family have been traumatised by their time in detention and that they are likely to be haunted by their experiences for the rest of their lives. It is blatantly clear that the detention of children is detrimental to their mental health, let alone that of their parents. A study by the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists in May 2003 of children in remote detention centres found a 10-fold increase in the number of psychological disorders in children over a two-year period.</para>
<para>We ask those opposite to vote for this amendment because it is about family values. This is a test of how fair dinkum they are about family values. Labor has picked up the member for Kooyongâs wording in order to maximise the possibility of that occurring. These kinds of interactions are very real. That two children at Stanmore Public School were taken from their classroom and locked up is an indication of how out of control it is. This is unacceptable in Australia in 2005. I commend the amendments to the House. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âIf you listened to the ALP on the <inline ref="R2409">Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005</inline>, you would think that they had a mortgage on compassion. Let me tell members of the ALP that compassion does not start and end on that side of the House. There are people on this side of the House who have been equally concerned about children being held in detention for a long time. In fact, one of the motivating factors for the introduction of these amendments by the Prime Minister was even his concern about children in detention. So do not put yourselves on some moral pedestal about your concerns.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>If you had those concerns, why didnât you act on them in government? The member for Lingiari stands up and says, âWhen in government the ALP will do such and such.â When in government you had that chance. You had that chance to take children out of detention. What did you do? In 1994, 318 children were in detention centres. How many were born in detention? Member for Reid, 24 were born in detention after the arrival of their parents to Australia, bringing the total to 342. How many children do we have in detention today? We have 53. We have seen over a period of timeânot just since this debate has startedâthe government introducing measures to move children and their families into residential housing situations. And full credit to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs for doing that. We have now gone one step further by saying that the minister now has a non-compellable authority to move these kids into housing facilities even faster.</para>
<para>Laborâs amendment puts restrictions on the process by saying, âItâs got to go to a judicial assessor; itâs got to be done within 30 days.â What about just allowing the immigration minister to make the decision? After all, she has the greatest accountability. She has more accountability than any other minister on these issues. She is the most scrutinised minister in this government. She is scrutinised by HREOC. She is scrutinised by the United Nations Human Rights Commission. She is scrutinised by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. She is scrutinised by every member of parliament in this place. She is also scrutinised by the media. She will make the decision based on the needs of that family at the time. No-one has greater power than the minister in this area and, knowing her and other ministers, I believe that power will be executed with absolute consideration for the needs of the families and the children who need to be moved out of detention centres.</para>
<para>The minister needs greater flexibility. She needs to consider all the issues in regard to a family. Not every family that she will consider will have the same situations. They will have their own unique considerations. Of course, often with these applications, there are one or two members of a family who perhaps need greater scrutiny. So an entire family, including the children, will need to be considered more so than, perhaps, another family. We need to take into consideration the type of housing we are going to move a family into and the location. Will an NGO take them on, or will they go into a state or a federal funded facility? We need to take into consideration the age of the children, their medical conditions and the kinds of facilities and services they require. The Labor amendment simply hobbles the minister; it does not give her the flexibility that she needs.</para>
<para>The member for Grayndler went on with his usual rhetoric and fear campaigns, describing Gestapo-like tactics of officials taking kids out of school. What the member for Grayndler has deceitfully done is confuse visa compliance issues with those of illegal immigrants. Let us not confuse that! They are two separate issues. Yet, he has deliberately done that to give the impression to every person who has kids in school that these Gestapo immigration officials are knocking on windows and dragging kids out their classrooms. The parents are of non-compliance cases. If they have already been in this country for a number of years and they have gone through a number of bridging visas and extensions along the way, then perhaps the time has come when they need to be held accountable to the department and to the Australian people.</para>

<para>âI proudly rise to support Laborâs amendment that will see children being taken out of detention centres. I just heard the previous speaker, the member for Deakin, describe what is in any school a critical incident: the removal of children by strangers. It is something that we are trained in schools to handle, yet this government practises it every day.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In May 2004 a Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report was tabled in this parliament dealing with repeated breaches of human rights suffered by children in Australian detention centres. That two-year inquiry found that the mandatory detention system breached the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Our detention system, it said, had âfailed to make the best interests of the child a primary consideration in detaining them and it failed to treat them with humanity and respectââthe right of all innocents made vulnerable by their youth. It condemned the governmentâs failure to implement repeated recommendations by mental health professionals to remove children with their parents from detention, describing it as âcruel, inhumane and degrading treatmentââunfortunately, something Australians have been encouraged to look away from with callous disregard.</para>
<para>This damning HREOC report has been callously disregarded by the Howard government until now. Fortunately, a handful of Liberals with compassion and courage have stood up to the determined bullying of the Prime Minister and have forced this shameful abuse of human rights back into this parliament and into the public eye. The bill that results is a compromise, but it is the best that could be achieved within government ranks. It will fall short, unfortunately, in dealing with the crisis that exists in our migration and detention systems. Regrettably, an incompetent minister in a complacent and arrogant government, supported by complicit senior bureaucrats in DIMIA, will remain.</para>
<para>These amendments will not, however, remove the responsibility or the culpability of this government, but they will remove children from behind razor wire. Labor has been pressing for these amendments and for this action since 2002. But today my Labor colleagues and I are pleased to finally have the opportunity to rid our immigration system of some of the most despicable aspects of government policy that have blemished the human landscape in this great nation. I give full support to the effect of the bill and the particular Liberals involved in bringing this about.</para>
<para>More than 2,000 children have suffered in immigration detention over the past few years. We hear today that there are 53 childrenâI thought it was 68âwho are still at risk of abuse and are having their rights demeaned right now. Hopefully, though, this legislation will mean DIMIAâs calculated mistakes will never happen again. It has been a long battle and I acknowledge the contribution made by many of my Labor colleagues, by refugee advocates, civil libertarians and decent Australian citizens. I make particular mention of the New South Wales Teachers Federation, who have quietly assisted childrenâs education and their removal from detention centres for that education.</para>
<para>But too many have been absent from this debate. It has taken extraordinary pressure, in one case from the Malaysian media, before the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs agreed to grant Naomi Leong a bridging visa. Naomi, as we have heard, was born in detention and she is therefore considered statelessâa pretty damning and sad label for a young child. Until recently, Naomi had never left the confines of a detention centre. Her plight became public last month after a psychiatrist, Dr Michael Dudley, revealed that Naomi had been banging her head against a wall and was mute and unresponsive. Having spent most of my lifetime contributing to the development of children, I find this horrifying.</para>

<para>Michael Andrew Tran was born prematurely on 23 May 2005 under guard at Perthâs King Edward Memorial Hospital. Michaelâs parents were among 53 asylum seekers who came within sight of Australian shores in July 2003 and have lived in detention on Christmas Island since. Michaelâs parents endured seven days of heartache while they waited to see if a compassionate DIMIA would allow them to keep their one-week-old baby, Michael. Thanks to intervention and media attention, this family was not forced to return to Christmas Island, but they continue to live under guard in a Perth suburb with the fatherâs 74-year-old mother, who was at the centre of controversy earlier this year when she was kept in the Perth airport detention centre while seriously ill. What must they think of Australians?</para>
<para>When mothers are forced to abandon their children, when kids are locked up in detention from birth, when mentally ill Australians are incarcerated or deported because they are unable to explain or defend themselves, it is clear that Minister Vanstone and her department of immigration are in unacceptable crisis. Naturally, the department resists a judicial assessor. It resists any scrutiny of its performance and any onus of proof being placed on it. We know that some 200 cases of potential wrongful detention have been referred to the Palmer inquiry. Decent Australians demand a more compassionate approach and this amendment will deliver that. When people of the world arrive at our doorstep seeking respite from trauma and injustice, seeking shelter and safe haven, we have choices and we certainlyâ<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThere are several ways in which the parliament can deal with this problem of children in detention. Let me say that I and, I believe, all of my colleagues share the communityâs concern about children being in detention centres. It is highly undesirable. Extended detention is clearly calculated to inflict psychological damage on children. It is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs. The recognition of that unsatisfactory state of affairs can be found in the legislation proposed by the government. What does it say? Children should not be detained in detention centres other than as a last resortâI emphasise: a last resort.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>So there are two approaches that we can take. The approach the government are taking is for parliament to state a very clear principleâchildren should not be in detention. That is what we believe; that is what we want to achieve. Having stated that principle, we then give the minister the ability to implement that principle by arranging for children and their families to live in the community under regimes of supervision or reporting that in some cases may be very light indeed.</para>
<para>Then the third part of that approach is to make the exercise of that discretion accountable so that parliament knows and the community knows whether the minister is exercising her discretion in a manner that is consistent with the principle laid out by the parliament, a principle which we all share.</para>
<para>The oppositionâs approach is a different one. It seeks, just as it did in the previous set of amendments that we discussed, to impose another legalistic layerâin this case, a judicial assessorâto impose yet another level of legal review in a system that is crippled and rendered inefficient, unjust and lacking in humanity by excessive legalisms, excessive legal processes. In some respects, as I said earlier today, the tortuous path of litigation associated with immigration matters is of Dickensian proportions. The government is endeavouring to cut that back with the migration reform bill, but more will need to be done. I would have hoped that the opposition would have recognised the problems associated with excessive litigation, excessive legalism, and would have recognised that an abundance of lawyers is no answer to a shortage of compassion. The answer to a shortage of compassion is more compassion, and that is what the governmentâs bill seeks to enable the minister to effect.</para>
<para>In short, the opposition is simply providing here just another excuse for something to say. The judicial assessor will make no substantive improvement to the situation. The law, as proposed, gives states a very clear principle. It gives the minister great discretionâthat discretion of the ministerâs is made accountableâand if she fails to exercise that discretion in a manner consistent with the principle then she certainly will be brought to account. A judicial assessor is simply yet another legal framework, another opportunity for the legal profession, of which I have to confess I am a member or a former member, but it is not a move that is calculated to make our system more efficient, it will make it less efficient, and it will certainly not make it more compassionate. There is no substitute for efficient and compassionate administration. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</amendment>
</amendments>
<para class="block">It is a scandal that we should have to move such an amendment in this House. We have to do so because the honourable member for Kooyong and his colleagues did not succeed in getting the Prime Minister to agree to such an obvious safeguard for those held in detention. We have to do so because of the decisions made by this deeply ideological government to contract the administration of detention centres to private contractors, whose motivation as a business is naturally profit rather than to ensure that the physical and mental health of detainees is safeguarded.</para>
<para>It is striking that the hapless Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Vanstone, is being made to carry the can for this governmentâs embarrassment over the treatment of people in detention. It is striking that the honourable member for Berowra, who as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs from 1996 to 2001 set up the regime which Senator Vanstone now administers, seems to have escaped any criticism. But it was the honourable member for Berowra who decided to privatise the departmentâs detention centres. It was the honourable member for Berowra who gave the department its riding orders, who set the tone for the ruthless and callous way in whichâas we have heard today, children have been dragged out of schools, as the Palmer report now tells usâthe department has treated detainees. It was the honourable member for Berowra and, behind him, the Prime Minister who are ultimately responsible, despite all of their wriggling and evasion, for the Cornelia Rau and Vivien Solon scandals, even though it will be Senator Vanstone who will have to accept the blame.</para>
<para>We now have a situation where the parliament must mandate the secretary of the department of immigration to allow detainees access to independent medical professionals. It is clear that the physical and mental health of detainees has been neglected. It is also clear that this is the only way in which the government can be forced to accept its responsibilities. Detainees must have the right of access to independent medical professionals. This is not a question of merit or otherwise of a policy of mandatory detention. When a government detains a person, for whatever reasons, whether that detention is just or unjust, the government becomes responsible for that personâs health and wellbeing. Even murderers and rapists in our prisons have a right to adequate health care and, by and large, they get it. Isnât it ironic that even Saddam Hussein in his prison cell is currently getting superior medical care than is made available to detainees under the care of the Australian minister for immigration? It is apparently only asylum seekers in detention, who in many cases are eventually found to be genuine refugees, who are denied this right.</para>
<para>This amendment also mentions media access. The current policy of treating detention centres as though they are some kind of prison camp to which people are sentenced without right of communication, as in Stalinâs day, never to be heard from again, must end. People in detention centres are not criminals. They have the right of free speech and free association. As events have shown, independent media scrutiny, and access to media by detainees, is an independent safeguard against the various abuses we are now discovering.</para>
<para>The government cannot say they were not warned about the consequences of handing over the administration of these centres to outside contractors. As the honourable member for Reid said in his speech on this migration bill last night, Labor has been advocating an end to this practice since 2002. It was our policy adopted at our last national conference. It was our policy long before the honourable member for Kooyong and his colleagues took their stand. I commend the honourable member for Kooyong and his colleagues for bringing this issue to a head inside the government and for wringing at least some concessions from the Prime Minister, but fairness and accuracy require an acknowledgment that Labor was advocating these positions well in advance of the honourable member for Kooyong. We were retro before Petro, as I was trying to say when the honourable member for Adelaide and I were gagged when we tried to bring this into the House a couple of weeks ago.</para>
<para>Our friends in the media have given Labor, and the honourable member for Reid in particular, a hard time on this issue over the past few days. I suppose it is too much to expect fairness in the treatment of this issue, but the fact is we have taken a consistent position, and the honourable member for Reid has consistently stated that position. We support an organised border protection policy. We are opposed to illegal immigration. We agree to detention only in temporary, specified, limited circumstances. But we also favour justice and due process for all asylum seekers and humane treatment of all detainees, regardless of their status. That does not seem to ask a lotâI would not have thought the Australian people would have thought it was asking a lotâbut it was evidently more than the Prime Minister was willing to concede to the honourable member for Kooyong. It is now up to this House to do the right thing.</para>

<para>âThe Labor Party is going right over the top. We expected, naturally, a spirited debate on the legislation and now the amendments, but when the honourable member for Melbourne Ports talks about Stalin and alleges that Saddam Hussein is treated better than detainees he has gone too far. The member for Grayndler spoke of the Gestapo tactics of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. This is outrageous and these members should be held accountable.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>But I predicted this. Earlier today I spoke of the Leader of the Oppositionâs tone when I was summing up in the second reading debate. I spoke of his hyperbole, his exaggeration, his abuse of the department and his generalised slander and, sure enough, members of the opposition have picked up on the tone that he has set, to their eternal disgrace. What upsets me more than anything else is that they come in for five minutes and then they are gone. Even the member for Adelaide, who moved the previous amendment and set off 30 minutes of debate, departed almost immediately after her contribution. She had her hand on her heart, gave a speech of moral righteousness that was wholly inaccurate and left the chamber. I have had the member for Mitchell, the member for Deakin, the member for Wentworth, the member for Macquarie here, except for brief periods, for the entire time of this debate, whereas you get the member for Northern Territory who comes in, makes an aggressive speech and is gone within five minutes, immediately he has made his contribution. This is true of even the mover of the amendment. It is the same with all of them: they come in and grandstand, they repeat the inaccurate and defamatory assertions of the extremist advocates, they do not give any evidence, they do not substantiate their case and then they are gone. It is all about them. It is how they feel about their own self-importance and their own moral proselytising.</para>
<para>The member for Grayndler, the great union man, accuses the whole department of Gestapo tactics. I think those members of the union in the department should be taking this up with the self-appointed champion. The member for Melbourne Ports is absurd. He talks about children being dragged out of schools. You name them and I will go through each and every one of those alleged examples. You are just repeating the rhetoric of the critics; you are jumping on the bandwagon. The Labor Party themselves have no approach to this. The member for Grayndler spoke about Naomi Leong. These are unsubstantiated allegations or accusations of the childâs self-harm.</para>

<para>âGive us specific examples. Tell us about a journalist who has requested to see a detainee or vice versa who has not been given access. Go onâyou are moving an amendment in the parliamentâand give examples of deprivation of access to media. Give examples of deprivation of access to medical or allied health assistance. The errors have occurred in mental health. Agreed, the Cornelia Rau and Vivian Alvarez tragedies relate to mental health, but I can tell you that, across the community and across all the state departments of community services and the like, there are shocking errors of judgment about mental health as the whole community grapples with this issue. We are looking to improve our services in that regard and we will be guided by the Palmer inquiry. But the Labor Party are grandstanding. This is a very shallow debate, unconvincingly presented by the Labor Party, and their allegations of DIMIA behaviour do them no credit. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âNow that the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs has finished frothing at the mouth, I am happy to reinsert some basic rationality into the debate. I want to address my comments primarily to the question of mental health and to the oppositionâs amendment that will guarantee proper access to independent medical advice and assistance to detainees. The Cornelia Rau case has exposed the enormous deficiencies in the provision of health services in detention centres in Australia in ways that shame our entire society. It reflects a mentality that is widespread in our community, sadly, that is complacent, neglectful and, ultimately in many cases, uncaring about the question of mental illness generally. It illustrates some of the rather retrograde attitudes that can be found in many parts of the Australian community with respect to problems of mental health.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>These issues are even more serious when they apply to somebody who is being detained by the state, and they are particularly serious when they concern somebody who is being detained when they have not committed a crime, when they have not been sentenced to any specific period of detention and when the mere detention itself is a significant contributing factor toâindeed, an adjacent cause ofâthe mental illness from which they are suffering. No matter how cynical any of us may be, we have to accept that there are very serious mental illness problems in Australian detention centres and we have to accept that indefinite detention, the uncertainty about an individualâs future that goes with that and the harsh administration of this system by both the department and its contractors are major contributing factors.</para>
<para>We can argue about individual cases, we can go into detail about specific individuals, but we have to accept that there is a climate, a set of circumstances and a set of pressures that are all highly adverse to the mental health of individuals and therefore impose an enormous onus on the Commonwealth to ensure, if it insists on continuing with this regime, that appropriate independent assistance is available to people. In the case of Cornelia Rau, we have seen a spectacular example of how that did not occur.</para>
<para>It was recently leaked to one of the newspapers that Mick Palmer, who is investigating the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and its administration of these requirements, was concerned about mindless zealotry on the part of officials of the department. All of the stories that have emerged suggest that there is a culture that is highly punitive, highly cynical and almost sinister in the way that Australiaâs asylum seeker policy is administered. The often extreme insensitivity and arbitrary behaviour to which many detainees are subject is calculated to have a significant effect on the mental health of anybody, but particularly somebody who has committed no crime, who is completely uncertain about their future and who faces the possibility of years in what is effectively a prison situation.</para>
<para>Laborâs amendment is designed to guarantee access to independent medical professionals for detainees with respect to both physical and mental illnesses. This access will ensure a much better monitoring and intervention process for health and psychiatric problems. It will ensure that appropriate treatment is able to be provided when required and that we do not see a repetition of what occurred with Cornelia Rau.</para>
<para>Detention centres are indeed very similar to prisons. Cynicism and indifference to the plight of the individuals who are incarcerated are rarely below the surface. Of course, this is absolutely critical with issues of mental health. We need a revolution in attitudes to mental health generally in our community. It is a huge problem, it is a massively important issue and it should not be considered just in isolated situations such as this.</para>
<para>I recommend to honourable members a recent book by Professor Richard Layard entitled <inline font-style="italic">Happiness</inline>, which is an extremely good book. I had the privilege of meeting Professor Layard in London recently. One of the conclusions he draws is that, when you actually look at the totality of human happiness as a key goal, if not the key goal, of any policy or government approach to governing society, in that framework the issue of mental health is almost paramount. The totality of human misery and suffering that comes from mental illness throughout our society is absolutely enormous. We should see this amendment not only as part of fixing a particular problem in detention centres but as a signal of a need in the community generally. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI share the concern of many members in this Houseânot only those on the other side but also on this sideâas to the medical, psychological and emotional conditions of those who undergo long-term detention. That is one of the reasons why the <inline ref="R2409">Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005</inline> has been introduced as a way of curbing the great length of time for which a person can be detained and also providing greater flexibility for the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to respond.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Mr Deputy Speaker, if you listened to the other side you would be hard-pressed to believe that doctors were allowed into detention centres at all. The fact is that detainees currently have access, and are increasingly having access, to preferred medical service providers. They may request a medical opinion from external health care providers at any time. They have that ability; they have that right to do so right at this moment.</para>
<para>I am not sure why the ALP feel that they need to put all these restrictions in the act rather than providing the flexibility that is required to manage individuals on a case-by-case basis. The medical relationship between the detainee and the independent medical practitioner needs to be upheld. It is a right out in the general community and is also a right in detention centres. If someone seeks a private, independent medical opinion, they have the ability to do that right now.</para>
<para>The member for Melbourne Ports referred to psychiatric and mental health services and the need to address those issues. I could not agree more. It is a blight on our society. There is a growing need generally, not just in detention centres, for governments of all persuasionsâstate, territory and federal governmentsâto spend money in this area. We have referred the whole issue of medical treatment to the Palmer inquiry. I know that in the next few weeks or so, when Mick Palmer brings down his report, he will be making recommendations specifically at the request of the minister and the Prime Minister that deal with examining and making findings on measures taken to deal with medical conditions and other care needs during the period. From the unfortunate episode I have mentioned, we will learn things about the role of the federal department and also about the role of the state and territory departments in that particular case. There are moves afoot in that area. I look forward to the Palmer inquiryâs recommendations in that area.</para>
<para>The other part of this amendment deals with access by the media. One of the things that I noted when I went to Baxter earlier this year was the concern expressed by some of the detainees about their identity and their particular circumstances being broadcast back home. I recall specifically one gentleman saying to me that one of the reasons why he cannot go backâI think it was to Iranâwas that his face was on a web site that indicated that he had converted to Christianity and that he was playing a role in conversions within the detention centre.</para>
<para>It is that kind of breach of privacy which is at the heart of making sure that the mediaâs access to detention centres does have strict guidelines. The media are not prevented. As the minister rightly pointed out, we have not come across any media outlet or organisation that has made a request to have access to a detainee and has had it rejected. Far from that, we have seen many articles in newspapers by noted journalists who have had detailed interviews with detainees about their conditions. Privacy is an important issue. It does need to be maintained. We do not want to jeopardise the safety of that individual or their family overseas, a fear some of them have expressed to me on a personal basis. That is one of the reasons this amendment needs to be rejected.</para>

<para>âFirstly, I refer to a statement made by the previous speaker, the member for Deakin. I know he is a very caring and compassionate man. He noted that if a person wanted or needed an independent medical assessment they could request it. I understand that he may not be as familiar with mental illness as a lot of people are, but one of the issues surrounding mental illness is the lack of insight into the fact that you may even need that independent medical assessment. You only need to look at some of the statements made by Cornelia Rau to understand the impact that mental illness has on a personâs ability to request that type of assessment when they need it.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There is no element of Australian society that causes me to feel more ashamed than the treatment of our detainees, or should I say people, human beings who have the same needs as every other person in our communityâtreatment that led to Australian citizen Cornelia Rau being held in detention for an inordinate period of time. She was mentally ill. This mental illness was not identified. She was subject to degradation and humiliation when all she needed was appropriate medical treatment. I mentioned that inability to have that insight into the fact that you need that treatment. If there were a regular independent medical assessment by health professionals of people who were being held in detention this would not have occurred.</para>
<para>This amendment to the <inline ref="R2409">Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005</inline> allows that to happen. I cannot help question why the government will not accept this amendment. I probably would argue that the government is frightened to give independent medical professionals access to detention centres because it is frightened of what those professionals will find. There is no argument about the psychological impact of indefinite detention. That is irrefutable. Amnesty International continues to receive allegations of physical and mental mistreatment of detainees held in Australian immigration detention centres. That is irrefutable. There are the hunger strikes, the suicide attempts, the riots and the protests. They are all symptoms of the fact that people being held in detention centres are disempowered. They are all evidence of the effect this is having on human beings who are being denied effective remedy to the conditions.</para>
<para>Dr Louise Newman, director of the New South Wales Institute of Psychiatry, said on the ABC recently that detention was a very abnormal environment for child rearing and for people to be held in and that the institute had clinical and developmental evidence that shows detention is causing enormous emotional and psychological trauma and stress for the children. This would be picked up if we had independent medical assessments. There is the example of a female held in detentionâand this example illustrates the powerlessness of detaineesâand the guard would say to her: âAustralians do not want you. Australians hate you; they want you to go home.â This engenders a feeling of self-worthlessness and it creates an environment where people will develop significant mental illness.</para>

<para>âYet again we have an example of the opposition having formed the view that the officials and professionals responsible for administering the immigration system are not doing their job well. Certainly there have been some unsatisfactory events, incidents and practices. There is no question of that. Everyone shares the concerns about the case of Cornelia Rau, about which several members have spoken eloquently and powerfully today. But just because you feel that bureaucracy A is not doing a good job does not mean that the answer is to create bureaucracy B to then look over the shoulder of bureaucracy A. If you feel that the department or its officials, professional medical staff or whatever are not performing their task adequately then the objective is to ensure that they do. Legislation is not a ready solution for good administration.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The amendment that is proposed by the opposition is quite interestingly worded. It says that the House is of the view that medical personnel and media representatives should be given independent access to people in detention centres. I would have thought that if the objective of the honourable members opposite were to be achieved, if their concern were to be dealt with, it would say that people in detention centres should be given independent access to, for example, medical personnel. Are they suggesting that anyone with a medical qualification should be able to enter any detention centre and perform physical or mental examinations of any person they see fit? If the oppositionâs concern is that people in detention centres should have access to independent medical opinion, that objective is not achieved by the language of the amendment that is proposed. The fact remains that detainees may nominate a preferred medical services provider and may request a medical opinion from an external health care provider. If they request a specialist opinion, a referral should be provided by the detaineeâs treating doctor. So the ability to get an outside medical opinion, a second opinion, is there.</para>
<para>The case of Cornelia Rau, which of course will be the subject of the Palmer inquiry, has been touched upon. I simply observe that in the case of Cornelia Rau there was an independent assessment. The problem was that the diagnosis was incorrect. Again, you cannot legislate to make every medical diagnosis correct, just as you cannot fix a perceived problem in administration by creating a second phalanx of administrators and overseers. You cannot legislate to ensure that every psychiatrist who interviews a person is going to get to the right answer, any more than you can legislate to make lawyers give the right answer.</para>
<para>The most charitable view one can take of this clause is that it is utterly superfluous. The access to independent medical advice is there. The medical staff involved in the detention centres are professionals. They do not always get it right. Even honourable members have been known to make errors from time to time. So none of us is perfect. But the principle of access to independent medical opinion is certainly agreed to and is certainly part of the current process. But the language of this amendment is so revealing. It seeks to give medical personnel and media representatives independent access to people in detention centres, so the people in detention centres are not people, they are objectsâobjects that the opposition wants to become the object of inspection and interest by third parties. We believe on our side that the motivation or the instigation of that independent advice should be with the detainee. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</amendment>
</amendments>
<para class="block">As of February this year there were 6,550 temporary protection visa and temporary humanitarian visa holders in Australia. The majority, some 3,980, are from Iraq, followed by 1,853 from Afghanistan. And there are about 800 TPV cases still waiting for a primary decision to be made. The proposed changes in the <inline ref="R2409">Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005</inline> do nothing more than speed up the process by which at least these primary decisions are to be made. To date this process has been disgraceful and the proposals in governmentâs bill do absolutely nothing to guarantee any certainty for TPV holders. In particular, the government changes fail to address the numerous people on rolled-over TPVs for two to three years. Those people who have been determined to be refugees should be granted permanent protection rather than having to go through the traumatic and pointless process of re-establishing their status. The governmentâs bill does not guarantee permanent protection and therefore does not go in any way to end the uncertainty that TPV holders are currently suffering.</para>
<para>The original proposal by the member for Kooyong called for the abolition of the TPV system and for permanent residence to be given to all TPV holders. The member for Kooyong understands the plight of TPV holders who are forced to live in limbo, not knowing what their future holds. It is a shame that the Prime Minister and his minister have not also understood the folly of this inhumane policy and that the government is only prepared to tinker at the edges rather than address the core of the problems surrounding TPVs.</para>
<para>We in the Labor Party, however, understand that the handling of TPVs needs significant attention and that is why we are proposing measures that will restore some certainty and dignity to TPV holders. Laborâs position is born from our commitment to ensuring that we deal with this matter in a humane and decent way. It comes from a commitment to humanity and to social justice that is at the very core of Labor beliefs. Labor therefore proposes that decisions on protection visas be given within two years, with the onus on the government to establish why a visa should not be granted. Laborâs amendments further recognise that even if a person is unsuccessful in an application for refugee status they will have an opportunity to put their case to be accepted as a person who would otherwise be accepted for a migration program.</para>
<para>My electorate of Calwell is a welcoming community; we have built on waves of immigration and we have provided a home to many new refugee communities. We are well aware in our community that amongst us there are a great number of refugees living in circumstances of tremendous uncertainty because they are TPV holders. I have seen the frustration and despair that ongoing TPV status has on the lives of these people, people like Mr Jassim Albtat and his boys, Muhammad, who is 13 years old, and Haidir, who is 14 years old, who live in Broadmeadows. After being released from Woomera in 2001 they are still waiting for a determination of their application for permanent residency. Mr Albtat has said that he simply wants to stay in Australia. Because of the persecution he endured under Saddam Husseinâs regime he believes that now they cannot go back because the situation is still so unsafe and tenuous in Iraq. Only Laborâs amendments will bring certainty to the lives of TPV holders like Mr Albtat and his family.</para>
<para>Many onerous restrictions are placed on TPV holders, such as being prevented from family reunion migration programs, having no access to DIMIA case management services, no access to accommodation support or household formation support services and no access to government funded English language tuition. But above all there is no certainty for these people as to when their circumstances will change, and it is this that creates hardship and impacts adversely on their emotional and mental wellbeing. It is estimated that there are 113 TPV holders in my electorate, with Victoriaâs third largest TPV population living mainly in Broadmeadows, Dallas, Jacana, Coolaroo and Meadow Heights. Local welfare agencies, including the Al-amel TPV Holders Association, have been helping TPV holders. The associationâs name, Al-amel, means âhopeâ. Laborâs amendments provide the only hope for these TPV holders, and that is why this government should adopt them as a matter of urgency.</para>

<para>âI can confidently predict that amendment (2) will not survive if logic comes into play by the time this is debated in the Senate. It is defectiveâand this is what happens when you bowl up backbenchers to move amendments that they know nothing about. Amendment (2) refers to temporary protection visa holders in detentionâbut you are not held in detention if you have got a visa. I stand to be corrected: maybe there are one or two TPV holders in detention at the moment through some circuitous route. But this amendment that the Labor Party has put forwardâwhich the member for Calwell does not understand, nor do the draftersâseeks to amend section 195A of the Migration Act, which deals with detention. So the member for Calwell, who is going out of the chamberâshe will leave the parliament like everybody else on the opposition side; they stay for their five minutes and then they are gone, which is a measure of their seriousness and commitment to this debateâneeds to explain to the House why amendment (2) deals with TPV holders in detention when her speechâand presumably those of everybody in the opposition that follows herâdeals with TPV holders more generally out in the community. So that is the first ground on which it is defective.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The second ground on which it is defective is its policy basis. The Labor Party would have it that all TPVs are converted automatically after two years. That is a recipe for disaster because it does not take into account the character issues that you need to check, which will take at times longer than two years, nor does it take into account the changed circumstances in the country of origin. So is the Labor Party saying that if democracy takes even stronger hold in Iraq, people cannot be returned to Iraq when there are no longer grounds for political asylum? In other words, the Labor Party wants TPVs converted automatically after two years. The situation at present is that the large number of people who come into the TPV stream quite regularly do need the existing issues of character and country of origin circumstances properly assessed. So I will be very interested to know whether or not the Labor Party truly believes TPV holders should automatically get permanent residency after two years.</para>
<para>Instead, I would submit to the House that the Labor Partyâs amendment is unnecessary as the ministerâs power to grant a visa under the new section 195A is where the minister believes it is in the public interest to do so. In defining the public interest, protection needs and contribution to the Australian community are factors that are taken into account. The large number of current TPV holders have been processed and assessed over the last couple of years to the point where, I understand, the overwhelming majority of TPV holders have been assessed and that a very significant number of them have received permanent residency. The Prime Minister has set October as a deadline for all TPV holders to be interviewed and assessed. I hasten to add that process is well under way, so the Labor Party is coming to this issueâlike with all othersâespecially late. It would have been interesting to hear the member for Calwell raise these issues in the House previously as to her assessment, because thousands of TPV holders have been assessed and I would have thought that a majority of them had been given permanent residencyâand we have now set October as the target for the remainder. So amendment (2) is defective, not just in a policy sense but in an operative sense as well.</para>

<para>âIn my contribution to the second reading debate, I said that the <inline ref="R2409">Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005</inline> made incremental changes and we supported them on that basis, but that if you are really serious about addressing the inequities that have occurred in this area you need to do two things: clean up the backlog and set the system up for the future so that the sorts of terrible things we have seen occur can never occur again. As for cleaning up the backlog, when we look at the cases of the 12,000 people who came to our shores between March 1996 and the end of 2001 we see that we have to make changes to detention arrangements, changes to processing and changes to the administrative and judicial review procedures for asylum seekersâ cases. We have also got to make changes to the temporary protection visa system. So if you want to set the system up for the future, then you need to seriously addressâas Labor has been arguing since the course of the last parliamentâhaving an inspector-general of detention, 90 per cent of processing done in 90 days and for those cases not done in 90 days a 30-day automatic review, access to independent medical advice, children out of detention and better processing and review mechanisms.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>So far as temporary protection visas are concernedâthe subject of this particular amendmentâthere are two things we have to address. There is nothing in the governmentâs proposals which will effectively address the backlog after all these years of having 8,000 or 9,000 TPV holders who came to this shore and were recognised as refugees by John Howard, on his watch, who have languished with uncertainty, delay and unfairness, other than the government saying, âWe are going to try to get these things done by October, by processing on the papers,â when that could have been done years before. The second fundamental thing is to set the system up for the future. If you have a TPV system, you need one which operates consistently and fairly, which does not leave people in limbo forever and which reflects, recognises and understands our international obligations. So far as temporary protection visas are concerned, since January 2003 Labor has had a policy which is reflected in these amendments. The rationale for that approach is essentially what I said to the ALP National Conference in January 2003, and it rings true today:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">So far as Temporary Protection Visas are concerned, John Howard believes that Temporary Protection Visas somehow operate as some form of deterrent to unauthorised arrivals.</para>
<para class="block">Well if it is such an effective deterrent, why have we had 8,000 to 9,000 people come here on his watch who are now out there in the Australian community.</para>
<para class="block">We say there is a role for Temporary Protection Visas, but only if that role is consistent with the Refugee Convention.</para>
<para class="block">The Refugee Convention always envisaged that there would be circumstances where the ongoing protection of the Convention was not required.</para>
<para class="block">Under our model, an unauthorised person who comes here, who is determined by the Commonwealth to be a refugee, will go on a Temporary Protection Visa for a one-off period of two years.</para>
<para class="block">After which if the ongoing protection of that person is required, and the onus of that will be on the Commonwealth, then that person has a pathway to permanency.</para>
<para class="block">The worst of Howardâs Temporary Protection Visas is having people out there in limbo for several years.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">You have to deal with the backlog but you also have to set the system up for the future. I continued:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We say two years is an appropriate time to make a judgment. Two years is an appropriate period to give protection, but after that period a different public policy consideration comes into play.</para>
<para class="block">... if the ongoing protection under the Refugee Convention is not required, in the case of those people who have been here on a Temporary Protection Visas for two years or more, you can make a judgment which is, are these people, who have been out and about in the Australian community making their family, community, social and economic contacts, are these the sorts of people who in any event Australia would want as part of our migration intake?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">If you come to a positive conclusion on that, then there is a pathway to permanency. So it is not, as the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs incorrectly describes, an automatic jump from TPV to permanency. These measures were put to this House in April 2004âa sensible, coherent TPV system, with trigger points consistent with our international obligations, making independent judgments under our migration procedures and rules, together with the right of re-entry. Everyone on the other side of the House voted it down, including the members for Kooyong, Pearce and Cook. You have to address the backlog of the 8,000 to 9,000 people who came here during John Howardâs watch. John Howard said they were refugees. John Howard gave them temporary protection visa status and now they just roll around in limbo. You have to set the system up for the future so that uncertainty can never happen again. If you adopt Laborâs amendment, that will set up the system to treat TPV holders in a fair way, consistent with our international obligations. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThere is no way we can wear this proposal to take away proper discretion from the minister and to confine the minister in decision making to basically a single outcomeâthat is, a permanent result rather than giving the minister the option of assessing an individualâs case carefully, taking into account every aspect of that case, including family circumstances, likely problems on return to country of origin and other options that a minister must consider.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Labor Party seek to codify everything. They want rules for everything; they do not want ministers to exercise judgment or to be criticised. They want a minister to say, âThatâs the law; I had to do it.â That is the problem with the way in which the act has been codified. This is a sensible provision which will allow the minister to exercise judgment. The amendment qualifies the power to grant visas and provides for the grant of a two-year visa and then the person must move towards permanency. That is not the governmentâs intention. The governmentâs intention is to provide proper assessment by a minister taking advice from everybody, including members of parliament and other agencies.</para>
<para>The Labor Party have presented these amendments in a very interesting way. Instead of going through the bill in a seriatim process, which is the normal way to run a series of related amendments, the Labor Party have gone through Petro Georgiouâs speech, picking out the purple patches and graduating them in a process where they think they can get people to cross the floorâa political stunt. They start with the inspector-general, but they know we are going to knock that out, that we will not wear it. The next one they want to run is the judicial assessor. They do not run them in a seriatim process, the normal process for amendments. The Labor Party have them in a graduated order of concern so that they can make a political point. The grant of protection visas for detainees and the 90-day provision are next.</para>
<para>This has been purely a political exerciseâone after the other. Part of the political exercise is the wish to codify the actions of a minister and to encourage the process of granting permanencyâno other options; just change the visa and grant permanency. If we go through the four parts of this proposal put forward by the Australian Labor Party we find that one after the other they remove discretion. Nobody is going to deny that there should be removal of the discretion which the government wants to grant in these circumstances. I believe you cannot argue effectively that that discretion should not be given. The judgment of the minister is exposed to everybody and open to public criticism. The minister is going to make these decisions and it is going to be open for everybody. But, in the view of the Australian Labor Party, the minister needs to be confined. The government do not believe that that should be the process. We believe the minister needs to exercise full discretion and that is why these amendments are hopeless.</para>

<para>âOne of the enduring features of the temporary protection visa regime in Australia is the governmentâs effort to keep secret the stories of the people who are affected by it. One after another, these stories come to light and we hear not only Labor members but also government members saying: âThe temporary visa protection system is terrific except for the people in my electorate who are making such a fantastic contributionââpicking fruit in the Riverina or working in the abattoir at YoungââThese people should not be affected by this regime, because they are a special case. They are terrific people and should be able to become Australian residents and eventually Australian citizens.â There is an irrational belief that the refugees we know are okayâit is all the other refugees who are a terrible threat to the Australian fabric and way of life.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Discussing temporary protection visas, I am reminded of the film <inline font-style="italic">Molly and Mubarak</inline>, which was shown in Parliament House in November 2003. It is a beautiful film by Tom Zubricki about a young Afghan boy, his friendship with a girl of a similar age at Young, their developing friendship and his virtual adoption by her family. It was a moving film and was very light-hearted in parts. It was certainly no great threat to Australian democracy. You might remember that the government tried to ban the screening of that film in Parliament House. The reason I was given for this was that the film is critical of the governmentâs policy, selectively quotes the Prime Minister and promotes the theme of widespread resistance to government policy. That was the reason given to shut down debate in this country on temporary protection visas. The filmâs director, Tom Zubricki, said of <inline font-style="italic">Molly and Mubarak</inline>: âIt is a film which I think makes you rethink your position on people who have been accused of being illegals and queue jumpers. It presents them in a different light and that is why it is probably politically contentious. It can be seen as subversive, because it humanises these people who have been demonised and vilified.â</para>
<para>We should remember that temporary protection visa holders have been found to be genuine refugees. There is no debate about whether they deserve Australiaâs protection as genuine refugees. That is not the question. The question is: what sort of protection will we give them? Up until now, we have given them extremely substandard protection. We have said that they can never be reunited with their families. They cannot leave the country to visit their family in a third country. In 20 or 30 years time, will they be permitted to meet their family in Singapore and see what has happened to children who have grown up or parents who are almost at the end of their lives? No. This is the regime to which we have subjected refugees who have come to Australia.</para>
<para>The member for Mitchell is talking about taking away ministerial discretion in this area. The point of his governmentâs legislation is to give ministerial discretion where it has not previously existed. I do not know how you can possibly interpret our efforts as being aimed at taking away ministerial discretion. Our efforts are aimed at offering certainty to people who deserve it. These people have invoked their right to protection under international laws. They have come here during the governmentâs watch, as one of the earlier speakers said, and have been granted asylum by the government. We want to say to these people: âWe will give you some certainty. You need not look forward to a lifetime of having the threat hanging over your head that, any day, you may be returned to your country of origin.â Most of the temporary protection visa holders are from Iraq and Afghanistan. Of the almost 9,000 temporary protection visa holders, over 3,500 are from Afghanistan and over 4,500 are from Iraq. I do not see the situation in those countries being safe any time soon. The constant threat that they will be sent home makes it impossible for them to settle into Australian society. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI have full regard for the member for Calwell, having worked with her on committees. But if she really understood the amendment and what it is trying to achieveâif she went back and looked through the legislation it is amendingâshe would know that it does not achieve what she intends. This amendment qualifies the power to grant visas to detainees and amends section 195A to require that TPV holders be granted permanent visas. I say to the member for Calwell and the member for Reidâwho has responsibility for carrying these amendments through the Houseâthat section 195A is purely for those who are in detention. These changes are not possible under this amendment. The issue is uncertainty. This amendment will create even more uncertainty if it is passed.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>We all know that the United Nations prefers that those who seek and are granted asylum in another country should at a future time be settled back in their original country. Granting permanent protection visas before we have had a chance to see how the situation unfolds back home prevents that United Nations objective from being achieved. It is much better that people be resettled back home if possible. The TPV allows a personâs individual caseâsuch as the country they come from, and their political, economic and social situationâto be reassessed to see whether or not it is safe for them to return home. The TPV gives that extra flexibility, including to the minister.</para>
<para>The member for Sydney says that these people are going to be prevented from going back to Singapore or Bangkok or wherever else to catch up with relatives in 10 or 20 years time. We know from current practices that the majority of TPV holders assessed as being in need of further protection have in fact already been granted permanent protection. In August 2004 the government introduced amendments to allow former TPV holders to access mainstream visa classes. We have allowed that flexibility for the TPV holders to access other visas. A lot of the cases have been assessed as warranting permanent protection. However, automatically granting TPV holders permanent protection removes the flexibility that any government and any minister would require. This is one of the reasons why this amendment should also be voted down.</para>

<para class="block">We have a stark contrast here. We have the assurances of the member for Wentworth that it is difficult to say whether reporting on people two years after detention and a further six months later is good enough. He says that experience will tell. That is very nice for him, but one has to ask whether it is all that nice for the people in detention. We also have the contribution to this debate from the member for Mitchell. He has lamented the possibility that Labor is codifying, bringing in controls and bringing in bureaucracy. He says that we can trust the minister; the exercise of ministerial discretion is good enough. But I am inclined to look to the other side for this stark contrast: the views of the member for Kooyong with regard to this constant stream from those opposite that the department is, to quote the member for Deakin, âscrutinised too muchâ. The member for Kooyong stated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">â¦ no government department has greater unscrutinised power over peopleâs lives thanâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">DIMIAâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">and I do not believe that it is acceptable to leave decisions about detentions in the hands of DIMIA officials without additional independent scrutiny and intervention.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">For all the rhetoric and talk opposite that this department is over controlled and over scrutinised, many of us would say that the member for Kooyong is more on the money. We have a situation where, two years after detention, they will start looking at giving a report to the ombudsmanâs office and then every six months after that. This is at the same time that the coalition comes to this parliament saying that DIMIA will process stages of these people in three months and then in another three months. One would have to question whether, given that alacrity and that move towards swiftness with the devotion of more resources, they cannot be a little bit more proactive with regard to having an early report on these people. I say that a first report after 90 days and further reports after one month is a far more sensible suggestion.</para>
<para>I do not need to dwell at length on the allegations and the evidence of psychiatric problems of people who have been in long-term detention. The minister has said that she was not prepared to come to the conclusion that the detention system puts patients at serious risk of mental illness. A few days after saying that, in the aftermath of the revelations, she said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Can I give an absolute guarantee that the detention of Cornelia Rauâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">who was detained for 10 months and not two yearsâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">did not in any way further damage her condition? Of course I cannot give that guarantee.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Those opposite talk about trust and scrutiny et cetera. The member for Kooyong and his allies do not trust ministerial discretion. I made the point earlier that the secret deal, which was not revealed to the public, involves this interdepartmental committee, led by Mr Shergold, reporting to the member for Kooyong and the other members involved in this on a fortnightly basis. That is the level of trust their own side of politics has in this process; they have to report fortnightly to see how it is going. This is the same interdepartmental committee which is supposed to be trustworthy with regard to monitoring the department of immigration, which, as anyone would know, is dysfunctional and out of control, as we have seen over the last few months.</para>
<para>The complaints about bureaucracy, about paperwork and about difficulties and over scrutiny should be seen in the context of the experiences of the people and the revelations of recent months. Labor puts forward that the background to this is a faster and fairer processing system; transparency and accountability are long overdue. There will be no hiding behind the non-compellable power of ministerial discretion. There must be a justification to parliament if the minister refuses the recommendations of these reports. We should avoid unnecessary and prolonged detention and we should have a system that is humane; the system is necessary but it should not be punitive.</para>
<para>There is a solid case in what we have seen for strong intervention, strong oversight and strong checking up on this department and, more particularly, on detention. The situation came to a head when Justice Finn said that the government, the department and the contractor had all lamentably failed in their duty of care to these people in detention. Australian citizens with psychiatric problems have been detainedâand not on one occasion, as the minister said earlier; this has been demonstrated publicly on at least two occasions. We have to have protection in a system where it has been revealed that there have been 200 unlawful detentions and where there is the possibility that some 928 further cases will be referred. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThe oppositionâs amendments to the <inline ref="R2409">Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005,</inline> before us now, would change the governmentâs proposal for ombudsman assessments of a detainee every two years and then every six months to, instead, assessments by the Ombudsman every 90 days and then every month. This is a matter of judgment more than a matter of opinion. We believe that our system of assessments every two years and then every six monthsâand, in the interim, the interdepartmental committee chaired by the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet reporting fortnightly to interested government membersâis the more practical and reasonable system. To have the Ombudsman reporting on detainees every 90 days and every month thereafter, quite frankly, is an administrative nightmare that will quickly become unworkable. Consequently, we do not accept the oppositionâs amendments.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We will properly resource the Ombudsman. I find an inherent contradiction in the oppositionâs presentation of its amendments. It puts forward a proposal for a new inspector-general who has the responsibility of overseeing the detention arrangements. Therefore, what does the ombudsman do? The inspector-general and the ombudsman will be crossing each otherâs paths in and out of detention centres basically doing the same thing. Then on top of that you have the judicial assessor. The layer upon layer of bureaucracy is frightening and not in the interests of detainees, let alone in the interests of sound immigration and detention policy. It smacks of the opposition trying to find points of difference and separation from the government. It is a game of one-upmanship to the opposition. That is why we are getting these new bodies, these new people, and these new powers.</para>
<para>Let me state categoricallyâand I know I speak on behalf of every member of the governmentâthat we do not want people in detention, let alone for prolonged periods. But the simple fact of life is that when you are running an immigration policy there are people in detention. That is unavoidable. The House will be interested to know that at present 75 per cent of all people in immigration detention are compliance cases, such as overstayers, most of whom are in for short periods. Fifteen per cent of detainees are unauthorised boat arrival people and the remaining 10 per cent are mostly people awaiting deportation, a number of them for criminal offences. Only a minority of children, nine per cent, or women, 20 per cent, found to be unlawfully in Australia are detained. In the vast majority of cases DIMIA works on removal arrangements while the women and children remain in the community.</para>
<para>We have heard Labor members talk about Stalin and say that Saddam Hussein has more rights than detainees. We have heard the word âgestapoâ from the oppositionâall exaggeration. But when you look at it clinically and objectively, we have a fair and necessary detention system which we are improving very substantially as time goes on. Senator Vanstone has announced reforms and improvements in past months. Administratively she has done a great deal and now, legislatively, the government is doing even more to make the system flexible and softer. Let us face itâin a minority of those cases where detention is the only option it is because parents or other individuals are not cooperating fully in removal arrangements.</para>
<para>So in summary, there has been a detailed consideration of the oppositionâs amendments. They bring nothing to the table except political posturing. Their amendments are either impractical or unworkable. They cannot walk both sides of the street on this. They cannot be strong on border protection and then weaken mandatory detention to a point where it becomes unworkable. Instead, the government has fair and sensible reforms brought about by the considered deliberation of all government members, reforms which will be endorsed widely throughout the community.</para>

<para>âI rise to again acknowledge that progress has been made on the <inline ref="R2409">Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005</inline>, but it does not go far enough. That is why I am supporting this amendment, moved by the member for Reid, along with the other amendments. This issue could have been dealt with by the parliament more than two years ago. Labor gave this House the opportunity to vote on the more expeditious processing of people in detention facilities. We came to that position because we had an extensive process of consultation around the community. For over 12 months the member for Lalor, and then the member for Reid, conducted seminars and discussion groups around the country to try to work out the best way in which we could advance this policy area so that we got the balance right between secure borders and a more compassionate system.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>One of the conclusions that came out of those consultations, not only with community groups but also with experts in the field and with the department, was that it was possible to process nearly every asylum seeker within 90 days. We accepted the need for detention to establish the question of health checks, security checks and citizenship, but we said it should not go on endlessly. We took advice and we were told that this could be done within 90 days. In fact, we were given an assurance that 90 per cent of cases could be dealt with in 90 days. This, I note, is a fact not disputed, not demurred from, by the government members.</para>
<para>So what we are dealing with here is what happens after the 90 days. It is not just a question of judgment, as the minister at the table, the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Mr McGauran, talks about. This goes fundamentally to whether we want a fair system for dealing with people after the 90 days has passed. Let us understand the contrast between what Laborâs amendment proposes and what the government proposes. We say that after the 90 days the onus of proof should shift. It should essentially come back to the government or the independent assessor to say why the person needs to be kept in detention facilities after 90 days. That is an exercise that needs to be made public. We say that there should be a requirement on the part of the independent body to report on a monthly basis and for that to be made public.</para>
<para>What does the government say? The governmentâs bill effectively says that the Ombudsman, the independent body, does not even start to look at these people for two years. And then it has a review only every six months. In other words, instead of our system, which would put the onus back on the government to say why after 90 days the person could not be released, we are stuck with this system which says the person can still be in detention for another two years and then only get a six-monthly review. That is not judgmentâthat is deception. You cannot masquerade in this place talking about 90 days and fairness if the truth is two years plus six months. That is the contrast. That is the difference between the amendments we are putting forward and what the government bill proposes. The governmentâs process could take 10 times longer than the process we have been advocating.</para>
<para>This is not the first time Labor has put this type of amendment before the House. I might say again of the four members that have been claiming credit for pursuing these changes: where were they when we put these proposals to the chamber before? They did not vote for us. I think that, importantly, has to get on the record. I have congratulated them on what they have achieved. But, if they really believe in their heart of hearts what they have been talking about, they should be supporting our amendments.</para>
<para>As for leaving the discretion ultimately in the hands of the minister: what a joke. This is a person who has shown no indication of compassion, no ability to really judge the circumstances. Yet after the Ombudsman reports to her it is up to her as to whether anything is done. That is not good enough. If we want a system that is going to improve, we need to accept Laborâs amendment on this case as well as on the other initiatives that are before the chamber.</para>

<para>âWe need to analyse what the Labor Party is proposing here with these amendments. The amendments propose that the period of two years before a re-examination is made be substituted with 90 days and then every month thereafter. This is not confined to asylum seekers; it applies to everybody in detention, of which at 27 May there were 973. These amendments are proposing that for each month after the 90-day period 973 cases be re-examined. In every instanceâright through the governmentâs billââtwo yearsâ would be substituted with â90 daysâ, with a follow-on of one month thereafter. On a rough calculation that would require the Ombudsman to look at 263 cases a week, approximately eight minutes per case. Is that a review? Do you think that will get bogged down, Madam Deputy Speaker Bishop, in bureaucracy? I am sure it would and you would agree with me. So how is it going to work? It is impractical. The proposed amendments to the act mean that in 973 cases there would be this monthly review. I am sorry: it will not work. The intention may have been good, but it is impractical if you add together the cumulative impact of all of these amendments.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This is why the proposals of the Australian Labor Party are so flawed. The first amendment they moved was to get a grand inspector to go into the whole array of detention centres to inspect them and to take submissions from anybody the inspector-general would want to take submissions from. That is one review. The next review would be by the assessorâthe judicial assessor would do another review of children and families in residential detention. So that is a second review and a second person doing their stuff. Then of course independent medical and media representatives would be able to go and see whomever they liked at any time. On top of that, the amendments confine the ministerâs discretion so the minister cannot really have much say except to grant permanent residency. Finally, to cap it all, there would be another survey of every individual in detention, giving them 8Â½ minutes per month every month, 12 months of the year.</para>
<para>The impracticalities of three re-examinations plus access by media and medical advisers, along with confining where the minister can exercise judicial discretion to make worthwhile decisions, is topped off by this 8Â½-minute examination by the Ombudsman. It just shows how out of touch the Australian Labor Party are with policy in general but immigration policy in particular. They have been running a line that was hopeless for them in government. It took them six years to decide they were going to ditch that policy. Then when the policy was continued for a little longer by the shadow minister he had a private talking to and was told to pull his head in. Finally we have these silly amendments today. It just shows you how out of touch they are.</para>

<para>âClearly consistency and statistics are not the strong suit of the member for Mitchell. Elsewhere in the governmentâs contribution to this debate they have claimed that they will process most cases in 30 days. I am not quite sure how that factors into his quick piece of arithmetic, nor his analysis of the work of the Ombudsmanâs office, who I take it he assumes has a total staff allocation of one individual. The simple fact is that involved in dealing with these amendments there is a fundamental principle that all members of this chamber cannot escape. It is whether we think people should be detained, effectively without review, for up to two years in what amounts to mandatory sentencing or whether there should be an obligation built into the system to process most people within 90 days.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As the member for Hotham pointed out earlier, Labor in 2002 made it clear that our policy would be to have 90 per cent of these people processed within 90 days. As bona fides, to ensure that the system operated properlyâbecause we understood in 2002, as has become tragically clearer since then, that this department has failed to conduct its affairs in a way which most Australians would regard as properâwe would build in the transparency and accountability mechanism of having, after 90 days, an external review for each of those cases. That external review would be conducted on a monthly basis and the minister of the day would be required to provide a response to that independent review. That provides a transparency and a process of accountability that the Australian people demand as fair and reasonable.</para>
<para>Contrast that with the governmentâs bill and the position which government members have sought to defend in this debate, which is that people should be put away and locked up for two years before there is an external accountability and review process. After those two years, there is then a review only every six months. In practical terms, the contrast is this: Laborâs amendment would ensure that if someone was detained compulsorily in a detention centre for two years, they would have had something in the order of 18 to 20 reviews by the time they got the first review under this government. Someone on the government benches might like to explain why that is fair.</para>
<para>I have listened to the debate today as a number of government members have complained that Labor members have tried to take some moral high ground on this. A number of people on the government benches have indicated their personal commitment to similar principles. I accept that a number of government members do share similar principles on this. The test of those principles and their bona fides is in dealing with these amendments. There is an opportunity for government members who claim to be concerned about these things to demonstrate that, not in press releases, doorstops or stunts, but in real activity by a vote in this parliament which makes a difference. There is an opportunity for them to put their feet where their mouths have been for the last few weeks and actually support what is by any measure a fair and proper system.</para>
<para>We think that to detain people for 90 days is a fair period in which the system can determine identity, health and security risks for the great bulk of people. That was a decision we took in 2002. I am glad that the member for Hotham spoke prior to me on this because when he was the Leader of the Opposition, he gave the commitment on Australia Day 2002, on behalf of the Labor Party, that changed our policy to say that we would remove children from detention centres. At the time, that was a pretty courageous stand to take. The member for Hotham did that with dignity. It is something that those of us on this side of the House are proud of.</para>
<para>Since that time, we have argued for a policy that embodies these principles of fairness. We have moved amendments in this place to that effect in the past and government members have done their best to prevent the parliament debating them. Here they have an opportunity to vote on the substance of the issueâno tactical games, but a vote on the substance of the issue. Do the government members who claim to be concerned about these things want to see people detained as a matter of practice for two years or do they think that 90 days is a fair time to process them? Here is the test to those opposite. We will wait to see whether they can measure up to that test. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI thank the member for Brisbane for coming out and finally telling us what the motivation for these amendments is all about. The motivation for these amendments is to see whether or not there are members of the government who will cross the floor. That is what this is all about. It is pure and simple: this is politics. I understand that; it is the profession that we are in. But do not disguise it behind some concern about the existence of immigration detention at all. This is about politics. The bells will ring and let us see whether or not people are going to cross the floor.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>These amendments, more so than any of the other amendments, basically outline a new ALP policyâthat is, the dismantling of mandatory detention. Mandatory detention would cease to exist if we have in the legislation the ability for reviews to take place within 90 days and then every month afterwards. People out there will know that they are going to get a decision within 90 days and after that every month. Mandatory detention is dead. This is a new ALP policy and let them come out and say it. Is it dead or is it politics? It is one of the two. It is either a new ALP policy of making mandatory detention dead or it is all about politics.</para>
<para>I will get back to the amendments because our changes do address the issue of people who will be in detention for exorbitant periods of time. I spoke in the main debate about my concern for Peter Qasim and how much I was touched by his story when I met him. We do not want situations like Peter Qasimâs to slip through the system. That is why we are making changes so that after two years, and then every six months afterwards, the Commonwealth Ombudsman will review each case. That is a fair system. Within that two-year period, we will also allow the applicant the ability to go through the primary application, including the tribunal, the Federal Court, the Magistrates Court and the High Court. So the legal avenues will still be available to the detainees. On the other hand, what the ALP is doing is mixing two systemsâan administrative system and a legal system. If you do not understand that, it is because this has nothing to do with addressing the issue; it is all about the politics that you are playing at the moment.</para>
<para>There is another thing that we need to understand. I think it was the member for Hotham who spoke about the onus of proof shifting onto the government to prove the case. At the moment we have a situation where someone applies to be an asylum seeker. Surely it is reasonable to expect that, if you are going to make an application for something, your application should demonstrate the veracity of your case. It is up to that individual, not the government, to demonstrate the veracity of the case. Even beyond that, the United Nations guidelinesâand you would know this, Member for Reid, as after all you carry the portfolio on behalf of the oppositionâallow within that system, where there may be a benefit of the doubt, that that also be taken into consideration and go in favour of the applicant. The application of the United Nations guidelines currently allows the benefit of the doubt to be applied. But we know what this is about. This is about politics; this is not about your concern for mandatory detention. If it is, then you have outlined a new ALP policy of dismantling the entire thing. What is it? State which one it is, and let us get on with it.</para>

<para class="block">The purpose of the <inline ref="R2315">Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline> is to make amendments to the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 and to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Act 2001.</para>
<para>Australiaâs Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 has made a significant contribution to the global effort to phase out ozone depleting substances, and is now also contributing to minimising Australiaâs avoidable emissions of synthetic greenhouse gases. Through cooperation between government and industry, the legislation has reduced Australiaâs consumption of ozone depleting substances by 80 per cent since 1989, resulting in estimated savings to the Australian economy of some $6.4 billion by the year 2060.</para>
<para>This bill proposes to amend the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 to rectify a small number of operational anomalies and unintended consequences of drafting. The proposed amendments will ensure the consistent and effective operation of Australiaâs legislation for the management of ozone depleting substances and their synthetic greenhouse gas alternatives. These substances have very significant impacts on the global climate system and the ozone layer, and appropriate restrictions are essential to ensure that these substances are managed consistently and used sustainably within Australia.</para>
<para>Specifically, this bill will make two changes to the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989. Firstly, it will confirm that importers or exporters of recycled or used methyl bromide or hydrochlorofluorocarbons are only required to hold a used substances licence. This approach is consistent with that taken for other ozone depleting substancesâsuch as chlorofluorocarbons and halonsâcurrently controlled under the act.</para>
<para>Secondly, the bill will ensure that reporting obligations for synthetic greenhouse gases manufactured in Australia are the same as those for synthetic greenhouse gases imported into, or exported, from Australia.</para>
<para>The proposed amendments to the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 contained in this bill demonstrate the governmentâs determination to further advance its practical and effective approach to managing ozone depletion and climate change.</para>
<para>In relation to the amendments to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Act 2001, the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust is responsible for preparing and implementing a plan for the future uses of former defence and other Commonwealth lands on or near the foreshores of Sydney Harbour. These are historic lands. They tell the story of European settlement in Sydney and trace the patterns of defence, industry and population growth in the fledgling colony of New South Wales.</para>
<para>The lands are Macquarie Lightstation on South Head; the former Artillery School at North Head; Woolwich Dock and Parklands; Cockatoo Island; Snapper Island; Defence lands at Middle Head-Georges Heights-Chowder Bay; and the former marine biological station at Watsons Bay.</para>
<para>The Sydney Harbour Federation Trustâs comprehensive plan for these sites was approved by the Minister for the Environment and Heritageâs predecessor, the Hon. Dr David Kemp, in September 2003. The plan was some years in preparation and involved wide community consultation. It is fair to say that consultation by the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust in the preparation of the plan was a hallmark of the planning process. A community advisory committee, established under the Sydney Harbour Federation Trustâs legislation, was instrumental in reflecting community interest in the sites and providing advice and recommendations on site outcomes. I particularly commend the work of the member for Warringah and the member for North Sydney in assisting with the community consultation.</para>
<para>The Sydney Harbour Federation Trust has begun the challenging task of implementing the comprehensive plan.</para>
<para>Former Defence lands at Middle Head-Georges Heights-Chowder Bay are being transformed into a headland park. The park will link all the elements of these disparate defence bases and bring them into accord with the great natural and cultural assets of the Middle Head plateau. A network of walking tracks, lookouts, revegetation and interpretive signage will underpin compatible uses of buildings and facilities and highlight the Indigenous and military history of this beautiful headland.</para>
<para>The Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Act 2001 provides for the sale, subject to environmental and heritage considerations, of 19 residential lots listed in schedule 2 to the act. The residential lots are at Markham Close, Mosman. Other trust lands are listed in schedule 1 to the act and are to remain in public ownership.</para>
<para>To date 12 residential lots at Markham Close have been sold by auction.</para>
<para>The effect of the proposed amendments contained within this bill will be to enable the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust to more effectively bring to the fore the natural ridgeline of Middle Head peninsula and add to the character of the headland park. This entails transferring three residential lots in Markham Close from schedule 2 to schedule 1, thus allowing them to be incorporated into the park and in exchange transferring the land on which a disused scout hall is located, currently included in schedule 1, to schedule 2 permitting its eventual sale.</para>
<para>This land swap, which has strong community endorsement, is consistent with the trustâs comprehensive plan and the fundamental objective of making its lands accessible to the public. The scout hall land does not have any significant environmental and heritage value and the scouting association has relinquished its lease on the land. The scout hall land, comprising around two-tenths of a hectare of trust lands, will be sold to private funds to enhance trust sites.</para>
<para>The trustâs preparation of the management plan for Markham Close included the proposal to swap land in the interests of highlighting the ridgeline of Middle Head peninsula and contributing to the creation of a spectacular headland park. The proposed land swap was overwhelmingly supported by the community during the exhibition of the draft management plan.</para>
<para>The proposed amendments contained in this bill will enable the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust to fulfil the objectives of the comprehensive plan and to open Middle Head peninsula for the benefit of the community.</para>

<para>âMy question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that the petrol bill of a typical family increases by $8 a week with every 20c a litre petrol price rise? Will the Prime Minister strengthen the Trade Practices Act and the powers of the ACCC to prevent and punish profiteering? Will the Prime Minister establish a full and independent inquiry into petrol pricing and profiteering? Or does the Prime Minister agree with the Treasurer that there is nothing the government can or will do?</para>

<para>âIt is a record high, as the Treasurer reminds me. Let me say that since 1979, when I think the former leader of the Labor Party and former Labor Prime Minister and my immediate predecessor embraced the policy of import parity pricing for crude oil, I have not heard the Labor Party repudiate that policy. All I can say is that the call by the Leader of the Opposition for another inquiry is the sort of empty populism about which Senator Robert Ray has complained. To Senator Robert Ray, the member for Lalor and all the other people who are running around telling the Leader of the Opposition to lift his game can I say that a decent policy alternative and not cheap populism is what is needed from the Leader of the Opposition.</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for his question. The International Whaling Commission held its second day of meetings in Ulsan, Korea, yesterday. At that meeting Japan proposed an amendment to the convention that would have allowed the resumption of commercial whaling. I am pleased to inform the House, and of course it has been in the media in any case, that working closely with quite a number of like-minded countries we were successful in voting down this measure by 29 votes to 23. The fact that a majorityâa good majority in the circumstancesâwere opposed to the resumption of commercial whaling is something that we particularly welcome. This was a vote that built on our earlier success in blocking Japanâs attempts to alter the procedures and the agenda of the International Whaling Commission to suit pro-whaling nations.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I make the point that this excellent result was the product of patient diplomacy, and I congratulate Senator Ian Campbell, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, on the excellent job he has done. I think we are all very grateful to him for his hard and effective work and to the officials of his department and my department. This is an example of patient diplomacy that has spanned many years. This is not an issue that has cropped up in the last three months; this issue is ages old. We have had very effective but quiet cooperation with our partners.</para>
<para>There will be further votes in coming days, including on an Australian motion that the International Whaling Commission not consider Japanâs expanded scientific whaling program until a review of the original program has been completed. The outcome is hard to predict and, again, it will be very difficult to get a majority. It is possible that we could, but it is possible that we will not. But in the end we will do our best to try to achieve that outcome.</para>
<para>In conclusion, some members and commentators have argued that we should abandon this process, that it does not amount to much, and, instead, we should just go to the International Court of Justice. The government have always said that we do not rule in or rule out any options. We obviously keep our options open, but we would need to consider any measure like that very carefully. That is the sort of measure that needs to be thought through. Bringing legal action in the International Court of Justice is a process that could take a decade or more, so we would not get very quick results there. Also, the doctrine of abuse of rights, which is the basis on which we would take action in the International Court of Justice, has not succeeded so far and so that is a case that would have to be argued. A third consideration is that, even if we were successful after a decade or so in the International Court of Justice, it would be open to Japan to circumvent the impact of the courtâs decision by simply withdrawing from the International Whaling Commission. It is better that Japan remain in the International Whaling Commission, where its whaling activities can be supervised and regulated. We would not want to overreact by dealing with this issue in such a way that it might be to the benefit of a decent headline one day but in fact be entirely counterproductive the next. That is the sort of issue that not just the government but the parliament needs to think through very carefully.</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for Paterson for his question. The Australian Bureau of Statistics today released information on sales of new motor vehicles for May. That showed that sales were down by 1.2 per cent on the previous month. One would not want to overstate this, because 2003 was a record year, 2004 was a record year and 2005 is in excess of 2004, but the fact that sales are increasing at a slower rate compared to 2004 does show that consumer demand may well be slowing a little, as I have indicated through other data.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Also, the skilled vacancies index was released today, which showed that skilled vacancies fell by 0.5 per cent in the June quarter and are 3.2 per cent lower over the year. That is consistent with the budget forecast showing a moderating domestic demand and employment growth slowing to 1Â¾ per cent in 2005-06. That is slower than in previous years but it would be sufficient to maintain the unemployment rate at around 5 per cent, which is at a 29-year low.</para>
<para>The partial data released today, I believe, is consistent with other data such as we have had from the housing sector, which indicates a slowing in consumption in the domestic economy. We have had very large price rises in relation to exports, and a rebalancing of growth from domestic to external sources would certainly be welcome. This moderation of consumption may well be consistent with households rebuilding their balance sheets. Again, that would be a welcome development for the economy.</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his question. I can inform the House that the good news is that all Australian income tax payers will receive a tax cut in nine days time on 1 July. The legislation to enact those tax cuts, unfortunately, has been blocked in the Senate by the Australian Labor Party, but schedules, which take effect and can be relied upon, have not been disallowed by motion in either house. They have now been in this House for 11 days and in the Senate for six days. There is only one more day of sitting for anyone to move a disallowance motion. Provided that no-one moves a disallowance motion tomorrow, those schedules will go ahead and every Australian will receive a tax cut on 1 July 2005.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Laborâs campaign to stop taxes being cut on 1 July 2005 has failed. The good news is that the public recognises that Laborâs campaign against income tax cuts was a misguided campaign. A large proportion of the Australian Labor Party also now recognise that the decision by their so-called brains trust to oppose the income tax cuts in the budget was misguidedâand the poor Leader of the Opposition is living with that. But, as I constantly say to the House, do not hold him solely responsible; he was advised by the member for Lilley, the member for Swan and Senator Conroyâthe three wise roosters.</para>
<para>This morning the member for Lilley was asked about the tax schedules. I will read the question and the answer, because I think the question is a bit of a corker. The journalist that approached the member for Lilley asked this questionâand I ask the House to listen to it: âWayne, are the roosters worried that Kim Beazley isnât coming through?â Answer: âNo, weâre not worried at all.â The good news is that the roosters are not worried. The line from rooster central is that there is no need to panic. Everything is going according to plan. There is a cunning strategy and all will shortly be revealed. Let the backbench of the Labor Party know that this particular strategy is under controlâunder rooster control. Situation normal at rooster command.</para>
<para>We on this side of the House believe that taxes should be cut because, if you can fund your services, if you can balance your budget and if you can reduce your debt, income taxes should be as low as possible for the Australian public. We have a plan to cut income tax rates at the lowest marginal rate and to increase thresholds at the top rate. After these schedules go through and after the legislation goes through in August, only three per cent of Australians will be bothered by the top marginal tax rate. That will put incentive back in the Australian taxation system and encourage growth and the continuation of a strong economy in this country.</para>

The reality is that Australians have enjoyed a 14 per cent increase in real wages because of the industrial relations changes that this government put in placeâthings which the member for Perth, amongst other colleagues on the other side, said would bring about the end of industrial relations as we know it. What he said in 1996 was wrong; what he is saying now will also be wrong.</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for his question. I am delighted to be able to report to the House that there is very clear evidence that the governmentâs aviation policies are working. There is strong growth in both the domestic aviation sector and the international aviation market. The combined domestic and regional aviation industry is operating now at record high levels, with almost 38 million passengers carried during the year ended December 2004. That was an increase of 14 per cent on the previous year. At the same time, passenger traffic on Australian international flights has also grown very strongly.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Over the 12 months to December 2004, we saw a record high of 1.93 million passengers internationallyâan increase of nearly 10 per cent on December 2003. International activity reached a record high of 10,000 flights in December 2004, which was 16 per cent higher than December 2003 and 48.4 per cent higher than the low recorded in June 2003 when activity was negatively impacted by SARS.</para>
<para>The figures are very buoyant and very encouraging. They come off the back of the sharp downturn of two or three years ago, which no-one could have foreseen; but, nonetheless, they are remarkable figures. It is worth bearing in mindâand we must never forget itâthat the aviation industry operates in a very volatile climate. It is particularly susceptible to sudden shocks. Unfortunately, the international aviation industry is highly corrupted with many airlines enjoying not only natural geographic advantages over usâthat is all strength to their right armâbut also the protection of government ownership and support, which we no longer supply and should no longer supply in Australia.</para>
<para>I make the point that, while the airlines themselves have to do everything they can to be internationally competitiveâand we encourage them in thatâthere is also a vital need for international reform. There are too many airlines internationally because there are too many governments that prevent sensible rationalisationâa point well made by Rod Eddington recently. He is a well-known and respected Australian who headed up BA for a long time. Unfortunately, our carriers still face unreasonable restrictions on access to other countries. For example, in my view there are still unrealistic and unfair limitations on our access to the important UK market.</para>
<para>On the domestic front, it is worth making the point that there are those opposite who would still want to saddle the aviation industry in Australia with the cost of a white elephantânamely, a second airport in Sydney.</para>

<para>âA lot of policy thought has gone into this by those opposite. You can tell that. They are all over the place. There is a certain sense of aircraft drift here, aviation drift. What has happened is that there has been a rapid move to having fewer aircraft carrying more peopleâmore rapid than anyone might reasonably have foreseen. Indeed, it is worth making the point that the Sydney airport master plan, approved last year, indicated that the airport would be able to cope with Sydneyâs air traffic needs for at least 20 years. I think that is a very good outcome indeed. Accordingly, I say to the House that the government has formed the view that a second Sydney airport will not be needed in the foreseeable future and, consequently, the government has no plans to impose a white elephant on the aviation industry in Australia.</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for what could be described as a fairly predictable question. The Nationals are completely opposed to compulsory unionism, particularly where those funds are used to support political campaigns and activities. I was at the University of Sydney in 1975 and I remember very well those front lawn activities. You do not forget them, Mr Speaker, so we are pursuing a policy that has long been supported by the party that I have the privilege of leading. If people want to voluntarily join a union, that is entirely their choice. But the changes contained in this legislation will finally offer university students across the country the choice that I think they want and they need.

<para>âI thank the member for Fisher for his question. I can indicate to him and the House that the governmentâs workplace reforms will protect minimum wages, they will protect collective bargaining and, indeed, they will protect the right of individuals to join unions. It is against this background that we see this continuing misleading campaign from the unions and the ACTU. Just recently they have been joined by some ALP MPsânamely, the member for Canberra; Senator Lundy, the Labor senator for the ACT; and the member for Fraserâwho have sent out a letter to residents in the ACT, including a copy of an ACTU brochure which contains a number of misleading and deceptive statements. It appears now that the ACTUâs campaign has been extended to using the postal allowance of ALP members to send out this misleading union campaign material.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Like other misleading statements that have been made by the unions, this brochure contains further deceptive material. For example, this brochure asserts that minimum wages will be reduced. That is just wrong. It asserts that unions will not be able to access the workplace. Again, this is just wrong. It says the changes that the government proposes will reduce the capacity for collective bargaining. Again, that is simply wrong. So what we now have is ALP members being the mail-out boys and girls for the ACTU scare campaign. It would seem that, in return for the $47 million which the unions have donated to the Australian Labor Party, what they have bought for themselves is a junk mail delivery service, as this letter from the member for Canberra and the member for Fraser indicates.</para>
<para>We have had an increasingly desperate campaign from the ACTU as the days have gone on. Yesterday, the Secretary of the ACTU, Greg Combet, said that this government proposed to abolish federal awards. That is what he saidâwe would get rid of federal awards. That is absolutely wrong. It was made clear in the statement which the Prime Minister made to this parliament, it has been made clear in numerous other statements and it has been made clear in all the material which has been sent out that this government proposes to retain federal awards, yet we have this increasingly desperate campaign from the ACTU and Greg Combet, just saying things which are simply misleading and deceptiveâa desperate campaign from a desperate union movement.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Hinkler for his question. As he knows, as members of this House know, and as the Prime Minister and the state Labor premiers all recently agreed, Australia has a good health system. One of the reasons we have a good health system is that the Howard government does not just talk about Medicare; we invest the real money needed to make a good system better.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I can say to the member for Hinkler that we have heeded his message about medical services in the bush. We have listened to people like the member for Hinkler and we are delivering. Under the policies of the Howard government, some 2,000 long-serving country doctors are receiving bonus payments of up to $25,000 a year to keep practising in country areas. We have put nurses into 1,100 rural practices and we have got 600 allied health professionals working with country GPs. There are now 11 rural clinical schools, including an excellent rural clinical school run by the University of Queensland in the town of Bundaberg in the electorate of Hinkler. There are 10 university departments of rural health. Twenty five per cent of medical students are required to do at least 50 per cent of their clinical training in country areas, because the more you train them in the bush the more likely they are to stay and practise in the country. Since 2001 there have been 346 additional medical student places at our universities, every single one of them bonded to country practice or practice in areas of work force shortage. Since 2000 there have been three new medical schools in the great state of Queensland, with 150-plus publicly funded places.</para>
<para>Can I make it very clear to the member for Hinkler and everyone else in this House: Medicare matters. Medicare matters to the Howard government, and since the election I have answered 37 questions about Medicare from coalition members. I just had my fifth from the member for Lalor. I ask this question: what has the member for Lalor done to upset the Leader of the Opposition so much? What has she done? Let us face it: she is not the only one who leaks out of shadow cabinet. That is what you get from a bunch of dills: leaks out of shadow cabinet. Or it may be that the Leader of the Opposition has got the message that the member for Lalor has not gotâthat the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had.</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for Makin for her question. I appreciate all the work she does and her interest in the way that our support for Indonesia and other countries in response to the tsunami is unfolding. This Sunday marks exactly six months since the tsunami tragedy, and it does provide an opportunity to outline both the timeliness and the effectiveness of the governmentâs response. The government has now spent over $75 million on relief and rehabilitation assistance to help people rebuild their lives as a result of the tsunami. In Indonesia, over $40 million has been spent on projects in Aceh and North Sumatra. Over 1,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid to Aceh has been delivered, medical services are being assisted in their re-establishment, essential pharmaceutical supplies have been given, schools have been re-equipped and essential infrastructure, including water and sanitation, has been repaired. And we provided over 100 Australian medical staff to assist.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As the emergency assistance phase draws to an end, as it obviously isâand we provided initially $60 million for that, all of which has been spentâand people return to their homes, we are beginning the task of assisting them to meet their longer term needs. In addition to what I have already described, the House well knows that the government has committed a billion dollars to the five-year Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development program, and progress on this is already pretty strong. Over $175 million worth of activities has already been agreed, including the $50 million Aceh rehabilitation program. We are helping, for example, with the rehabilitation of the Banda Aceh hospital; we are training doctors and nurses to take the places of some who were killed as a result of the tsunami.</para>
<para>In conclusion, there has been some suggestion in one of the newspapers today, the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>, that this program was not unfolding. It is and it is unfolding at a good and effective pace. It would be folly indeed if we tried to spend all of the money at once. That does not just apply to the government but also to the non-government organisations which have raised over $300 million. They have spent about 20 per cent of that, but it needs to be spent over a period of time, not spent all at once. This program by both the government and the non-government organisations is progressing very successfully. I think all Australians will be pleased to hear that, because all Australians have supported the response by both the government and the non-government organisations to the tsunami.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Dobell for his question. He is working hard to get those toilets fixed at the Tuggerawong Public School in his electorate. As I informed the House last week, the government, before handing over $33 billion of taxpayersâ hard earned money for schooling over the next four years, has for the very first time put conditions on the funding. The states, before they receive that money, will be required to agree to a number of things, which include that by 2010 there will finally be a common starting age for schooling in Australia. We will from next year have not only testing of our children in years 3, 5, 7 and 9 in literacy and numeracy but reporting to parents. Principals will have a say over who actually teaches in the school. The performance of the school must be published at the school level. In other words, parents have a right to know how many students are passing literacy and numeracy in years 3, 5 and 7. They have a right to know the qualifications of the teachers, the participation of teachers in their ongoing professional learning and how much money governments spend on the support of teachers at the school level.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>One of the other requirements is career leaver destinations: how many kids got apprenticeships, how many went to TAFE, how many got a job and how many went to uni. That information needs to be published. Another requirement, which is long past due, is that of plain language reports to parents. As parents, we are sick and tired of getting politically correct language neutered reports at home about our kids. If you are told that your child is almost achieving, what does that mean? If you are told that your child is consolidating or performing sometimes or not yet performing, what does that mean? We have only one state government left to sign this agreement, and that is the Victorian government. The Victorian government has eight days to sign up before it will lose more than $1 billion in funding for schools.</para>
<para>The plain English report cards will describe student performance as A, B, C, D or E. As parents, we know what A, B, C, D and E mean. They will also be required to tell parents which quartile, which 25 per cent, of the class their child falls in. So, taking the typical Australian primary school report which has gone to the states, for example looking at mathematics, the student will be graded A to E. So, for example, with a D in mathematics, Mr Speaker, you would know exactly what that meant if your child came home with that or was in the bottom 25 per cent. Then the teacher is required to explain in plain language what it means. So the grades are from A to E and then the parents must be told in which quartile of the class their child falls. If your child is in the bottom 25 per centâsomebody has to be thereâyou would want to know about it. For example, the report might say: âWayne is trying hard in maths and attempting his homework. However, he is not doing as well as last year and I would like to discuss further work he could do at home. Please contact me.â This is what parents are going to get over the next 12 months. Plain language reporting is a condition of funding, and I table an example of a plain language report.</para>

Isnât it a fact that, when interviewed on radio on 25 January this year, in answer to a question about whether the prices of branded medicines would go up for patients as a result of the Howard governmentâs 12.5 per cent price cut policy, the minister said:</para>

<para>âI make two points. First of all, I say to the member for Holt that any patient whose doctor believes that a particular drug is clinically necessary can, by way of an approach to the HIC and an authorisation from the HIC, ensure that that patient gets the drug at the standard copayment. That is the first point I make. The second point I make is that we the government stand by our policy of a 12Â½ per cent mandatory price cut for new generic drugs coming onto the PBS. This is a good policy.</para>

Would the minister update the House on recent developments with the governmentâs increased assistance to Australiaâs drought ravaged farmers.</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for Hume for his question. He represents some of the worst drought affected farmers in New South Wales and he has been a strong advocate, providing timely and effective assistance to the farmers in his region. The member for Hume will welcome the good news that yesterday the <inline ref="R2404">Farm Household Support Amendment (Exceptional Circumstances Relief Payment) Bill 2005</inline> passed through the Senate. That means that all of the elements of the governmentâs enhanced drought assistance package can now be implemented on time and in full. The legislation means that there will now be a $10,000 concession on off-farm income in assessing the eligibility of farmers in drought stricken areas for the exceptional circumstances relief payment. That will mean that a lot more farmers will be eligible to receive this essential help for them and their families.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Other parts of the package include the more generous EC interest rate subsidiesâup to 80 per cent in second and subsequent years of a droughtâand the easier off-farm assets test associated with those benefits. Additional counselling and support services are being put in place. The new drought Envirofund round will be called very soon. And yesterday the Prime Minister and I were happy to ceremonially hand over a cheque for $3 million to the CWA so that they are able to commence their role in providing additional assistance to farmers and their families who are especially in need. Last week I provided to the state rural adjustment authorities revised guidelines for the implementation of the interest rate subsidies, which again will mean that more assistance will be available and that it will be provided under more generous terms than has been the case in the past.</para>
<para>These benefits will certainly be encouraging to farmers facing the difficulties of drought. There is no doubt at all that the Howard-Anderson government has been the best friend that drought affected farmers have ever had. I guess there is only one thing better that we could deliver, and that is rain right across the nation. We have made a reasonable start on that, although I know we had a bit of assistance from above. There is one thing better than drought assistance that farmers can get, and that of course is rain across the country. I am encouraged by recent falls but, as the honourable member for Hume knows, there is going to have to be a continuation of this improved weather for some time before the drought is broken. In the interim, this government will stand beside farmers so that they are able to take advantage of better circumstances when they come.</para>

Minister, isnât it a fact that the expensive new drugs used to treat osteoporosisâdrugs which cost the PBS $130 million a yearâare effective only if taken together with calcium tablets, which have now been removed from the PBS to save about $9 million a year? Isnât it also a fact that some patients with kidney problems may need to take as many as 10 calcium tablets a day, at a cost of over $30 a month? Given these facts, why did the government take calcium tablets off the PBS, particularly without getting any advice from the experts, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee?</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Blair for his question and his interest in superannuation and the workers of Australia. On 1 July this year, in just nine days time, some five million Australian workers, for the very first time, will get the choice of determining where their investment, their superannuation, is to be invested. This is something that the coalition has been fighting for since 25 May 1995, when it was first announced as coalition policy. In November that year, the then shadow Treasurer, now the Treasurer, told the ASFA conference exactly what the coalition intended to do with choice and how we were going to empower Australian workers. We took it to the Australian public in 1996 and won an overwhelming mandate. Here we are, nine years later, with nine days to go before finally Australian workers will be able to choose where their money is invested. It certainly has been a marathon.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>To people listening, to the Australian workers out there, it must seem incredible to believe that the Labor Party is still seeking to obstruct the introduction of super choice. There is just one sitting day left in the Senate and the Labor Party is yet to support the government in passing the final superannuation choice legislation. That is creating confusion for small business and unnecessary uncertainty just because the Labor Party refuses to make a decision.</para>
<para>People need to understand what it is that we are trying to achieve. For nine years the coalition have been fighting to give workers the right to be able to choose where their money is investedânot so some union through a union backed award agreement decides where your money goes, not so an employer decides where you should put your money, but so you as the worker who has earned that money decides where it goes. If an employee moves jobs they are required to set up another fund in many cases and have another set of fees. The Labor Party seems to think that is all right in 2005. That is the status quo that the Labor Party wants to maintain.</para>

<para>âI hear the member for Jagajaga interject. In the same way, the member for Watson yesterday tried to tell the House that employers would face jail terms. I would like to tell the member for Brand, who is a Western Australian memberâit may come as some surprise to himâthat Western Australian employees have had the right to choose where they put their superannuation investments since 1998. I did not see at the last state election the Labor Party in Western Australia trying to remove that right. In fact, the very charge that was levelled in this place yesterday was that employers would go to jail. How many people have gone to jail? How many people have ASIC thrown the book at in Western Australia, where they have had the right of choice since 1998? One hundred? Ten? Zero. It is another lousy scare campaign and last-ditch attempt by the Labor Party to try to roll back choice. It is not going to happen.</para>

<para>âIt has been reported that there was a security breach in an Arizona based credit card transaction processing company. The vast majority of cards vulnerable to the breach are held by US customers. Of the MasterCards affected it is thought that less than two per cent were issued by banks in the Australia-Pacific region. The following information comes from Visa. Visa has informed the Treasury that it was the National Australia Bank that uncovered this fraud out of all the domestic and international banks of the world and reported it to MasterCard and Visa in September 2004. The FBI was notified and commenced an extensive investigation and on 1 June 2005 declared it a crime scene. During this investigation organisations were told by the FBI not to say anything publicly and the FBI only allowed public comment on Thursday or Friday of last week.

<para>âI was asked a question by the member for Perth about some negotiations between the department of finance, as it is, and Comcar over their collective arrangements. I am advised that the department of finance met with the two relevant unions, the TWU and the CPSU, on 2 June to discuss negotiations of a section LJ collective agreementâthat is, one with the unionsâand that in the course of those discussions the department of finance gave the unions a list of 10 possible productivity measures that could offset any pay increases that the unions may seek in the negotiations. It is therefore wrong to assert that we were stripping entitlements. The 10 proposals, I am advised, are purely options for the unions to consider and are completely dependent on the size of any wage increase sought by the employees. It is open to the unions, as is usual, to accept or reject some or none or all of the optionsâthey are not final. Indeed, the department of finance has sought for three weeks to arrange a meeting with the unions to get a response to the proposals made at the earlier meeting, on 2 June, and the unions only agreed yesterday to meet on 28 June. This is a beat-up by the Labor Party to portray negotiations as though they were outcomes and to scaremonger about productivity improvements in the absence of referring to any offsetting pay increases.</para>

<para>âThat was a very wise selection indeed, Mr Speaker; thank you very much. There is a brand of politics that causes more disgust towards politicians and governments than any other. Many people in this parliament were fans of the American television show <inline font-style="italic">The</inline> <inline font-style="italic">West</inline> <inline font-style="italic">Wing</inline> in which the press secretaries would gather on a Friday afternoon and talk about âputting out the trashâ. What they meant by âputting out the trashâ was that they would put out the bad stories on Friday nightâput them out deliberately too late for Saturdayâs newspapers but by Sundayâs newspapers they were too old. That was how they would clear out the stories they did not want anybody to know about. It is clever, it is tricky and it is that brand of politics that causes the community to reel back in horror. Unfortunately, it is a brand of politics in which the Minister for Health and Ageing fundamentally believes, because it is that kind of trickiness that has actually characterised his interaction with the public across the sweep of his public life.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This is the minister who in 1998 denied any involvement in the Australians for Honest Politics slush fund, only to be caught out spectacularly on TV on 27 August 2003 on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30</inline> <inline font-style="italic">Report</inline>. This is the minister who got caught out so amazingly on <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> denying and then confessing in the one interview that he had met with Cardinal George Pell. This is the minister who went out and gave the community a rock solid, ironclad guarantee before the election, with every ounce of his credibility and every fibre of his being in that guaranteeâwith his word, his honour and his integrity on the line in that rock solid, ironclad guaranteeâonly to smash it immediately after the election. This is the minister who practises that sort of mean, tricky politics by doing things like putting out the private health insurance premium increase notifications on the same day that interest rates go up, hoping against hope that one storyâthe big interest rates storyâwould come over the top and exclude from the public glare the story about the mismanagement by the Howard government of private health insurance premium increases.</para>
<para>Last Wednesday we saw the minister back at it again when at 6.30 that nightâwhen, as Leader of the House, he would have known that Douglas Wood had been released and that all of the nation was going to be rejoicing that Douglas Wood had been released and was going to be returned home safeâthere was the minister sneaking out under the radar, hoping no-one would notice the fact that he is turning our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme into a two-tiered system. There is a reason I started with an allusion to <inline font-style="italic">The</inline> <inline font-style="italic">West</inline> <inline font-style="italic">Wing</inline>. I did so because this is the Americanisation of our health systemâthe creation of a two-tiered system for pharmaceuticals. Perhaps the Australian community would forgive Minister Abbott his meanness, his trickiness, his bit of manipulation here and slipping out of a press release there and his not-quite-frank statement on TVâmaybe they would forgive him those thingsâif they thought he was competently running our health system.</para>
<para>In fact, Minister Abbott is either nowhere near our health system or near those bits that are a complete shambles. Let us look across the sweep of the Howard government. Who is looking after the biggest issue when it comes to the health sectorâs medical work force? The Treasurer isâthat is who is looking after that. Who is looking after reviewing the PBS? The Treasurer is, and, when the minister for health was asked, he did not even know about the review. Take a huge issue like mental health. Who is looking after that? The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, who is leaving the chamber now. Take something as important to the future of medical science as the stem cell review. Who is looking after that? The Minister for Ageing is. Then of course there is the question of the sale of Australiaâs biggest private health insurer, Medibank Privateâgovernment owned at the momentâthat most Australians rely on for their private health insurance products. Who is looking after the sale of that? Senator Nick Minchin, as Minister for Finance and Administration, is. And when asked about the scoping study for the sale of Medibank Private, the minister for health did not even know anything about it. So all of these enormous health issues are being dealt with elsewhere in the Howard government.</para>
<para>One might imagine that his closest colleagues know something about his competence that they do not let the rest of the Australian community into. When you look at the things that the minister for health is actually managing, you see they are a shambles all round. I am going to go out and buy a Tattslotto ticket on the strength of the fact that I put in this MPI before the most recent shambles in health even emerged in the public domain. But it has emerged today with the Pharmacy Guild basically putting up their hands and saying: âWe want to deliver medicines at a reasonable price to Australian consumers. We would like the Prime Minister to honour his word, the word he gave us when he wrote to us on his letterheadââa prime ministerial letter on prime ministerial letterhead, and John Howardâs signature down the bottom, which is something you would think would actually count a little bit. âWe would like the Prime Minister to honour his word to pharmacists. We are trying to negotiate a new five-year agreement with the minister for health and we just canât do it because the minister for health cannot competently conclude these negotiations.â That is the most recent shambles in health, which emerged today in between me putting in this topic for the matters of public importance debate and the debate actually coming on before the parliament. The pharmacy agreementâa five-year agreement about the delivery of pharmaceutical products and medicines across Australia at reasonable pricesâis expiring on 30 June. And this minister, who knew that it was expiring on 30 Juneâbecause everybody knew that was the end dateâand who has had every day since he first became minister for health on 29 September 2003 to competently conclude a new agreement with the pharmacists, has been unable to do so, jeopardising Australiansâ access to pharmaceutical products after 30 June this year. Everything he has ever touched in health has become a shambles.</para>
<para>But the very particular matters I questioned the minister about today show that the very thing he slipped out last Wednesday, hoping no-one would noticeâthis new two-tiered structure for the PBSâis, as of today, in a shambles too. Let us talk about this in some level of detail. What has happened here is that in the federal election campaign, after the Prime Minister had gone out on the Sunday, done his campaign launch speech and spent billions and billions of dollars with not one dollar specifically directed at older Australians, by the Monday and Tuesday in the second to last week of the campaign the headlines and the newscasts were all saying that there was an adverse community reaction to Prime Minister Howardâs free-spending policy announcement speech. On the Wednesday we had the Labor launch and it contained a very big policy for older AustraliansâMedicare Gold. By the Friday the Howard government, which had obviously wanted to coast through the election campaign not saying a word about older Australians because they were taking their votes for granted, thought they had better respond. But they knew they had spent too much money. What were they going to do faced with this conundrum: they needed a policy for older Australians but had spent too much money? âOh,â they go, âwe need a savings measure. Where are we going to get a savings measure from across the whole sweep of government? Where are we going to make a cut when we are desperate? I knowâthe Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.â</para>
<para>They had a small problem: they had spent two years corresponding with Labor denying savings could be made on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Schemeâdenying such savings were possible. But let me tell you: while they bleat about the Charter of Budget Honesty process as it applies to the opposition, they never apply anything that sounds like the same discipline to themselvesânever once, not ever. So, with complete disregard of anything like transparency in fiscal policy, in a quick 48-hour cycle, they cobbled together a cut on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It is very important to remember that the money generated from this cut was not going to go to PBS sustainability; it was not even going to go to the Health portfolio. It was going out of Health to other portfolios to fund an older Australians policy that they cobbled together at the last minute. The Department of Health and Ageing has admitted at Senate estimates that it had nothing to do with the costing of this savings measure. Why should that surprise us?</para>

<para>âIf it was a responsible measure, you would have been working on it before the caretaker period, my friend. Putting that to one side, why should it surprise us that the Minister for Health and Ageing did not know anything about this savings measure? It would not surprise us at all because, on his own admission, at a press conference he said he is ânot very good with figuresâ. For a minister with a multibillion dollar spending portfolio, his depth of knowledge about expenditure in health is limited to the statement, âPeter will provide; he always doesââa reference to the Treasurer. The ministerâs intellectual hold on the financing of the single biggest expenditure area of the Commonwealth governmentâhis complete encapsulation of this challenge for modern Western democracies where inflation and balancing the health account keep public policy specialists and academics fully engagedâis âPeter will provide; he always does.â The problem is that Peter has a tendency to provide six months before an election and a very startling tendency to cut back six months afterwards.

<para>âIt is a direct quote as to how the Minister for Health and Ageing refers to the Treasurer. The Treasurer is known to refer to me by unusual titles, but I will respect your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker. The problem for the Minister for Health and Ageing is that the Treasurer provides in the run-up to elections, but he does not provide afterwards. The Treasurer could have salvaged this ministerâs future and credibility and allowed him to keep his rock solid, ironclad guarantee to the Australian public for an expenditure of $200 millionâthe difference between the Charter of Budget Honesty figure of $1.3 billion and the $1.5 billion the Treasurer said he had to cut back. He decided not to do that. Peter does not always provide, does he?</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Let us come to the details of the savings measure this government cobbled together during the election campaign and the consequence it has had. The government want to cut the price of generics by 12Â½ per cent. That is not a bad thing, but because it is badly designed policy it has a lot of knock-on consequences for newly listed, innovative drugs. The minister has no hold on the interconnection between these two things. He wanders around saying, âIt all doesnât matter because I know my policy has caused four drug companiesâand four drugsâto say that they will not accept the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme listed price. I know that means that patients will have to pay a special contribution, but it does not matter because there are chemically equivalent drugs available on the PBS.â Wrong, Minister: there is no chemically equivalent drug to eclipta, which is taken for lung cancer; there is no chemically equivalent drug to keppra, which is taken for epilepsy. Doctors say you cannot substitute.</para>
<para>The Minister for Health and Ageing comes into this place and says, âIf you canât substitute, then you can have it at the PBS price.â My question to you, Minister, is: what is this special patient contribution which you announced ever going to do for these two drugs? If there is no chemical substitute, if every patient who is taking that drug needs only that drug and you say they do not have to pay the special patient contribution, that means that no-one will ever pay the special patient contribution, but you cannot have it both ways. You should get up to the dispatch box and say that you announced a mythical policy last Wednesday and that no-one will ever pay the special patient contribution, or you should say that in truth you know some people who need that drug and will pay the special patient contribution despite all of your words of comfort and guarantees.</para>
<para>There are only two possibilities, there is no third choice: patients are going to end up paying that special patient contribution, even though it is the only drug they can take, or your special patient contribution is a myth and you can guarantee that no-one will ever have to pay it. But I know what is going to happen: people with lung cancer who cannot take any other medication will have to pay $500 out of their pocket. That is a disgrace equal to where we started this session with you breaking your rock solid ironclad guarantee. It is an absolute disgrace. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThe Leader of the Opposition either does not think that health is very important or, more likely, he does not like his shadow health minister and does not trust her competence to deliver a substantial message. I was quite interested to hear on Sky News on Monday, 13 June the opposition signalling that it wants to shift the focus to health and land some blows on Minister Tony Abbott. I was quivering with fear and apprehension! I was so nervous I could hardly eat my cornflakes on Tuesday morning! I had to wait all this time to have three or four questions, which are all essentially the same, to which there is a clear answer.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Since the member for Lalor made her announcement on Sky News, we have had four press releases and four doorstops but, until today, not a single question on health. We constantly get from the member for Lalor a string of hysterical press releases and a succession of shrill doorstops saying that the sky is falling in and we will all be destroyed because of the evil of the Howard government. Obviously I do not believe her, because I am presiding over the health system. The Australian public do not believe her. According to Newspoll, more and more Australians believe that the Howard government is best placed to handle the issues of health and Medicare.</para>
<para>The Leader of the Opposition does not believe the member for Lalor. If he did, he would give her more questions in question time. When the Leader of the Opposition took office, he was asked:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Have you given thought to how Labor will change its approach, will need to change its approach to meet that challenge in the Reps?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Leader of the Opposition replied:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Yes, I have and totally new significance will come around our tactics committee in the House of Representatives and the role that Julia Gillard plays â¦</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">A lot of new significance has come in: she now has almost no role! Under the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Lalor would do a doorstop every day and then ask a question in the House of Representatives. Under the current Leader of the Opposition, she does the doorstop every dayâthe same shrill, hysterical attacks on the Howard governmentâbut almost never asks a question. It is not just that I do not believe her, it is not just that the Australian public does not believe her and it is not just that her own leader does not believe her; it is that the premiers do not believe her. If the health system were as chronically mismanaged as the member for Lalor keeps telling us, why is it that the premiers and the Prime Minister said in the communique that came out of COAG last week that Australia has one of the worldâs best health systems? How can it be one of the worldâs best health systems if, in the words of the member for Lalor, it is suffering from âongoing mismanagementâ? The member for Lalor is on her own. She is isolated among her colleagues, unpopular with the Leader of the Opposition and scorned by the premierâthose successful and responsible Labor politicians. She is on her own.</para>
<para>Let me take a few moments of the Houseâs time to talk about some of the precise issues that the member for Lalor has raised. She says that I denied involvement in the Australians for Honest Politics Trust. I ask: what has that got to do with health? I have never denied involvement in the Australians for Honest Politics Trust. For the record, let me say that I have never denied that. If the member for Lalor is going to come into this House and make statements, as a former partner in a law firm she should at least get it right, tell the truth. I think she is suffering from TDDâtruth deficit disorder! The next statement she made was that I denied a meeting with Cardinal Pell.</para>

<para>âI am sure you will, Mr Deputy Speaker. The member for Lalor said we had denied that savings were possible in the PBS. That is not true. We said that savings could not be included in the forward estimates if they were merely speculative or hypothetical; in order to be included in the forward estimates they had to be the result of a change in government policy. When she finally dropped the personal abuse and the litany of untruths and tried to talk about health, she came up with two criticisms. The first criticism was that the 12Â½ per cent mandatory price cut policy means that patients will allegedly have to pay hundreds of dollars more for necessary drugs. I have already said this several times in the House today, but let me say it again for âMadam Slow Learnerâ: if it is clinically necessary in the opinion of the treating doctor that a patient should get a particular drug, all the doctor needs to do is seek an authorisation from the Health Insurance Commission and that drug will be available to that person at the standard copayment. Please, let us not hear any more of this furphy, this scare tactic. Let us have the member for Lalor tell the truth for once and properly describe the policy of the government as I have repeatedly explained it today.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Her next statement about health was that negotiations with the Pharmacy Guild were not going particularly well. Has the member for Lalor ever had negotiations with the Pharmacy Guild? What is the proposal of the member for Lalor? How does the member for Lalor imagine that we are going to get savings out of the PBS through the use of generics? How does the member for Lalor imagine that we are going to get savings out of the PBS through more effective management of the supply and distribution chain? It behoves responsible politicians not just to come in here like Chicken Little and cry day in, day out that the sky is falling in but to come up with some policies of their own.</para>
<para>The current Australian Labor Party has two policies. The first policy is Medicare Gold. That policy was described by Michael Costello, the former Chief of Staff to the Leader of the Opposition, as a strategic disaster. It was described by Peter Botsman, a genuine Labor intellectualâ</para>

It was described by former President of the Australian Labor Party, former respected member of this House and former minister in the Hawke government, Barry Jones, as a turkey. This is policy No. 1: Medicare Goldâa strategic disaster, a turkey with the body of a wombat and the head of a donkey. What a monster! But it is the conception of the member for Lalor.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The other policy of the member for Lalor is to totally abolish the Howard governmentâs Medicare safety net. The member for Lalor comes into this House regularlyâwhen she is allowed. It is not normally in prime time, but it is in the adjournment and grievance debates and in debates on second reading speeches. She comes in and talks about how terrible it is that the thresholds of the Medicare safety net have been adjusted by the Howard government to what we originally proposed. This terrible crime is that we now have the same safety net thresholds that we originally proposed in November 2003.</para>
<para>With all these buckets of crocodile tears, the gallons of indignation and the self-righteousness dripping out of every pore, what would she do to the threshold? She would abolish it altogether. There would be no safety net. There would be 1.6 million Australians who would totally miss out on the additional help from Medicare that they need and deserve, and $1.1 billion would be ripped out of the Medicare budget because these people are Medicare vandals. That is what members opposite are. That is what they would do if they got the chance.</para>
<para>I really do invite interested members of the general public who do take health seriously, who might be following the discussion here this afternoon and who want to figure out who is serious about health, to look at the work of the Howard government: look at the $11 billion more that we have invested since October 2003 in the forward estimates for the Health and Ageing Portfolio; look at the fact that we have got bulk-billing rates up from 66 per cent to 73 per cent; look at the fact that bulk-billing rates for kids are now at an all-time high; and look at the fact that we have settled down the crisis that was enveloping our public hospital system. Compare that with the web site of the Australian Labor Party. These people, who think that health is so important, have devoted just 323 words to health. It is pathetic. It is a disgrace. It is a comment on the fact that the member for Lalor has no standing with her own leader, no standing with her own party and increasingly less standing with the general public that she is forced to come into this House and make the kind of shrill, hysterical and false attacks that we have seen today.</para>

<para>âOn reflecting on that very passionate contribution by my friend the Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott, I was very concerned that he was talking about messages of hate, messages not benefiting his career. What I would like to do in light of the blow that he suffered at the hands of the Treasurer, the mentor of the member for Casey, that savage blow trying to destroy his good career, is give him some advice in the spirit of love and friendship with respect to where he is going wrong with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the changes that he has proposed. Please read the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, Minister, because I am concerned about your career.

<para>âsneaky, mean and tricky press releases put out in the timing of them. Few would match this press release put out just after 6.30 pm, when the nation was rejoicing, under the cover of darkness. I think the minister has got a good career in the SAS after this, quite frankly. He has done an extraordinary thing under the cover of darkness that would make the SAS proud.</para>

<para>This press release should be of great concern to the least advantaged in our community, who have borne the brunt of a lot of the Howard government reforms. It is a very innocuous press release, but it is the hole in the dyke. That is what it is and, contrary to what the minister for health has actually said, I think the shadow minister for health is making a very constructive suggestion. As we know, in a number of his public statements the minister for health was quite clear. When he was negotiating that 12.5 per cent cut in prices for generic medicines on the PBS, he said, âThere wonât be any more price rises.â Something happened on the road to Damascus, because very shortly after he said that he issued a very innocuous press release. I am trying to help the minister for health, so I will read some of his press release into the record:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Government is now in the process of implementing 12.5 per cent price cuts for 10 brands of PBS medicines where generic equivalents have applied for listing on August 1.</para>
<para class="block">Unfortunately, four companies have not agreed to accept lower prices. As a result four brands of medicines listed on the PBS will be subject to a Special Patient Contribution in addition to the normal PBS co-payment.</para>
<para class="block">For these medicines the difference between the existing price for the drug and the new benchmark price will become a Special Patient Contribution (SPC).</para>

<para>âI know that this government has taken âuser paysâ to a new level, but this is a very OrwellianâI thank the member for Rankin for saying it as it isâuse of language. This is the government that basically said that the Medicare safety net was going to be set at a level and it has increased. This is the government that tells people who have paid their taxes that they should be paying more to see their doctor. Now we have the government basically saying to people, âWe screwed the negotiations with the pharmaceutical companies and now we are going to screw you by passing this on.â It would be bad enough if these were well-off people or people who did not necessarily need these drugs, but try telling someone with mesothelioma that they need to pay $460 to get their medication. It is interestingâas I said, in my view this is a hole in the wall.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Let us look at some of the antipsychotic drugs, because one of the pharmaceutical companies that refused to accept that 12.5 per cent cut was a company that dealt in antipsychotic and antidepressant medication. The problem is that there are a number of new generation drugs coming on stream which are quite expensive. What will happen, for example, when you have someone with schizophrenia who requires risperidone, which costs $423.96 for 25 milligrams and $632 for 375 milligrams, and this patient needs to have an injection every two weeks? As they are about to receive the injection, will they be asked: âSorry, Iâve just got to check. Can you pay the difference before we administer this?â</para>
<para>This leads to my broader concern with respect to the health ministerâa concern that has been constructively raised by the shadow minister for health: there are very scant details about this policy and the mechanisms and process under which it will operate. No official figures have been released, such as how many people are going to have to access this. What about the number of people who are going to be affected and what is going to happen with the Health Insurance Commission? Very interestingly, who did the health minister consult with before he announced these changes through this press release? I am afraid I cannot find any record, and I have checked with the shadow minister for health about whether or not the health minister has consulted with the Australian Medical Association. If you had brought in a change with substantial ramifications for the future of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, wouldnât you consult with the AMA before you put out a press release? No consultation occurred. That tells me that there is something very rotten in the state of Denmark when it comes to this proposition.</para>
<para>In fact, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>, the new President of the AMA, Mukesh Haikerwal, said that the new measure was âa chink in the armour of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Schemeâ. The report stated that, according to Dr Haikerwal:</para>

<para>âAs the member for Casey would know, when we were lobbying for a Medicare officeâand my good friend the health minister did in fact come and open itâit took 10 years and a petition with 22,000 signatures to get it. This was the largest shopping centre in the Southern Hemisphere and it did not have a Medicare office. It took 10 years and 22,000 signatures. In Cranbourne, where the government has funded a new Medicare office, it took 10 years and 4,500 signatures. So the message is: you pay your taxes in the south-east but you basically have to get a sledgehammer for the government to deliver a service.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>What do these changes mean to the least well-off, to those with psychotic disorders, to those many Australians who rely on antidepressants and to those dying of lung cancer? The health minister has not made a statement in this placeâunless the shadow minister for health has not told me; I certainly have not heard anything. He has done this by stealth. He has slipped a substantial change into the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme under the door while the Prime Minister was addressing this House on a matter of national importance.</para>
<para>It is not just us who believe this. I have quoted the President of the AMA, Mukesh Haikerwal. There is a very appropriate headline to an article written about this by Annabel Stafford in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>. It sort of summarises the minister for healthâs approach to life. The headline is âThis is going to hurtâ. I think that is very appropriate. It is not just the opposition being critical. For the member for Caseyâs edification, I quote from the article:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Health experts ... have slammed the governmentâs plans to make patients pay for drugs on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, saying itâs a dismantling of the cheap medicines scheme by stealth.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Someone who I think would be of great importance to the minister for health is the Chief Executive Officer of Catholic Health Australia, Francis Sullivan. I would hope that the minister for health would take notice of him, given his very strong faith. Mr Sullivan said this about these changes:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We should make no mistake that these measures, along with the recent cuts to the PBS [safety net], indicate that the government is looking at every opportunity to shift costs to patients and this in turn erodes any benefit low-paid people receive from the tax relief.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So a good friend of the minister for health, the Chief Executive Officer of Catholic Health Australia, Francis Sullivan, has belled the catâthe health minister is not present in the chamberâso it is not just us who are belling the cat on this issue. This is a serious breach in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. When we tried to have a debate on this, it was gagged. I was here. I watched people such as the member for Casey vote against having a debate of substantial importance to this country. If the government want to continue to do this, that is fine; but they should not stand up in here time after time and just repeat the Crosby Textor pollingââWeâre the best friend of Medicareââbecause this minister is destroying Medicare by stealth. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âAfter listening to the contributions of those oppositeâthe member for Lalor and most recently the member for Holtâit is quite obvious that the motive behind, and the reason for, this matter of public importance is not a concern for health policy. This is not about health policy at all. Both of those members sketched out an elaborate conspiracy theory that reflects either their particular political outlook at the moment or a vivid imagination, or a combination of both.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>At the outset, I would like to address in some detail why the conspiracy theory, outlined so vividly by the member for Lalor, and to a lesser extent by the member for Holt, simply does not stack up. The motive for proposing this MPI is something entirely different. It is not about the concern of those opposite for health policy, as they would pretend. I will concede that the member for Lalor is far better at pretending that she believes in something passionately than is the member for Holt.</para>
<para>What this MPI is aboutâand the reason it has been proposed todayâhas nothing to do with health policy; rather, it is a desperate and irresponsible act by those on the other side to cover up policy and political calamity on issues far away from health. It is to cover up other issues that are quite obvious and which are not at all the subject of a conspiracy. But they do appear in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, where members opposite are being quoted on their views regarding the Labor Partyâs approach to so many other issues.</para>

Having a high regard for the member for Melbourne Ports means that I know him well. I know that he will always interject when he is sensitive about a subjectâalways. The member for Lalor outlined with vivid imagination her conspiracy theory based on an episode of <inline font-style="italic">The West Wing</inline>. The problem is that her conspiracy theory runs like this: last Thursday a press release went out at a terribly nasty time and, therefore, this was something of great concern to those opposite.</para>

Instead of putting forward an MPI on this matter yesterday, we had an MPI on small business, which was proposed by a shadow minister who is, I think, about 32nd in line. The shadow minister, who is 32nd in the Labor team, got precedence over the member for Lalor.

<para>âBecause the member for Lalor cares so deeply about this issue and has proposed an MPI, she would have come in here and asked the first question. But, no, we had 10 questions without the member for Lalor getting a guernsey, without her asking a question. Today, there were five questions on subjects that had nothing to do with this MPI. The first question from the Leader of the Opposition was on petrol. The second question from the member for Grayndler was on whales. The third question from the member for Hunter was on credit cards. The member for Perth asked the startling question about Comcar drivers. Then we had a question on voluntary student unionism. Finally, after last Thursday, the member for Lalor got a guernsey and asked her first question on health.</para>

</continue>
<para>As I said, if those opposite were really concerned about this issue, if they were deeply of the belief that this was such a critical policy issue, we would have had an MPI yesterday. We would have had questions on Monday and Tuesday. We would have had questions today. The member for Lalor had 25 opportunities to ask a question and she took the 26th question today. She asked the sixth question in question time today. So we know that deep concern is not the reason she has proposed this MPIâand we know that because she could have done so yesterday. We know that the member for Lalor could have asked the first question, not the 26th. So there must be another reason why this MPI has been proposed. The motive for proposing the MPI is obvious. Those opposite know it. It is another episode of <inline font-style="italic">The West Wing</inline> that the member for Lalor is acting out, and that is the great diversion from their own policy and political catastrophe.</para>
<para>Since the member for Lalor raised American politics, it reminded me of another great political figure who had a vivid imaginationâthat is, former President Lyndon Johnson. To paraphrase, he said that if you have a relative who has one eye and it is in the middle of their forehead, you do not keep them in the front living room. I am grateful that the member for Reid is in the chamber, because he is that person in the Labor Party. The great problem for the Labor Party is that he is not just in the front living room; he is at the doorstops every morning describing a policy that is completely at odds with his backbench and that has led the leadership of the Labor Party into total policy catastrophe throughout this week. He has announced, I think, three separate positions. Two were identical. The first one was followed by a total reversalâ</para>

</quote>
<para class="block">After the Premiers Conference, I would not have thought that any other Labor figure in Australia believed that. As the minister for health points out, Australia has a good health system, and the Labor Premiers agree with that. Whilst those opposite will criticise the health systemâand the minister for health outlined just what an irresponsible furphy it was that they ran today in question timeâwe must ask: what is their alternative? When you look back over the last nine years, you see a doubling of the spending on health policy. You see the introduction of a private health insurance rebate, which never existed before, of 30 per cent for the general public, 35 per cent for those aged over 65 and 40 per cent for those over 70. You see the introduction of a Medicare safety net that is now paying benefits for out-of-hospital expenses that Medicare never paid in that form.</para>
<para>You would think that if those opposite were criticising the health system they would be offering to increase spending in those areas. But, far from that, the past for those opposite will actually be the future health policy if Labor ever gets its way. If Labor had its way, what health system would we see? Let us go to the substance of this MPI. You would see a health system with no private health insurance rebate. The member for Holt spoke after the member for Lalor about the deep concern for health in his electorate. He obviously has no concern for the more than 40 per cent of people in his electorate who have private health insurance. That is obviously something they have picked up which would explain his result at the last election. Not only would we have no private health insurance rebate; as the minister for health pointed out, we would have no Medicare safety net because, whilst the member for Lalor will criticise the safety net, what she does not publicly outline is that her policy desire is not to alter it or tweak it but to totally abolish it.</para>
<para>What is her alternativeâMedicare Gold? It has been called foolâs gold. I would call it for what it was: âMedicare gold toothâ. That policy, amazingly, is the one policy the member for Lalor still sticks to today, in spite of opposition from those on her own backbench and inside the shadow cabinet. As the minister for health rightly pointed out, Labor figures have called it everything from a strategic disaster, âsomething with the head of a donkey and the body of a wombatâ, a hoax, to something that proved to be a turkey. Lindsay Tanner, the member for Melbourne, said it would be a very substantial burden on future budgets. This MPI is a furphy. It has been put up to cover up a policy catastrophe on the other side and it should be dismissed for the irrelevancy that it is. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âOrder! The discussion is concluded. Before we go on with government business, could I just make a comment that there has been a liberal use today of personal pronouns: âyouâ, âheâ, âsheâ and âyourâ. They are to be discouraged because it does not encourage a debate. It becomes a personal attack, and that is why the chair always insists that members should speak through the chair and also address members by their seats or by their titles.</para>

<para>âby leaveâThe committeeâs sixth report of 2005 addresses the refurbishment of light wells and defence office accommodation at Australia House in London. The works, referred by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, are intended to ensure compliance with current occupational health and safety standards, provide an acceptable level of amenity for tenants, ensure ongoing viability of the property in respect of income generation and redress degradation of the light well areas. Having investigated the proposal, the committee is satisfied that the works will improve the amenity of the 90-year-old building in a cost-effective manner and therefore recommends that the works proceed at an estimated cost of $11.98 million.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The committeeâs seventh report of 2005 examines the midlife upgrade of Australiaâs existing chancery building at its High Commission in Singapore. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade reported that the chancery in its current form has significant deficiencies in meeting current occupational health and safety and Building Code of Australia standards. It is dysfunctional and non-cost-effective in layout and does not present an appropriate image of Australia in its representational and reception areas. To redress these deficiencies, the department proposes to upgrade building services, access, security and communications systems and reconfigure and refurbish tenant office accommodation. The committee was satisfied with the departmentâs responses to its questions and recommends that the work proceed at an estimated cost of $12.7 million.</para>
<para>The committeeâs eighth report of 2005 deals with a proposal, also by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, to construct a new Consulate-General building in Bali, Indonesia, at an estimated cost of $7.15 million. The department reported that the former Consulate-General building in Bali is no longer suitable to fulfil its consular and representative role, with significant deficiencies in respect of occupational health and safety, floor space and functionality, building structure and services and particularly security. Since the terrorist bombing in 2002, the Australian Consulate-General in Bali has been accommodated in leased premisesâa situation that is not sustainable in the long term. The committee is in no doubt as to the requirement for the proposed work and recommends that it proceed. Further, the committee is pleased to note that the proposed work will provide a permanent site for, and improve access to, the memorial garden and anniversary pond erected to victims of the Bali bombing.</para>
<para>A further proposal by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Tradeânamely, the construction of a new chancery in Vientiane, Laosâforms the subject of the committeeâs ninth report of 2005. The proposed new building, estimated to cost $11 million, is intended to replace the existing chancery, which was acquired and refurbished in 1961 and no longer maintains modern standards in respect of services, layout, building codes or occupational health and safety requirements. The committee has given detailed consideration to this proposal and it recommends that the works proceed at an estimated cost of $11 million.</para>
<para>The 10th report of 2005 presents the committeeâs findings in relation to the proposed construction of a dedicated business resumption site for the Reserve Bank of Australia. The purpose of the proposed work is to provide a facility that, in the event of an emergency, will ensure the continuation of functions critical to the operation of Australiaâs financial systems. During the course of its inquiry, the committee investigated the revenue to be generated and/or saved by this project, issues relating to relocation and accommodation of staff, the use of the facility, electricity supply, energy consumption and green building initiatives. The committee was particularly impressed by the range of energy and water conservation measures proposed for the new facility and was pleased with the high quality of the evidence submitted by the Reserve Bank, which assisted greatly in the speedy completion of the inquiry. The committee has no hesitation in recommending that the proposed work proceed, at the estimated cost of $38 million. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my committee colleagues and all those involved in the five inquiries, and I commend the reports to the House.</para>

<para>âby leaveâOn behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I have just presented the committeeâs Report No. 403, <inline font-style="italic">Access of Indigenous Australians to law and justice services</inline>. The terms of reference were adopted and the inquiry commenced in the previous parliament, when the committee was capably chaired by Bob Charles and his deputy, the member for Sydney, Tanya Plibersek. Two ongoing members of the sectional committee, the current deputy chair, Sharon Grierson, and Senator John Hogg, provided important continuity to the inquiry over the two parliaments.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The committeeâs inquiry examined the delivery of legal services to Indigenous Australians from the perspective of providers and their clients. Of particular concern to the committee was the access that Indigenous Australians have to family and civil law services in cases where the safety of individuals is threatened by criminal activity, such as family violence.</para>
<para>This report makes 17 recommendations for the government to consider that build upon programs already in place. The committee has recognised the governmentâs doubling of resources to the Family Violence Protection Legal Services program over the last financial year as an important response to family violence in Indigenous communities and has recommended a further expansion of these services to people living in urban areas. While the committee is in no way opposed to the holistic response to victims of family violence, incorporating services such as counselling, it has recommended that family violence protection legal services be recognised primarily as providers of legal representation and advice to persons at risk of violence, who must be assured of their full rights to protection and compensation under the law.</para>
<para>The importance of expert staff in providing legal services to Indigenous Australians should not be underestimated. To this end, the committee has recommended an investigation into and review of comparative rates of remuneration for staff of Indigenous-specific providers of legal services and of publicly funded mainstream providers. There is also room for increased cooperation and coordination between Indigenous-specific and mainstream service providers to promote mutual benefits to staff in both types of organisations.</para>
<para>In conclusion, I would like to express the committeeâs appreciation to those people who contributed to the inquiry by preparing submissions and giving evidence at public hearings. I particularly want to thank the people of the community of Yuendumu in the Northern Territory for their hospitality and their frankness. It was an example of how cultural law and common law can work together for outcomes in the community. I wish to thank all members of the sectional committee involved for their time and dedication in conducting this inquiry. I commend the report to the House.</para>

<para>âby leaveâAs Deputy Chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I am also pleased to draw the attention of the House to our recent report No. 403, <inline font-style="italic">Access of Indigenous Australians to law and justice services</inline>. This reportâs recommendations give government clear direction for the future provision of Indigenous law and justice services. The report strongly recommends the acceptance of separate and specific requirements for the three main areas of legal servicesâfamily, civil and criminal lawâmatched of course by adequate funding. It draws attention to the tendency for legal representation services to be directed primarily at those facing criminal charges and possible incarceration.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In the interests of women and children, the family violence prevention legal services so needed in both urban and rural Indigenous communities must be consistently accessible and available. The committee received evidence that from 1991 to 2001 the number of Australian women in custody increased by 147 per cent. Indigenous women were included in that figure. The corresponding increase for Indigenous women alone was 225.8 per cent. To us, it was very evident that services are needed. In my own region, the Many Rivers Aboriginal Legal Service explained that the increase in the incarceration of Indigenous women was a response to high incidences of family violence and child sexual assault. They said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... we are starting to see the flow-through into older ages of a lot of child victims of sexual assault, physical assault and systems abuse from having been made state wards and left high and dry.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">We have much to achieve in providing for women and children and in healing the harm that past policies have done to the Indigenous people in this country. No stronger evidence of that was presented than that at Dubbo, where sadly we were part of the grief and despair around a death in custody at that time. For the committee members, it was a very poignant and certainly pointed reminder that we have much to do in representing Indigenous people.</para>
<para>Ways for government to adequately respond to the problems of staff recruitment and retention were identified in the report. Comparable pay rates, exchange programs, scholarships bonded to regional service, and assisted training and development plans for paralegal community support workers were all recommended, as were the better coordination of legal services and the sharing of resources. I draw particular attention, as the chair did, to some wonderful initiatives towards multiagency policies and policing in Western Australia, and I thank those involved for their initiative, their innovation and their commitment. Many service providers strongly expressed their concerns that the governmentâs new tendering system may compromise Indigenous ownership of legal services and Indigenous participation. But, pleasingly, it seems that the government has heeded those concerns, with successful tenderers thus far in Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia all being Aboriginal legal services.</para>
<para>It was truly a privilege to be invited by the people of Yuendumu to visit their community. Life experiences reinforce that local solutions work best, and the self-determined initiatives to overcome petrol sniffing, domestic violence and antisocial behaviour by youth that the people of Yuendumu have devised are exemplary. There is no place in government for programs of paternal benevolence such as the recently endorsed petrol for parenting measures, but there is a real place for taking notice of Indigenous communities when they pose local solutions to problems that eat away at their communityâs prosperity. I thank the people of Yuendumu. I was touched by their wisdom and by their commitment to their kin and community.</para>
<para>Recent media articles have raised concerns amongst the community that committees do not achieve real effectiveness in shaping government policy. I am proud to say that this report and this inquiry have already been effective. This report is a tribute to the committeeâs secretariat, particularly Dr Glen Worthington, and to all those who submitted to and supported the committee in its deliberations. I would also endorse the chairâs acknowledgements and appreciation. I can say that this was perhaps one of the too few experiences that we have in this House that motivate us to achieve more through our work here as parliamentarians. I commend the report to the House.</para>

<para>âOn behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission, I present the committeeâs report on the examination of the Australian Crime Commissionâs annual report 2003-04. The Australian Crime Commissionâs annual report was presented out of session on 21 December 2004 and was tabled in both houses on 8 February 2005, in accordance with section 61 of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002. The duties of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission are prescribed under section 55 of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002. These duties include examining each annual report of the Australian Crime Commission and reporting to the parliament on any matter appearing in or arising out of any such annual report.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>In the course of its scrutiny of the Australian Crime Commission report, the committee held a number of hearings in Canberra on 17 March and wrote to a number of individuals and organisations, inviting them to comment on the annual report. We received seven submissions as well as a number of letters that expressed satisfaction with the operation of the Australian Crime Commission. This yearâs Australian Crime Commission report is significant in that its reporting period covers the first full year of the commissionâs operation. It gives the committee, the parliament and the electorate the opportunity to evaluate the progress of the Australian Crime Commission towards its stated objective of âreducing incidence and impact of serious and organised criminal activityâ.</para>
<para>The committee draws the Houseâs attention to a number of recommendations made in the report that are designed to provide more public information about the Australian Crime Commissionâs operation. They include a recommendation that the Australian Crime Commission consider the release of public versions of key research, including a declassified version of the informative picture of criminality. The committee has also recommended that the Australian Crime Commission review the legal and administrative arrangements governing information on its intelligence networks and that it brief the committee on the results. To make some of the performance indicators more informative for the committee, the parliament and the community, the committee has included recommendation 4:</para>
<quote>
<para>... continued refinement of the performance measures, including an explanation of the significance of quantitative and qualitative indicators.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Recommendation 5 also concerns performance indicators. The committee has recommended that those performance indicators relating to criminal intelligence operations include, subject to reasonable security considerations, how priority is given to matters submitted to the Australian Crime Commission board for consideration.</para>
<para>In making these recommendations, our committee is acutely aware of the necessarily confidential nature of the work of the Australian Crime Commission; there is a fine line to be drawn between information which must be kept confidential for operational reasons and that which can be released for general use. However, the committee considers that the recommendations made in this report will not compromise the Australian Crime Commission in any way and will provide a greater understanding of the work and achievements of the commission.</para>
<para>In conducting its evaluation of the annual report, the committee acknowledges the assistance of the chairman of the ACC board, Commissioner Mick Keelty, the CEO, Mr Alistair Milroy, and officers of the Australian Crime Commission. Throughout the reporting period, the ACC has provided considerable assistance to the committee through written reports and briefings as well as through verbal presentations. The commissionâs willingness to assist the committee has been of great assistance and has contributed to a transparent and cooperative relationship. The committee would like to acknowledge also the considerable assistance of Professor John McMillan, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, and his staff. I also take this opportunity to thank the secretariat staff for the consistent support they have given to the committee.</para>
<para>Finally, I take this opportunity to inform the House that, following discussions with the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison, the committee has agreed to conduct a statutory evaluation of the operation of the Australian Crime Commission Act, pursuant to section 61 of that act. This inquiry will call for submissions in the near future. It will be an excellent opportunity to examine the adequacy of the act to provide a practical working framework for the Australian Crime Commission in a criminal environment, which is not only national but also transnational in character.</para>

<para class="block">I note that a very similar second reading amendment was passed by the Senate without any dissent being recorded. Clearly, there must be some concern amongst the ministerâs own Senate colleagues over his handling of this issue; otherwise, the government would have argued against the minister being criticised for causing unnecessary delays in the appointment of the industry board. Also, you would have thought the government would have supported the minister against criticisms that he had not achieved the environmental improvements which are the rationale for the 2003 act. Clearly, the criticisms are well founded, and that is why the Senate voted as it did.</para>
<para>The <inline ref="R2315">Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline> proposes amendments to two acts: the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 and the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Act 2001. The proposed amendments to the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act are relatively uncontroversial and are of a housekeeping nature. They ensure that a person importing or exporting used HCFC or methyl bromide has either a used substances licence or a controlled substances licenceânot both, as could be the case under the existing act. It also applies the same controls and reporting requirements to anyone who sets up a synthetic greenhouse gasâSGGâmanufactur-ing operation in Australia as those applying to SGG importers.</para>
<para>The amendments to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Act 2001 permit the sale of a disused scout hall in Mosman and a land swap to replace the lost public space. These are uncontroversial and have the support of the New South Wales government. The Sydney Harbour Federation Trust legislation is legislation that I spoke on when it was introduced. The harbour is the jewel in Sydneyâs crown, and I, as someone who was born there and loves Sydney Harbour, certainly believe that Sydney is the jewel in Australiaâs crown. Anything we can do to protect and enhance the Sydney Harbour National Park and the public space around the harbour is to the benefit of all Australians. On this side of the House, we support these minor changes to the act.</para>
<para>I want to confine my comments today primarily to the changes that are effected by the amendments to the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act. The main industries affected by the amendments to this act are the refrigeration and airconditioning industries and the fumigation industry. In Australia, the regulation of the fluorocarbon gases used in the refrigerant industry started when the Hawke Labor government introduced the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 to phase out CFCs and implement the Montreal protocol. CFCs, as everyone came to know, were causing global ozone depletion or, to put it another way, a hole in the ozone layer. International action on this important issue was urgent, and the Hawke Labor government acted quickly and decisively to phase out the import and manufacture of CFCs by 1 January 1996.</para>
<para>Recently I had the pleasure, at an Australian-Israel Chamber of Commerce function in Sydney, to hear Dr David Suzuki talk about climate change and the challenge that it presented to us. He drew parallels with the issue of CFCs and their impact on the ozone layer and how, originally, it was thought that these revolutionary consumer items were going to bring great benefit to us. It took time for the danger that CFCs were causing to the ozone layer and the threat that they posed to the global environment to be recognised. There is a parallel with the current debate on climate change and the danger that greenhouse gases are causing to the climate and, therefore, not just to our environment but also to our potential economic future.</para>
<para>I am very pleased and proud to say that the Hawke Labor governmentâs decision to phase out CFCs by 1 January 1996 was achieved with strong community support and without significant disruption to industry. It is a great practical example of taking action that is necessary, rather than finding reasons not to take action as a global community. The Hawke Labor governmentâs actions are in stark contrast to the complacency of the Howard government when it comes to climate change. In 1995, the Keating Labor government continued this good work and introduced the Ozone Protection Amendment Act 1995, which included controls on HCFCs, reflecting their inclusion in the Montreal protocol. HCFCs are also an ozone-depleting gas, albeit considerably less so than CFCs. They will be phased out by 2020 at a rate considerably in advance of Australiaâs international obligations. This great result was achieved because the Keating government worked with industry to do the best that it could, not merely just the minimum. Again, the Keating Labor governmentâs actions are in stark contrast to the abject complacency and incompetence of the Howard government when it comes to taking action on climate change.</para>
<para>The Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Amendment Act 2003 included controls on HFCs and was seen as a useful step by the industry. It received bipartisan support. The legislation will minimise emission of HFC gases which are controlled by the Kyoto protocol but previously uncontrolled in Australia. HFC gases are mainly used as refrigerants. These gases do not deplete the ozone layer but do have a significant greenhouse warming potential. End use controlsâthat is, minimising the emissions of these gases to atmosphere through sound industrial practicesâare contained in the regulations dated 16 December 2004. The controls are put in place by improving training and other standards in the industry, certifying tradespersons and inspecting associated work. Without an appropriate licence a tradesperson will not be permitted to purchase refrigerants. Companies buying and selling refrigerants or using refrigerants in a manufacturing process will also have to be appropriately licensed, abide by agreed standards and be subject to inspection. This licensing process is a keystone of the actâs emission minimisation program and is to be undertaken by an industry board to be appointed by the minister. The board was to be directed by the Department of the Environment and Heritage. This approach received strong industry support and emerged from a consultation and review process held over a number of years. Somewhat scandalously, the minister did not appoint the industry board until three weeks agoâon 31 May 2005. With nobody to put the program in place until three weeks ago, the legislation passed way back in late 2003 has not, up to this point, produced a tangible environmental benefit.</para>
<para>According to ABC news reports in February, the appointment of a national industry board was derailed after lobbying from a small section of the industry in Western Australia. After achieving bipartisan support for such important legislation and also getting industry support for national regulation, the minister backflipped and wanted to rewrite the whole thing. This step was taken without consultation with industry, and the minister refused to meet with industry representatives. The minister stated that he wanted to take in âregional and sectoralâ considerations. I think everyone here knows what that is code for when this minister and other ministers in the Howard government speak about âsectoralâ considerations. The minister delayed the whole licensing regime for six months while he tried to find a way to accommodate these parochial interests. Not surprisingly, the ministerâs approach was severely criticised by the industry.</para>

<para>âMinister, that was an editorial from the April 2005 edition of <inline font-style="italic">Climate Control News</inline>. It is not from the Labor Party and it is not from the trade union movement; it is from the main industry newsletterâpeople on the ground who know what the impact of this governmentâs inaction has been. Also quoted in the April edition of <inline font-style="italic">Climate Control News</inline> was Rod King, president of the Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Equipment Manufacturers Associationânote: the association, not the union; this is the industry. He said:</para>
</talk.start>

<quote>
<para class="block">There have been press reports that the Minister is considering establishing multiple boardsâbut we can find no justification or rationale for this approach. We have just spent years getting to the point where we have comprehensive national regulation of refrigerants and now there seems to be a move to implement accreditation on a state basis.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">But Mr King went on to say a bit more as well. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">This approach is completely inconsistent with other Federal Government reforms, such as the move towards a unitary industrial relations system.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">But who could expect consistency from this government? They have been up at the International Whaling Commission arguing that secret ballots are a bad thing, and yet in industrial relations, when it comes to workers having control over their own environment, they are pro secret ballots.</para>
<para>So it is consistency that is needed when it comes to the environment, just as on the issue of the Kyoto protocol we have a different position from that which we had on the Montreal protocol. By our not being a part of the most significant global effort on the most important environmental challenge facing the global community, that of avoiding dangerous climate change, we are undermined when we talk to the international community about issues that everyone here would agree withâeveryone except the parliamentary secretary for tourismâwhich is that whaling is a practice that should be consigned to the dustbin of history.</para>
<para>We need consistency when it comes to the environment if we are going to be able to achieve real gains. Alan Woodhouse, the CEO of the Australian Refrigeration Council, another industry body, stated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We are all very disappointed. The Government called for tenders to fulfil a single national industry board. We responded with a very thorough tender that complied with all the specifications. Now, nearly 12 months later the Department of Environment and Heritage is abandoning the original tender and the structure and outcome from work put in over the last three years. Why?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Alan Woodhouse then noted he was âunderstandably bewildered and upsetâ by the ministerâs actions.</para>
<para>In attempting to overturn the national approach and protect parochial interests at the expense of a consistent national approach, the minister has threatened the underlying philosophy behind this important legislation, which enjoyed bipartisan support in this House. The delays in appointing the industry board exposed the airconditioning and refrigeration industry to severe consequences as the industry board issues the licences which will be required by law for 50,000 tradespeople after 1 July 2005.</para>
<para>So you have got a system that is going to apply to 50,000 people in 10 days time being debated in this House now, when the board was appointed at the end of last month, on 31 May. This is an extraordinary performance even by the ministerâs own standards when it comes to taking decisive action on issues of environment and heritage. And that is why Labor is moving the second reading amendment today. It is also possibly why the Senate carried the second reading amendment yesterday without the government members even calling for a vote or expressing opposition to our amendment.</para>

<para>âAs the member for Throsby, the parliamentary secretary for environment and heritage for the Labor Party, says, I think they were embarrassed by this performance, because the whole purpose of the licensing regime is to minimise ozone-damaging gases and other greenhouse gas emissions. There has been widespread frustration and confusion in the airconditioning and refrigeration industry because the reforms proposed by the act have been delayed by the minister. More than 50,000 tradespeople in the airconditioning and refrigeration industry have been frustrated and confused as to what the industryâs licensing regime is. It is a scandal that the environmental improvements which are the rationale for the bipartisan 2003 act have not been achieved. Once again this shows the minister and the Howard government are just not serious about taking practical steps to avoid dangerous climate change. The Howard government is slow, it is reluctant and it is complacent when it comes to tackling the issue of climate change. National leadership is needed to avoid dangerous climate change, but instead Australia has a lethargic, tired approach.</para>

<para>Climate change caused by the burning of fossil fuels and greenhouse gases is changing Australiaâs climate right now. Australia is at one of the most important crossroads in its history. What we do in the next 10 years about these issues will determine the fate of our economy and our environment for the rest of this century and beyond. The extended four-year drought gripping Australia is the most dramatic example of climate change to hit our continent. Experts predict Australia is going to get progressively drier over the coming century because of changes to our climate caused by greenhouse pollution. According to the CSIRO, climate change will only worsen drought conditions.</para>

<para>âThe member for Robertson, sitting opposite, proclaims confusion about jobs and the Kyoto protocol. But I was quoting the Prime Minister from 1997âthat is what he said. He was right then but he is wrong now when it comes to taking decisive action, because the decision not to ratify the Kyoto protocol is stopping new investment in technology which would reduce greenhouse gases, create jobs and move Australia to a cleaner, more secure energy future.</para>
</talk.start>

<para>The Kyoto protocol is not perfect, but it is an essential first step and shows what can be done when the international community works together. It is a global solution to a global problem. Not ratifying Kyoto means Australia cannot contribute to how the world is dealing with the climate crisis. One hundred and forty other nations are having a say, but we are not. We have no credibility in the discussions over emission reductions in future international agreements, which will take effect after 2012. Quite clearly much deeper cuts will be necessary. In a passionate speech in Britain recently, the international Chairman of Shell, Lord Oxburgh, stated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We have roughly 45 years. And if we start NOW, not in 10 or 15 yearsâ time, we have a chance of hitting those greenhouse gas reduction targets. But weâve got to start now. We have no time to lose ... The boat is sinking, and we have to use everything that we possibly can.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It is extraordinary that companies such as Shell and BP are so far ahead of the position taken by someone like the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, who thinks that climate change is not really happening. People in industry, including those industries which have contributed greatly to climate change, understand very well that the world has to change. Certainly the frustration of the refrigeration industry is another example of the overwhelming frustration felt by those who recognise the dangers of climate change and want to do something about it. That is what the second reading amendment that we have moved today is about. My colleague the member for Throsby will second it. It is a fair and balanced amendment, and I ask members to join with the Senate in supporting it.</para>

<para>âThis afternoon is a timely moment to reflect on Australiaâs achievements with greenhouse gases. Obviously, the Montreal protocol pertains to the <inline ref="R2315">Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline> that we are debating today and the amendments to the legislation which, as we can see, have support from both sides of the House and are relatively minor. The Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 needs to be amended in three or four ways. It will bring licensing of domestic producers into line with importers and exporters. I think that is appropriate. There will not be the complexity of requiring both used and controlled substance licences. I think that is also appropriate. Finally, the process of reporting to the minister on when these products are imported and exported will now be brought into line for domestic producers and manufacturers. I think that is all relatively non-controversial.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Right now is an excellent time to remember exactly what has been achieved by Australia in reducing the use of these gases. The gases have important roles in industry. The most obvious one is their quarantine application. I experienced that myself when we brought material back from a recent visit from Papua New Guinea which was fumigated. There are quarantine uses for these heavy gases. There are the non-quarantine applications which pertain to the Montreal protocol. That protocol only pertains to non-quarantine uses. In the areas of refrigeration, use in the manufacture of foams, use as solvents and airconditioning, we have seen significant reductions.</para>
<para>The point I make today is that had we simply stuck to the bare bones of the protocol we would be importing today 240 tonnes of methyl bromide. But, no, we have done significantly better at 160 tonnes and I think that should be acknowledged. If we hung purely and simply on the symbolism of signing to a protocol and doing not an ounce better, then we would be performing significantly more poorly than we actually are today. I would point out that it is not always government, whether we are in power or opposition, that should be congratulated for those achievements but industry themselves that go out there and go one step better than the protocol. I think that is a fine allegory for the debate we are having around Kyoto where our reductions and emissions are in line with achieving the 2008-2012 objective of being aâ</para>

<para>âBecause we are doing it and industry is doing it without that ratification down to 108 per cent of emissions in 1995. These gases also have applications in medicine and science. Heavy gases are used in eye surgery where a millilitre of heavy gas is used to reattach retinas. I do not see that one as threatening the ozone layer, but it is important to remember that there is still, as we reduce the use of these substances, a notable but very small tail where they will still be used. The HCFCs I hope will be phased out within a year or two, but methyl bromide which has some more essential applications one would suspect will be used perhaps early into the next decade.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I have made my point already about the use of HCFCs being 160 tonnes of importation. Methyl bromide is at 145 tonnes and that is predicted to fall next year to 66 tonnes and the following year to 42 tonnes. That is a substantial reduction and a credit again to industry and also to two bodies that have been running now for some time. I refer to the National Halon Bank, which has been responsible for collecting about 1,985 tonnes of halon. While a small amount of that will be required to be saved for aviation use, the rest is being cleaned up and either preserved or destroyed. The Halon Bank has been a very effective way of avoiding around 160 million tonnes of ozone being destroyed in the atmosphere.</para>
<para>The other body is Refrigerant Reclaim Australia, which has been responsible for collecting refrigeration gasesâaround 1,000 tonnes. Some of these are extremely ozone damaging. We are talking about one kilogram of these gases being able to destroy up to 50 tonnes of ozone. When you think that this molecule is only present in perhaps three or four molecules per million and has such an important role in blocking ultraviolet C and effectively in important health applications, there are very good reasons for keeping ozone intact. What you have effectively done with that reclamation is to avoid around six million tonnes of COÂ² going into the atmosphere. They are two very good success stories for the work that has been done over recent years.</para>
<para>I turn my attention to the member for Grayndler, who spent most of the time allotted to him focusing on effectively cobbling together some opinions of individuals who are unhappy with the speed of the process. And there was a great fixation on board appointments. But what is far more important than anything is the fact that we have had significant reductionsâamong the best in the worldâand have got the use, the importation and the collection of some of these heavy gases to be world standard. That is really where the action is. The action is not what has been signed and what has not been signed, but what is happening on the ground. For that reason, I believe that industry itself deserves an enormous amount of credit.</para>
<para>Industry itself is now finding alternative heavy gases to use. In some cases that is very difficult, and the federal government has set out some critical use exemptions which are very important. This again speaks to the fact that, if you have a government prepared to work with industry rather than using a protocol in a punitive way, you do not need to have that luxury of sitting back and saying, âWe have signed and that was enough. We have achieved what was signed off on a protocol, and that is all we intend to do.â That a constructive approach goes much further than what one would sign up to in a protocol is evidenced here with Australiaâs achievements in relation to these heavy gases. That is analogous to the situation with the Kyoto protocol.</para>
<para>We now have significant reductions. There is still HCFC reliant equipment and machinery that will be using heavy gasesâin small amountsâuntil the end of its lifespan. That is an important concession made so that industry is able to comply, to go about finding alternatives. But it is not done in a punitive way; it is done with a discrete allocation of time for industry to be able to respond. That is really important.</para>
<para>About 5,100 ozone-depleting potential tonnes of material are being prevented from being released into the atmosphere. Again, that is a significant improvement on what is happening in a number of situations around the world in a number of economies. The achievements of the Halon Bank, as I have pointed out, are impressive, as is the reclamation of refrigerant gases. Industry is supportive of all of these three amendments.</para>
<para>There is no doubt that, of these ozone-depleting substances, some also have greenhouse impacts, but we have seen a movement from some of the highly ozone-damaging substances, with an ozone-depleting effect of about 0.4, down to some HCFCs that are in the realm of about 0.05. That is a significant improvement, and we are seeing that in the outcomes for Australia in being well in front of its obligations due to the Montreal protocol.</para>
<para>I believe it is industry that should be congratulated for those achievements; it is the government that has continued to tighten up legislation as required. For each of those reasons, I speak in support of the amendments today. We have excellent end use regulations, so there is provision there for industry, and industry appreciates the flexibility, but in the end I would say that it is not the small arguments that are contained in these amendments that are important. What is truly important is the eventual emission reductions from Australia, for they are world class.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Bowman for his contribution to the debate on the <inline ref="S454">Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline>. It was quite an erudite scientific and technical explanation, some of which went over my head as I do not have that level of detailed knowledge about the science of the issue and its impacts. But what I did find rather surprising in his contribution was that he failed to respond to the essence of the argument of the member for Grayndler, which was to compare and contrast the international action, with Australiaâs support, to deal with the impacts of the depletion of the ozone layerâhow Australia really led the way in that debate and the actions that have subsequently flowedâwith the total inactivity over the newest global threat that is confronting all of mankind, and that is global warming.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The shadow minister was making the point that Australia supported the ratification of the Montreal protocol. But, unfortunately, and much to the regret of people on this side of the House, the Australian government continues to fail to ratify the Kyoto protocol. The Kyoto protocol, as members know, has now been ratified by about 140 developed nations. Only Australia and the United States stand outside the ratification process on an issue that many Australian citizens believe is the greatest threat facing not just our own country but the global community. That was a profound point made by the member for Grayndler.</para>
<para>People on this side of the chamber take great pride in the fact that it was under the Hawke Labor government that this nation took steps to fall into line with the calls that were being made to ensure that we phased out the use of substances that depleted the ozone layer. At that time, the data that was being collected revealed a general thinning of the ozone layer over most of the globe. This included a five to nine per cent depletion over Australia since the 1960s, and it was having very severe impacts over Antarctica. The ozone hole in 2000 was the largest on record. At that time, it measured 32.9 million square kilometresâmore than three times the size of Australia. It is not surprising that the Australian community at large was very concerned about the impacts of that depletion and the far-reaching consequences for human health.</para>
<para>As the member for Bowman rightly said, governments around the world began the phasing out of CFCs, halons and other ozone-depleting chemicals. Those chemicals had been widely used as refrigerants, aerosol propellants and foam-blowing agents. The success of the action under the Montreal protocol is now evidenced by the fact that eminent scientists now believe that the prospects for the long-term recovery of the ozone layer are improving. Non-essential consumption of major ozone depleting substances did in fact slow down during the early 1990s, and if we continue to give this issue our best efforts some estimate that the hole in the ozone layer could be fully recoverable by around 2050.</para>
<para>Interestingly enough, had we not taken action as a nation in concert with the rest of the international community, studies seem to suggest that by 2050 ozone depletion would be 10 times worse than current levels and UVB radiation would have resulted in an estimated 19 million additional cases of non-melanoma skin cancer, 1.5 million more cases of melanoma and 129 million more cases of eye cataracts. The seriousness of the situation compelled an international response at that time. I am very pleased that our country was part of that international effort. It is much to the shame of the Howard government and the Australian nation that the same commitment to solving another international and global crisis is not being made by this government.</para>
<para>The member for Bowman rightly acknowledgesâand I want to say a little more about thisâthat the substitute gases, the more ozone benign gases, are in fact themselves contributing to the greenhouse impact. I recently read a UN report which was headed âSafeguarding the ozone layer and the global climate systemâ. You would assume that the substitution of ozone friendly gases would not cause any irreparable harm and any consequent flow-on effects. But in fact what this and other reports are suggesting is that in phasing out CFCs, halons and other ozone depleting chemicals we have replaced them with alternatives that are having a marked impact on global warming.</para>
<para>Like CFCs, some of the alternatives, such as the group referred to as HCFCs, HFCs and PFCs, are themselves powerful greenhouse gases. In the words of the Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organisation:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Although climate change and ozone destruction are essentially different issues, our use of certain chemicals links them together.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He goes on to argue:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We must continuously monitor, undertake research and improve how we manage this group of extremely useful substances, which is implicated in not one, but two of the major environmental problems we have ever known.â</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">To limit their damaging effects governments have included two of the CFC alternatives in the 1992 UN climate change convention and in the Kyoto protocol, under which signatory countries must reduce their emissions from a basket of six greenhouse gases by the period 2008 to 2012. This basket contains the alternative HFCs and PFCs. The contribution that CFCs and their replacements and other ozone-depleting substances currently make to global warming is estimated to be about five per cent of humanityâs total greenhouse gas emissions.</para>
<para>I raise this issue because the major concern in the public debate is with the contribution of carbon to greenhouse warming. In fact, the substitutes that we are now using to continue to protect the ozone layer are themselves partly contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. This report went on to recommend some simple and commonsense practices that should be put in place to minimise the impact of the ozone friendly chemicals on global warming. The report says that containment can be improved to prevent leaks, evaporation and emissions of unintended by-products.</para>
<para>About 65 per cent of todayâs total emissions from this group of chemicals still comes from CFCs, mainly from existing refrigeration and airconditioning equipment. Reducing leaks from these sources could cut greenhouse gas emissions, benefiting both the ozone layer and climate change. Amounts of the chemicals needed in equipment can be reduced and there should be more end-of-life recovery, recycling and destruction of HFCs and PFCs. Since virtually all ozone depleting substances and their replacements are now used in closed systems, they are not emitted until years or even decades after being produced. Large amounts of CFCs still exist in current refrigeration and airconditioning equipment and in insulating foams from which they can leak or evaporate. Later, as the report indicates, when the equipment is finally decommissioned, these gases can be released into the atmosphere.</para>
<para>While I commend the bipartisan approach that we have seen in the past in phasing out ozone depleting substances, many of the alternative gases that are now being used, whilst ozone benign, are potent greenhouse gases contributing to the greenhouse effect. I point out, as the member for Grayndler did, that there was a concerted international effort led by our national government on the ozone layer, but on the issue of global warming this national government is missing in action by its failure to ratify the Kyoto protocol. So, in that context, we have to be even more vigilant that there are systems in place to monitor the impact on global warming of these ozone benign gases.</para>
<para>On the specifics of the legislation, the member for Grayndler went through the lead-up and the details contained in the amendments so I do not want to dwell on the detail for too long, other than to say that the implementation of the proposed licensing regime and the creation of the new council has been another example of a botched effort on behalf of the minister who has overall responsibility for protection of Australiaâs environmental conditions. The new refrigeration licensing system is to replace existing state systems and, as the member for Grayndler rightly pointed out in moving his amendments to the bill, the industry has experienced a litany of delays and frustrations in getting the system into place.</para>
<para>There is no doubt this has caused concern and frustration in the industry, and the comments the member for Grayndler made, drawing on a number of industry sources and industry bodies, I think make that very clear. Here we are today in parliament debating a piece of legislation that is supposed to come into effect on 1 July. I do note, though, that there are now transitional arrangements under the licensing regime because there is no way that people are going to have their licences properly in place by the operative date of 1 July when something like 50,000 tradespeople are going to be incorporated as part of this new regime. There are also many in the industry who are querying the cost of the licencesâ$320, I think it is, for a two-year licence. And some who may not have the requisite trade qualifications are going to go through transitional arrangements that will recognise prior learning, however ill-defined that is at the moment.</para>
<para>So it has been quite a botch-up in terms of administrative arrangements. That botch-up is most clearly revealed in the delays that the member for Grayndler outlined in relation to the creation of the Australian Refrigeration Council, the body that was supposed to operate as a service provider under contract to the government. Its main role is to issue the licences and authorisations and to undertake compliance audits. Quite clearly, there was a lot of parochial and sectional pressure on the minister, most notably by the Motor Trade Association over in the west which attempted to derail the national system that was originally outlined in the bill. One has to ask about the special privileges this industry body had in applying the kind of pressure that has seen the new council announced only very recentlyâon 31 May. So here we have a totally new body announced at the end of May that is supposed to oversee a process to license around 50,000 tradespeople between now and 1 July, and yet this legislation has still not being carried by this parliament. It would be hard to find a clearer example of maladministration and botch-up than in the arrangements for the new licensing regime that is to apply.</para>
<para>We do support the essence of the bill, while our amendments clearly note the failures of the government and refer to the problems that these delays and pressures are causing in the industry. There is a clear parallel between the action Australia took when the worldâs community understood the impacts of the thinning of the ozone layer around the world, when we were at the forefront of the international action that has seen the damage to the ozone layer being held at bay with the possibility of the damage being reversed, and the lack of action by this government over a similar global crisis, the crisis of global warming, where we do not have the courage to go along with the rest of the developed nations and ratify the Kyoto protocol. When this bill is passed I look forward to being reassured by the government that we will have proper monitoring in place to look at the impacts that the more ozone friendly chemicals are actually having on global warming and climate change. There should be no trade-offs in my opinion between saving the ozone layer and minimising the very negative impacts of climate change. They are two global issues of equal importance and you cannot have any trade-offs between saving the ozone layer and minimising climate change.</para>
<para>Lastly, I ask the members of the government to think seriously about the benefits that would flow to the Australian economy, to the Australian environment and to the health and wellbeing of our communities if the government were to do the right thing and accept the challenge put forward in the member for Grayndlerâs private memberâs bill, which had a second reading in the House the other day. It is a bill that would see this government belatedly recognising the impact and the negative consequences of climate change and actually doing the right thing and ratifying the Kyoto protocol. I think the Montreal protocol showed that the international community working together can have a major influence on serious global environmental issues and I think ratification of the Kyoto protocol would show this government belatedly accepting the need for Australia to join again with the rest of the international community in dealing with a major environmental issue confronting mankind today.</para>

<para>âI am not joking, my friend. Since 1996 we have spent an unprecedented amount of money repairing the impact of 200 years of European settlement in this country. We have had the Natural Heritage Trust and an enormous range of other objectives, and the <inline ref="S454">Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline> is yet another way that the Howard government is doing what it can to make sure we appreciate collectively as a country that we do hold our nation in trust for future generations.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Australia is performing strongly in moves to phase out the use of hydrochlorofluorocarbonsâHCFCsâas set out in the internationally accepted standards of the Montreal protocol. It follows our commendable results in phasing out other more harmful ozone-depleting gases. Chlorofluorocarbons, the propellants that were so talked about in the 1980s, have not been in use in Australia since 1996, the year that the Labor government was swept from the Treasury benches and a year ahead of the time frames of the Montreal schedule. The almost as equally damaging gas, halon, once used as a coolant in refrigerators and fire-extinguishing systems, has not been used in this country since 1993, also a year ahead of the Montreal timetable. I am not, however, suggesting that this side of politics has a monopoly on interest in our environment. I believe that one of the important steps forward in recent years has been that everyone, both in the political arena and more generally, has appreciated that as a nation we simply could not go on as we were and that we had to look very closely at our environment and appreciate that obviously we must make sure that the environment is appropriate for succeeding generations of Australians. Methyl chloroformâused as a solvent for adhesives and for metal degreasingâwas phased out completely by 1996.</para>
<para>These three examples give some indication as to how serious Australia is to end the use of ozone-depleting gases for the good of the environment. The Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 will further help Australiaâs efforts by improving the licensing and administration of the guidelines for importers and exporters of hydrochlorofluorocarbons or used methyl bromide. The bill proposes to amend the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 by modifying the requirement of importers and exporters of these two gases so that they only require a used substances licence. This mirrors similar actions taken for chlorofluorocarbonsâCFCsâand halons, which I mentioned earlier and which are both now out of circulationâquite appropriatelyâin this country. The bill will effectively halve the licensing requirements for importers of HCFCs and methyl bromide gas.</para>
<para>Those who may be wondering about the impact of the amendments can rest easy knowing that the environmental protection afforded by the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 will not be compromised in any way by the amendments currently before the House. The bill will help fix what is largely a number of anomalies that were overlooked during the drafting of the legislation in 1989. I honestly do not know why so many mistakes have been made in the drafting of legislation over the years. I know that our parliamentary draftsmen do have a very high degree of skill, but it is frustrating to see that it is necessary on so many occasions to dot the iâs and cross the tâs and finetune the provisions of legislation which has been enacted in earlier times.</para>
<para>The bill will also ensure reporting conditions for synthetic greenhouse gases that are manufactured in Australia come into line with reporting conditions currently required for imported and exported synthetic greenhouse gases. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons have between one per cent and 10 per cent the ozone-depleting effect of the CFCs that they replaced one decade ago. Usage in Australia of methyl bromide, which is mainly used as a soil fumigant, has been cut back dramatically, by about 70 per cent of 1991 levels. Australia is continuing to investigate alternative gases that have no detrimental environmental impact; however, for some purposes there are regrettably still no viable alternatives. The use of these two gases in limited amounts and in controlled situations is, sadly, presently unavoidable. While the government recognises the environmental impacts of these substances, there is also an economic advantage in their usage. HCFCs are still the most commonly used refrigerants, as well as being widely used in foam-blowing, fire protection and aerosols, while methyl bromide is used as a solvent and, as I have mentioned, in the fumigation industry. However, the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 encourages the usage of recycled or used HCFCs and methyl bromide to further reduce the detrimental effect that these gases are acknowledged to have on the environment. Importing of these used or recycled gases is an important factor in the ongoing phasing out of the use of these substances altogether.</para>
<para>The second part of the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 ensures that part of Sydneyâs valuable historic past is conserved and enhanced. Several landmarks on the harbour reflect the colonial history of the area. They map out the growth of the region in terms of our defence and industry, and the population growth of the young fledgling colony of New South Wales. The areas targeted in this bill include Macquarie Lightstation on South Head, the North Head former artillery school, Woolwich Dock and the adjacent parklands, Snapper Island, Cockatoo Island, the once-bustling marine biological station at Watsons Bay and the defence lands at Middle Head, Georges Heights and Chowder Bay.</para>
<para>The amendments put forward in the bill will help enable the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust to continue to develop its plans for a beautiful parkland. I understand that local residents have already overwhelmingly voiced their support for a proposal that will see a 2,000 square metre block of land owned by the trustâthe site of an unwanted scout hutâallowed to be subdivided and sold off to private purchasers. In some communities, a grand plan such as this might ordinarily attract widespread condemnation, but the Sydney community is an understanding one and it will receive other benefits that balance the sell-off that might appear to outsiders looking in to be of somewhat limited value. In return for the scout hut land sale, three houses will be purchased in Markham Close, with the houses to be removed and the land then incorporated into a spectacular headland park. The cooperation of the community and its support for the insightful plans of the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust will enable the development of an attractive parkland that is both practical in terms of sensible land use and a great place for families to enjoy.</para>
<para>I listened to the political rhetoric of the honourable member for Throsby when she claimed that the government should ratify the Kyoto protocol. It is not in Australiaâs interests to ratify that particular protocol. We are meeting the targets which would have been set out in that protocol, so Australia is actually playing its part. We are simply not going to react to some knee-jerk requirement by members of the opposition that we should ratify a protocol that is clearly not in Australiaâs interests. At the outset I said that the coalition government are the greenest government in Australiaâs history. We do have a proud record. The environmental situation of this nation is infinitely better now than it was when we were elected to office in 1996 and the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 adds to that excellent environmental record. I am pleased to be able to commend this bill to the House.</para>

<para>âIt is a pleasure to speak to the <inline ref="R2315">Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 2005.</inline> As has been outlined, the purpose of this bill is to amend the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1999 and the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Act 2001. Amendments to the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act are of a housekeeping nature. They ensure that a person importing or exporting used hydrochlorofluorocarbons or methyl bromide has either a used substance licence or a controlled substances licenceânot both, as could be the case under the existing actâand apply the same controls and reporting requirements to anyone who sets up a synthetic greenhouse gas manufacturing operation in Australia as those applying to synthetic greenhouse gas importers. Amend-ments to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Act will permit the sale of some land in Mosman and a land swap to replace lost public space.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This is an opportune time to review some of the matters that surround the phenomenon of ozone protection. During my time in this place, I have had a number of opportunities to speak on various bills. Sometimes it is worrying to go back over previous speeches âyou may be a little concerned that you did not keep a consistent line. Having had the opportunity to speak on ozone protection legislation in 1988, 1992, 1995 and 1998, there was a great risk that perhaps I had not been consistent. One thing that has happened when reviewing pieces of legislation is that at each step we, as legislators, have had to react to the developing body of scientific knowledge to do with this phenomenon. Sometimes I think that is not understood. Scientific investigation is very dynamic.</para>
<para>Tonight I wish to go through some of the things that continue to develop our understanding of ozone depletion in the stratosphere which have led to this body of legislation, culminating in the Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 that is to be amended by the bill tonight. Governments of both political persuasions have come to grips with this over the last 17 years. When these environmental phenomena are tackled by global cooperation and in an international way we can have great success.</para>
<para>This phenomenon came to light in the 1980s. Fortunately, we have seen the global community come together and, through the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, followed by the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, set down a timetable of achievement, cutting out the production of gases identified as being ozone depleting. I am not going to go over the successes because they have been indicated by a number of people already in this debate. Even if we take the position that the honourable member for Bowman put quite stronglyâthat industry had cooperated and should get a pat on the backâit should be realised that industry is important and has done its part. If we were to look only at Australiaâs success in isolation, like any global phenomenon, we would do an injustice to the way in which we are attempting to protect the planet.</para>
<para>On this side of the chamber we say that through Kyoto we could achieve for climate change and the greenhouse phenomenon what has arisen through the Montreal protocol. It is incongruous that we have this dichotomy where there has been bipartisan support right throughout the 17 years of the Montreal protocol and the 20 years of the Vienna convention. It was never questioned that we should be doing this in an international way through the cooperation we have seen.</para>
<para>Regrettably, when we have seen bipartisan support, we do not really want to go into this territory. But on some of the reviews of the Montreal protocol, this government has tended to side with the United States over, for instance, the Europeans in the way in which implementation timetables have been placed. Traditionally these have been seen to extend the timetables. When Australia decides, it is usually not to go with the earlier target placed on removals by Europeans but to fall into line with the Americans. This is a little disappointing. The Chinese have made considerable strides in meeting their targets and are likely to meet them many years ahead of requirements in the Montreal protocol.</para>
<para>The points I want to make today have been touched upon in other contributions. Back in 1988 we were endeavouring to set in place a timetable which countries could sign up to and which industry was comfortable with. Industry had started on the development of replacement gases. At that stage there was not much discussion about which gases might replace the ozone-depleting gases. As things have developed and as alternatives have come on board, we have studied those alternatives and realised some of the phenomena that occur with the release of those gases into the atmosphere and then their percolating up to the stratosphere. We saw industry developing the alternatives: hydrochlorofluorocarbons, or HCFCs; hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs; and perfluorocarbons, or PFCs. We now know these are powerful greenhouse gases.</para>
<para>We are now tackling ozone depletion by taking measures leading to ozone protection where it intersects with the phenomenon of climate change. It is very important that we realise there is an interconnection. It makes it even more important for the government to understand that, even though this is only one grouping of greenhouse gases, these are important environmental phenomena that are the result of mankindâs use of the planet and they have to be tackled in an international and global way. We have to make sure we understand the phenomena created by synthetic greenhouse gases and that we look at the replacement of those gases with more benign substances which can have the same effect. Ammonia has been suggested as an alternative for refrigerants and mineral wool has been suggested as an alternative to plastic insulating foam.</para>
<para>There is a further intersect about which I was a little surprised. As reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 28 April this year, it has been suggested, in the monitoring of the Arctic ozone layer, that ozone depletion was at its worst recorded levels as a result not just of the percolation of ozone depleting gases but also of climate change itself. It is known that the stratospheric clouds that are over both poles in winter have some involvement in the phenomenon of ozone depletion. It is now being suggested that, because of climate change, the concentrations of stratospheric cloud are greater, and therefore ozone depletion is greater. It is now being suggested that ozone depletion is the result of not only greenhouse gases but also climate change. Increasing ozone depletion is not only caused by the greenhouse gases that are used to replace ozone depleting gases but is also a direct result of climate change. In fact, the European Union is investing $27 million in a five-year project to try to understand this phenomenon.</para>
<para>Returning to where I commenced tonight, I repeat that understanding of this phenomenon requires continuing scientific study. As we go forward, the overlap is getting greater. Given the stage we find ourselves at, in terms of our cooperation with the international community over matters to do with climate change, Australia must understand that it is better for us to be in the international cart that is represented by the Kyoto protocol than outside it, because these are cooperative efforts going forward. There is no reason to suggest that a phenomenon that happens in the Northern Hemisphere, which is increasing ozone depletion and creating ozone âholesââwhich, of course, are not holes but areas with a reduced level of ozoneâwould not be happening in the Southern Hemisphere.</para>
<para>Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, as a Tasmanian you would be aware that the so-called ozone hole in the Antarctic is stretching across not only Tasmania but also mainland Australia. The cost to Australia of not doing anything over the last 17 years would have been astronomical. The direct cost to human health is high, and the cost of the change in habitats and biospheres throughout Australia is also high. We only have to think of the effect of UV rays on plankton in the oceans, and the fine balance in the food chain for aquatic animals, which starts with plankton, to realise that this is a very important area of public policy.</para>
<para>It is not often understood and it has not been repeated in this debate that what we are talking about in the reduction of the production of the gases is one step. The next step is to realise that there are still a lot of CFCsâfor instance, in old refrigeratorsâwhich continue to be refrigerants. All the acts and regulations developed recognise that and have put in place proper procedures for the appropriate removal and storage of these gases from obsolete equipment. But it is often not recognised that some of these gases have very long lives when they reach the stratosphere. It may take anything from months to years for the gases to percolate, but once they get there their lives are over tens of years to hundreds of years. So we are taking action now to attempt to get back to levels measured 40 years ago, which may not happen until the middle of this century. This is an investment to make sure that we are doing things today that will have that longer term advantage. Again, if we contrast this to greenhouse, this is exactly what is being said. These are actions we have to take in our proper stewardship of the environment to ensure that later generations are afforded the protection required. To the extent that these matters require bipartisan agreement I think that, in the main, that has been achieved.</para>
<para>The opposition places before the House its concerns, which are set out in the second reading amendment passed by the Senate when it dealt with this legislation before sending it to us for our deliberations. The amendment expresses our absolute disquiet about the length time it has taken to put in place requirements for the appointment of a national industry board, leading to industry regulation and the way in which people working in the industry could be registered to carry out actions under the legislation. If we look at the timeline, we see that it was not until 31 May that the minister indicated that the Australian Refrigeration Council had been selected to administer the national authorisation and licensing system for the sale, use and handling of refrigerants that are ozone-depleting substances and synthetic greenhouse gases, and it was not until a week later that the details of the licensing scheme were announced.</para>
<para>The opposition acknowledge that transition arrangements have been put in place, but we are reliant on the skills and techniques of those who will be licensed under this act to ensure that we do not have the release of ozone-depleting gases into the atmosphere and then into the stratosphere and that we do not have the release of replacement gases that are now acknowledged as greenhouse gases. That was the point of the 2003 legislation. I think it has been acknowledged throughout the debate that all parties have worked together in this important area of public policy. We understand that we need to solve and ameliorate these problems and acknowledge that the partnership between government and industry will set out these achievements. Many of the uses made of ozone-depleting gases are illustrative of the way our society has developed. Artificial refrigeration and many other uses of these gases have been important to our economy. But it is also an example of the way we have gone about ozone protection that various studies of these pieces of legislation have, importantly, highlighted that this has been of benefit to our economy. So we see yet again an example of where we have the collision of measures being taken that are of benefit to the environment, of benefit to the economy and, because people have an understanding of collective action, of benefit to society. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI rise to address the <inline ref="S454">Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline>. I particularly want to focus the attention of the House on some of the gross mismanagement of vegetation in Queensland through the Queensland vegetation management legislation and on how the Queensland Labor Party through the leadership of Peter Beattie is failing to deliver what he thought he was going to deliver by his punitive measures. He is failing to deliver the positive outcomes to the ozone that could be delivered with good vegetation management laws. The Premier failed to work cooperatively with the key stakeholdersâthat is, the land-holders and the regional communitiesâbefore he brought that legislation forward. Yes, he went out to see them, and I was involved in some of the visits to parts of my electorate. But he failed in that process and, in the end, he just brought his legislation forward with little concern for the impact it would have on local landholders.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Our environment is part of our heritage, and it is important that we protect it for future generations. That is undisputed. Australia houses several unique environmental wonders of the world, including the Great Barrier Reef, the Daintree rainforests and, at the back of my electorate, the Simpson Desertâanother one of those great unique features of our landscape. Let us not forget the Lake Eyre basin and Lake Eyre itselfâwhat a unique feature that isâthe Queensland Mitchell grass plains and the brigalow lands. The Darling Downs is unique as an agricultural land in the Southern Hemisphere because of its features, its soil type and the richness of it. In the west of my electorate is the great Channel Country, where the inland rivers flow, and, of course, there is the Murray-Darling Basin.</para>
<para>All have unique vegetation, unique features and unique animal life. Last week we saw the launch of National Bilby Day in this parliament. The bilby is a wonderful little mammal that has for many years survived non-native predators like wild cats and foxes that have been introduced into Australia. Thank goodness for those people from my electorate, who were down in Canberra last week, who have done a tremendous job in protecting the bilby and establishing an ecosystem where they can breed in a natural environment. It is a fact that land-holders across Australia have been working since very early settlement to manage our native vegetation.</para>
<para>Australiaâs natural environment and landscape is one of the biggest drawcards in attracting both domestic and international tourists to our wonderful environmental features. The latest figures, for instanceâand this demonstrates just how important our environment isâshow that tourism contributes substantially to Australiaâs economy. Tourism is a $73 billion industry, which employs more than half a million Australians, with over 200,000 of those in regional areas.</para>

<para>âI just say to the honourable member that I am demonstrating the uniqueness of some of our environment and how we should protect it, because it does contribute to the ozone layer, and how through protecting our vegetation in our rural areas it will contribute to the protection of the ozone layer. I am just highlighting an issue relating to tourism. The health of the ozone layer is important to tourism as well as to good vegetation management.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>To complete what I was saying about the tourism industry, tourism earns something like $17.3 billion. Australia earns more export dollarsâand this is interestingâfrom tourism than from the export of coal and wool combined. The honourable member might just reflect on that for a moment, because we know that coal is one of those energy sources that is not a positive on our environment or the ozone. We know we cannot live without it at the moment; it is important. So, when you consider that tourism can replace some of these exports over time, tourism will be a great economic driver for the nation. I just point that out to the House and for the honourable member in the face of his intervention.</para>
<para>The government in Queensland introduced into the parliament the Vegetation Management Amendment Bill, which was legislating to ban broad-scale tree clearing of remnant native vegetation by December 2006. There were several purposes for that legislation, one of which was to contribute to greenhouse abatement. That was one of the Premierâs intentions. It is a known fact that trees contribute to reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and, hence, the potential to minimise the ozone being further damaged by industry emission sources such as motor vehicles, which we all obviously drive, factories and coal fired power stations. So trees play an important part in the environment and an important part in contributing to greenhouse abatement.</para>
<para>The Queensland governmentâs vegetation management legislationâI will be kind and say âinadvertentlyââis having a detrimental impact on the environmental ecosystems of parts of Queensland. The only reason I can see for the Premier acting in the way he did is that he was after Greens preferences. He was not really considering ozone; he was after preferences. He should have had that foremost in his mind in addition to his being able to work in a positive and cooperative manner with the land-holders of Queensland. Had he been prepared to work with the land-holders of Queensland and get suitable vegetation management laws in place, it would have been a win-win for both the ozone layer and the livelihoods of land-holders. If the Queensland government had worked with land-holders, there would have been a positive outcome for the regional towns as well, because they are just so dependent on the jobs created by the enterprises on the farm lands, the pastoral lands, around those towns.</para>
<para>On a recent visit to Quilpie in the west of my electorateâI was there with my parliamentary colleague Senator Ron Boswell, the Leader of The Nationals in the SenateâI inspected a property in the mulga lands where the legislation in Queensland is having a detrimental effect. I have linked trees to the ozone, so I think I have the right to continue pointing out where bad laws will have a detrimental impact on the ozone. Stephen Tully is a well-respected and knowledgeable land-holder. He is a descendent of some of the first settlers in the Quilpie region. The families of some of the first settlers are still there. They have been there since 1874. We toured parts of his property and, of course, as we all know, that part of Queensland is in exceptional drought. It has been in exceptional drought for the last two years. It will have to be rolled into a third year. We would all love to see rain so that is not necessaryâbut it looks as though it will be. There has been some rain in the region, but not exceptional drought-breaking rain.</para>
<para>On Mr Tullyâs property the grasses have been eaten out and have not been able to regenerate because of the exceptional drought. Mr Tully, his family and a large number of the pastoralists in that region have harvested mulga trees, which are a source of fodder and nutriment for animals in times of drought. A lot of the land in western Queensland has been mapped by satellites. These satellites are a wonderful tool for all of us, but they are inaccurately describing some of the vegetation on Mr Tullyâs property. Some mulga trees are described as âbastard mulgaâ when in fact they are not in that region; they are elsewhere on the property.</para>
<para>In order for Mr Tully and other land-holders in the mulga ecosystems of western Queensland to sustain their stock, as they have done for more than a hundred yearsâthe mulga regenerates in the good seasons and is conserved for the bad seasonsâthey have to harvest that timber. They would have harvested it in the early days with an axe. Later on it would have been with a chainsaw, and then with a tractor. While in some cases that practice is still allowed under a permit, it is becoming more difficult day by day and year by year as a result of the legislation introduced by the Queensland Labor government, under the premiership of Peter Beattie.</para>
<para>One of the aspects of harvesting mulga is that when the trees or the low branches are laid on the ground they protect the soil. We have only got to look at a mulch system in our own garden to see that when we put mulch on top of the ground we protect the soil and conserve moisture underneath it. Mr Tully was able to show us that, with the last few years of limited rains, trees have been harvested for their fodder but underneath the branches that remainâwhich have been acting like a mulchânew green plants were emerging. They had germinated. They were also protected from the livestock. So what you have here is some grass and some weeds coming through. It will grow through the mulch if the tree or its branches are allowed to remain on the ground. The mulch also creates a ground cover, which prevents erosion when the rains come. Mr Tully was able to show us how he and his forebearsâhis familyâhave successfully used mulga since the late 1890s. They only harvest it when they want to use it as drought fodder.</para>
<para>Another point I want to make in relation to the harvesting of mulga is that, if you do not harvest the mulga, the tree will of course grow to its full height and, as it matures, the leaves become very dry. It cannot produce the same sorts of benefits that a young tree, green grass or crops produce for carbon abatement; it cannot create a carbon sink. So by harvesting the mulga and allowing it to regenerate when the seasons come and by using the fodder harvested to feed drought affected stock, you end up with a win-win situation.</para>
<para>To my mind, there is no-one better to determine whether or not mulga should be harvested than the land-holders who have been doing it sustainably for 150-odd years. Why a satellite map should be the only determinant for this outcome, I am not quite sure. It should be used as a useful tool, but it should be used in conjunction with the knowledge of the land-holders and of course the regional bodies who are very involved in the agricultural or the pastoral scene, as in this case.</para>
<para>An example of what happens when you do not manage your vegetation was clearly demonstrated right here in Canberra with the bushfires. The national parks were not being managed and we saw the tragic consequences of that with the bushfires. When the wind conditions changed the fires raced towards Canberra and, sadly, people lost their lives and over 500 homes were destroyed. Had the vegetation in the national parks been managed to prevent bushfires, those sorts of consequences would not have occurred. The other element of those fires is that the smoke from them is a net negative for our ozone.</para>
<para>If we manage our vegetationâour timber resources and our grassesâwe can have a win-win for the environment. I believe that, importantly, the issue is about management rather than about the punitive measures that we have seen introduced into Queensland. The land-holders in Queensland who want to work with government to produce sustainable ecosystems are not in the business of destroying the ecosystem. They are not in the business of wanting to destroy their own livelihoods. It is their livelihood; it is what sustains their families.</para>
<para>I know time is short, but I want to move very quickly to the recommendations of the Productivity Commission report which was commissioned by this government in the last term of government. That report, which was brought down in June last year, is titled <inline font-style="italic">Impacts of native vegetation and biodiversity regulations</inline>. I commend that report to the opposition, because the conclusions are the basis on which I believe we should be looking at vegetation management at a national level. I refer to recommendation 10.3, which reflects what I have been saying about fodder harvesting. It states:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Ongoing efforts are required to improve the quality of data and science on which native vegetation and biodiversity policy decisions are based, particularly âon-the groundâ assessments to test the accuracy of vegetation mapping based on satellite imagery.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is the very point that I was raising in relation to the problems Stephen Tully has been having. That is a recommendation from the Productivity Commission report. All this leads to having a positive outcome on the environment and also on the ozone layer, if we manage our vegetation properly and sustainably.</para>
<para>It was found that there needed to be an improvement in the regulatory regimes to enhance the transparency, the consistency and the accountability of decision making. In particular, recommendation 10.4 highlights several possible approaches, and I would commend those to others, because of the limited time I have here. One of the other recommendations that I believe is particularly important is 10.5. It states:</para>
<quote>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>greater use should be made of the extensive knowledge of landholders and local communities â¦</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>some across-the-board rules â¦ could be relaxed and replaced with requirements that meet environmental objectives but which reflect regional environmental characteristics and agricultural practices.</para>
</item>
</list>
</quote>
<para class="block">That fits in exactly with what I have been talking about in relation to the mulga lands of western Queenslandââthat reflect environmental characteristics and agricultural practicesâ. Finally, the report also saysâand this is important in the vegetation laws of Queenslandâthat regulations assert authority of ownership over the private propertyâs remnant vegetation. Land-holders are held accountable for the management of the vegetation while being left uncompensated for this ongoing day-to-day management. Incentives for land-holders to voluntarily manage and conserve native vegetation are therefore undermined. Subsequently, when regulation reduces the private value of land-holders or native vegetation, incentives to manage it are diminished.</para>
<para>In light of the Productivity Commission report and the comments and the experience of the land-holders of Queenslandâand I visited the mulga lands of western Queensland only two weeks agoâI commend to this government and all governments across Australia the work of the Productivity Commission in bringing forward sustainable vegetation management rules. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âin replyâIn summarising the debate on the<inline ref="R2315">Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline>, I wish to do three things. Firstly, I want to address the points raised by both government and opposition members. Secondly, I wish to address some of the issues more generally in relation to the ozone and synthetic gas amendments. Thirdly, I want to outline some key points in the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust amendments. In looking at this billâand I wish to thank all of the speakersâwe have had a series of points from both government and opposition members.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I want to address the points raised by the three opposition members: the member for Grayndler, the member for Throsby and the member for Scullin. Their points really fall into two categories, other than a general agreement with the governmentâs policy and approach on ozone protection and endorsement of the actions in relation to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. The two criticisms that the members of the opposition have raised fall into these categories: firstly, there has been an attack on the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell, who is currently in Korea having enormous success in leading the international campaign against whaling and getting ready to see his reforms in relation to ozone and synthetic gas come into being.</para>
<para>The criticism was that the minister had in some way delayed the appointment of the refrigeration and airconditioning industry board to issue licences for refrigeration and airconditioning. I want to set down that there were two absolutely clear principles which the minister adopted. The first was to make sure that any appointment of a group which would regulate would be contested, that there would not just be a desire but a responsibility to ensure that a critical position such as that was fully and properly contested. The minister was not happy that there was sufficient contestation. He made a very clear, very simple ruling that we had to open it and we had to make sure that there was a proper chance for competition. We had to make sure that that was the case.</para>
<para>The second principle which he applied was that he had to be prudent, that we had to see that this was a safe, appropriate body capable of protecting this industry and ensuring that licences were allocated properly. So he had to have the best and they had to be up to standard. For taking time to do that, we make no apology. It is utterly the appropriate thing to do.</para>
<para>In the second criticism levelled by our friends in the opposition, they drew a comparison between what Australia is doing in relation to ozone protectionâand they acknowledge that it is an outstanding set of activities which go back both to this government and to the previous government; and I recognise the work of the previous governmentâwhat it is doing in relation to greenhouse gases. That is the criticism. On both ozone protection and greenhouse gas abatement the Australian government has an outstanding contemporary record. The key thing to remember is that not only is the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act world-leading legislation but also we are achieving our targets in terms of our Montreal and Kyoto protocol obligations in relation to greenhouse gas. Australia is one of the only countries in the world to actually be achieving both our ozone and our greenhouse gas targets.</para>
<para>We happen to take exception with the mechanism within the Kyoto protocol because we believe that it could well have a net detrimental effect to the general approach of dealing with climate change and greenhouse gases. But we have met our targets and we are one of the very few Annex 1 or developed world nations to be so doing. We are in an almost unique group to be achieving both our Montreal protocol targets in relation to ozone and the Kyoto protocol targets in relation to greenhouse. That is an exceptional situation.</para>
<para>The second point that I want to make today is in relation to the ozone and synthetic gas amendments contained within this bill. We agree and accept that there is a critical need to protect against ozone depletion. That threat is real and tangible, but there is extraordinary progress. Australia has performed exceptionally by international standards, and has been progressing very well.</para>
<para>The third point is that within the ozone protection element of this bill there are two important amendments. The bill amends and streamlines the licensing requirements for the import or export of used or recycled methyl bromide or hydrochlorofluorocarbons and, in addition, it amends and requires that Australian manufacturers of synthetic greenhouse gases report to the government consistent with the existing requirements for importers and exporters of synthetic greenhouse gases.</para>
<para>This brings me to the last part of my summaryâthe Sydney Harbour Federation Trust amendments. I am delighted to be able to make this summary in the presence of the member for North Sydney, who has fought with absolute ferocity to protect and expand the areas under the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. When we look at the seven sites of the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust, we apply two key principles to dealing with them. The first key principle is public accessâopening these lands to public access for the first time in many cases not just for 10 years, not just for a generation, but forever. That is an extraordinary legacy which will be left by the member for North Sydney, the member for Warringah and others involved in the establishment of the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. The second principle is in relation to the use of these public areas. This may include use for marine science, marine education and for the communityâall of the things for which the community has pushed and which are currently being delivered.</para>
<para>The next step is in relation to HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Platypus</inline>. That submarine base should be turned over as quickly as possible from defence land to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. The member for North Sydney has been unstinting. He has set a deadline and we are working to that a deadline. This bill puts forward a practical land swap that is all about protecting the environment, and it delivers on that.</para>
<para>Ultimately I thank everyone who has spoken on the bill, both government and opposition. I thank the government speakers, the members for Bowman, Fisher and Maranoa, who talked about the legacy that we leave to future generations. They summarised what we are doing in relation to the ozone amendments and in relation to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. It is about leaving a legacy for the next generation, and with that I am delighted to commend the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 to the House and I urge its speedy passage.</para>

It is thought that the fraud apparently started in September 2004 and the National Australia Bank first reported a related suspicious transaction in December 2004. In question time today I said that the National Australia Bank had reported in September, but it in fact was December 2004.</para>

</motion>
<para class="block">The <inline ref="S455">Family Law Amendment Bill 2005</inline> is a part of the Howard governmentâs continuing reform of the family law system. The bill contains a range of amendments to the Family Law Act 1975, designed to improve the operation of the current family law system. Some of these are technical amendments intended to improve the actâs operation, such as amendments to modernise the terminology used. Other amendments relate to procedural matters, including appeal processes.</para>
<para>These amendments to the Family Law Act 1975 are ongoing reforms, separate from the package of family law reforms that respond to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs report, <inline font-style="italic">Every picture tells a story</inline>. The government has announced part of its response to that report, and I will introduce an exposure draft of legislative amendments shortly for comment.</para>
<para>Following its introduction into the House on 1 April last year, the Family Law Amendment Bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which reported in July 2004. The committee recommended that the bill should proceed, subject to a number of amendments.</para>
<para>The bill lapsed with the proroguing of parliament before last yearâs election and was therefore reintroduced in the other place in March 2005. The recommendations made by the Senate committee have been taken on board and are incorporated in the bill before you.</para>
<para>The bill contains amendments to address the issue of parenting orders not working in practice. A number of parenting orders, particularly those made by consent, are found not to actually work. The bill contains amendments to allow a court of its own motion to vary orders relating to children. This is aimed at situations where contravention proceedings have arisen because the original parenting order is unworkable and allows the court to fix the problem before it leads to further contravention proceedings.</para>
<para>Another important amendment in the bill provides a right for persons who are determined not to be a parent of a child, through DNA testing or by other means, to recover any moneys paid or property transferred for the benefit of that child under maintenance orders. During its passage in another place, both government amendments and Democrat amendments were made to this section. The government proposes to introduce further amendments to remove the Democrat amendments, to ensure that this provision gives a clear and predictable resultâthat is, if a person is found not to be a parent of a child, and that person has paid child maintenance under a court order for that child, the person can expect to bring a claim in the court that made the original order, and to recover what has been paid, unless there are exceptional circumstances.</para>
<para>A number of amendments in this bill clarify the Family Courtâs powers in a range of areas, including the courtâs rule-making powers to support the Family Law Rules 2004 which commenced on 29 March 2004, and in relation to the ability of the court to change the venue of proceedings and to clarify the effect of offers of settlement.</para>
<para>The bill also clarifies a number of issues relating to the operation of appeals. One amendment removes the power of the full court to issue a certificate that no special leave to appeal is needed from the High Court to appeal to that Court where âan important question of law or public interestâ is involved. This amendment was made in response to a recommendation of the Australian Law Reform Commission with which the High Court and the Family Court both agreed. The government accepted the recommendation as it considers that the High Court, through the special leave to appeal process, should be in control of what matters are dealt with by that court.</para>
<para>The bill provides for the transfer of family law proceedings from state courts of summary jurisdictionâthat is, magistrates and local courts, direct to the Federal Magistrates Court on the state courtsâ own initiative. Many proceedings instituted in state courts in relation to property with a value of over $20,000 or in relation to contested parenting orders will be appropriate for determination by the Federal Magistrates Court.</para>
<para>Currently the Family Law Act provides for transfers in such matters from courts of summary jurisdiction on the courtâs own initiative to the Family Court but not to the Federal Magistrates Court. The Family Court then transfers appropriate matters on to the Federal Magistrates Court. This amendment will enable matters to be transferred directly to the Federal Magistrates Court and therefore reduce delays.</para>
<para>The bill also widens the range of matters which can be the subject of private arbitration. Currently the matters that can be dealt with by a private arbitrator under the Family Law Act are limited to matters which relate to property, spousal maintenance and maintenance agreements. The bill expands the scope to include financial agreements and certain orders in relation to superannuation. Parties must consent before matters can be referred to private arbitration.</para>
<para>Also included in part 16 of the bill is an amendment to the Bankruptcy Act 1966 to support reforms recently made under the Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Act 2005 that relate to bankruptcy and family law reform. This amendment will ensure that the Family Court of Western Australia, along with the Family Court of Australia, acquires all necessary bankruptcy jurisdictions in concurrent family law proceedings where a party is bankrupt. Part 17 also supplements the reforms that are made in that bill, reinforcing the role of the bankruptcy trustee as representing the interests of all creditors in family law property proceedings where a party is bankrupt or subject to a personal insolvency agreement.</para>
<para>The bill also modernises the terminology of the act to terms which are commonly used and widely recognised, thereby increasing the publicâs understanding of the act and accessibility to family law. This should be particularly beneficial in aiding self-represented litigants. It will no doubt surprise many that the term âdivorceâ does not appear in the act. The term âdissolution of marriageâ is simply replaced with âdivorceâ.</para>
<para>There are a range of other minor amendments in this bill.</para>
<para>The government is committed to enhancing and making more accessible and efficient the family law system and this bill is part of the governmentâs commitment to that goal.</para>
<para>Full details of the measures contained in this bill are included in the revised explanatory memorandum to the bill, which I table.</para>
<para>I commend the bill to the House.</para>
<para>Leave granted for second reading debate to continue immediately.</para>

<para>âAs the Attorney-General indicated, the <inline ref="S455">Family Law Amendment Bill 2005</inline> is very similar to the Family Law Amendment Bill 2004, which was introduced in the last parliament. That bill was examined by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which made a series of very useful recommendations. Labor is pleased to see that the government has clearly taken on board many of those recommendations in the preparation of the new bill. This has been one of many examples of the Senate committee process facilitating constructive bipartisan work on important policy issues.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As with the last bill, Labor welcomes this bill as a positive contribution to improving the existing Family Law Act. This is an omnibus bill dealing with amendments in 16 parts. For the most part this bill is non-controversial. Many are technical changes that will ease practical difficulties faced by the courts and court users. Part 10 deals with terminology. This may seem trivial, but in fact it is very important that the Family Law Act makes use of plain English. This is, as we note, an area of law that touches more people than almost any other. It is also an area where, as a result of economic circumstances, there are a substantial number of self-represented litigants. If ever there was a case for making an effort to clean up arcane language in our statutes, it is in this act and we commend the government for that.</para>
<para>Part 5 would extend the range of matters that can be dealt with through private arbitration. This creates a welcome new pathway for certain cases that do not require the expense and delay of litigation but cannot be resolved through mediation alone. Part 16 cleans up a gap in the recently passed Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Bill to ensure that the Family Court of Western Australia has the same jurisdiction as the Family Court of Australia in the area of crossover between family law and bankruptcy law.</para>
<para>There are some parts of the bill that are controversial, and these have been the subject of amendments in the other place. The most important is part 14. This would allow claims for the retrospective recovery of maintenance by a person who finds out later that they are not the childâs biological parent. Labor supports the intention of this provision. As I will note shortly, it would have limited application, but we have serious reservations about the sorts of outcomes it could produce if applied too rigidly.</para>
<para>In most instances, we are talking here about cases where a mistake has been made as opposed to deliberate deception. That is, we are talking about a case where one person was thought to be the father, and a maintenance order was made requiring them to pay maintenance to the mother to support the child. It is a situation where everyone has shared in the mistaken belief: the mother, the purported father and even the court. The question is really about who should bear the cost of the mistake. A good argument can be made for both sides. The man can rightly say that the maintenance order should never have made and that he should never have been required to pay for a child that is not his. But the mother could also argue convincingly that she is incapable of paying all the money back while continuing to support herself and her child or other children in circumstances where a genuine mistake occurred. The Family Court, of course, cannot be required to force a mother and her children into povertyâand should not be required to do soâto correct an honest mistake.</para>
<para>Labor thinks there is only one fair way to deal with this dilemma, and that is to ensure that there is sufficient judicial discretion to have regard to the entirety of circumstances. In short, every case could be different. In some cases mothers may well be doing it tough, and recovery of the full amount could be disastrous for them and their children. In other cases, the mother might have ended up in a new relationship or in secure employment whereas the purported father may have struggled to find the money to pay the maintenance every fortnight. In some cases it will have been an honest mistake; in others a court would regard seriously circumstances of deliberate deception. In some cases the man will have acted quickly upon finding out that he is not the biological father; in others he may have left it for many years, with the result that recovery will be all the more onerous for the mother. We cannot predict all the permutations that will arise and devise a formula that is fair in all circumstances. We need to trust the authority and wisdom of the courts to closely examine each case and make an appropriate order in the circumstances. For this reason, Labor has been anxious to ensure the bill provides the courts with adequate discretion over the amount that is recovered and how it is to be paid. In the Senate, Labor supported an amendment that would have that effect.</para>
<para>It is also important to ensure that, where a mother has been required to repay maintenance under these provisions, she is able, in turn, to recover maintenance from the actual biological father of the child. It would hardly be fair if a mother could be liable to retrospectively repay maintenance when the biological father cannot himself be found accountable. Moreover, in many cases the mother will have forgone other income in reliance on the maintenance. In particular, she will have received less in social security benefits. This makes it all the more important that the mother have a right to retrospectively claim maintenance from the actual father.</para>
<para>Labor raised this concern with the Attorney-Generalâs office and we were advised that the Family Law Act already provides the court with the power to award backdated maintenance. We received advice from the Attorney-Generalâs adviser which I will quote for the record and perhaps to assist in some way in the future interpretation of the legislation. The adviser replied:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I am advised by our Department that a right for the mother to claim maintenance from the biological father already exists under Division 7 of Part VII of the Family Law Act in respect of children to which the new s66X would apply. Under section 66G of the Act, the court has a wide discretion to make any child maintenance order it considers appropriate against the parent of a child. The period covered and the amount of that order would be a matter for the court, considering the principal object in Division 7 to ensure that children receive a proper level of financial support from their parents.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">We are satisfied with this explanation. It is the case that section 66G provides a wide discretion for the court to make orders for maintenance, and nothing seems to prevent them making backdated or retrospective orders if that is appropriate. As I said, this goes a long way to easing the concerns that Labor had with this particular provision.</para>
<para>I should note here also that this provision does not have as profound an effect as I flagged earlierâto the extent that it is already the case that retrospective repayment of maintenance can be ordered by a court where the maintenance has been paid under the administrative assessment scheme of the Child Support (Assessment) Act, in particular under section 143 of that act. This bill would affect only those cases where the maintenance order has been made under the Family Law Act. We are advised by the Attorney-Generalâs office that only around 2.8 per cent of child support liabilities currently administered by the Child Support Agency arise under Family Law Act maintenance ordersâand that figure includes some spousal maintenance orders that would not be affected by this amendment. We are talking about a very small minority of cases that could be affected by this bill. Most of the cases that would be affected by the change are those where the maintenance order was made before 1989. This means that not only does the bill affect a small minority of cases of mistaken paternity but that that minority is clearly defined and ever shrinking.</para>
<para>As noted, it is desirable to bring the regime under the Family Law Act into accord with the Child Support (Assessment) Act. Having considered these issues, Labor are inclined to support a change to the Family Law Act that would ensure mistaken paternity cases are dealt with under that act as they are under the child support act. However, where we disagree with the government is on the words used to obtain that objective. We therefore supported the amendment in the Senate because it brings the language of the Family Law Act closer to that of the child support act. In doing so, the court has been given a greater discretion to ensure that mistaken paternity can be dealt with in the manner most just and equitable in the circumstances. In this way, it is an amendment which has improved the bill.</para>
<para>The other part of the bill that might be controversial is part 1, concerning the parenting compliance regime. The provision in this part would do two things: provide that the court can order parents to participate in counselling or parenting programs before making orders in enforcement proceedings; and provide the court with the power to amend parenting orders where enforcement proceedings have been brought but either no contravention was found or there was a reasonable excuse for the contravention.</para>
<para>With respect to the first of these, it is already possible for the court to order a couple to participate in counselling or parenting programs in other types of proceedings. This change is extending that power to enforcement proceedings. This is a positive move, as counselling and parenting programs have proven very successful at getting to and resolving the issues at the heart of noncompliance. We as members would have seen many instances of constituents coming in and, in one way or another, expressing their grief about serial noncompliance. It is obviously desirable all round if they can be resolved appropriately. Of course, counselling is not appropriate in all cases, especially where there is a history of violence, but we are satisfied that the protections already in the Family Law Act provide sufficient guidance to the court as to when these orders should and should not be made.</para>
<para>The second change in this part allows the court to vary parenting orders in enforcement proceedings, even if no contravention is found or there was a reasonable excuse for contravention. This will allow the court to iron out the practical or other problems in parenting orders that gave rise to the complaint of noncompliance. In some cases it will also allow a reasonable excuse for noncompliance, such as an apprehension of violence, to form the basis for a substantive change to the orders. Currently these changes require separate proceedings for variation of orders. It makes a lot of practical sense for courts to be given the power to deal with variation at the same time as hearing enforcement proceedings.</para>
<para>The National Network of Womenâs Legal Services has recommended that this new power be limited to certain cases, such as those where violence is an issue. When this was raised in the Senate committee on the 2004 bill, the Attorney-Generalâs Department advised the committee that the courtâs power would be effectively limited by the considerations the court must always have when making parenting orders: the best interests of the child and the factors set out in section 68F(2). Labor is comfortable with the response provided by the Attorney-Generalâs Department.</para>
<para>In summary, although this is a useful bill containing several practical reforms to the workings of the family law system, we did have some concerns with part 14 in its original form. But we believe those concerns have substantially been addressed by the amendment that was made in the Senate. Given that amendment, the opposition will be supporting the bill in the House.</para>

<para>âBecause of the time frame allocated to this debate it is necessary to reduce at the request of the whips the amount of time taken to speak on the <inline ref="R2316">Family Law Amendment Bill 2005</inline> to five minutes. I will therefore have to truncate somewhat what I was otherwise going to say. There is probably no area of Australian law which affects people more significantly than family law. Tragically, many marriages in our country collapse. Indeed, I suspect this is the case right around the Western world. It is incumbent on governments, therefore, to have the very best family law system to endeavour to manage, on behalf of families, in the best possible way a situation which is often less than entirely desirable.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Australian government is committed to doing all that it can to ensure that Australian families are given the best possible chance to live their lives with as few unwanted disruptions as possible. The Family Law Amendment Bill 2005 does back up the commitment of the government to ensuring the best possible outcomes for Australian families, particularly given family breakdown. The bill endeavours to ensure that the most vulnerable during these times of immense stress and hardship, the children, are given the best support and protection that can be provided by a legal system.</para>
<para>There is a long list of improvements afforded by this bill to the Family Law Act 1975 and, as has been mentioned previously, a number of these changes have come forward as a result of a Senate inquiry report. The amendments are ongoing reforms, as I think the Attorney has pointed out, quite different from the package of family law reforms which will respond to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs report, <inline font-style="italic">Every picture tells a story</inline>. There will be a government response to that report and legislation will be brought forward, possibly in the form of an exposure draft.</para>
<para>The changes in this bill, however, include clarification of the own motion powers of the courts to modify parenting orders and the courtsâ power to order parties to attend counselling or post-separation parenting programs. There are changes in the provisions relating to the costings as well as offers of settlement to allow aggrieved parties to settle out of court, thereby avoiding the draining expenses of legal costs and further pressure on family members. The bill includes an increase in flexibility in courts in their dealings with parties who breach parenting orders, giving the court power to order a suspended prison sentence. This deterrent will be a useful tool in encouraging the compliance of some family members and there are provisions for sentences to be revoked at a later date. There is simplification of the processes involved with issuing a warrant for a parent who fails to comply with a parenting order and an expansion of the various matters that can be dealt with through private negotiation and arbitration. This will include issues such as superannuation and other financial issues.</para>
<para>It also follows up on the desire of government to encourage the use of alternatives to the courts to once again reduce the psychological and financial burdens of the courtroom. There is an ability to change the venue of a proceeding, replicating the powers also available to the High Court and to the Federal Magistrates Court, and clarification of the definitions of those depositions that could be set aside by the court. This becomes relevant when one party has made a submission that has the sole purpose of counteracting or nullifying an existing or anticipated court order. There is an extension of the list of procedural applications for the purpose of the appeal provisions, and provision for the magistrateâs court or local court to have the power to transfer Family Court proceedings directly to the Federal Magistrates Court in order to reduce unnecessary delays. The bill includes modernisation and clarification of some of the language in the Family Law Act to make laws more user friendly. For example, the term âproceedings for principal reliefâ is replaced by the term âdivorce and validity of marriage proceedingsâ.</para>
<para>The amendments in the bill also allowâand this may surprise someâthe use of the word âdivorceâ in legislation for the first time. There is clarification of guidelines related to when leave to appeal is required and the introduction of power enabling the court to stay or dismiss the appeal where the court is of the opinion that the appellant has not presented a proper ground for the appeal. The bill allows the removal of a time-consuming procedural hurdle whereby the full court of the Family Court is required to issue the certificate requiring the High Court to hear an appeal. There is a provision that a person who is found by the court not to be a parent of a child will be able to recover the money outlaid or the money transferred for the child under a maintenance orderâand this is a very important initiative. Whether a person is a parent or not, of course, is most often determined through DNA testing.</para>
<para>The bill gives judges of the Family Court the ability to delegate to judicial registrars, allowing them to make orders that vary parenting orders in relation to complying with existing court orders. It ensures that bankruptcy jurisdiction is correctly given to the Family Court of Western Australia, as it is to the Family Court, to supplement reforms made under the Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Bill 2005. It varies the Bankruptcy Act to add a provision previously omitted that limits the application of the Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Bill 2005.</para>
<para>In summaryâas, alas, my five minutes has almost elapsedâthe amendments relate to procedural matters such as appeal processes and improvements and clarification in terminology, all designed to improve the operation of the current family law system. All of these amendments address the issue of parenting orders issued by the court that are failing to deliver on their intended outcomes. These outcomes, as I mentioned at the commencement of this speech, are intended to improve the smooth operation of the Family Law Act 1975, with the overall motivation of protecting parents and children from as many as possible of the difficulties associated with family breakdown. I commend this bill to the House.</para>

<para>âI express my disappointment that we have such a short time to speak, but I live in expectation of a wonderful change coming forward from the Attorney-General to the Family Law Act based on the comprehensive inquiry conducted by the members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. The inquiry report to which I refer is <inline font-style="italic">Every picture tells a story</inline>. I believe it was a report done over a short period of time and it proposes some substantial changes. I look forward to the governmentâs and the Attorneyâs response to the recommendations of the committee.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I note that the changes in the legislation tonight do move in part in some areas towards the recommendations of that report. Substantially, this legislation is that which was offered to the House prior to the elections and which lapsed with the proroguing of the parliament. We now have that legislation back with some changes. I note in particular that parenting orders are a part of these proposals and that the cost and offers of settlement, enforcement processes and private arbitration, changes of venue and other matters are involved in these changes.</para>
<para>I have always considered the Family Law Act would be better entitled the âdissolution of marriage actâ, but that is a personal view and I am pleased to see that in this legislation there are some changes which reflect common usage by replacing references such as âdissolution of marriageâ with the term âdivorceâ, which is simple and easily understood. There is no doubt that in this area of intense human relationships the warfare that is conducted or may be conducted by a smallish percentage of those whose marriage is dissolved or is on the point of breakdown is a terrible thing to see and is a daunting thing to cope with as far as a legislative framework is concerned. I am very pleased to see in this legislation that there is a shift towards the prospect of private arbitration, which can be recommended by the court. I think that is a direction that needs to be pursued and, I hope, will be pursued: firstly, conciliation; then arbitration, if necessary; and finally a court decision at the end of the day. That court decision must be the indication that there has been a final and absolute breakdown and the judge has to make the settlement.</para>
<para>Australia has one of most legally interventionist forms of family law in the world. Other parts of the world, generally those of English-speaking traditions, tend to look to a process whereby the partners in the dissolution take greater responsibility for the resolution of the problems that they themselves have created, so they are asked to resolve, under supervision, matters such as the custody of the children and the settlement of property. I believe that process is superior to the one that we have pursued for such a long time and I suspect that there will be changes to that process. I note that even in this legislation there is pressure to refer more matters to a federal magistrate. In many ways it is a crazy thing that 60 per cent of the work of the High Court of Australia is taken up by immigration mattersâand we have been dealing with immigration matters today. Family law matters are dealt with by a superior court and I do not know that that is necessarily the process that we are looking for. A superior court normally requires rules of evidence along with other very tight rules of the court that cannot be fulfilled by the Family Court. Much of the evidence given in the Family Court is evidence that is untested and simply taken on hearsay. I think unproven evidence is dangerous because it encourages people to make extraordinary claims and statements which do not have to be justified.</para>
<para>I note that the costs of and the processes of changing orders are dealt with here. I think it is a very good move to waive the costs and make the changing of court orders a simpler factor, and the compliance problem is in part dealt with too. I look forward to a future occasion when we will deal with substantial changes which have been agreed to by both sides of the House, and with that progress I trust that we and the Attorney, in particular, will be successful in the advances we seek to make.</para>

<para>âI have the same time limit as other speakers have, so rather than go through this bill in detail, item by item, I would like to put it in the context of some of the broader changes that this government is looking to make to value families in our society. I would also like to look at some of the linkages of areas that the changes to this bill make to the broader changes that are coming in. The <inline ref="R2316">Family Law Amendment Bill 2005</inline> is part of the governmentâs continuing reform of the family law system. The changes that are being proposed will be the most significant changes in over 30 years. In the budget this year nearly $400 million was put aside over four years as one of the biggest investments to be made in the family law system. Importantly, what we are looking at here are not just changes in legislation. The government are looking to fundamentally change the way that Australia looks at its families, the way we support them in marriage and, where necessary, the way that family breakdowns are then handled.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The comprehensive package includes an expansion of services to assist families, as well as changes to the laws and the courts. Together, these changes aim to promote the involvement of both parents in their childrenâs lives, to reduce the impact of conflict on the children and to reduce the enormous emotional and financial costs to families and the community of relationship breakdown and separation. A key part of the governmentâs initiatives is a network of 65 family relationship centres. As well as providing information, advice and dispute resolution, the centres will work closely with other services and agencies and will refer families to the help that they need. One of the key elements of this package is that we are looking to provide the opportunity for families to have a less adversarial approach to dealing with disputes and relationship breakdowns. I am pleased to say that at the moment in Parramatta, in Sydney, family law courtsâas their own initiative and using consent by parents rather than legislationâare already seeing terrific developments in terms of a reduction in conflict, a reduction in time in the courts and a reduction in cost as well as better outcomes through an increased level of mediation and the use of direct discussion between parents and judges. The courts are using community and other services to provide the kind of support and counselling that families need.</para>
<para>Importantly, these services, under the governmentâs proposed reforms, will have a large proactive element as well as supporting people during separation. The services will also aim to reduce conflict after separation and help non-resident parents maintain contact with their children. The nonresident can be either a mother or a father but, generally speaking, it is a father. I cannot overstate the importance of fathers in the lives of their children. These reforms are an important step to making sure that that contact is possible. So while this bill that is being considered today contains important amendments to the Family Law Act 1975, it does not represent the package of law reforms that I have just talked about. But it does provide the start of some enabling legislation which will support those reforms.</para>
<para>As other members have mentioned, this legislation has been to the Senate, which proposed a number of amendments which have been incorporated, so today I wish to touch briefly on the aspects of increasing coordination between agencies and services, suspended sentences, disputed parenthood and increased scope for private arbitration. The aspect of coordination with other services is really one of looking at the issue of parenting orders that are not working. As most members of parliament would know, this is one of the significant sources of discontentâin fact, more than that: despairâfor many parents who do not have their children resident with them. I welcome these moves in this bill, as the measures underpin the concept of increasing coordination between the courts and other services that can help the two parties come together to reduce the conflict which affects their children. They increase the ability of both parents to have a role in their childrenâs lives. Professor Parkinson, in his report on reforming the child support system, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">There is strong evidence that dealing with separating parents through the legal system alone can entrench conflict, rather than resolve it.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Because the government sees that and recognises that, not only through this bill but through other measures, it is continuing to explore the best way to have good outcomes for children. A Griffith University report on childrenâs contact services highlighted the very good outcomes that the childrenâs contact services have. Through some of the broader reforms I mentioned earlier, the government has committed an additional $17 million to fund 30 new contact services throughout Australia. The bill also talks about suspended sentences. In terms of easing the angst of parents who see that orders that have been made by the court are being breached continually, the option for the courts to be able to impose a suspended sentence means that there is a very real lever that they can use to provide the incentive for the parent who has custody to provide access to the other parent.</para>
<para>On the issue of disputed parenthood, I welcome the move to make it easier for people who can prove that they are not the biological parent to reclaim money. A gentleman in my electorate of Wakefield has been in this situation and went bankrupt through the actions of the CSA before it was proved that he is not the father. I notice that Professor Parkinson also highlights this as something that is needed and proposes in his report that, where a court makes an order for repayment of an overpaid amount, that payment should be registered with the Child Support Registrar as a registrable maintenance liability for enforcement. I welcome the increased scope of matters that can be the subject of private arbitration, opportunities to make them less adversarial and to help people achieve better outcomes for them and for their families.</para>
<para>In summary, it is important to note that these amendments support the direction in which the government is reforming the family law system. I welcome the fact that we are not just changing rules and legislation but really looking to bring about cultural change in the way we support families and the way the government is committing to a more proactive approach to keeping marriages together in the first place. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>âThe <inline ref="R2316">Family Law Amendment Bill 2005</inline> contains a mixed bag of amendments. That is not to say that they are not positive, but there is a raft of amendments which are not related other than that they are amendments to the Family Law Act. I would like to speak about giving people who have paid child maintenance incorrectly under a court orderâincorrectly because they are not actually the parent of the childâthe right to recover moneys paid or property transferred. All of us over the years have received representations from constituents who have paid child support, often for many years, only to find that the child is not theirs. It is a very bitter pill in many circumstances. When the person has sought to recover money paid, that has virtually not been possible. In some circumstances, on presentation of absolute proof of paternity, the Child Support Agency has still been unable or unwilling to address that matter. On behalf of parents in Townsville in that situation, I am very pleased to support this amendment to the Family Law Act.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There was quite a celebrated appeal case in Victoria last year. It related to a person who had discovered that he was the biological father of only one of his three children and had paid child support for seven years. The judge in the Victorian County Court found that the personâs former wife had knowingly lied when filling out the birth certificates for her two youngest children, who had been fathered by a family friend. That case raises a number of very 21st century questions. Should any man, rich or poor, be made financially responsible for a child found not to be biologically his? Should courts hold mothers accountable when they make false statements regarding paternity? That inevitably leads to deeper questions of what defines a fatherâchild raising or genes? In my view and I think in the view of the government, the father is the biological father of a child.</para>
<para>It is appropriate that we address this because every day in Australia at least 10 men open their mail to find the potentially explosive results of a DNA paternity test. Between two and three will receive the unhappy news that they are not the biological father of their child. Fortunately it is now possible to determine with virtually foolproof accuracy whether someone is the father of a child. I also note that one in four men taking a paternity test in Australia discovers that he is not the father of his children. According to a US survey, up to 30 per cent of unwed mothers who sign affidavits of paternity name the wrong man as the father. That is why it is important that it be made clear that a person who is not the biological father of a child should not be responsible for child support payments.</para>
<para>I thank the Labor Party for supporting this very important principle. I am aware that the Democrats tried to amend the governmentâs legislation, basically saying that this amendment should not be passed because it is not in the best interests of the child, but it is very much in the best interests of a personâs biological children. So I thank the Labor Party for changing their view and supporting the government on this amendment. This will be widely supported in my electorate in Townsville and Thuringowa. I appreciate the privilege of supporting this bill in the House tonight.</para>

<para>âI rise today in support of the <inline ref="R2316">Family Law Amendment Bill 2005</inline>. The first amendment in this bill inserts an additional part 17 to schedule 1 of the original legislation. The purpose of this insertion is to correct an oversight. The amendments are designed to limit the role of third-party creditors in family property proceedings in cases where the trustee in bankruptcy can appropriately represent the interests of third-party creditors in those proceedings.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The second series of amendments included in this bill propose to amend section 66X in part XIV of the act. The changes would allow the recovery of child maintenance paid or property transferred under a Family Court order in cases where a person is later found not liable for child support. This would apply, for example, where a paternity test later confirms that a father who has been paying child support is in fact not the father of the child he has been supporting. In this case, under the current system the father may have paid out tens of thousands of dollars in supporting a child and would instantly lose any access rights he had to that child.</para>
<para>This legislation makes the situation much fairer for de facto couples in relation to property settlements. Under the current legislation in South Australia, a de facto couple must live together in a de facto relationship for three years, or have a child, before the courts can intervene to make an order in relation to property. For example, an individual in South Australia may have owned their own home for some years and, after the birth of their child to their partner, the de facto partner and the child of the relationship may move into their home. If that relationship were to break down six months later, the mother may have a claim over half the house by virtue of having a child with her de facto. Under this legislation, if a court order were made that there was an entitlement to a percentage of the property, any moneys paid out would be recoverable in the event that the home owner was later found not to be the parent of the child.</para>
<para>There is no doubt that relationships are difficult, and they are even more difficult when children are involved. The breakdown of relationships in these circumstances is devastating to all parties involved. This legislation is about making the law that little bit fairer. At the end of the day, no amount of legislation is going to stop parties to a failed relationship from feeling hurt and angry. All we can do as legislators is make the basis for those situations as fair as possible. At the end of the day, if an individual has been financially and emotionally responsible for a child, only to find out that the child was not their responsibility, they should have a right to recover what they have lost. No law can ever help them to recover the emotional costs, but we should enable them to recover what they have mistakenly outlaid financially.</para>
<para>While this government feels it is important to enable the recovery of financial outlays in situations where a party is deemed at a later time not to be liable for child support, we accept that every situation is different. Accordingly, this bill also seeks, through the amendments to section 66X, to introduce a provision which will allow the court to order only partial repayment in cases where child support has been wrongfully paid. However it is important to note that, with this provision, the court will only be able to make such an order in cases where there are exceptional circumstances. An example of exceptional circumstances is where recovery of the child support paid in error would result in the bankruptcy of the mother. For the reasons I have outlined, it is important that this provision only be available in exceptional circumstances. This bill and these amendments are about making the law fair and it should be only in very exceptional circumstances that that fairness is taken away.</para>
<para>In considering the exceptional circumstances provision, it must be remembered that paying child support is often a very heavy financial burden. An individual who has struggled to meet that burden for years, only to discover it was not his burden to bear, should have his right to recovery altered only where the circumstances are exceptional.</para>
<para>Another government amendment being sought to section 66X relates to the Child Support Agency. This amendment makes it clear that any application for the repayment of child support outlined in this legislation must be against the mother, not the Child Support Agency. The Child Support Agency attempts to intervene in situations which are exceptionally complicated and which are influenced by a very high level of emotion. Those working at the agency make decisions based on the information which is available to them at the time. These changes seek to protect the Child Support Agency from action to recover child support under these amendments. These amendments make it clear that actions for the recovery of incorrectly paid child support must be taken against the mother involved.</para>
<para>These changes are not meant to penalise single mothers and will not affect the large majority of them. I have no doubt that the cases where these new laws are invoked will be rare, but we cannot ignore the fact that these cases do occur, and we have a responsibility to those who suffer in these circumstances to do the right thing. These amendments are necessary to ensure there is equality in our family law system and to ensure that those who come in contact with the family law system have faith that the outcomes will be just and fair.</para>
<para>The Howard government is committed to improving outcomes in the family law system. We will continue to introduce further major reforms in accordance with the committee report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Every picture tells a story</inline>. We will continue to do all that we can to ensure the family law system provides appropriate and just outcomes for all who come in contact with it. No government can make the separation of a family an easy thingâwe do not for a moment fool ourselves into thinking that we canâbut these changes and the raft of changes that this government will introduce are aimed at making the system as fair as possible and at assisting families in what are exceptionally difficult times. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2316">Family Law Amendment Bill 2005</inline>. Anybody who knows me in this place or in my community knows that I very much believe in the importance of the family unit. I believe in doing everything we can as individuals, as a government and, indeed, as a parliament to support families, especially children. The bill we are debating tonight contains a range of amendments to the Family Law Act 1975. The bill is designed to improve the operation of the current family law system. Some amendments in the bill, such as those that modernise the terminology used, are technical and are intended to improve the actâs operation. Other amendments relate to procedural matters, including the appeals process, and the Attorney-General has covered those extremely well.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Families are the cornerstone of society, and they certainly are the cornerstone of Australian society. I do not think there is a person in this place, despite the different brands of politics that we might follow, who would disagree with those statements. It is so important that we get a perspective on this and that we recognise that, since the introduction of the Family Law Act in 1975, in the Whitlam era, we have seen a growth in the rates of divorce in Australia that probably nobody in the parliament of that day would ever have expected to see. That brings great sadness to me. I recognise that families, and indeed relationships between adults, break down for all sorts of reasons, and I reluctantly say that sometimes it is probably for good reason. However, if we are to be honest with ourselves and with each other it has to be said that families are breaking down far too often in this country. While politicians will never be in a position to dictate the relationships that people share and the way in which homes and families can function in the future, we do have a responsibility to make sure that we have covered ourselves and are satisfied that we have provided families with the support they need.</para>
<para>An example that springs to mind is one in which a government policy, and I will not try to think of one, may put more pressure on families. If that were to happen, we in this place would have to take some of the blame for some of the growth in the rates of family breakdown. This is not a political point, other than to say that everything we do here that will have an impact on families has to be very carefully scrutinised as to the consequences it will have in homes around Australia.</para>
<para>As this bill relates to the Family Law Act, I would like to touch on the issue of access after divorce or separation. I have spoken in this House before on the need for children to have both male and female role models. We need to make it fair and equitable for both a mother and a father to have fair access to children after a relationship has broken down. I feel it is appropriate at this stage to acknowledge a letter I recently received in relation to the growing movement of people who are crying out for change to the Child Support Scheme and the Family Law Act. I quote from my correspondentâs letter in which he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I am writing to you to add my voice to the growing movement of people who are crying out for change to the Child Support scheme and the Family Law Act. There is almost an epidemic of family separation going on and there has to be a fairer outcome available not only for the parents but most importantly for the children. All children of separated parents should be able to see both their mother and father as close to equal time as possible.</para>
<para class="block">This just does not happen at the moment. The norm has been for mum to keep the kids with her and quite often she keeps the house etc. and dad is lucky if he sees the kids every second weekend. If the mum chooses to be adversarial she can withdraw the kids from their father. Dad keeps paying child support and he doesnât get to see his children.</para>

<para class="block">It is very important to recognise that this letter came from a man in a situation where his former partner is cooperative and has a respect for the children that means there is not the conflict between them as he has described. He has himself said to me that he enjoys fair access to his children. His point, I think, is that he is scared to think what could happen if that were not the case, how devastated he would be, the sense of loss he would experience and the sense of loss of his children were they not in a position to enjoy a healthy relationship with their dad. I think we all know of cases where his example is true.</para>
<para>The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Every picture tells a story: inquiry into child custody arrangements in the event of family separation</inline> is provocative reading. It provides very important recommendations relating to the custody of children after broken relationships. It is clear that the committee kept the best interests of children in mind when they listened to witnesses, took submissions, made deliberations and, finally, made recommendations. I was very delighted to see the Attorney-General make a public statement earlier this year in which he said that the governmentâs agenda in this regard, in responding to this report, means that we will see the biggest ever investment in the family law system in Australia and that the governmentâs proposed changes will bring about not just tinkering but generational change in how family conflicts are managed in the future following a separation.</para>
<para>I am very encouraged to see a growing movement towards mediation rather than litigation. That is a very healthy move. I was very sad to read the ministerâs observation that as many as one in four children from separated families will see one parent once a year or not at all. These changes to the law will recognise the rights and needs of children and, importantly, the right of a child to know both his or her parents. I am also greatly encouraged to see a commitment to open a network of 65 family relationship centres around Australia. I suspect that not many people at this stage appreciate how significant these family relationship centres will be. I think we are in for exciting times.</para>
<para>I know the Attorney-General and the Minister for Family and Community Services have been very receptive to suggestions as to how they could function in the future. I and some of my colleagues have made public our view that these family relationship centres should not in practice, or indeed in a perceptive sense, be seen as divorce shops, as avenues or first stepping stones that you must overcome in order to achieve a divorce. A good many people would like to see these family relationship centres as places where families can go for advice, referrals or even counselling, not with a view to achieving a divorce but with a view to strengthening their relationships and marriages and provide an even better atmosphere for children to be nurtured to grow into healthy young Aussies.</para>
<para>Coming to the end of my remarks tonight, I would like to congratulate the government on the work it is doing. I am very proud to be a member of this government. I said in my first speech in this place, standing where I am tonight, that I believe the rate of family breakdown in this country must be identified. It must be addressed and, if we can, it must be reversed. A final observation I make tonight is that this country has come a very long way in its attitude to family breakdown since 1975. It has been said to me that in 1975, when this legislation was first debated, even Paul Keating as a backbencher voted against it. I do not think we are yet settled in this country on our final views on family breakdown. We as a government and I as a member will always respect the various reasons that families cannot survive. But where they can survive we will continue to hold the family up as the ideal and something that should be supported. With those remarks I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>âToo often we hear and see the tragic consequences of relationship breakdown. Too often children, despite the best efforts of their parents and the courts, suffer as a result of these breakdowns. All of us in this place want to believe that we can help those in needâthat somehow we can come up with the right outcomes and that somehow we can fix peopleâs problems. But with family breakdowns we can never really achieve this. There is no magical legislative outcome or formula to alleviate the pain of relationship breakdown.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The <inline ref="R2316">Family Law Amendment Bill 2005</inline>, while it cannot ameliorate the pain or rectify all the problems, will at least correct some of the anomalies in the Family Law Act 1975. It is an important step forward and it is evidence of this governmentâs determination to monitor what is happening, adjust the law to meet societyâs expectations and address some of the concerns and grievances. In the past I have been quite a critic of many aspects of family law and the operations of the Child Support Agency. While I would have liked to have seen some of these issues debated earlier in this place, I am very pleased that we are doing so now and that the Attorney-General has brought this legislation forward.</para>
<para>The bill makes a number of technical amendments intended to improve the operation of the act. For instance, it deals with the enforcement of court orders. It introduces the term âdivorceâ and also, and in my view this is very significant, allows for a person to recover child support payments made when they are found not liableâthat is, when they are later found to have, in fact, not been the parent of the child. On this point, I really want to make it clear that taking child support maintenance from someone who does not have a moral obligation to pay it cannot be condoned. It is bad enough for someone to be emotionally duped into falsely believing that they are the parent of a child, but to add a financial burden to this is an additional and unforgivable insult. At least now there will be some opportunity for financial redress by allowing the courts to make orders to recover payments or transferred property when there is no liability for a child. We can see the start of justice in this area.</para>
<para>The bill widens the range of matters that can be the subject of private arbitration, and this is also a very positive step. For instance, financial agreements and certain orders relating to superannuation will now be able to be arbitrated. The bill will remove some of the adversarial judicial features from the current arrangements and therefore prevent some of the destructive actions that often occur. The bill provides for the transfer of family law proceedingsâfor instance, from state courts directly to the Federal Magistrates Courtâon the state courtâs own initiative. This will potentially save large sums of money and reduce a lot of the delays involved in the court processes.</para>
<para>In contemplating any changes, we really have to ask: will these changes make the circumstances less painful for those involved? Are we going some way towards mollifying the damage caused by family breakdown? In asking these questions, the fundamental issue is the best interests of the child. In addition to that, we need to look at the issue of fairness to parentsâfairness to parents in custody arrangements, fairness to parents in terms of input into the lives of their children and fairness to parents in the financial contributions that they are called on to make.</para>
<para>It is worth differentiating, though, between the changes to the Family Law Act contained in this bill and the more substantial changes that, hopefully, will occur following the parliamentary report <inline font-style="italic">Every picture tells a story</inline> and the task force review into that report headed by Professor Patrick Parkinson. That report is a very important stepping stone to future family law and child support improvements. For instance, coming out of the recommendations of that report we saw the governmentâs commitment in the last budget of $397 million over the next four years that, hopefully, will bring about a cultural change in the way that family breakdowns are handled.</para>
<para>Of this allocation, $180 million will go towards establishing 65 family relationship centres. These will be a critical entry point into the family law system and will provide mediation services. They will refer families to other appropriate services. They will reduce the expensive resort of adversarial action through the courtsâaction that so often exacerbates the bitterness of family breakdown and separation and just intensifies the pain that all parties experience. Other important changes need to come about as well. The report made a number of recommendations regarding changing the formula for child support arrangements. I know there are many in the community who are distressed by the inadequacies as well as the perceived and, dare I say, actual inequities in the way the child support system currently works.</para>
<para>Further changes are needed to revolve around custody and parenting arrangements. All children, except in extreme circumstances, need the input of a father and a mother, particularly in their formative years. All children need to have access to the care, the nurturing and the leadership that a mother and a father can provide. On the other hand, both parents deserve a right to have an input into the lives of the children that they have parented, that they love and that they want to care for. Both parents need to have adequate opportunity to share parenting arrangements and to have that input into the lives of their children.</para>
<para>These amendments to the Family Law Act are a first step, but they bring with them some very welcome and overdue changes. I believe that in this place we have the opportunity to make generational changes in both family law and child support. While the amendments that we are debating today do not provide those fundamental changes, they are a very positive step in the right direction. I commend the bill to the House, and I look forward to the subsequent improvements that we will see coming out of changes to child support arrangements and to the way that parenting and family law work in this country.</para>

<para>âin replyâI thank all honourable members who have contributed to the debate on the <inline ref="R2316">Family Law Amendment Bill 2005.</inline> Firstly, I thank the member for Barton, who acknowledged that from time to time there are contributions made by Senate committees. I am hopeful that we will see an opportunity to place more emphasis on members of this House contributing through committee discussions to the improvement of legislation, and to avail myself of the opportunity of receiving that advice.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Committees can be very useful if their work is undertaken quickly and delivered in a timely manner and is not used to produce constructive delay for other purposes. I can assure the member for Barton that I am always willing to hear constructive views. If they can improve legislation that I am dealing with, I will take them from any quarterâparticularly from the member for Barton, whom I usually find very constructive. Further to the advice that my advisor gave in relation to that reference, I understand that the remedy does exist, as he outlined, but it is clearly a discretionary remedy in the hands of the court to be able to provide.</para>
<para>I thank the members for Fisher, Mitchell, Wakefield, Herbert, Kingston, Bass and Macquarie for the issues they raised about our new family relationship centres, the rights of children to know their parents, allegations of violence and enforcement of contact orders. I am gratified by the very wide level of interest in family law issues and the very constructive comments that have been made.</para>
<para>It is recognised that the Family Law Amendment Bill 2005 is largely a technical bill. While there are some issues that are important, such as those which allow a court to vary a parenting order of its own making in contravention cases, nevertheless, major reforms will follow the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Every picture tells a story.</inline> I hope to release shortly an exposure draft containing a range of measures and many of the matters that members have referred to. When I am in a position to release that exposure, I look forward to referring it to one of our House committees so that it can hear the input on the draft. I want that to happen quickly. I am anxious that we should proceed with these measures this year. I do not want to see them delayed unnecessarily.</para>
<para>Finally, I foreshadow two government amendments to section 66X that will be moved to the bill in the consideration in detail stage. These amendments will have the effect of removing the amendments that were made in the other place on 20 June. Those amendments allowed the court a very wide discretion to decide how much child maintenance a person could recover. The government sees this discretion as too wide and leading to variable results that would undermine the right of recovery that we are wanting to see in place. The government amendments will allow the court to recognise that in exceptional circumstances it may be appropriate to reduce the amount to be repaid. It is to give the court some direction but it acknowledges that in exceptional circumstances those matters can be addressed. I thank honourable members for their contributions. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para class="indentii">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (ii)Â Â Â  an amount up to, or equal to, the value of that property.</para>
</amendment>
</amendments>
<para>The court may only order the repayment of an amount that is less than the amount, or the sum of the amounts, referred to in subparagraphÂ (1)(b)(i) of this section, or the return of an amount that is less than the value of the property referred to in subparagraphÂ (1)(b)(ii) of this section, in exceptional circumstances.</para>
<para class="block">The government is committed to making amendments to the Family Law Act to ensure that fathers have a statutory right to recover certain maintenance payments where they have had no right before. The governmentâs amendments give the right to recover child maintenance in a court having jurisdiction to make the original maintenance orderâa right that is presently not available. The right will be offered to people who have paid money that they were not in fact liable to pay. Under current law, all that a person in a situation can do is to seek a civil remedy in a state court using remedies and torts in restitution. It is unfair that a person in this position cannot access the courts that have special expertise in these matters.</para>
<para>The advantage of the government amendments is that they will give the parties some certainty as to the likely outcome so that there is a real right of recovery of wrongly paid maintenance in appropriate and relevant circumstances. The current subsection 66X(2), passed in the Senate on the Democrat motion, is for a wide and expanded version of the courtâs discretion to adjust the amount of child maintenance that can be recovered based on what the court thinks is just and equitable. That provision would look similar to section 143 of the Child Support (Assessment Act) 1989, which allows the court to make such orders as it considers just and equitable for the purposes of adjusting or giving effect to the rights of a party or a child concerned. This is a wide and variable discretion which in practical terms means that it is very risky to pursue recovery action because it is very difficult to predict how courts will deal with the application.</para>
<para>The government amendment to this provision will ensure that court action under section 66X produces results. It should be obvious that a person in this situation should be able to recover what they have paid unless there are exceptional circumstances for ordering a less than full repayment. The phrase âexceptional circumstancesâ shows up already in sections 66M(4), 68L(2A) and 111CR(3) of the Family Law Act and in subsection 74(4), 74(7), 79(13) and 79(16) of the Bankruptcy Family Law Legislation Amendment Act 2005. It is also used in subsection 17B(1) of the Crimes Act 1914.</para>
<para>The government have proposed an amendment which is reasonable. We have preserved the right of recovery but given the court the ability to reduce maintenance in exceptional circumstances. The court could take into account extreme hardship caused by giving recovery, such as the fact that it may force a mother into bankruptcy. Another example of exceptional circumstances might be where a father has insisted on a purported child going to a private school. In such results it should be obvious to parties that the money should be repayable except in exceptional circumstances. I commend the amendment and I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill.</para>

<para>âThe opposition will be opposing the amendments but, for the benefit of those who may be considering attending a function this evening, I can indicate that we will not be dividing on them. Essentially, there is a distinction between the Labor opposition and the government with respect to the extent of the courtâs discretion, and the Attorney-General fairly put the competing arguments. The amendment moved in the Senate and adopted with the majority vote of the opposition parties there provides that the court would be given a broad discretionâin fact, the wording is âto make such order that it considers just and equitable in the circumstancesâ. Effectively, this gives quite a broad discretion, having regard to what we would anticipate to be commonsense provisions.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>On the other hand, the governmentâs approach has been to have a presumption in favour of recovery, if you like. It is perhaps an appropriate thing that there be a presumption in favour of recovery, but it may be too far on the spectrum to say that that presumption is only displaced in exceptional circumstances. I note that in his concluding comments the Attorney-General gave some guidance as to what may constitute an exceptional circumstance, but effectively there will be a presumption that the moneys will be repaid. This is a complex area. While this bill applies to about 2.8 per cent of cases, I think there will probably be circumstances in the future where DNA technology makes it easier to identify parentage and, in those circumstances, it will be an issue not infrequently coming before the courtsâcertainly not infrequently coming before the Child Support Agency.</para>
<para>We believe that commonality between the respective provisions is desirable, but we would obviously oppose the government amendments so that the amendments moved in the other place stand. Having said that, I think from a broader perspective there probably does need to be a review of the situation downstream. Obviously the government amendments will succeed in this House and ultimately we will pass the legislation in the Senate, because it is desirable legislation. But downstream I think there will need to be recognition that perhaps an innocent party in all of this will be the children who have benefited from financial contributions from a man who was not their father but, nonetheless, in circumstances where there was not appropriate recovery from the actual father. Consideration should perhaps be given to whether there is justification, for instance, for supplementing social security payments or a right on behalf of that family and/or child specifically to recover moneys that otherwise would have been payable with respect to social security. These are issues that may require revisiting and review as the effect of the legislation becomes apparent. I flag those but formally, as I said, oppose the government amendments.</para>

<para>â I rise to draw membersâ attention to the harsh realities that face workers in my electorate and around Australia under the Howard government. I want to use the example, with his permission, of David Noel Thomas, a constituent in my electorate recently retired from his job after 48 years of service as a semitrailer driver for WM Jago and Sons. When he left the workplace Davidâs employer threw him a farewell party and he was told that his entitlements would be available for him to collect the next day. David Thomas returned the next day only to be told that the cheque had not yet been signed. Following a week of fruitless phone calls, fob-offs and contradictory stories, David returned to the office where he was told by the store manager, âI have bad news for you: they have the administrators in.â David Thomas is still waiting for $25,500 in entitlements that are owed to him.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Ken Day also worked for the same employer, giving 32 years of service and is accordingly owed approximately $32,000 in long service and other leave entitlements. David and Kenâs former colleagues are also still awaiting their entitlements. David has since made an application to the General Employment Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme, GEERS, for his outstanding entitlements. His application to GEERS was rejected outright. He was told that because he retired a week prior to the company going into receivership he was unable to access any assistance under the scheme.</para>
<para>After 48 years of service David Thomas is now left to survive on his pension. After a combined 90 years of service, David and Ken have been left high and dry by the failure of the Howard government to adequately legislate to protect entitlements. Innocent workers like Ken and David are left with only financial uncertainty and distress. Instead of protecting workers and ensuring financial security for them and their families, the Howard government intends to reduce their job certainty. This governmentâs proposal to change the unfair dismissal laws to exempt small business and to undermine the job certainty and security of some four million workers is outrageous. This antiworker and, ultimately, antifamily attitude is typical of this governmentâs ideologically indulgent agenda. Employees who have served their probationary period can currently challenge their dismissal in the relevant industrial commission within 21 days, but this right, this basic and fair process of appeal, will be removed under this governmentâs regime.</para>
<para>Workers in businesses employing up to 100 people will have no appeal to an industrial commission and new workers will have to serve a double period of probation. The Howard governmentâs proposals could see workers sacked without explanation, perhaps sacked for something they did not do, without recourse to challenging the decision and no way to prove that they did not do it. There will be no warnings for these workers and no justice when they are unfairly sacked. This government intend to see these workers thrown on the scrap heap just as they have done with David Thomas, Ken Day and their former colleagues at WM Jago and Sons.</para>
<para>The governmentâs legislation will also remove the right to collectively bargain. David is represented by, and is a proud member of, the Transport Workers Union. Unions have played a proud role in this nation, going back to the very beginning of defending workers in situations such as this, of representing them, but the government is determined to take away that right due to an ideological agenda.</para>
<para>The government is also determined to take away minimum wages. In spite of question after question in question time, Mr Speaker, you would recall that we have received no guarantee whatsoever that no worker will be worse off, because the government knows that this will drive down wages particularly for those people who are most vulnerable. There is no justification for this attack on the hardworking people of my electorate, workers like David Thomas. Workers and their families deserve protection, they deserve job security and they deserve financial certainty. They do not deserve the Howard governmentâs package of ideologically motivated attacks on their working conditions and, ultimately, on their families.</para>

<para>âI rise tonight rather reluctantly to speak about an issue that arose out of an article by the Clerk of the Senate, Mr Harry Evans, in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 21 June 2005. Mr Speaker, you would realise that I have spoken before about some of the comments that Mr Evans has made on the public record in regard to the parliament, and I have been very concerned each time I have seen them, but this one arose apparently out of inquiries from the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> about committee reports from this parliament which in fact had not been replied to by the government. It is probably interesting to find out why the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> made inquiries in the first place; nevertheless Mr Evans, instead of replying to the inquiry, has then put his own view of the world to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> about this establishment of parliament.</para>

<para>âIt is Drug Action Week and I was pleased to attend the launch by the honourable member for Sturt, Chris Pyne, earlier this week. I know honourable members are busy this week but I was somewhat disappointed to see so few members and senators present at the launch. With the tens of millions of dollars expended by this government and the bipartisan nature of the issue, it would have been wonderful for more of us in this place to be there.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>What is Drug Action Week? As honourable members would know there are so many worthy causes for us to support and a plethora of coloured ribbons which we wear to show our solidarity with causes such as MS, motor neurone disease, youth suicide, diabetes, cancer and Daffodil Day et cetera. For me, Drug Action Week is probably one of the most important causes that I support. The week is an annual initiative hosted by the Alcohol and other Drugs Council of Australia. It is the premier event to raise awareness about alcohol and other drug issues in Australia and this year it is being held from 20 to 24 June.</para>
<para>The week is part of a host of activities to raise awareness about issues relating to alcohol and other drugs and to promote the achievement of those people who work to reduce drug related harm. The week also aims to promote public debate about good practice strategies for reducing drug related harm. Each year, Drug Action Week has different theme days to highlight the diversity and complexity of alcohol and other drug issues. The theme days reflect suggestions received from the sector as well as other identified priorities while maintaining the core themes of prevention, treatment and Indigenous Australians. The theme days for 2005 are: Monday, young people; Tuesday, treatment; today, prevention; tomorrow, Indigenous Australians, and Friday, consumers and carers.</para>
<para>Alcohol remains the most commonly used psychoactive drug in Australia, with 2001 data showing that over 80 per cent of the population aged 14 years and older consumed alcohol in the previous 12 months. The proportion of the population who used any illicit substance in the previous 12 months was 14.27 per cent. Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit substance with 33.1 per cent of Australians aged 14 and older having used cannabis at some time in their lives.</para>
<para>Alcohol misuse and tobacco use are overwhelmingly the cause of most drug related morbidity and mortality in this country and are therefore associated with the greatest social costs. Of the estimated $34.4 billion in costs attributed to problematic drug use each year, alcohol and tobacco combined account for more than $28 billion, with over $21 billion of these costs related to tobacco use. As someone who represents an electorate that contains both a rural as well as an urban component, I am concerned with the following statistics. Rates of smoking are up to 25 per cent higher in rural areas and the proportion of smokers outside of major cities has not decreased in recent years. In 2001, females in inner and outer regional areas were 1.15 and 1.27 times as likely to smoke as females in major cities. Younger males in outer regional areas have been shown to be 1.3 times as likely to smoke as males in major cities. Finally, males in regional areas were more likely to engage in risky alcohol consumption than males in major cities.</para>
<para>These are rather startling figures and when said quickly can easily be glossed over. These figures are why programs and campaigns should focus on regional areas, to start making inroads into such risky and costly behaviour. These figures are a cost to Australian society in many ways: hospitalisation, family dislocation, road trauma, suicide, lost productivity, diminished life spans, domestic violence and so on. It is hard to imagine that so much distress can come from the two most commonly accepted and legal drugs in our community, yet we persist in hiding behind the myth of legality and shade our eyes from the destruction caused by misuse of alcohol and tobacco.</para>
<para>This year 640 separate events make Drug Action Week the biggest ever, compared to last yearâs 450 events. It is my fervent hope that this year Drug Action Week will open the eyes of many Australians to the damage done, and that they will take the necessary steps to substantially reduce their abuse of alcohol, tobacco or illicit substances.</para>

<para>âTonight in the parliament, I want to speak about Pooh Corner in the western suburbs of Brisbane. On 21 April, the federal government announced that it intended to transfer the ownership of Pooh Corner from the Department of Defence to the Brisbane City Council for the nominal sum of $1. I want to take this opportunity again to congratulate and commend the federal government and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence for being involved in this transaction and for making it happen. The alternativeânamely, the sale of Pooh Corner to private developers for the purpose of high-density residential livingâwas not acceptable to me or the local community. In my capacity as the federal member for Ryan, I was pleased to have played a small part in lobbying the parliamentary secretary and the government to see through some of the difficulties that existed and to ensure that the transfer of the land to the local Brisbane City Council could take place smoothly.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I want to speak about Pooh Corner for two particular reasons. The first reason is that it is a fine example of where a genuine and relevant local community organisation and its members can work with their local federal member to achieve a very good outcome for the wider community. The second reason is that it is a fine example of how the federal government and the Brisbane City Council can work together for the good of the people they both represent in their respective ways.</para>
<para>Pooh Corner is a very special piece of land just outside my Ryan electorate. It is adjacent to the Ipswich Motorway, Sanananda Barracks and the Centenary Highway. The Ryan suburbs of Riverhills, Middle Park and Jamboree Heights are only minutes away by car from Pooh Cornerâs peaceful and serene environment. I was very pleased to be able to support the many Ryan residents who contacted my office to ask for my support in this matter. Pooh Corner is about 1.4 square kilometres in size and has a very high conservation value. It is a piece of real estate that is home to a large population of eastern grey kangaroos that are frequently seen eating and relaxing near Wacol Station Road. It is also a site that is home to 26 species of animals and 16 plant species that are rare and vulnerable. Clearly, the size of the land and the nature of the land meant that Pooh Corner had to be protected and preserved not only for the future residents of my Ryan electorate but for other people of Brisbane.</para>
<para>I mention again that the April announcement about Pooh Cornerâs future would have been a great relief to the wider community. The alternative, as I said, was that it would be sold to private developers. It was going to be put on the market for sale. Once it was purchased by a local developer, the outcome would have been, first, the decimation of an attractive and valuable piece of family friendly land. Secondly, there would have been a massive increase in the amount of traffic onto the local road network and infrastructure following construction of residential homes or units. I campaigned strongly against such a commercial transaction taking place because it was not in the best interests of the local Ryan community.</para>
<para>Apart from the major conservation value that the land has, it is very significant that private development on Pooh Corner would have had a tremendously negative impact on the roads in the community. The Ipswich highway and the Centenary Highway, which are very close to Pooh Cornerâin fact, adjacent to itâand Moggill Road a bit further down the road are well over capacity. They are in desperate need of major attention. The oppositionâs policy is simply to upgrade the Ipswich highway. This is, quite frankly, a bandaid solution. Together with the member for Blair, I worked very strongly with the government to come to a long-term solution that will deliver to the people who use the Ipswich Motorway a more sustainable outcome. Centenary Highway and Moggill Road in the Ryan electorate are state roads. I call on the Queensland Labor government to use some of the money from its massive GST funds on the roads in the Ryan electorate. The Queensland government is awash in funds. It has nearly $8 billion of funds out of an Australian total of $35 billion. It is high time that the Queensland government spent more of this money on the roads in Ryan. Moggill Road is desperately in need of funding. I call on the transport minister and the Queensland Premier to spend more money on the roads. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThis year 68 people have died on South Australian roads already. We had an absolutely horrible month in March, with 27 people being killed, compared with just eight people last year in the same month. The South Australian Labor government has been committed to reducing that devastating figure and has introduced legislation to crack down on dangerous driving and improve the conditions on our roads. Groups like Neighbourhood Watch, including the Morphettville Neighbourhood Watch group in the electorate of Hindmarsh, have been particularly active in calling for a crackdown on the behaviour of motorists.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am aware of a number of roads within the electorate of Hindmarsh which are used as racetracks by inexperienced and inconsiderate drivers. I am relieved that legislation to stop this sort of behaviour has been introduced by the Rann state Labor government. Since the laws came into effect earlier this year, 176 drivers have been reported and at least eight vehicles impounded. In 108 of those cases, motorists were reported for âsustained wheel spinâ, or burnouts, which have been causing residents sleepless nights for years.</para>
<para>The first phase of the reforms was introduced in February and created the new offence of misuse of a vehicle and an offence of failing to obey police orders to reduce noise from a car stereo. Both offences attract a maximum fine of $1,250, as well as other penalties. The second phase, introduced last month, gives police the power to impound for 48 hours vehicles suspected of being used for hoon drivingâeven before the matter reaches courtâas long as there are proper grounds for laying charges. Upon conviction, a court can impose a second period of impoundment. The penalty is up to three months for one prior offence and up to six months for two priors. Those with three or more prior offences risk having their vehicle forfeited permanently. The proceeds from the sale of forfeited vehicles will go directly to the Victims of Crime Fund. This is commonsense legislation, because it takes away what these drivers value mostâtheir cars. The risk of losing their lives or of hurting or killing someone else seems to mean nothing to them, but the risk of losing their car really hits home.</para>
<para>The state government is also targeting other irresponsible driving behaviour. Drink-drivers now face an immediate loss of licence if they are caught driving with a blood alcohol level above 0.08. Last year 36 per cent of those killed on our roads were driving with an illegal blood alcohol content, and more than half of these had levels more than three times the legal limit. Some 28 per cent had been using marijuana or amphetamines. Motorists who drink and drive are now more likely than ever to get caught, because of the Rann state Labor governmentâs changes to drink-driving laws. South Australian police can now conduct full-time mobile random breath testing. The risk of immediately losing their licence might make a difference to people who are too stupid to take a taxi instead of driving home when they have had too much to drink. If it is not enough of an incentive, then at least it will get a few of these fools off the roads and make it safer for other people who are doing the right thing.</para>
<para>South Australia is aiming to reduce its road toll by 40 per cent by 2010. This yearâs toll already makes that a huge challenge. In 2003 the state Labor government in South Australia introduced restricted mobile random breath testing, which is only allowed at certain times of the year, because the Liberal opposition refused to support full-time testing. Since then South Australian police have detected more drink drivers than when they were limited to stationary breath testing units. Because it was a success the government tried again to convince the Liberal opposition to allow police to mobile breath test all year around and this time the state Labor government succeeded.</para>
<para>The new legislation means that if you get caught driving between 0.05 and 0.079 more than once you lose your licence. If you get caught with a blood alcohol level between 0.08 and 0.149 you lose your licence immediately for at least six months. If you are driving with a blood alcohol count higher than 0.15 you lose your licence for at least 12 months, effective immediately. There are no second chances for people killed in car accidents; why should there be second chances for people who are a risk to themselves and others on the road?</para>
<para>This year the state government has also allocated a further $40 million over the next four years to improve the chances of catching drivers who speed or run red lights. Red light cameras reduce the number of casualty crashes, and over the next four years there will be 48 new cameras installed around South Australia. On urban roads the speed limit has been reduced to 50 kilometres per hour, which reduces the risk of crashes and the sort of damage they cause. Of course, road crashes are not just about driver behaviour; road conditions are also a factor and it would be great if the federal government would look more closely at its responsibilities to improve road safety in South Australia.</para>
<para>In closing I would like to thank the many residents and community groups who have raised their concerns about driver behaviour with me over the years, both as a candidate and as their local federal member. The feedback they have provided to me, and to other members of parliament, provided the information and input required to get something done about dangerous driving. Now when we report hoons to the police in South Australia, the police can do something about it.</para>

<para>âTwo extraordinary individuals from the bayside of Queensland were recognised this year with Australia Day awards: Helen Elmslie is the first and the second is Mary Preston. Mary Prestonâs work with the Coochiemudlo Island Bush Care Group dates back 10 years when their love of the island spurred them to form a group of 20 who would fight to protect the glorious foreshore of Coochiemudlo Island. They were concerned about exposed root systems and damage to ecology and habitats. Their work over 10 years has shown that they have achieved enormous steps not only in education and in encouraging young groups to take an interest in ecology and the environment but also in practical improvements. Together with Redland Shire Council, who I know they will be thanking, their workers, the division 10 councillor Peter Downing and the staff of Indigiscapes they have, where necessary, fenced off fragile areas of the coastline and conducted annual curlew counts, weed for tree programs and, most importantly, adopt-a-coastline so the residents of Coochiemudlo Island can reconnect with their own foreshore in a practical way.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Probably the best way of measuring their achievements is that this year their foreshore management plan has been submitted to the state government and is awaiting approval at this time. Should you ever visit Coochiemudlo Island, which is Aboriginal for red rock, if you find Mary Preston down by the foreshore she will probably invite you in for a cup of tea to talk about how the island is going. It is no better exemplified than in the words of poet Mary OâBrien:</para>

</quote>
<para>Helen Elmslie has had an extraordinary life in the Moreton Bay area. Born in Sudbury, Massachusetts, in 1938, she travelled out to Queensland to complete her zoology undergraduate degree. After defending her thesis in the United States she returned to marry her husband, Leo, have four children and live in the historic township of Dunwich on North Stradbroke Island. From there her two great passions were art and the environmentâand her life is one of opening the door for hundreds of people to both of those. It was her children, Daniel, David, Virginia and Leona, and their love of the intertidal mudflats, with its shags, cormorants and sea snails, that drew her down to the water to share her zoological knowledge. Soon there were school groups following in their footsteps. She spent a number of years on her passion for art with the North Stradbroke art and craft group.</para>
<para>In 1962 she moved across to Ormiston and joined the Yurara art group where they were running Mount Gravatt TAFE courses in art for art and design students. There she met Robert Barnes, an inspiration to her, and she began teaching art and art history. Of course, one of the great disadvantages of teaching art is that you do not have enough time to do it yourself. So in the early 1990s Helen decided to open an art gallery in Manly. From there she became an institution in the area, painting on the footpaths and down by the waterside. She won Redlands Shire Council awards in 1991 and 1992; had a joint exhibition at the Manly Gallery in 1993; in 1994 was featured artist with the Redlands art and craft festival; and in 1995 had a sole exhibition at Manly Gallery and was featured artist for the Manly sailing festival.</para>
<para>In 1996 Helen Elmslie was diagnosed with Parkinsonâs disease. We all know her commitment and energy to tasks throughout her life. This was no different. She joined Parkinsonâs Queensland and thought about helping those who lived with Parkinsonâs. She developed a board game called Parkinsonâs Daily Olympics. It is her hope that that will now be distributed free through Parkinsonâs Queensland to schools, nursing homes and doctors surgeries around the country. Helen Elmslie is a woman who has shared her love of art and her love of nature with hundreds of people in the Moreton Bay region. She was awarded an Australia Day award, as was Mary Preston with her Coochiemudlo Island Bush Care Group. I congratulate them both for their awards and for devoting their lives to their passions on the bayside.</para>

<para>âI would like to use the time that is left to congratulate the federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Pru Goward, on the discussion paper <inline font-style="italic">Striking the balance: women, men, work and family</inline>, which was released and widely reported today. The paper is about prompting submissions to HREOCâs inquiry into paid work and family responsibilities. The paper shows that the balance between work and family is just not there currently and that is especially the case for working women. The paper shows in stark figures that women employed full time are putting in 14.3 hours per week of unpaid work in the home and women employed part time are putting in 20.1 hours per week of work into the home, compared to six hours and 5.2 hours respectively for men employed full time and part time. While this situation continues, it is a serious issue not just for those exhausted families trying to cope with the juggling act but for Australia generally.</para>

<para>âThis coming Saturday, 25 June, I will have the great honour of launching Ron Ritterâs latest labour of love, <inline font-style="italic">Triumph, Tragedy and Port Adelaide</inline>, a history of the port. And what an authentic history it is. We all know the cliches about history: to the victors the capture of history, the narrative captures the history, and so on. This history is nothing like that. As I said earlier, it is authentic; it is a labour of love. It is nine years since I launched Ron Ritterâs previous work, <inline font-style="italic">Spanning Time and Tide</inline>, now sold out at the Port Adelaide Sailing Club.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">This second book continues the virtues of his first book: authenticity, accuracy, sound research and the presentation of rare photographs. However, it deals with a much broader range of topics, which include the following: the Port Adelaide New Yearâs Day regatta; the history of Black Diamond Corner; leisure time activities at Semaphore and Largs Bay beaches; the circumstances surrounding Tragedy Dock; the fire and explosion on <inline font-style="italic">SS City of Singapore</inline>; Fletchers Slip, South Australiaâs first slipway; the 1928 waterside workers strike; the saga of Outer Harbor and much more.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On this last matter, the building of the Outer Harbor gave my grandfather Walter, Wattie, a second nickname: the Punt Man. Prior to the building of the Outer Harbor, my grandfather worked for the Marine and Harbours Board. After storms it was my grandfatherâs job to recover the punts that broke away from their moorings, and he did this single-handedly in a longboat with oars, oar over the stern. In his book, Ron refers to Sawfordâs crew on <inline font-style="italic">Native</inline> winning the working menâs race at the port regatta in 1895 and my grandfather being beaten by Robert Angelinowich in a dinghy sculling race, oar over the stern, in ketches for a prize of 30 shillings. He would not have been too happy about that.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Ron Ritterâs book <inline font-style="italic">Triumph, Tragedy and Port Adelaide</inline> makes a significant contribution to the history of Port Adelaide. It must be said that a great deal of the history of the port has been lost and that our ancestors did not always record what we would have likedâthe quite remarkable history of Port Adelaide. That loss has been addressed in recent years by the Friends of the Maritime Museum in their magnificent publication <inline font-style="italic">Port Adelaide Tales from a Commodious Harbour</inline> by John Couper-Smartt and Christine Courtney.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Ron Ritter continues that tradition. He is to be heartily congratulated. He has researched topics thoroughly for nine years in his spare time and funded his bookâs publication in South Australia. Hyde Park Press of Richmond has done an excellent job; and good friend Errol Chinner edited the book. The foreword was written by Brian Samuels, who, more than any other person, has encouraged the written history of Port Adelaide. The launch will most appropriately take place in the South Australian Maritime Museum, Port Adelaide, this Saturday, 23 June at three oâclock in the afternoon. I very much look forward to launching this most invaluable history of Port Adelaide, by a man who has shown again his great love for Port Adelaide. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI rise today to support the work of Reynella East High School, a local high school in my electorate of Kingston, and in particular to make my colleagues aware of a project within the school that will send 10 students to Sri Lanka to assist with the rebuilding process in areas which were affected by the Boxing Day tsunami. The group of 10 students, accompanied by three staff members, will be leaving on 2 July for just over two weeks, returning on 17 July. Three projects will be undertaken by the group. The first task will be making bricks at the Maharagama National Youth Centre. Once completed, the bricks will be donated to various housing projects in Galle.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The second project involves working at Lake Maduganga Environment Education Camp. Here students will be clearing tracks, working on simple construction tasks and assisting with the rebuilding of local housing. Finally, the students will be going on a three-day adventure expedition. During the trip, the students from Reynella East will be linking up with students at Nalanda College. These students will then be visiting Australia later in the year as part of a reciprocal exchange with Reynella East High School. The school has fundraised for the trip, and, as part of their curriculum, students are learning about Sri Lankan culture. The trip is being organised through the Duke of Edinburghâs Award and Ausquest. Students, staff and their families are attending cultural nights sponsored by Adelaideâs Sri Lankan community in their temple at Oaklandâs Park.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This nation saw a massive outpouring of support for the nations devastated by the tsunami, but it is so easy to forget the tragedy once the news images stop and there are no longer any phone polls seeking support. This school in my electorate still remembers those who suffered and are still suffering in the tragedy on Boxing Day. The school is going to lend a hand in the rebuilding effort. I congratulate the students and staff at Reynella East High School for this very generous effort, and I congratulate their principal, Rob Mutton, on this outstanding effort. It is with great pride that I stand here today as their local federal representative.</para>

<para>âI rise to condemn the continued indefinite detention of David Hicks at Guantanamo Bay and the lack of effort on the part of this government to have him returned to Australia. I wrote an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 15 January 2003, and I have raised the issue on a number of occasions. Mr Hicks was captured by the US military in Afghanistan in November 2001. It is now 3Â½ years later. What is known is that Mr Hicks did not contravene any Australian law as it was then. A special American process has been defined for him, and others, where he has been labelled an âunlawful combatantâ. That was done so that he might be excluded from the protections of the Geneva Convention.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The US government has sought to use Guantanamo Bay, a piece of Cuban sovereign territory leased to the United States, to create a legal black hole where people can be excluded from the American judicial process and not have the protections of the American constitution. Guantanamo Bay should never have been established. Charges have been delayed due to appeals, and there is a question mark over the charges Mr Hicks currently faces. He should be released and returned to Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is a suggestion that there are some continued security concerns about Mr Hicks. These should be dealt with by ASIO if and when he is returned to Australia. He should be subject to Australian law as it stands today. We cannot condone the continued indefinite detention of an Australian citizen on the basis that there is some perceived threat to security. This is a national disgrace. Australian citizenship must count for something. Americans cannot be detained under this process, so Australian citizens at Guantanamo Bay are subject to second-class laws. Unlawful combatants are second-class citizens.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">American citizens must be dealt with under the American constitution. The Australian government must demand Mr Hicksâs immediate return to Australia. I repeat: he is being kept over there because there are no charges that can be laid within Australia. That is the paradoxâwe are punishing an Australian citizen because he did not breach any Australian laws in place at the time of his detention. It is inexcusable and it cannot go on.</para>

<para>âThis morning I propose a five-point plan to help with the development of the wonderful town of Baxter. Baxter is a tremendous town. People work hard and retired people and young families live there. In many ways Baxter has not been given the full respect and full resourcing that it deserves.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The first of the five points is that we want to work to ensure that there are additional aged care places to meet local demands. Point 1 is all about aged care for Baxter. The Baxter village, which has now passed from the electorate of Flinders to Dunkley, does a tremendous job and it has been getting great support from the member for Dunkley, Bruce Billson. I am delighted to be working with Bruce on providing assistance with aged care places for Baxter and the surrounding area.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The second issue that I want to raise is about working to deliver additional before school and after school child-care places for Baxter. This town has a lot of working parents, a lot of two-parent working families, and child care is an issue that needs to be focused on. One of the things that I want to doâand we have already been able to deliver some significant results for Baxter Primary Schoolâis to work with the primary school and with any other providers on additional out of school hours care places for children. I think that is very important.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The third thing I want to do is look at the facilities for both the preschool and Baxter Primary School. Baxter Primary School is a well-managed school. I think we can work with them through Work for the Dole projects or through other forms of assistance to try to upgrade some of the local facilities. I think that is important. We have already had tremendous success through a formal Commonwealth program with upgrading the facilities at Baxter preschool. But we can go further, and I have already spoken to the leaders at Baxter preschool about that.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The fourth pointâa critical one for Baxterâis working to upgrade the dangerous Baxter-Tooradin, Hawkins and Fultons roads intersection. It is a dangerous intersection, and everybody in the area knows it. It is one of Victoriaâs principal black spots, and we will keep pushing until this is properly upgraded. This leads to the fifth and final point, that we need to upgrade the train station and beautify itâexactly the same sort of thing that we are proposing at Hastings. Taken together, these five points in terms of aged care, child care, the schools, the roads and the rail hub will all work to make Baxter an even better place. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>âI rise to speak on a matter that is causing residents in the electorate of Hindmarsh a great deal of grief. The Adelaide airport land is a large area right in the centre of the electorate, surrounded by about 15,000 homes. Unlike many airports around the world, Adelaide airport is located just six kilometres from the CBD. That is great if you are getting on or off a plane, but for the people who live next door it is not without its problems. Aircraft noise has been an issue for some time, but more recently another challenge has emerged. The land has been made available for commercial development.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The federal Minister for Transport and Regional Services last year signed off on a master plan for the airport land which includes provisions for non-aviation related development, including retail, recreational and commercial uses. Because the land is owned by the Commonwealth, it is not a requirement that development on the land comply with state or local government planning laws. The upshot of this is that residents often feel powerless to make a difference when developments that affect them get under way. But the Adelaide airport developments are also creating a very active and aware community, and residents are not taking these things lying down. Instead, communities are becoming increasingly active. There are about six very active residentsâ groups around the airport, but today I only have time to mention two.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Recently, a group of residents in West Beach became aware that the Adelaide Airport Club would be relocated opposite their homes. Unhappy with this decision, they rallied together and formed a residentsâ group. Before long, they came to see me. They also spoke with Adelaide Airport Ltd and with their local councillors and their state MP, the member for West Torrens, Tom Koutsantonis. They have also written to the federal Minister for Transport and Regional Services. I was pleased that Adelaide Airport Ltd, particularly the Managing Director, Phil Baker, was prepared to discuss this issue at length with residents and with me, and he has been willing to request that the club makes several changes to the plans for the new premises so as to reduce the impact on residents.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The residentsâ group has also collected hundreds of signatures from those living in the immediate area and asked me to table their petition opposing the relocation, which I was able to do earlier this week. The core members of this group have dedicated their time and energy to fighting this decision and to representing the many other residents in the area who would be affected by it. Already, they have achieved much. Efforts are now under way to ensure that the clubâs licence recognises the needs of local residents.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Another challenge for local residents is that which faces the Netley residentsâ group. Whitegoods and electronics manufacturer, LG, has a warehouse on the Adelaide airport land opposite residents. Residents have repeatedly raised concerns about noise at the warehouse, and now the developer, Australand, wants to expand the building. I am told the expansion plans are not consistent with what is outlined in the master plan, and residents have every right to be up in arms about the proposal. In the interests of good corporate citizenship, I believe Australand should think again. Their plan is not within the intent of the master plan, and the residents are far from happy about it. Given the track record of the residents living around the airport, I would advise Australand to bow out early and gracefully, because these residents understand how to be part of a democracy and take action.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There will be many challenges like this for residents in the coming years. They knew they were moving in next to an airport when they bought their houses but they did not know that they would be living next to factories, warehouses and enormous retail outlets. They did not know that they would be woken up in the middle of the night by forklifts dropping their loads on concrete floors or by security alarms that are set to deafen intruders. So they will fight for their rights. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">âPhase One of our research found that the overwhelming majority of Australians believe the number of abortions is too high, and 87% want that number reduced without restricting legal access to the procedure,â...</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">âPhase Two of our research examined exactly how the number of abortions could be reduced. Australians were clear that we first need to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies through education/information and helping women manage risk, and secondly we need to offer pregnant women more options so that abortion becomes the option of last resort.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">âPopular options for pregnant women included changes to policies on taxation, health and welfare; as well as options such as counselling, better information and family/community support,â...</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Dr Fleming said there was considerable discussion about counselling including:</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">That counselling should be available on the alternatives to abortion as well as on the risks associated with the abortion procedure</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">That there was strong support for further funding for counselling services</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">That Australians believe health professions should be more active in providing information, advice and support for pregnant women</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">That counselling should be provided on an optional basis</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">âThere is considerable common ground amongst Australians in their respect for motherhood and their desire to move forward with the debate on abortion. We believe this data, the second phase in a four phase project, provides the evidence and opportunity for change,â...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Senator Santoro has suggested that, prior to Medicare funded abortion procedures taking place, there ought to be mandatory access to Medicare funded independent professional counselling. Many Australians believe that there are too many abortions in this country and that more options should be given to women. They should be aware of what is available to them. At the present time I believe that many women are being pushed into abortions when they have not considered the available alternatives. I want to commend Senator Santoro, Dr Fleming and Ms Ewing on their contribution to this very important debate involving the lives of unborn Australians.</para>

<para>âI rise to bring the attention of the House to the Howard governmentâs litany of deception and distortions when it comes to their proposed detention centre at Pinkenba, in the Lilley electorate. I rise to inform the House of the governmentâs broken promise to engage in genuine consultation with the people of Lilley on their plans to build this unwanted detention centre at Pinkenba and to report on the continuing indifference of the government towards the legitimate concerns of local residents.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The government has finally owned up and admitted that it recently bought the Damascus Barracks site in Pinkenba in late May to build a 550-bed medium-security detention centre. This is a significant revelation because it confirms the governmentâs determination to force a medium-security prison of 550 beds onto an unwilling local community. Since 2001 the government has refused to come clean with the people and to reveal its plans for the site. There has been one deliberate deception after anotherâone thing said before the election and entirely another thing said after it. There has been underhanded sneakiness of the highest order.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">During the 2001 election, Minister Ruddock promised that the government had no intention of forcing a detention centre on an unwilling community and that any decisions that would be taken would be taken after the completion of the community consultation processes. They gave residents hopeâfalse hope in the endâthat the government would take on board their views. But clearly this was all window-dressing of a decision that had already been made. Two public meetings in the electorate and 90 per cent of residents surveyed voiced their opposition to a detention centre at Pinkenba, but the governmentâs mind was made up. After the 2001 election, Minister Ruddock wrote to me in July 2002 and said that they would go ahead with their plans whether locals approved or not. So the people of Lilley quickly learned that the government would say and do anything to get them through an election.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It was the same old story before and after the 2004 election. Before the election Minister Vanstone denied that a decision had been taken on the centre at Pinkenba, but the budget documents after the election belled the cat, showing that money had been set aside for the project. Of course, this was confirmed when the government purchased the Damascus Barracks site in the last month or so. The people of Lilley will not forget the lies and the distortions of the Howard government when it comes to Pinkenba, especially those local residents who have fought hard against this proposed detention centre, including Margo Canavan, Betty Baldwin and Sandy Spadotto.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Now that the government have admitted to buying the site without any meaningful consultation they are one stop closer to building a medium-security prison right within the metropolitan area. Building this detention centre in the middle of a built-up community is simply ridiculous. It is even more ridiculous, given what the government have been saying more recently about the nature of detention. I just do not see the need to continue with a 550-bed medium-security prison for the centre if their policy has changed fundamentally. The government like to pretend that this facility is only for visa overstayers, but there are very few of those each night in Brisbane. This is not some small holding centre; this is a fully-fledged, 550-bed medium-security prison located close to the airport and close to built-up communities. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âOn Friday evening I met with a number of local charter fishing operators who are very concerned about the proposed impost of some $30,000 per vessel in annual costs to their chartering operations being determined by the state government. While I understand the need to tighten maritime regulations and introduce a sense of uniformity to national navigational and safety guidelines, the blanket application of these rules without reference to local maritime conditions or safety conditions is draconian and deeply unfair to local business people. The new rules, which are contained within part D of the National Standard for Commercial Vessels, came out of four years of work by the National Marine Safety Committee. This process sought to review and replace the uniform shipping laws and provide an updated framework upon which state and territory governments could base new codes. Part D provides for a national standard of crew competency as well as standards for minimum adequate crewing levels.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Most of the charter fishing vessels operating out of the shire do so on a shoestring budget. Often these businesses are operated by people who have retired from their principal job and use their charter business as a way of ensuring they have fuel in their boat and a modest income in retirement. In other cases these businesses are full-time professional careers for residents trying to support young families. Adding between $30,000 and $90,000 to the annual operating costs of these businesses will ensure that most of the small operators will be forced out of businessâin the short term and at great personal financial loss.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The National Standard for Commercial Vessels does specify a minimum crew, but it also specifically provides for local equivalent solutions for crewing. I put it to the New South Wales Maritime Authority that it is within their power to ensure the continued viability of these local small businesses. When framing these kinds of rules, clauses that provide for a local solution are not inserted merely for fun; they are drafted to provide for specific instances of where risks are lower. In an area like Cronulla, where the boats are operating within sight of land and close to the best rescue facilities in Australia, I firmly support a local equivalent solution. There is no pressing safety requirement for these changes. There have been no fatalities in New South Wales waters which have been the result of a lack of crew. The only recent death on a charter fishing vessel was at Narooma in 2003, when the vessel capsized while crossing Narooma bar. In Cronulla, Botany Bay and Sydney Harbour there are no bars to cross, with deep channel entries to the ocean circumventing these kinds of problems. The New South Wales government and the New South Wales Maritime Authority need to look at proposals from local boat operators in a constructive way to ensure that they do not drive local operators out of business.</para>

<para>âIn the Australian parliament today I wish to pay tribute to three local identities in Logan City who all gained life membership of the Australian Labor Party at the most recent ALP state conference held in Cairns. They are Wes Young, Michael Eborn and Don Wilkie.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Wes Young joined the party 35 years ago in 1970. In 1976 he transferred from the Acacia Ridge branch to Woodridge branch. Wes has never sought an official position within the ALP, but whenever he was called upon to provide any voluntary assistance he was always happy to do so, often manning single-person booths in the olden days. Wes is a very valued member of the party and also of the broader community. He has a talent that, for reasons best known to Wes, he himself has hidden, and that is that he is a very well-performed singer. We had the pleasure of listening to Wes on one occasion in my office and I would encourage Wes to display his talents more often. He is a great contributor and good on Wes for the contribution that he has made already over 35 years.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The second person rewarded with life membership at the state conference in Queensland was Michael Eborn. Michael is one of natureâs gentlemen. He is always available and volunteers to help. Within the ALP he has organised all of the branches in the state seat of Woodridge for more years than most of us can remember. But, in a sense more importantly, Michael is a great contributor to the broader community. He is a regular attender at St Bernadineâs church, a terrific guy and, I think, an ornament to the local community in Logan City. He has made an enormous contribution, very quietly going about his business but always available to help those who need a helping hand.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The third of the three amigos is Don Wilkie. Don too is a very gentle soul. Don works in my office. I met him in the early 1990s when I was being introduced into the local area of Woodridge. There were a lot of tough nuts in the suburb of Woodridge but Don had lived in and around the area for many years and he introduced me to the local characters there and that ultimately led to my preselection and entering parliament. Don has enriched the lives of so many people, particularly migrants, because he works very hardâand I must say very successfullyâon family reunion programs. It is just so delightful to see the beaming faces of people when Don is able to help them. So good on all three of them.</para>

</talker>
<para>âI rise in the Main Committee to draw attention to the issue of the Pacific Highway, a major element of our transport infrastructure that is producing problems along the east coast of Australia. Certainly within my electorate, and particularly in the community of Coffs Harbour, the issues of traffic congestion and the high rate of accidents along the highway are causing great concern. I welcomed a visit to Coffs Harbour on 27 May 2005 by the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr John Anderson, to discuss issues about the Pacific Highway with local government representatives and concerned members of the business community. I am pleased that the federal government is currently working hard to negotiate an ongoing 10-year agreement for the continued upgrade of the highway. I think it is vital that this work continue just as quickly as possible. I certainly welcomed the announcement last year of $765 million to continue the upgrade of the road until 2008-09. This is vital work that just needs to occur.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">One particular item of local infrastructure that can substantially assist traffic flows and substantially improve safety around Coffs Harbour is the completion of the Hogbin Drive extension. This road runs parallel to the existing highway, and completing the last elements of this road has the capacity to take some 15,000 cars a day off the Pacific Highway and allow for separation of local traffic from highway traffic. It is vitally important that people going about their local business are able to travel an alternative route to the highway and be separated from the large numbers of heavy vehicles that are commuting along the Pacific Highway.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Council has already invested a substantial amount of funds in completing the northern section of this road but there is still one missing link in the project which will cost in the order of $15 million. If that section of road were completed we would see an improvement in traffic flows along the highway, a reduction in the road congestion around the Bray Street intersection and an improvement in the environment around the jetty area by removing some of the traffic which flows through that very fashionable jetty area of Coffs Harbour. A further substantial benefit would be that travel times would be dramatically reduced, particularly from the airport to the resort developments on the northern side of Coffs Harbour.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The completion of the Hogbin Drive extension will have substantial benefits through reduced congestion, improved safety and improved environment within the city of Coffs Harbour. It is a project that must go ahead. I have certainly been lobbying the Deputy Prime Minister to see in what ways the federal government can assist to provide funding for this much-needed road upgrade. A partnership between state, federal and local government could achieve this much-needed work and these improvements in environmental outcomes and in traffic flows that our community so greatly desires and so greatly needs. I think that it is a vital piece of infrastructure that must be completed. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI am pleased to comment on the committeeâs report, which focused on the first public hearing with the Reserve Bank governor since the formation of the 41st Parliament. Importantly, these hearings provide for public interchange and go some way towards satisfying the expectation that, although the Reserve Bank should make its decisions independently of government, monetary policy decisions should have some degree of transparency and accountability, given their potential impact on all Australians.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">In his statement, the Reserve Bank governor gave an overall picture of the national economy that was somewhat different from the rosy view we get in parliament from the Treasurer. But the main interest is always in the movement of interest rates, and at that hearing it was clearly evident that rates would riseâas they did in March, when they rose by 25 points, remaining at that level since.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Significantly, the Governor of the RBA departed from standard practice and expressed concerns regarding some imbalances in the economy. He gave a clear signal to the government that, while monetary policy could influence the interplay between demand and supply to maintain economic growth, only the government could institute reform that would reposition the economy and allow it to take full advantage of the economic opportunities presented. The governor claimed that, without reform to address capacity constraints, infrastructureâespecially ports and export transport chainsâand skills, the risk of wage increases was high and the ability to maintain commodity and resource export levels could be compromised.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Inconsistency in economic indicators was also canvassed by the committee when it was revealed that 2004 GDP growth actually came in at 1.5 per cent, much lower than the forecast of 3.75 per cent. This clearly suggested to some committee members that a slowdown was occurring and that therefore an interest rate rise would not be justified. However, the governor was of the view that anecdotal evidence suggested consumption and demand were continuing to increase, and that was worrying to him. Interestingly, the ABS have since revised their retail sales figures upwards for the last years, apologising for their deviation from their usual high standard of reliable statistics. However, upward trends in retail sales, consumer confidence and wage growth had at the time clearly convinced the Reserve Bank that there was a need to dampen demand.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Secretary of Treasury has put forward a conflicting view since the hearing, which is that capacity constraints and skills and infrastructure blockages will not damage the economy sharplyânor, he claims, will they fuel inflation. His confidence in the ability of the market to adapt to these constraints is not surprising, and I think the Port of Newcastle is an excellent example of that. However, it seems that any attempt to apologise for the failure of government to anticipate, plan for and respond to these important determiners of economic success through real reform would be indefensible.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">At the time of the hearing it was not known to us that the May budget would take on the supply constraint challenges by offering big tax cuts to the suppliers of capital for the economyâthe wealthiest individuals, who could be counted on to increase their savings and their investments as a resultâwhile providing very small tax cuts for over seven million taxpayers, ensuring that there would be no inflationary or expansionary impact from the tax cuts. That is the lazy approach to economic reform, matched by some equally ineffectual welfare to work measures and skilled immigration increases. I anticipate that the governor will be asked about that approach to reform when we meet again in August.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I attempted unsuccessfully to gain some insight into the normalising of regional data by the Reserve Bank and into how the Reserve Bank responds to divergences in the economy. Now that area of concern has since taken on some very different dimensions. The new divergence evident in our economy is between the states, not just between the regions and the capital cities. Growth in energy- and resource-rich states like Western Australia continues to be strong, whilst growth in the most populous states of New South Wales and Victoria is significantly slowing. This is another area for future discussions with the governor.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The current account deficit and the terms of trade conundrum will require further deliberations by the committee and the Reserve Bank of Australia. It has been suggested by some analysts that this presents a new dimension in our economy. We now have greater personal wealth, greater demand and consumption, increased ease of access to our markets by other countries, a continuing strong dollar, an exchange rate that favours imports and a domestic supply that does not match our consumption tastes or our demand levels. We are learning that some of the consequences of what some infer is the âGregory effectâ may include continuing unfavourable current account deficits and lower GDP figuresâfigures which, according to the governor, we will have to become more used to.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">What must also be mentioned is what was not disclosed at the initial hearing with the Reserve Bank. After the announcement of the interest rate rise in March, public statements were made by some board members suggesting that the decision to increase rates was far from unanimous. This is unusual, but perhaps points to the need for more transparency in the deliberations and decision making by the Reserve Bank. In fact, some members of the committee were interested in the deliberations that preceded the decision by the Reserve Bank not to raise interest rates in October 2004, when the housing boom was continuing apace. However, these were not disclosed.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The complaint to the AEC by the Reserve Bank regarding the governmentâs interest rate election advertising material compromising, perhaps, the independence of the RBA was not raised during the hearing. However, clearly we would like to discuss such an important issue, given the importance this country places on separation of responsibilities.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In concluding, I thank the Governor and the Reserve Bank of Australia for this important dialogue and express my appreciation to secretariat staff. I thank Bev Forbes in particular, David Richardson from the Parliamentary Library, economists Chris Richardson and Saul Eslake for their assistance to the committee. I also acknowledge the media and community interestâin particular, the presence of many high school students at the hearing.</para>

<para>âThe closing remark of the honourable member for Newcastle, Ms Grierson, noting the large number of school students at the Reserve Bank hearing in Sydney reminds me that many of these school students have a knowledge of economics that would put most professional economists to shame. One of the most challenging experiences I have in my electorate is visiting classes of senior economics students, who subject me to a grilling, the intensity of which I would like to think the standing committee on economics might be able to emulate at some point.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">In the course of the governorâs presentation to the committee he discussed, as the member for Newcastle has observed, the current account deficit. I wish to make a few comments about the nature of the current account deficit, reflecting on the governorâs observations. The current account deficit is at a record highâthere is no question about thatâbut it is not producing a record high of anxiety either among the business community or the economics community. Some of the reasons for that were identified by the governor. Firstly, we have a floating exchange rate, which is able to absorb the changes in international investor sentiment and the changes in flows of investment around the world. That gives us a great deal more flexibility than we had in the past.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Another feature of the current account deficit, or Australiaâs foreign debt, today is that it is not denominated in a foreign currency. The vast bulk of our borrowings is either in Australian dollars or hedged into Australian dollars. So in that sense, the foreign lenders are taking the currency risk. That, of course, is an enormous change from previous periods of high current account deficits. There are two other features about the current account deficit today. Firstly, the composition of it has changed remarkably. If we go back to the early or mid-1990s, we see that the current account deficit was composed of a very large fiscal deficit. The government was running deficits. It was a net borrower. Now Laborâs debt has been largely paid off and the federal government is moving to be a net lender. So the fiscal deficit has been largely eliminated.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">At the same time, in years gone by, Australian businesses were net borrowers; now they are net lenders. The switch that has occurred is with Australian households, which have gone from being net lendersâon a modest scale, to be fairâto being relatively considerably more indebted. That level of indebtedness has caused considerable concern not least to the Reserve Bank, not so much because of its impact on the current account deficit but simply because of the fact that, if households are highly leveraged, they are exposed to greater risk if financial conditions deteriorate, if income declines due to changes in the business climate or unemployment or if interest rates were to rise.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The rise in this household debt has been largely driven by the property boomâsome would say the property bubbleâand there is a very instructive analysis of this in a speech made late last year by the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, Glenn Stevens, in which he looks at the change in Australiaâs saving/investment position as a percentage of GDP over different periods where there has been an increase in the current account deficit. What is remarkable about the last period, which he sets out as being from September 2001 to September 2004, is that, as in previous periods, there was a decline in savings and an increase in investmentâthat is what produces the deficitâbut the three per cent increase in investment, which consisted of investment in dwellings, was extraordinarily high. So, in the period from June 1997 to March 1999 there was a 2.9 per cent increase in investment as a percentage of GDP, of which only 0.7 per cent was investment in dwellings. In the more recent period, 2001-04, that change in investment was three per cent, of which 1.7 per cent was investment in dwellings. What has driven the change is our fascination with real estate. That is why, in my view, we have seen this increase in borrowings by households, because obviously homesâpropertyâare very easy to borrow against. It is much easier to borrow against bricks and mortar than it is for a business to borrow against its own cash flow.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">More recently, there have been some signs that the air is leaking out of this bubble and, again, I refer to a recent speech by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, who observed that this slowing in domestic demand, which is taking pressure off the current account deficit because there is less demand for imports, is driven by change in the housing sector. In the last year we have seen a flattening of house pricesâin some markets, a declineâa slowing in mortgage lending and, so far, a relatively modest contraction in house building. All that represents a slowing in domestic demand and will, in due course, feed into a reduction in our current account deficit.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The opposition have raised the current account deficit issue and sought to criticise the government over it, but, on the several occasions I have heard the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer speak about this issue, I have never heard them identify any measures that the government should take. They have not, for example, suggested that the government should promote a recession in the manner of âthe recession we had to haveâ, which was the previous Labor tactic to address current account deficits. They have not suggested we should impose tariffs, I am pleased to hear. But they have rung the alarm bellsâ</para>

<para>âTo return to my train of thought, the opposition when dealing with this issue has been rather like somebody that calls out âFireâ but does not nominate any exits or any measures that can be used to address this apparent emergency. Historically, the logical response for governments when facing a current account deficit has been to put their own house in order and to save themselves. The Howard government has already done that.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">What are the measures that the government should be undertaking? In an MPI last week, the Leader of the Opposition quoted from an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Economist</inline> which referred to the current account deficit. Probably because of a lack of time the Leader of the Opposition was not able to refer to two other factors in that <inline font-style="italic">Economist</inline> article. They were the remedies or the measures that the <inline font-style="italic">Economist</inline> urged the Australian government to undertake. What were those? Taxation reform and workplace relations reform. Is the government undertaking those? Yes. Does the opposition support them? No.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The <inline font-style="italic">Economist</inline>, which was relied upon by the opposition in that MPI, also cast its own judgment on Australiaâs capacity to deal with this issue. It did so by predicting that next year the current account deficit will have been reduced from somewhere over seven per cent of GDP to around five per cent of GDPâand some forecasters estimate it will go below five per cent. What that very distinguished economic journal was saying was that the economic reform measures that the government should be undertaking to deal with the current account deficitâamong other thingsâare exactly the measures that this government is undertaking and exactly the measures that are opposed by the Labor Party. The <inline font-style="italic">Economist</inline> cast its own judgment into the future and expected that those measures would be successful.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Before I accept the question from my friend the member for Melbourne Ports, I make one last observation on the importance of tax reform. It is quite clear that a major driver of the property boom has been the fact that, for taxpayers on higher incomes in higher brackets, leveraged negative geared property investments have offered a very attractive form of tax-effective investment. That has been the subject of commentary by a wide range of commentatorsânot least among them, the Reserve Bank governor himself. There was a very perceptive article in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> on 20 June, which made the observation that in the budget we saw a welcome reversal of adverse recent trends in policy towards household saving. The author, Geoffrey Kingston, said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">By abolishing the superannuation surcharge and cutting the proportion of households exposed to the top two marginal rates, it offers big incentives for middle Australia to save less for retirement via leveraged property and more via superannuation.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It should help remedy the inordinate 63 per cent of our private net worth locked up in dwelling assets and the upsurge in our foreign debt to 50 per cent of GDP.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In these ways, the 2005-06 budget truly brings home the bacon. Assuming the budget fulfils its promise of lifting savings in vehicles other than leveraged property, the task of future budgets will be to reinforce success.</para>

<para>âThat is a question which will take a little while to answer. You might regret asking it. America has a very different relationship with China than Australia does. America has a wide range of manufacturing industries which are subject to increasing competition from China. Chinaâs competitiveness in the manufacturing sector is extraordinary and, obviously, if the yuan is revalued, that will make, prima facie, Chinese exports to America more expensive. That is obviously what American manufacturers seek.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">There is a very interesting dimension to Chinaâs manufacturing journey from Australiaâs point of view. One of the reasons our terms of trade have improved is not simply because the price of our raw material has increased but because the price of our imports, particularly manufactured goods from Chinaâthe worldâs leading manufacturer nowadaysâhave decreased. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted.)</inline> Chinaâs ability to produce higher value, more complex manufactured goods, which have traditionally come from higher cost countries, will not only impact adversely on manufacturers in the United States but also benefit Australiaâs terms of trade. We will benefit from that because, of course, we are not producing those capital goods and equipment ourselves anyway.</para>

<para>âI make the observation for the member for Melbourne Ports that China is already a big producer of motor cars. There are obviously risks and threats from China to everybody in its domination of the manufacturing universe, but the risks to the United States are considerably greater than ours and the opportunities for Australia outweigh the risks. As Chinaâs manufacturing activities move into higher value products, there is likely to be a continued improvement in our terms of trade both as the price of imports declines and as demand for our raw material exports from China increases.</para>

<para>âI rise to comment on the report <inline font-style="italic">Working for Australiaâs future: increasing participation in the workforce</inline> tabled in the House some months ago. This report, the result of a significant amount of work by 10 members of the House of Representatives, points to some of the deficiencies we have currently in the way in which the government is handling very important matters and provides the government with an opportunity to attend to those deficiencies in its policy.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">First, I would like to express my appreciation to all members of the committee, who worked long and hard to produce a very significant report. In particular, I would like to extend my appreciation to the chair of the committee, the member for Deakin, who led the committee well in its proceedings. I would also like to make particular reference to the members for Calwell, Shortland, Swan, Brisbane and Canberra, and the shadow minister for small business, Tony Burke, who also participated. This effort has covered two terms of this parliament. The report had its inception in the last parliamentary term, but much of the analysis and construction of the report, based on the evidence before the committee, was done in this term. So there are a number of members to thank. Along with the member for Deakin, there were certainly other government members who put a lot of time and effort into ensuring that this important committee handed down a very broad-ranging report on increasing participation in our work force.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Parliamentary committees are a very important function of democracy and of our system. I am concerned about the revelations that were outlined by the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on Monday and since thenâand I understand that they may continueâthat have highlighted the failure by government to respond to the majority of committee reports in recent years. I am most concerned about that because parliamentary committees are a reflection of how democratic our institution is. If the findings of parliamentary committees are not properly responded to and respected, it means the parliament is not being respected. I should not have to remind the government that enshrined in the Constitution are not only powers to the executive but also separate powers to the parliament. With the coming 1 July change to the composition of the Senate and the governmentâs political opportunities in having majorities in both houses, today is a good time to remind the governmentâin light of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Heraldâs</inline> articles on the abject failure by government to respond to parliamentary committeesâthat they have an obligation, not only by convention but pursuant to the Constitution, to respond to and respect the parliament and not allow the executive to run roughshod over the parliament. I say that because, as the member for Deakin already outlined, there are many unanimous recommendations in this report that go to fundamental issues concerning our economy. Yes, it is true to say that there were some significant areas of disagreement and dissent. Indeed, four membersâopposition members, it so happensâfelt the need to dissent particularly in areas that went to how industrial relations and disability pensions operate.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I will firstly focus upon those areas that we agreed upon, because government and Labor members of the committee agreed on 20 of the 23 recommendations. I want to touch upon a number of them. The committee got it right when it said there was a real need for us to attend to the skills crisis in this country. The committee made some recommendations, firstly by listening to evidence not only from the ACTU and social institutions like ACOSS but from peak employer bodies, who quite clearly said that their No. 1 concern in the workplace was not industrial relations but the skills shortagesâthe skills that workers need for us to respond to the changes in the economy. We now know that there has been a revolution in the workplace as a result of the changes in our economy as a result of a rapid change precipitated by what is called globalisation. Indeed, the newer economies are growing at a much faster rate than what are termed the older economies. But unfortunately, the government has failed to anticipate the skills required. Therefore, it is brave, wise and proper that not only Labor members of the committee but also government members of the committee point to those deficiencies.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Recommendation 2 is:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Committee recommends that the Australian Government in cooperation with the State and Territory governments, industry, unions and educational bodies expand programs to maximise the uptake of apprenticeships in areas of skills shortages and ensure that the training is relevant to the apprentices, the businesses and the industry.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">That recommendation seeks to attend to the deficiencies that we currently experience and to get the executive of the parliament to respond to our concerns. Whilst there was passing reference by the Treasurer to some of these things, we think that what should have happened, if the executive had been listening to the parliament, is that the executiveâindeed the Treasurer on budget nightâshould have announced in the budget in the second week in May some comprehensive response in the area of skill shortages and taken up the recommendations made by opposition and government members in relation to skills. Unfortunately they fell on deaf ears. We do not really believe to date that the government has properly responded to this recommendation or incorporated it into its thinking and its policy. There have been a lot of words spoken about skill shortages but little proper response. The government would be wise to start considering our recommendations in that area.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The committee recommended unanimously:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... that the Australian Government establish, as a priority, a dedicated cross-portfolio approach to develop a coordinated long-term strategy, including a series of newly funded programs and defined outcomes, to address national skills shortages.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">We believe there has to be some proactive intervention by the government to attend to the deficiencies in the economy, to attend to a matter that they have neglected for nine years and to really start anticipating what every other commentator and participant in the economy has already anticipatedâthat is, as the economy evolves and as the skills mix requirements change, we must be proactive in anticipating those changes. Indeed, I applaud the government members who have come to that realisation, although they had no choice in this regard because they listened to the evidence. The evidence from the ACTU and ACOSS and, more significantly, the peak employer bodies was that employers have major problems in finding people to undertake new work and work that is evolving and developing in our economy. I do want to applaud all members of the committee in finding common ground in that area.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I also want to quickly touch upon some other recommendations. There was a recommendation for the government to attend to the effective marginal tax rates. We really believe, again, that this was another opportunity lost by the Treasurer and by the government. It is very clear to us now that the effective marginal tax rates are way too high for lower to middle-income earners. They are effectively an institutionalised, entrenched disincentive to find employment, when you have a combination of taxes and subsidies that could actually lead to people paying 70 per cent and 80 per cent. In fact, there was one situation where the combination of an amount of income, youth allowance and Newstart allowance actually resulted in a 104 per cent tax impost upon a person. So in fact they lost money when they worked.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I moved a motion in the House in 2003 on effective marginal tax rates and the need to reduce them. The committee has recommended that that matter be attended to. Again, six government members, along with four Labor members, agreed that the government should attend to this matter so that those people on middle and lower incomes who are in receipt of some government assistance would not be penalised because they seek work. Again, instead of looking to mitigate the problems associated with that matter, the government has decided to ignore the fundamental concern here, give 45 per cent of the $24 billion to 10 per cent of income earners and really not address the systemic problems in our tax system. I do applaud the wisdom, courage and good sense of all members of the committee in relation to those matters.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I turn now very briefly to the three areas of dissent that existed. It probably does not surprise you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we did have some difficulty reconciling our views in relation to industrial law, industrial relations and industrial governance. The evidence we heard from a variety of groups indicated a number of things. Firstly, flexibility in the workplace can be achieved in all manner of waysâthrough temporary employment, casual employment or part-time employment, for example. There are all sorts of ways for any employer with any wit at all to ensure that they have a flexible workplace. Indeed, what we were given by way of evidence was that amongst the OECD countries we have the most casualised work force. However, notwithstanding that, the majority of the committee decided, against the will of the four dissenting members, to recommend that government pursue strategies for further award simplificationâby reducing the number of allowable matters and encouraging greater work force customisation. Indeed, they also recommended that the government examine mechanisms to remove barriers to part-time and casual employment in industrial awards and other industrial arrangements.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">If an employer in this country cannot use the current system in a flexible way then they really have no idea what opportunities they have under the current arrangements. You can employ people using fixed term arrangements, casual arrangements or part-time arrangements. What else is required to provide flexibility? I guess that when government members talk about flexibility they are talking about a one-way flexibility. Their idea of flexibility is really an assault upon the maintenance of some balance in the workplace for workers, who deserve a decent quality of lifeâand the capacity to balance work and familyâand some decency and dignity when they spend so much of their time in their workplaces. Instead, on this occasion government members of this committee blindly followed the ideology of John Howard, Peter Costello and other government frontbenchers and actually contradicted the evidence provided to the committee.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Finally, I had concerns about the disability support pension recommendation. We clearly see this so-called welfare to work proposition as a completely bogus proposition. There has been no money properly afforded to this area to ensure that people with disabilities will find genuine work. This is a way of placing people with disabilitiesâthe most vulnerable people in our societyâin a situation where they will not have the same amount of assistance. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the member for Gorton, the Deputy Chair of the Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation, on the excellent work he did on that committee. An increase in labour force participation is necessary to deal with the problem of Australiaâs ageing population. With an ageing population and a higher proportion of the population not of working age, it is necessary to have more of the people who are within working age actually in work. On that the government and the opposition are in the white heat of agreement.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">We also agree on the benefit of work for individuals. Work can provide a sense of achievement and a sense of worth. There are few things worse for a community than a sense of welfare dependency. This is apparent in some of the public housing communities in my electorate and other electorates where three generations of welfare dependants live side by side and young people have very few non-welfare-dependent role models. This report is a good exposition of the economic need to increase Australiaâs participation rate. I do not agree with all its conclusions, but I do think it has put the case well for urgent action to increase the participation rate.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Before I turn to Welfare to Work, I would like to talk about productivity and particularly research and development, which this report deals with in its early stages. As a nation, we need to invest more in research and development. I was drawn to the Australian Industry Groupâs submission to this inquiry, which pointed out that Australia and New Zealand are the only two countries in the OECD where private investment in R&amp;D is less than public investment. We have seen R&amp;D investment levels in Australia in recent years much lower than they were in 1996, and only now are they approaching the levels that they were at when the Keating government left office in 1996. Personally, I believe this governmentâs decision to reduce the tax concession for R&amp;D from 150 per cent to 125 per cent to be probably the most backward decision it has taken in the realm of economics. The report correctly highlights the need for more R&amp;D. The committee makes no specific recommendation about going back to a 150 per cent tax concession, but I think the thrust of the committeeâs report was certainly heading in that direction. The committeeâs work lends itself to that conclusion, and restoring the tax concession to 150 per cent would be logical place to start.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On another matter, the report correctly highlights the growing issue of brain drain, of people leaving Australia. Over the last five years, the number of Australian-born people leaving to live overseas permanently has doubled. Of course, many of these are young and well-educated people. There are two ways of looking at this. On the one hand this is a problem which the government and society need to addressâand I do not make a political point about this, because there is no easy answerâbut there are advantages and opportunities here.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I was drawn to a recent report by the Lowy Institute called <inline font-style="italic">Diasporaâthe world wide web of Australians</inline>, by Dr Michael Fullilove and Dr Chloe Flutter. The report deals with this issue of the growing number of Australians living permanently overseas and the wealth of talent and networking that Australians working overseas in very high-ranking positions can provide to Australia, particularly with the trade opportunities that that can create for Australia. The report calls on the government and the parliament to take this issue seriously, to develop those networks and to make it a major goal of our diplomatic corps to have links with the Australian diaspora living overseas.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Lowy Institute report actually recommends the establishment of a parliamentary committee on the diaspora. Whether or not that is a good thing, I am not sure. But it is certainly something this parliament needs to consider, and it lends itself quite easily to the work of this committeeâs reportâthat the government and the parliament need to deal with the matter of more Australians living permanently overseas. On the one hand we need to take steps to encourage them to come back to Australia when they have learned great skills in places like America, Europe and Asia and to contribute to the Australian economy. But on the other hand, while they are living overseas, we need to encourage them to make the most of their experiences and the networking opportunities that are available.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would now like to turn to the major part of this report, which is of course the issue of Welfare to Work. The committee concentrates on the issue of disability pension and parenting allowance, and it does this for good reasons. I wholeheartedly endorse recommendation 4 of the committee, which is:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Committee recommends that the Australian Government review the tax-free threshold, taper rates, effective marginal tax rates and income test stacking to maximise incentives to move from income support payments to increased participation in paid work.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">This was a bipartisan recommendation of the committee, as the deputy chair pointed out, but unfortunately it has not been taken up by the government. The government did not lift the tax-free threshold in the recent budget. Admittedly, it did propose a reduction in the lowest marginal tax rate from 17 per cent to 15 per cent, but this would be nowhere near as effective as Laborâs proposal of an extended low-income earners rebate, which would see the effective tax-free threshold at $10,000 a year. So Labor has taken up the committeeâs recommendations; the government has not.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In relation to taper rates, the governmentâs actions have been counterproductive. The taper rate for the so-called enhanced Newstart allowance is 60c in the earned dollar; however, the taper rate under the disability support pension is 40c in the earned dollar at low incomes. So the government has actually increased the effective marginal tax rate for people trying to move from the disability support pension into work.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">An opposition member</inline>âIt is disgraceful.</para>

<para>âIt is disgraceful. Labor has taken up the committeeâs recommendations and the government has not. The government has failed to act to improve the effective marginal tax rates. NATSEM modelling has shown that the effective marginal tax rates of over 60 per cent are a real disincentive to work. Tax rates are more than 60 per cent under the governmentâs proposed Welfare to Work changes. So, again, Labor has embraced the issue of reducing effective marginal tax rates, reducing taper rates and providing increased encouragement for people to move from welfare to work. This government has ignored the issue. Just this week, we saw the government ignoring a range of parliamentary inquiries and reports, and this is another one where the government had a golden opportunity in the budget to take up the bipartisan recommendations of this committee and it has completely ignored it. The OECD has also identified reductions in the effective marginal tax rates as one of the most pressing needs for the Australian economy.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">Reduced effective marginal tax rates were an important part of the welfare to work reforms implemented in the United States in 1996 and Great Britain in 1998. These two nations have introduced earned income tax credits, which is one way of reducing the effective marginal tax rate. Whichever way is chosen, the government must take action to reduce effective marginal tax rates. We will not see real welfare to work reform until this happens.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In relation to the parenting allowance and the transition of sole parents from welfare to work, the committee also received some interesting submissions. I was drawn to the submission of Associate Professor Austen of the Womenâs Economic Policy Analysis Unit of Curtin University of Technology. I endorse her submission.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Part of that submission says:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... womenâs ability to successfully respond to labour market opportunities, without sacrificing fertility, will depend on support given to them as they try to balance their paid and unpaid working roles. The gender division of unpaid labour; institutional support such as childcare and elder care, and availability of parental and other forms of paid leave will be vital in securing both economic outcomes for the nation and the wellbeing of Australian women.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I have said on other occasions in the House just how inadequate the governmentâs actions have been in promoting welfare to work amongst sole parents. The government has reduced sole parentsâ benefits by moving them onto an allowance that is lower than the one they had before. Worse still, the enhanced Newstart Allowance actually has a more punitive taper rate than the parenting payment, with a taper rate for low-income earners of 60 per cent instead of the 40 per cent taper rate that applies under the parenting allowance. Just as we saw with the disability pension, we see with the parenting allowance the government increasing the effective marginal tax rates for people trying to do the right thingâtrying to move from welfare to work. Instead of the government encouraging them, as its rhetoric says it does, it punishes them. The government takes an ideological stake and drives it through as it punishes people trying to move from welfare to work. If you believed the governmentâs rhetoric you would believe that it was trying to help people moving from welfare to work, but what it is doing is punishing people who are trying to move from welfare to work.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The government has also clearly failed to create anywhere near enough out of school hours care places to cater for sole parents returning to work. I note that even the Treasury, in its submission to this inquiry, says that women might find it easier to return to the work force with adequate and affordable child care. I would put it a little bit more strongly than the Treasury. The Treasury says child care might help; I think it is pretty obvious that it would help. But even the Treasury recognises the importance of child care. The government has not followed this up with adequate action. There will be 80,000 places created, but there is a shortfall already of 30,000 places. Before anybody moves from welfare to work, we have a shortfall in this country of 30,000 out of school hours places.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I make a prediction that the 80,000 places now being created will be woefully inadequate and that the government, perhaps in the budget next year or the year after that, will create more places. It will be forced into action, it will claim credit and say, âLook how wonderful we areâ, but really it should be creating all those places right now, as people move from welfare to work. Half of the funding for these places does not come online until 2008-09, while these reforms apply from 2006. Even when the extra positions do come online, they will be inadequate. The government will then create more positions, and will claim all the credit, but really it should be doing that right now.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The UK government has taken a very different approach to the Australian government. Despite all the measures of support and assistance that the Blair government has provided, it still does not require sole parents to work until the child in question is 16. In contrast, this government has provided hardly any support for sole parents to return to work, yet it requires them to seek work when the youngest child turns six.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is also a contrast when it comes to assisting disabled people to return to the work force. Recipients of a disability pension in Great Britain are also able to access a personal adviser, who helps them develop an individually tailored plan to return to the work force. Government members should take note that, in addition, the Blair government has introduced a disabled personâs tax credit, at a cost of Â£120 million. Again, this reduces effective marginal tax rates for people moving from welfare to work.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">So this government, in its wisdom, increases effective marginal tax rates, reduces support and pushes people back into the work force. The Blair government reduces effective marginal tax rates and puts Â£120 million into a personal work force access plan so that each person seeking to move from the disability pension into the work force has a personal adviser to help them work out their travel plans, how to get around on public transport in their wheelchairs et cetera. They get very personal and individually catered support from the Blair government, which still does not require sole parents to return to work until their youngest child is 16. This punishing government, by contrast, requires people to return to work when their youngest child is six.</para>

<para>âAs I was saying before the calling of a division, the contrast between the Blair governmentâs approach and the Howard governmentâs approach is stark. To continue that theme, in the area of child care the government of the United Kingdom has taken action to extend child care and out of school hours care. It has spent Â£330 million to provide out of school hours care for up to half a million people. It has also provided Â£100 million to improve training for child-care providers, taking all the steps necessary to encourage and support people as they do the right thing and try to move from welfare to work.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">The early figures in Britain on the number of people returning from welfare to work are encouraging and heartening. It is too early to say just how successful the British governmentâs scheme has been, but, as I say, the early figures are encouraging. I am not saying that the Blair governmentâs approach is perfect or that it should or could be adopted lock, stock and barrel in this country. However, one thing is clear: the Blair government has taken the approach that people on welfare often face great challenges in making the transition to work. The government of the United Kingdom has adopted the approach that these people should be helped and supported as they face the challenges involved in moving from welfare to work. The Howard government has taken the approach that the best way to encourage people to move from welfare into the work force is to reduce their benefits and to increase their effective marginal tax rates. Given a choice, I know which model I preferâand it is not the Australian model, I am sorry to say.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This is one of the most important economic issues facing our country. This report does a good job of outlining why it is so important. However, the Howard governmentâs reforms do not maximise the chances of moving people from welfare into work and they are based on bad economics. I hope the government listens to the alternative approaches, embraces them for the sake of our economy and listens to the unanimous views of this committee, both government and opposition, on the sorts of things that the government should be embracing to encourage people to move from welfare to work. I do not expect the government to embrace the minority report, although I hope it might, but I do expect it to embrace the unanimous report, which it has so far ignored. I encourage the government to do that.</para>

<para>âAs a person who served on the Standing Committee on Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation for the entire period of the inquiry this report is aboutâfrom June 2003, when the terms of reference were given to the committee by Tony Abbott, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations at the time, right up until the report was tabled in parliament in March this yearâI want to put on the record my thanks to all those people who gave evidence to the committee and to the staff attached to the committee. It was very much appreciated by all of us. We learnt a lot from those people and from hearing about their experiencesâthe experiences of people within the work force, the experiences of people who tried to obtain work and the experiences of people who were involved in various industries, training organisations and unions. The committee received evidence from a wide range of people.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">During my contribution today I would like to go through some of the issues that were raised during the inquiry. I have to say that I strongly support the recommendations of the report that were unanimous and those which were contained in the dissenting report. I will spend some time going through the dissenting report later, but I would like to start with the issue of skills shortages. The committee received overwhelming evidence from a variety of people about the fact that there are significant skills shortages within the Australian economy and community. That evidence came not just from one group but from a wide variety of people.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Manpower Australia believes that Australia risks economic irrelevance unless its skills shortages are addressed. The shortages occur in a number of key areas. We need to address the shortages in those key areas if we are going to be competitive in the global market, but I really feel that the government has failed to address this issue of skills shortages and failed to address the fact that we are facing chronic shortages in the area of trades. We need to put significant investment into the area of developing and skilling up our work force. We do not need rhetoric. We need action. We need to listen to the messages that we are getting from organisations such as Manpower, Employment Services Australia and the Australian Industry Group. The message has come from a wide range of people that we have a chronic skills shortage in Australia. If we do not address that, we are going to become irrelevant.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We need to put significant investment into the area of developing and skilling up our work force. We do not need rhetoric. We need action. We need to listen to the messages that we are getting from organisations such as Manpower, Employment Services Australia and the Australian Industry Group. The message has come from a wide range of people that we have a chronic skills shortage in Australia. If we do not address that, we are going to become irrelevant.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would like to spend some time discussing issues surrounding mature age employees. One of the most disappointing submissions that the committee received, from my perspective, was from Professor Saunders. Professor Saunders tended to write off mature age workers. He was of the opinion that it is a waste of money to try to retrain a blue-collar worker and get that person back into the work force. I find that highly offensive. At a time when we have an ageing population and when we need to encourage mature age workers to re-enter the work force, somebody who puts himself up as an expert says that these menâhe highlighted menâare irrelevant. These negative stereotypes that exist in the community affect Australiaâs ability to utilise a vital part of our work force.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I agree with the Treasurer when he says that we need to get more mature age workers back into the work force. We should value these people. They are a valuable asset to Australia. With ideas like those expressed by Professor Saunders, we will go backwards, rather than forwards. I believe it is possible to retrain mature age workers and that, if we make the proper investment, as a nation we will be rewarded.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">One of the organisations from which the committee received evidence was Westpac. Their evidence was in stark contrast to the evidence that we received from Professor Saunders. Westpac have adopted a policy of employing mature age workers. They can see that this is of great benefit to them. It puts them in a very strong competitive position in relation to other banks. Westpac believe that mature age people relate better to older people when they come into the bank. Westpac are employing mature age people within the client service area. People feel a certain confidence when a mature age person serves them at the counter. Westpac have employed somebody who is in excess of 70 years of age. That is highly commendable. That is the type of approach we would like to see taken by businesses in Australiaânot the negative approach of Professor Saunders, but rather the positive approach of Westpac.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The level of unemployment amongst Indigenous Australians is a condemnation of what is happening in Australia. All the strategies that have been introduced have failed this group in our community. They are over-represented in our jails and they are well and truly over-represented in the unemployment figures. For too long the approach to addressing Indigenous unemployment has been to start another CDEP program. It is time we were serious about addressing this issue. Until we do, we cannot hold our head up high as a nation.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This brings me to people with disabilities. We received a large body of evidence relating to people with disabilities. The recommendation of this committee with regard to this issue is one that I dissented from. I have a long history of working with people with disabilities, helping them access employment. I spent 13 years working as a rehabilitation counsellor, helping people with disabilities enter the work force. The current proposal and the recommendation put forward in this report will undermine the ability of people with disabilities to enter the work force. The first thing that a person with a disability needs to have before they are prepared to enter the work force or are able to even think about entering the work force is confidence that they will not be worse off. You must appreciate that there is a big risk associated with it. A person with a disability could obtain a job and only be able to maintain that employment for a very short period of time. Once you go over the magic 15 hours a week that is being proposed by the government, it will cause all sorts of difficulties for these people.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">To be able to assist a person with a disability successfully move from being on a disability support pension or Newstart, you need to have in place a proper program with a proper case manager. You need to have in place all the support that that person will need to successfully make that transition. If you have somebody who is moving from working in a manual occupation and is looking at entering something like a clerical position, you need to make sure that they have the proper ergonomic furniture, you need to have the workplace looked at and you need to make sure that you are not setting that person up for failure. One of the easiest things to do is get the job; it is maintaining the employment that is the difficulty.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">When I was very new in the position of finding jobs for people with disabilities, I developed a relationship with a number of people who were going through a program. These people were alcoholics. When they were sober, it was very easy to find a job for them. I managed to find employment for five or six of them. Unfortunately, it was only for a very short time that they maintained their employment. One of those people ended up being murdered. Once they found employment they felt secure, they felt that they had money, they felt that they were okay and they were tempted to have a drink, and they did so. The reason they failed was that there was no proper support in place for them after they found that jobâat that time I was working as a disability officer with an organisation that only had placement procedures. Subsequently I worked with an organisation that provided ongoing support, and the outcomes were much better. So I say to the government: be very cautious about where you go with these disability support changes, because there can be very negative outcomes if the proper supports are not in place. It is long-term support that is needed. Unless that happens, we are going to be setting a whole lot of people up for failure.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I am sure members on the other side of this House do not wish to do that. I am sure they want to see people with disabilities succeed when they re-enter the work force. The Treasurer said in his budget speech that he would particularly target people with back injuries. Once again, that group needs to have the proper support in place, including the proper ergonomic furniture that I detailed earlier.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In the last couple of minutes remaining to me, I will turn to the dissenting report. Recommendation 1 of the committee states:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">The Committee recommends that the Australian Government pursue strategies for further award simplification by reducing the number of allowable matters and encouraging greater workplace customisation to suit industry and regional conditions.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I cannot think of one occasion on which that proposal was presented to the committee. That was not the tone of the evidence we received. The government members took this up and ran with it.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We do not feel that casualisation and part-time employment is benefiting the Australian work force. Increased casualisation means less security in the future, which does not in any way benefit workers. If this government is truly about building a strong economy, workers need security so they can plan for the future, obtain housing loans, buy houses and care for their families. This increasing casualisation is not the choice of workers. Some people have been employed for seven years as casuals. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI am very pleased to speak to the report on workplace participation. I was Deputy Chair of the Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Work Force Participation during the 40th Parliament but, unfortunately, the federal election was called while the draft report was being considered. As I did not rejoin the committee in the 41st Parliament I was unable to participate in the final presentation of this report, so I am particularly pleased to be given the opportunity to speak to the report today and to thank the member for Shortland, other members of the committee and the staff of the committee for their contributions and their assistance.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The inquiry into the long-term unemployed was a valuable experience. The evidence submitted by so many individuals, organisations and stakeholders was challenging, and the inquiry was very much an eye-opening experience for me and my colleagues. This inquiry took place at a time when all the critical issues surrounding employment in this country were being discussed and debated, so clearly the report is current and very relevant. As a result, its recommendations will be helpful to government, to the opposition and to policy-makers alike.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I agree with the comments made by the committee chair, the member for Deakin, that the report tackles some of the critical issues that relate to building both the size and the capability of Australiaâs work force. Like all other members of the committee, I was concerned to hear evidence that, by the year 2030, Australia would have over 500,000 jobs with no-one to fill them. This is indeed an alarming prognosis and, if true, it means we must act immediately to address the looming work force shortage. At a time when alarm bells are being sounded about the skills shortage we are currently experiencing, it is imperative that we address these issues immediately or we will have no hope of averting a potential crisis 10 or 15 years down the track.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This report is pertinent, and its importance is also highlighted by the fact that the committee was almost unanimous in its recommendations. Of the 23 recommendations, there was unanimous support for 20, including the recommendations on apprenticeships uptake, on addressing long-term unemployment, on expanding and improving child-care assistance and services and on all but one of the recommendations relating to the disabled. These recommendations are of particular interest to me because they are of great relevance to the people I represent in the electorate of Calwell.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I have mentioned many times in this place that my electorate has a large number of residents on disability pension support. We also have a large number of young people who take up apprenticeships because we are fortunate enough to have the Kangan Batman TAFE in Broadmeadows. It should also be noted that this inquiry was undertaken in the context of an ageing population and recommendations 8 and 10 go some way to addressing the increasing issue of mature aged unemployment, which is another significant issue in my electorate.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">During the hearings, what struck me most was that the evidence being given indicated a strong trend towards ageism in the work force. I remember then remarking that what the submissions were stating was consistent with what many of my mature aged constituents were telling me: there is a real sense of discrimination against you if you are seeking employment and are 40 years of age. If you are 40 and over, you have a problem getting a job if you are unfortunate enough to become unemployed. Many people reported that they were simply overlooked on the basis of their age, with their experience and skills not seeming to carry as much weight as they deserved. These reports have been backed up by figures from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission which show that the majority of complaints before them, in respect of age discrimination laws, claimed discrimination in employment, with 65 per cent of those claims being lodged by men. Equally, many mature aged workers who lost their jobs were low skilled and had virtually no chance of re-employment despite being keen and often desperate to be employed. Given that most of these mature unemployed are simply too young to be out of the work force, it is clear that we need to re-skill this work force and provide incentives to stimulate employment recruitment.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Similar problems are faced by the disabled, by Indigenous Australians, sole parents, migrants and the long-term unemployed with a lack of employer interest in giving them a go. If this yearâs budget is about increasing work force participation then addressing all areas of disadvantage and hurdles becomes imperative. It is vital that, if the Welfare to Work reform is to be successful, it must tackle and look at employer attitudes and practices and see what can be done to alleviate impediments on that level.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Twenty of the recommendations in this report have received unanimous agreement and should be acted upon immediately by the government. The remaining three recommendations, however, have not received unanimous support with opposition members producing a dissenting report covering recommendations 1, 9 and 14 because these committee members have substantial concerns about these recommendations. As my colleague, the member for Gorton, has already stated:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Our concerns about these three recommendations go to the negative effect we believe they will have on industrial relations in this country.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">As a former member of the committee, I also cannot support these three recommendations. I stand with the dissenting report of the opposition members for the following reasons.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would like to address recommendation 1 at this point. It concerns award simplification by reducing the amount of allowable matters and encouraging greater workplace customisation to suit industry and regional conditions. Along with opposition members of the committee, I do not support this recommendation because it does not reflect the evidence received by the committee, nor is there any evidence to support the assertion that reducing allowable matters in federal awards would improve work force participation. The evidence received by the committee did, however, suggest that improving award provisions by including provisions such as paid parental leave or job sharing would, in fact, increase work force participation. In accordance with that evidence, I support the proposed recommendation 1 in the dissenting report which recommends that the government pursue strategies to improve participation in the work force by encouraging employment conditions that are mutually beneficial, such as job sharing, permanent part-time and paid parental leave.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Recommendation 9 concerns part-time and casual employment and recommends that the government examine mechanisms to remove barriers to the employment of part-time and casual employees in industrial awards and other industrial arrangements. I agree with the dissenting report in not supporting this recommendation as the evidence received by the committee highlighted that whilst there will always be a place for part-time and casual employment there are problems associated with such employment including a lack of training, an inability to save or secure a home loan as a result of being a casual employee, and difficulties balancing home and work responsibilities.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I have to agree with the member for Gorton, who makes the very valid point that Australia already has one of the most casualised work forces in the world and a large number of workers in part-time employment. Both groups are heavily represented in my electorate, and I knowâbecause I speak with many of themâthat a great number would prefer to have permanent, full-time employment.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Although I agree that there is benefit in having flexibility in the workplace that allows for increased workplace participation, this is true only to a certain extent. A great number of Australians, far from feeling that the existing flexibilities provide greater opportunities for participation, are in fact feeling a greater sense of insecurity and underemployment. As such, I do not support this recommendation. Rather, I support proposed recommendation 9 in the dissenting report, which calls upon the government to undertake a comprehensive study on the growth of casual and part-time employment and the social and economic effects of such growth, so as to identify the impact upon industry, occupations, gender and age groups and to identify the adverse social impact on employees and their families.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Recommendation 14 concerns disability support pension recipients and recommends that the government introduce increased work capacity provisions in determining eligibility for those in receipt of the disability support pension. We have seen this recommendation incorporated in this yearâs federal budget. However, opposition members did not support the recommendation when included in the report, and we do not support the budget provisions which implement the recommendation. Much of the evidence presented to the committee indicated how difficult it was for people with disabilities to gain employment, largely due to the perceived attitude of employers that people with disabilities were not preferred. They were often seen as a burden, with employers often not prepared to pay for the adjustments required in the workplace. Generally, there seemed to be an attitude that people with disabilities were not worthy of long-term investment.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Within my electorate are many examples of companies giving disabled employees a fair go, and these organisations include Brite Industries and a local employer, Mr Gary Marshall, whom I have spoken about in this place. He virtually makes it his business to employ people who are most at risk, and most of his work force is made up of people with some form of disability, people with long-term unemployment or mature age workers, who, as the member for Shortland said, when given an opportunity are able to perform tasks efficiently and successfully. It is being given the opportunity that is the problem. There is ample evidence to suggest that there is discrimination in the workplace against people with disabilities and the mature unemployed, in particular.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I talk to Job Network providers, such as Distinctive Options, that specialise in finding placements for people with disabilities, and they have an incredible number of problems convincing employers that their clients are worthy of being given a go. So there is plenty of empirical evidence to suggest that it is very difficult for these cohort groups to find employment or to be given an opportunity. I talk to many of these people in my electorate, and they always raise the difficulties of perception and discrimination that they have. It is a real shame, given that in particular the mature aged unemployed have a wealth of experience and potential which, at this stage, remains untapped and needs to be harnessed if we are to avert a skills shortageâthe 500,000 jobs with no-one to fill themâby the year 2030.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I raise my concerns about the prospects of a large number of people in the Australian work force who are out there ready, willing and able to work should they be given an opportunity, and I reiterate that we need to concentrate very much on employer attitudes. There are recommendations in the report that go some way towards providing encouragement for employers to take on what are, I guess, perceived to be the less desirable unemployed, but I think we are going to require more than just incentives; we are going to require a stick as well as a carrot.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">If we are going to be successful in the Welfare to Work policy that the Treasurer trumpeted loudly in this yearâs budget, and if we are going to arrest the skills shortage and give Australians an opportunity to participate in the work force, we need to be mindful of the fact that employers have a great responsibility to do their part and not to pick and choose as they see fit. After having gone through that inquiry, it is very obvious to me that that was one of the greatest problems, one of the greatest obstacles, in the way of a lot of people getting meaningful and long-term employment.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In conclusion, I do agree with the dissenting report that was put forward by my colleagues. I support proposed recommendations 14 and 14A in the dissenting report, which recommend that a broader and more comprehensive study be undertaken and that the 30-hour per week work test for disability support pensioners be retained, given the difficulties I have outlined that people with disabilities have in gaining employment and then, as the member for Shortland said, in being able to maintain it.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would like to finish by saying that throughout this inquiry all committee members agreed that paid employment is important in reducing social disadvantage and improving Australian living standards and all members agreed on 20 of the 23 recommendations. What is now needed is for the government to take up the initiatives put forward in this report and to implement the recommendations which were agreed upon unanimously. I thoroughly recommend that the government also adopt the additional recommendations from within the dissenting report.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As I said earlier, I think that the report comes at a critical time in the history of employment and the work force in this country. It makes some very sound and sensible recommendationsârecommendations that I believe will go a long way to assisting with improving work force participation. In particular, the report goes a long way to assisting those people who happen to be in groups that at present are disadvantaged in the work force to be given a fair go and an opportunity to improve their livelihoods and build upon their aspirations for themselves and their families.</para>

<para>âI rise today to comment on the report of the Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation entitled <inline font-style="italic">Working for Australiaâs future: increasing participation in the workforce</inline>. I take this opportunity to comment on the recommendations which prompted a dissenting report by Labor members of the committeeâa dissenting report that it would seem from the Prime Ministerâs recent statement on industrial relations he clearly chose to ignore.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Before turning in particular to the three recommendations of the dissenting members, I would like to record my support for the reportâs 20 unanimous recommendations. I believe that it is very important that the recommendations that were made by the committeeâincluding reviewing the tax-free threshold; reviewing effective marginal tax rates; improving transition to work programs; expanding child care and after-school and holiday care; and improving access to employment programsâshould be closely examined by the government if it is truly intent on assisting an increase in work force participation.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I also support the recommendations of the dissenting report. It seems to me that the Labor members of the committee have considered the evidence more closely and clearly have a better understanding of the concerns of the average Australian. It seems that the dissenting members of the committee are more aware of the concerns that Australians have in relation to casualisation of the work force. It is true that more employees are facing longer periods of part-time and casual employment. Gone are the days when getting a job meant simply accepting regular, full-time working hours. Some have dismissed this as a change in the composition and structure of work in Australia. Nevertheless, it is occurring, and that fact is certainly supported by statistical evidence. In particular, it is interesting that in the statistics presented in the report the proportion of males employed on a casual basis has doubled since 1988. Additionally, over that same period, from 1988, the statistics show that total employment involving casual employment has increased by 50 per cent.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The labour force statistics for April, released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, record that more than 2.8 million people were employed on a part-time basis. Granted, a number of them will be happy to be employed on a part-time basis, as it will enable them to pursue other activities while earning an income, such as raising a family, caring for aged parents or, indeed, studying. However, many people do want to work more. In 2004, the ABS released a report on the underemployed workers of Australia, which was particularly revealing of the views of part-time employees about their employment status. The ABS conducted a survey throughout September 2003 to provide empirical evidence for that report.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">At that time the survey showed that 2.7 million people were employed on a part-time basis. Of this 2.7 million people, 23 per cent wanted to work more hours; that is, more than 600,000 people employed on a part-time basis wanted to work more. Examining the data further showed that, of those 600,000 workers, 58 per cent wanted full-time employment and 77 per cent, during the four-week period of the survey, had actively looked for work that would provide more hours. It is pretty clear from the results of that survey that the majority of these part-time workers wanted to work more and they were ready to start working more. The ABS report goes on to indicate that 90 per cent of those who wanted full-time employment were available to start immediately.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This situation has not changed. In the lead-up to my own by-election campaign, a constituent in Werriwa approached me and described his experience of entering the work force. The fellow was on a Job Network program and had found some part-time work. As he said, it was great; this was what he wanted to do. This work was probably not the best in the world, but he wanted to participate in the work force. He was very pleased to have gained the job. He sought to inquire of his conditions from his employer. He turned up there and was told that, from the next day on, he would be required to bring his own vehicle because he would be required to travel for work purposes. So he was required to drive his own vehicle not only to and from work but also in the course of his employment.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">After his first week at work, he had only worked for three days. He said that he was pretty shocked when he got his first weekly pay. After taking into account that he was using his own vehicle not only to travel to and from work but also to run errands during the day for his employerâs business, he found that he was worse off than he was on his former program. So being keen to continue working, he went in the next weekâgranted, one day was wetâto be told that he would be required only one day that week. The company that he was working for and that he named for me would be well known to everybody; it would certainly be found on the ASX. That is the way in which employment practices are starting to perpetuateâand I am sure that Werriwa is no exception with circumstances like theseâand this is one example that was brought to my attention. This bloke is just an average fellow who is happy to pay his taxes. He wanted to participate in the full-time labour market and do his bit in looking after his family. He certainly saw the way in which the system is stacked against many individuals.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Given the fact that at the time of the last census one in four workers in Werriwa was employed on a part-time basis, this gentlemanâs case that he related to me could hardly be considered as isolated. But it gets worse than that. Not only do part-time and casual workers face greater uncertainty of income; because of their own financial instability they also find it difficult to access a number of other services that many of us would take for granted. Part-time and casual employees have greater difficultly accessing financial services. Due to the uncertainty surrounding their future incomes, part-time and casual employees often report that financial institutions are more reluctant to give them access to loans and lines of credit than they would be had they been in full-time employment. Most of us would know that to be a fact. The evidence presented to the committee suggested that casual and part-time employees may also face reduced access to training and skills development opportunities, which are obviously so crucial for people making that transition into full-time permanent employment or trying to pursue a career.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I am also quite sure that, if we had a closer look at those who have Centrelink debts, we would probably find that a significant number of those debtors are either part-time or casual employees, as they would find it even more difficult than the rest of us to accurately estimate their annual income. Hence, at the end of the year part-time and casual employees receive yet another setback when they are notified that they have managed to accumulate a Centrelink debt. I guess these are the rewards for being employed under the so-called flexible working arrangements.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would also like to take the opportunity to support the recommendations in the dissenting report concerning employment conditions. Once again, when making recommendations pursuing further award simplification and encouraging greater workplace customisation and flexibility, government members of the committee seemed to substitute ideology for evidence. As someone with a reasonably extensive involvement in the Australian industrial relations system, having worked in it from all perspectives, I find it difficult to believe that further simplifying awards will result in greater participation in the work force. I think such an argument does not hold much weight, particularly when one considers the claim that 77,000 more jobs will be created if small businesses are exempted from unfair dismissal lawsâa claim that, when placed under some scrutiny before the Senate committee, was found to be seriously lacking.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">My views are reinforced by the findings of the dissenting report. The dissenting committee members found that the committeeâs recommendations for reductions in allowable matters and greater workplace customisation were contrary to the evidence received. The dissenting members reported:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">On no occasion had evidence supported the assertion that reducing allowable matters in federal awards would have any bearing upon improving participation in the paid workforce.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Work force participation will not be improved through award changes or even the erosion of hard won conditions in awards. It will not be improved by exempting small business from unfair dismissal laws or reducing the right of entry into workplaces. And it will not be improved by effectively sidelining the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, which, after all, has acted as the independent umpire looking to protect the interests of both employers and employees engaged under the system.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Increasing participation rates requires increasing opportunities for unemployed people to enter the work force. These opportunities will only emerge when the hurdles that people face when they are seeking a job are effectively addressed. To address those issues really does require us to focus on matters such as the effective high marginal tax rates; child-care places, so that they are more abundant to facilitate people being able to translate into the workplace; and more affordable training places, when the opportunities are there, for people to become job ready to re-enter the work force.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I have spent many years working closely with both employers and employees in business improvement programs and also representing workers as a union official. Bearing in mind this experience, I cannot recall one occasion when I thought that the employment prospects of Australians would be enhanced by reducing award conditions or by reducing the number of allowable matters. I am yet to be convinced that Australians who for whatever reason are not participating in the labour market at the moment believe this will encourage them to re-enter the labour market.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee recently explored the stunning statistic this government used to justify excluding small business from unfair dismissal lawsâthat is, that small business will create 77,000 new jobs if exempted from unfair dismissal laws. The assertion was found to be unreliable and based on opinion and perception rather than on any accurate data. In much the same way, once the claim that reducing the number of allowable matters and increasing the flexibility in workplace arrangements is subject to some harsher scrutiny, I suspect that it will be found to be lacking as well. With regard to the recommendations on disability support pensions, I support the expansion and modification of the Job Network disability support pension pilot. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThis report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation titled <inline font-style="italic">Working for Australiaâs future: increasing participation in the workforce</inline> was tabled in the House of Representatives on 14 March 2005. Although I was not a member of this committee, I understand the importance of its findings and its recommendations to future work force participation in this country, particularly the participation of older workers and other disadvantaged groups.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">We are all aware that no longer do any of us have a career for life. Many Australians will have two, three or more careers over their working lives. I note that the committee was told that by 2030 Australia will have over half a million jobs with no-one to fill them. I note also the committeeâs determination, in the face of low unemployment levels, to assist the work force participation of those groups who have traditionally been called disadvantaged. These groups include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, the long-term unemployed, young people, migrants, mature age workers and people with disabilities. This report recommends that these people should be assisted by government and that this assistance must be targeted and delivered in an appropriate way.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Some members in this place may know that in my previous career I was a manager with the old Commonwealth Employment Service. I came into the CES at the time when Paul Keatingâs Working Nation programs were being implemented. This was exactly the range of programs which case managed so-called disadvantaged job seekers to increase their work force participation. Under these case management programs, there was a range of programs to assist the long-term unemployed, people with disabilities, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and sole parents. There was a whole spectrum of programs. Whatever level a job seeker was at, there was a program that they could fit into and that would take them right through to the reality of getting a job.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">These programs included, at one end of the spectrum, training programs to assist people with literacy and numeracy skills and programs to increase self-esteem and to address personal issues that related to working. Along the spectrum were skills training and eventually to what were known then as job clubs, where people were assessed as being work ready and were assisted in applying for jobsâin getting their CVs together and in the actual physical activity of getting out there, knocking on doors looking for work.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Other programs included the Jobs, Education and Training program, which assisted sole parents. That program was delivered between the CES and the then department of social security. It provided a lot of assistance for sole parents to assist themselves into the work force, including subsidies for child-care arrangements. I believe that program still exists, but it has been decimated under the Howard government.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There was training for Aboriginal people, which was the specific area that I was working in. There were a whole range of programs to assist particularly young Aboriginal people into work. I had the satisfaction of seeing many young Aboriginal people commence and complete traineeships and apprenticeships and get themselves into work.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There were also programs called disability support panels. These panels case managed each individual with a disability personally to assist that person into a job. The panels consisted of somebody from the CES, somebody from the department of social security and somebody from the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service. Those people would then also go out and assist people to sell their skills to employers and actively encourage employers to take these people on.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to make a point in relation to work force participation of Indigenous Australians. There are seven pages in the report, from page 151 through to page 157, which deal with participation in the work force by Indigenous Australians. However, there does not seem to have been a recommendation from the findings of the committee relating to Indigenous employment. The committee did note on page 154:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">While significant numbers of Indigenous youth are being helped to gain employment through Job Network and the Indigenous Employment Programme ... more needs to be done to ensure they have the skills, job search techniques, confidence and motivation to benefit from strong economic growth.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The report went on to say at 5.101:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Committee is encouraged by the broad range of these initiatives and the improvements in employment outcomes. However ... significant focus is required to support and foster further increase in participation in paid work.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I find it a bit disturbing that, although there had been some focus on Indigenous employment participation, there were no recommendations coming out of this report. As I said, the programs that had been in place in the old CES under Paul Keatingâs Working Nation were either abolished or decimated on the election of the Howard government in 1996.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to move now to changes proposed in this yearâs budget to the disability support pension. I note the recommendations relating to these changes were dissented from by the Labor members of this committee. The dissenting committee members noted:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... that while the Job Network Disability Support Pension pilot has shown some promise in assisting people on the DSP to gain employment, there are areas which require greater investigation before any long term conclusions can be made.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The dissenting members also said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Less than half of the pilot participants and less than a quarter of DSP recipients who initially met the providers were successfully placed in employment or education. If this sample is representative then more than half of the DSP population could be penalised by the proposed changes to the DSP eligibility requirements despite their desire to look for work.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The concerns that we have in the Labor Party in relation to the changes to the disability support pension have been expressed in this place. They include concerns about the changes in the eligibility criteriaâthat is, eligibility for a person who has a disability will be changed so that the number of hours a person is deemed as able to work without losing eligibility will be reduced from 30 hours a week to 15 hours a week. From 1 July next year we are going to see two classes of disability support pensioner. We are going to see those people who are on the disability support pension who cannot work more than 30 hours a week but may be able to work between 15 and 30 hours a week and those people with a disability who will be forced onto Newstart allowance because they have been assessed as being able to work more than 15 hours a week.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">These people are also going to see a drop in their incomes. Once we have a person with a disability who is deemed to be able to work more than 15 hours a week, rather than being supported by a disability support pension where all the support mechanisms are in place for that personâas well as assistance in concessions and a little bit more incomeâthey are now going to be forced onto Newstart allowance. They are going to have lower incomes than disability support pensioners, but they are going to have the same health concerns and they are going to need the same assistance in trying to look for work as they would if they were on the disability support pension. Those people with disabilities who can work more than 15 hours a week are being told, âYes, you must look for work,â but they are also being told âYou are not going to get the same support as a disability support pensioner to look for work and you must do it on less money.â</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We must remember that people with disabilities or chronic illnesses have variances in their day-to-day lives. They can have good weeks and bad weeks and good months and bad months. This particularly applies to people with mental illnesses. If a person with a mental illness who is assessed as being able to work more than 15 hours a week, subject to the work activity test, goes off and gets themselves a job that they can do, the next week or the next month they might have a bad week and not turn up for work. That person is then going to be penalised when they go back to the Centrelink office to resume their unemployment benefits. They will be penalised for leaving a job. But they have left a job through no fault of their own; they have done that because they have a particular illness which has not been catered for under these arrangements. A lot of these people would be working if they could be working. If there were jobs out there that were for 15 or 20 hours a week, with flexibility and arrangements to adapt to their health circumstances, it would be great. But the unfortunate reality for a lot of the people with disabilities who want to work is that the jobs which should be flexible to their needs just do not exist out there.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I want to move on now to the long-term unemployed and particularly the mature long-term unemployed. We saw in April the release of the Productivity Commissionâs report on the economics of ageing. Following the release of that report, Sid Marris, in the initial paragraph of an article he wrote in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The first priority for tackling the mounting taxpayer costs of ageing should be getting unemployed mature workers into a job rather than simply raising the pension age.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Productivity Commissionâs report was titled <inline font-style="italic">Economic</inline> <inline font-style="italic">implications of an ageing Australia.</inline> The summary released with that report stated:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">People aged over 55 years have significantly lower labour force participation rates than younger people. As more people move into older age groups, overall participation rates are projected to drop from around 63.5 per cent in 2003 04 to 56.3 per cent by 2044-45.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Following the release of that report, a couple of statements were made. An article headed âWork for over-55 jobless the keyâ in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> of Wednesday, 13 April 2005 states:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">Council on the Ageing-National Seniors chief executive David Deans said that with work force participation for men aged over 55 below 50 per cent in Australia, a low figure by international standards, mature-age workers and employers had to think differently about work and training.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Â That is also reflected in this report. The article later states:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association NSW president Morrie Mufsud said ... increasing the pension age to 70 or 75 was inhumane and would put greater stress on the health of older people.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Over the years that I have been representing my constituents of Charlton here, I have received much correspondence regarding the barriers facing long-term unemployed, mature age workers when trying to get back into the work force. I have one such letter here, written by Graeme Winter and signed by nearly 40 constituents, parts of which I would like to read into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. These quotes touch on just some of the barriers and challenges that face mature age workers. Graeme writes:</para>

<para>âThis report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation is indeed a very welcome report. I would like to start by congratulating the members of the committee on both sides for what is an extremely substantial and much needed report. I particularly congratulate the members of the government, who have contributed to an analysis of the current situation in Australia which is quite often critical of their own government.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">There are two issues in my electorate which are regularly raised with me. The first concerns unemployment. In spite of the rhetoric about low unemployment, one of the most common issues raised with me concerns people unable to find a job. Whether it is single mothers, mothers returning to the work force, people with disabilities, older Australians, skilled migrants or members of the Indigenous community, the difficulty in finding work is still very much alive in my electorate in spite of the rhetoric about low unemployment.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The second issue which is regularly raised is raised by the small business community in particular, and in my electorate that is a vibrant community indeed. The issue for them concerns future growth. It concerns the ability to find skilled people to work for them. It involves the need for greater investment in research and development and for the building of export markets.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This report contributes greatly on both of those issues. I have learned a great deal from reading it, and I know I will find it extremely useful in working with people in my electorate. It is a comprehensive and serious report involving over nearly 100 submissions and over 20 days of public hearings, and again I thank the committee, particularly on the government side, for the courage to be constructively critical of the government.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Many of the recommendations imply a failure by the current government to seriously tackle issues of workplace participation, particularly in the areas of skill shortages and marginal tax rates. But it is interesting to note that when committee members from both sides of the House get together and have a proper look at what is happening there is general agreement on what needs to be done. Of the 21 recommendations, the vast majority were passed unanimously. That is a very good sign of the health of our democracy when people get together and work collaboratively.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We have a comprehensive report making largely unanimous recommendations which was tabled at the beginning of this year and yet, in spite of its quality, those recommendations were not incorporated in the budget. On occasion the Treasurer referred to some of the issues, but it is fair to say that he did not pick up the main recommendations of that report. This is indeed a lost opportunity. The members of the committee, and the members of the public who contributed to this inquiry, made an extraordinary effort in putting this report together and their work deserves much more consideration than it received. It is interesting to speak on this report now, after the budget, when it was actually written before the budget because it throws the budget into an interesting light. The main issues raised, particularly that of skill shortages, were not addressed adequately in the budgetâand nor, for that matter, was the whole issue of how we get Australians back into the work force.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Instead of taking the positive approach recommended in this report in the main the government took a punitive approachâa stick approachâto forcing people back into the work force. It is clear from the recommendations in this report and the substance of the report that there are far greater barriers to people returning to the work force than a willingness to do so. There is a recognition in this report that employment is patchy, a recognition that I really appreciate having spoken to so many people in my electorate who are having difficulty getting back into the work force. It clearly recognises that, while we can talk about the overall low unemployment rate, that rate is not enjoyed by some sections of our community, particularly the Indigenous community, women, older Australians, younger Australians and skilled migrants. I would like to raise a couple of examples that have come up in my electorate recently of people who are facing extraordinary barriers to their re-entry into the work forceâbarriers which this report addresses but which the government has failed to address in the budget.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">My first example is of a 29-year-old woman who emailed me a couple of days ago. She is married and has three children between eight months and six years old. She is a stay-at-home mum. Before she decided to stay home with her children she was quite a senior person in the public sector. She resigned from her full-time job in July 2004 to be a full-time stay-at-home mum. Since then, she and her husband have reviewed their financial situation and decided that she needs to return to full-time work. They have a mortgage and a car to pay off and their wage is barely making ends meet so they feel that she needs to return to work. She does not have anybody to help with looking after her childrenâshe does not live close to her parents, for exampleâso she needs to send one of the children to before- and after-school care and two of the children to full-time long day care while she returns to work.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">She went to Centrelink with an estimated income of $95,000 to calculate the familyâs child-care benefit and family tax benefit. After she considered those and took into account child-care costs, which would be $95 a week for one child and $185 a week for each of the othersâtotalling $515 per weekâshe realised that child care would cost $27,000 per year. That would be more than 70 per cent of her pay and larger than their mortgage payment. She then went on to calculate their net weekly income less their expenses and realised that if she returned to work she would be $50 a week better off than if she did not. After taking into consideration the effect that returning to work would ultimately have on her relationship with her children and the pressures it would have on her marriage, she just cannot justify returning to work for $50 a week. The budget announced that there would be 80,000 extra child-care places but, as she says, that is no use if the price is not regulated. In her area long day care is charged at $57 a day for under twos and $47 a day for children aged two to six. With three children, that is not something she can afford.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This woman asks in her email what incentive she has to go back to work, even though she wants to. She has discussed this issue with other mothers in her area and has found it to be a common story, as have I in visiting child-care centres around my area. The single biggest topic of conversation among mothers, both those working part time and those staying at home, is the difficulty they have in finding a way back into the work force.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The second example I have is of a young woman I know who has a mental illness. She is bipolar. She is an extraordinary young woman and was highly skilled before the onset of her illness. She has been on the disability support pension for quite some time. Through the intervention of a small group of people, she has managed over the last four or five years to find her way back into the work force on a part-time basis, and she is now managing to control her illness. She has not had a serious bout of depression and has not needed shock therapy for nearly 2Â½ years. She is now looking at a situation where she is able to work more hours and can get the work. But, of course, if she does that she will have to go off the disability support pension.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This should be a time of great rejoicing for this woman. She has been on that pension for many years now and, through considerable work by her and a surrounding group of supporters, she has found a way back into the work force and has taken back control of her life. She should be celebrating. Quite to the contrary, she has a recommendation from her psychiatrist that she not take up this option at this time, for the simple reason that if she does go back to work and then lapses back into her illnessâwhich undoubtedly she will; this is a lifelong illness that she hasâand has to return to the disability support pension at some point, she will go onto the new pension, not the old one. She also may not be able to get back onto it because of her capacity at this stage, when her illness is essentially under control, to work considerably more than 15 hours a week.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Because fear of the future is one of the triggers for this womanâs illness, her psychiatristâs advice is that she will be better off in the long term working only a few hours a week, rather than doing the considerable hours that she can. When you understand that this woman is one of the leaders in the fieldâthat when she does work she is an unbelievably productive person who makes a great contribution to those around herâit is really quite a tragedy. This is a case of a person who is ready to return to work and really should be returning to work, but the very measures which the government introduced to try to force her to do so are those which will prevent her from returning to the work force.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The third example is mothers returning to the work force. I have just given part-time work to two mothers who are returning to the work force after a long time, and I would encourage every employer out there to consider finding a way to get some of these fabulous mothers back into the work force. For a start, they are quite often more mature women who have had experience in the work force at a very high level and who are looking for secure, ongoing work at a level which allows them to go home at the end of the day and concentrate on their family. They are those rare workers who bring skills to a job they can quite often handle easily. They do that job with their full attention and go home at the end of the day to concentrate on something else. They are incredibly valuable people.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">What I have found in talking with these people and the many who come to my office looking for a solution to their dilemma is that they have difficulty in finding work which allows them to balance their responsibilities to their families. There is difficulty in finding work, for example, which while secure and ongoing provides time off during school holidays. It is difficult to find work close enough to their own home to be able to get to and from work, and to include travel time, between the hours of nine and three.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This report makes quite a few recommendations concerning child care. Child care is absolutely essential to these women. It also covers in some depth the area of family balance, which is one of the biggest barriers for women returning to the work force. Again, the budget which was recently delivered does not address this issue in any real way at all. We still have in our community thousands of women with great skill and great willingness to return to work who simply cannot find appropriate working conditions in which to do so.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The casualisation of the work force is an increasing barrier to these women. I met two parents recently when I was doorknocking in the south of my electorate. The first time I went to their house I did not actually meet them; I encountered their six-year-old child at home on her own. Sheâand this is quite scary to meâopened the door to me, and I suspect she would have opened the door to anyone who knocked. There was a six-year-old child at home on her own. So I phoned these parents after hours, just to see how they were and if they needed some help, and I found two people who got up every morning not knowing whether they were going to work that dayâtwo parents on casual work in a low-skilled area who phoned the office each morning to find out whether they were going to work. They were on extremely low pay and under very poor conditions with three children, actually, under the age of 10, all three of whom were at various times at home on their own.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">These parents did not have a support network that could help them. These parents did not have the opportunity to find regular child care; in fact, child care does not work on that kind of basis. They really were doing the best they could. They were doing their best to pay their rent; they were doing their best for their children. Unfortunately, the best is still an appalling situation for these parents. Not only could they not guarantee that their children could be picked up at school; as a married couple, they could not even commit to each other that they would be there on Saturday to pick up the kids from soccer or that they would take care of the kids tomorrow. These were two people who were completely unable to make the commitments to each other that parents need to make in order to stay together, let alone raise three children.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The recommendation in this report that even suggests increasing the casualisation of the work force is an appalling recommendation for people who live this kind of lifestyle now. Anybody, any parentâany person, reallyâseeking to save for their retirement, to educate their children or seeking to build a life needs some form of planning in their life. You simply cannot commit to a family and children and a future if you cannot look ahead and know that you can earn this amount of money, that your pay will come in on a regular basis, that your job is reasonably secureâeven if irregularâand that you can commit to the people around you to do the things you need to do to hold your relationships together.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The casualisation of the work force is not just about work force and it is not just about business. It is actually about family. It is an extremely negative trend that has made it incredibly difficult for people who are already struggling with low wages and poor conditions and, in many cases, a low education level, to build lives for themselves and their families. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI rise to continue my comments of condolence on the death of His Holiness Pope John Paul II. I had only just started the speech when this debate was adjourned. I had been talking about the Popeâs life during World War II, which was extraordinarily hard in his native Poland. During that time he had become a priest and he had earned his first doctorate. He continued his studies and in 1953 he defended his thesis and was appointed a professor of philosophy at the University of Cracow. The following year he joined the faculty of the Catholic University in Lublin.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">He moved through the ranks of the Catholic Church swiftly. In 1958 he was named the Auxiliary Bishop of Cracow and in 1964, when the communist government lifted a ban on such appointments, he was promoted to archbishop. He was promoted to cardinal in 1967 by Pope Paul VI. As a cardinal, he was required to attend in Rome at the untimely death of Pope John Paul I who, as we all know, died after just 34 brief days in office.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On 16 October, after three days of deliberations in the Vatican Sistine Chapel and after eight ballots, Wojtyla was elected to the throne of St Peter. At 58 he was the youngest pope in 132 years. âIt is Godâs will,â he declared when the vote was announced, âI accept.â With those simple words, he began one of the most extraordinary reigns of any pope, creating a legacy that touches all parts of the globe.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Pope John Paul II led the worldâs Catholics for 26 years, which is the third longest reign of any pope. His capacity to travel was one of the hallmarks of his period in office. He transformed what was traditionally a Eurocentric church into one with a global outlook. His destinations included the United Nations, remote islands in the farthest reaches of the Pacific, the plains of Africa, the slums of Latin America and the Mall in Washington. His visits included non-Catholic areas such as India and South-East Asia. His extensive travels made him one of the most recognised figures in the world. I well remember going to the local racetrack in Perth when the Pope visited and I can remember him walking by and greeting the assembled children, to our great excitement at the time. He drew enormous crowds on his two Australian visits, and these crowds were repeated wherever he went in the world. No corner of the world escaped the Popeâs attention, and his popemobile was a very familiar sight on the evening news.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On his travels he reached out to men and women of other faiths. Indeed, he did more than any other pope to open dialogues with other religions. He was the first pope to enter a mosque and the first pope to visit a synagogue. He championed relations with the Jewish community, and one of his first official acts was to send a message to the Jewish community in Rome. Under his guidance, the Vatican opened full diplomatic relations with Israel. The process of reconciliation reached a dramatic climax during the Popeâs visit to the Holy Land in March 2000. At Yad Vashem, Israelâs monument to the Holocaust victims, he declared:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... I assure the Jewish people that the Catholic Church, motivated by the Gospel law of truth, and love, and by no political considerations, is deeply saddened by the hatred, acts of persecution and displays of anti-Semitism directed against the Jews by Christians at any time and in any place.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">In Jerusalem, Pope John Paul II prayed at the Western Wall, the most sacred site in Judaism, and he also visited the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest site in Islam. I note that the Chief Rabbi of Rome, who once prayed with the Pope, has said that he believes that Pope John Paul II ushered in a new era of Jewish-Christian relations. I also note that following the Popeâs death he was eulogised by both the Israelis and the Palestinians and that the President of Israel and the Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority both attended his funeral. I know that sadness over the death of Pope John Paul II was shared by both Jewish and Islamic communities in my electorate of Stirling.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Perhaps the real defining moment of his reign as Pope was in the role that he played in liberating the people of Eastern Europe from the forces of totalitarianism. He worked tirelessly with the people in his native Poland, in Hungary, in what was then Czechoslovakia and in other nations that were locked into the rigid sphere of Soviet domination. He visited Poland not long after he was elected Pope, in June 1979, and that was his second overseas visit. He received a rapturous welcome from Poles across the whole country. He used his visit to highlight the plight of the Poles, and he developed close ties with the Solidarity movement and a man who would be Polandâs first post-communist president, Lech Walesa. He is reported to have told a Polish cardinal after his election as Bishop of Rome, âI have become the Bishop of Rome but I have not ceased being a Polish bishop.â</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Pope visited his homeland eight times during his reign. These visits increased the confidence of the Polish people and ultimately contributed to their throwing off the yoke of communism. This in turn contributed to the extraordinary demise of this evil doctrine in Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union. With hindsight, I often fear that we forget how soul-destroying communism was to the people who were literally trapped behind the Iron Curtain. Pope John Paul II, by his presence and quiet dignity, challenged those regimes to respect the dignity of the people that they ruled over.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">By visiting these nations he was able to highlight the deficiencies within the governance of these countries and to shine a bit of light into corners of the world where information and hope were not readily available. I am reminded of the quote attributed to Stalin, âHow many divisions does the Pope have?â Of course, the Pope had no armies but he did have the power of his own ideas and I think that history has proven him to be the victor in that particular conflict.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Pope John Paul II was a man of very firm beliefs. He did not gauge the prevailing view before making up his mind but decided what was right and then stuck to it. This is in marked contrast to some of the more fashionable clerics who seem to be more malleable in their views. In fact, I am often struck by how some members of the clergy now seem prepared to jump on whatever politically correct bandwagon happens to be passing. Even in death, many have criticised Pope John Paul II for the rigidity of his viewsâand I had better add that I do not share them allâbut I respect the fact that he remained true to what he believed was right.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I heard a person who was randomly interviewed at the time of the Popeâs death make a comment that went something like this: âIâm not what you would call a true believer, but I believed in him.â This person, in one simple statement, was able to express exactly what it was that made Pope John Paul II so special. He was a man who was able to gain the love and respect of not only people of Catholic faith but people of all religions across all nations. His presence and counsel will be missed by many. His recent funeral will be recorded as one of the most memorable events of this century for two reasons: firstly, the unprecedented outpouring of public grief and, secondly, the sheer number of world leaders that attended. I cannot think of any other event that would have brought such a diverse group together. It will be recorded as one of the defining moments of its time.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would like to conclude my remarks by congratulating Pope John Paul IIâs successor, Pope Benedict XVI. I am sure that the whole parliament will join me in wishing him well in carrying out his extensive duties on behalf of Catholics the world over.</para>

<para>âBorn on 18 May 1920 and dying on 2 April 2005, Pope John Paul II was Pope of the Catholic Church for almost 27 years, the third longest reign in the history of the church. He oversaw a momentous period in world history, providing a moral force for his followers in the latter half of the 20th century as he travelled the globe, determined to reach as many people as possible, in the process becoming known as the âpilgrim Popeâ.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Pope John Paul II lent a spiritual force to his fellow Poles in the rise of the Solidarity movement, which went on to destroy a regime in the thrall of the communist ideology he so vehemently opposed. He also rallied against what he saw as the dangerously secular hedonism of the West, a spiritual malaise he saw as caused by an excessive adherence to materialism and consumerism. Unwavering in extolling his belief in the sanctity of human lifeâfor example, in his vocal opposition to abortion, war and capital punishmentâhe nevertheless expressed traditional Catholic values in his attitudes towards marriage, sexuality and the role of women in the church. Pope John Paul II was unstinting in his advocacy of social justice and in the rights of the individual. Yet some of his views could be seen as challengingâsome even divisive.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As a student in southern Poland, Karol Wojtyla intended to become a professional actor. With the occupying Nazi regime closing the university he attended, and under threat of deportation, he was forced to support himself by working as a stonecutter. In 1942 he entered the underground seminary run by the Archbishop of Cracow and was ordained a priest in November 1946. In 1958 the future Pope was named Auxiliary Bishop of Cracow and four years later he assumed leadership of the diocese, all the while publicly rallying against communism and oppressive state officials and also secretly providing supportâfinancial and otherwiseâfor opposition groups and, it is reported, often clandestinely meeting their leaders, who were on the run from the government. He was at the time the youngest bishop in Poland. In 1962 he contributed to the Second Vatican Council and within five years was elevated to cardinal. He refused to attend the First General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops due to a fellow Polish cardinal being denied a passport by the communist government. He participated in the papal conclave that elected Pope Paul VI and then, after the sudden death of Pope Paul VIâs successor, John Paul I, he found himself, a compromise candidate, at only 58 years of age, the 264th Pope of the Catholic Church.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The new pope proved in the eyes of many, including the leader of the Solidarity movement, Lech Walesa, to be instrumental in the fall of communism in eastern Europe. His visits to Poland in 1979 and later in 1983 provided inspiration to the Catholic Church and to the growing non-violent Solidarity labour movement. In the words of future Polish communist leader Jaruzelski, his first visit was the âdetonatorâ for a train of events that eventually resulted in the collapse of the communist states in the East and the fall of the Iron Curtain. No less a person than Mikhail Gorbachev asserted that the disintegration of the Eastern bloc would have been impossible without Pope John Paul II.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">During his reign, Pope John Paul II became the most travelled pope in history, making more visits to foreign lands than all the previous popes combined. Many of these trips were to the developing world and to countries never visited by a pope before, drawing some of the largest crowds in history. For instance, his visit to his Polish homeland in 1979 drew over two million people, while his mass in Dublinâs Phoenix Park in the same year drew one million people, a staggering one-quarter of the population of Ireland. He oversaw the global expansion of Catholicism, especially in Africa. His second visit to Nigeria saw the Pope canonize a Nigerian monk, greatly enhancing the Popeâs popularity in the region. Pope John Paul II was committed to spreading the influence of the church across the globe to Catholics and non-Catholics alike. I vividly remember his visit to Perth and our great family outing. We sat on a rug at the showgrounds for many hours to attend mass there.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Pope John Paul II, speaker of six languages, was determined to overcome religious divides, stressing the peace inherent in all religions. During his ceaseless travels he made several historical overtures to divergent faiths. He met with the Dalai Lama no fewer than eight times, finding common ground with a spiritual leader who had also suffered under communism. He was the first Catholic Pope to visit and pray in an Islamic mosque, and he subsequently visited the mosque where John the Baptist is understood to be buried. He was also the first pope to visit the United Kingdom, meeting the head of the Church of England, Queen Elizabeth II. In a powerful gesture at the time of the Falklands War, a battle he strongly spoke out against, he knelt to pray with the then Archbishop of Canterbury.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">However, despite significant stumbling blocks, it could be said that his greatest success was in bridging the divide between the Catholic and Jewish faiths, with a Jewish-American organisation declaring:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... more change for the better took place in his 27 year Papacy than in the nearly 2000 years before.</para>
</quote>
<para pgwide="yes">Such approval stemmed from several actions undertaken by Pope John Paul II. He made a formal apology for the missteps committed by the Catholic Church over the last 2,000 years, expressly apologising for the acts of anti-Semitism committed by the church. He visited the Auschwitz concentration camp in his Polish homelandâthe first pope to do soâand, in his historic visit to Israel in 2000, he left a written apology to the Jewish people in the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem. Furthermore, he issued an apology for the conspicuous silence that fell over the Catholic Church during the time of the Holocaust, and he became the first pope in modern times to visit a synagogue. Pope John Paulâs ecumenical efforts were instrumental in the emergence of a new, outward-looking Catholic Church.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Popeâs belief in the sanctity of human life expressed itself in his stance against contraception, euthanasia and abortion. Yet his belief in the rights and inherent dignity of the individual also manifested itself in his fervent opposition to war. To the Pope, all war was unjust and, in his words, a defeat for humanity. He asserted that all avenues must be exhausted before contemplating aggressive means, a position that logically led to his opposition to the war in Iraq. The Pope sent a cardinal from the Vatican to meet with the President of the United States to relay his opposition to the actions of the coalition of the willing, seeing any unilateral aggression as a breach of international law and seeing diplomacy through the United Nations as paramount. By speaking out almost daily on the injustice of the war, the Pope provided moral support to the millions of antiwar protesters throughout the world. This search for a political solution was emblematic of the Popeâs reign, with the Vatican sending diplomats to the Middle East, East Timor, the Balkans, Africa and Asia in the search for peace during intense periods of conflict.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Popeâs influence was strongly felt in his shaping of the Catholic Church as a defender of human rights and of the poor and disenfranchised. He was a vocal supporter of Jubilee 2000, the campaign to provide debt relief to the beleaguered nations of Africa. He issued apologies for the suppression of ethnic and indigenous groups by past Catholic missionaries and was a strong supporter of the rights and aspirations of indigenous peoples, creating in 1992 a foundation for the indigenous peoples of Latin America to promote the development of rural communities among the campesinos of Latin America and the Caribbean and the African-American peoples.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In a speech given here in Australia in Alice Springs in 1986, the Pope spoke compassionately and eloquently in support of the stolen generation and Aboriginal land rights. He said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Let it not be said that the fair and equitable recognition of Aboriginal rights to land is discrimination. To call for the acknowledgment of the land rights of people who have never surrendered those rights is not discrimination ... Christian people of good will are saddened to realiseâmany of them only recentlyâfor how long a time Aboriginal people were transported from their homelands into small areas or reserves where families were broken up, tribes split apart, children orphaned and people forced to live like exiles in a foreign country. The establishment of a new society for Aboriginal people cannot go forward without just and mutually recognised agreements with regard to these human problems even though their causes lie in the past.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">If only such emphatic words were more prevalent today. The Pope decried the structural excesses of neo-liberalism and economic rationalisation, highlighting the devastating effect such policies have upon the poor and marginalised. As he stated, the wealth produced often remains in the hands of only a few.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Pope was a champion of workersâ rights. I have already touched upon his unwavering support of the Solidarity trade union in his homeland. In his encyclia the Pope affirmed the right of workers to join trade unions. In his 1981 statement, âOn Human Workâ, the Pope called for:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... ever new movements of solidarity of the workers and with the workers. This solidarity must be present whenever it is called for by the social degrading of the subject of work, by exploitation of the workers and by the growing areas of poverty and even hunger.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Pope continued by asserting the right of trade unions to exist and the right of workers:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... to form associations for the purpose of defending the vital interests of those employed in the various professions. These associations are called labor or trade unions... The experience of history teaches that organizations of this type are an indispensable element of social life.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">In another encyclical, Pope John Paul II reaffirmed the need for trade unions to:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... defend workersâ rights and protect their interests as persons while fulfilling a vital cultural role so as to enable workers to participate more fully and honorably in the life of their nation and to assist them along the path of development.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Elsewhere he stressed the importance of a just wage, health care and workers compensation and the right to a retirement pensionâall mainstays of the labour movement. The Popeâs compassion and sense of justice meant he instinctively sided with the workers.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As progressives rightly point out, Pope John Paul IIâs reign was not without fault. His views on contraception and the role of women in the church have been highly controversial, and he has rightly been admonished for his slow response to sexual abuse scandals within the church. Yet Pope John Paul II has had an extraordinary impact upon the Catholic Church and hence upon the world, transforming the church under his charismatic leadership into an activist church based upon social justice, human rights and dignity and respect for the individual. A man of great integrity, compassion and conviction, his success was due to his ability as a world statesman to reach across to Catholics and non-Catholics alike. His words and actions during his 27-year reign will continue to reverberate. I wish to congratulate his successor, Benedict XVI, who, as confidante and right-hand man to the previous Pope, is no doubt aware of the great demands and requirements of the pontificate. I wish him well as he guides the Catholic Church into a new era.</para>

<para>âI rise to express my condolences, along with those of other members of this parliament, to members of the Catholic Church, particularly the Catholic constituents of my electorate of Hinkler and the Catholics of the diocese of Rockhamptonânotwithstanding the fact that I am a Catholic myself. I think John Paul IIâs passing will be one of the seminal events of this new century that we live in because of the profound effect he had on so many lives.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I wish to express my thanks for the life and work of John Paul II, Karol Wojtyla, who passed away on 2 April this year. He was truly a remarkable man. His 26-year papacy was marked by his drive to create a more inclusive churchâone that extended the hand of friendship to all faithsâand by his truly global appeal as a man of the masses. He made his first communion at the age of nine and was confirmed at 18. When the Nazi occupation of his native Poland occurred, he had to work in a quarry from 1940 to 1944. No doubt it was in this environment that he developed his love for the workers of the world and for the unionists whom he served so well. He then worked in the Solvay chemical factory, to earn a living and to avoid deportation to Germany. In 1942 he became aware of his calling to the priesthood and started courses in a clandestine seminary in Cracow.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">After the Second World War he continued his studies at the major seminary in Cracow, being ordained there on 1 November 1946. His work took him to Rome and during his vacations he exercised his pastoral ministry amongst young Polish immigrants in France, Belgium and Holland. In 1948 he returned to Poland and until 1951 he was vicar of various parishes in Cracow and chaplain for the university students. Then he again took up studies in philosophy and theology. This led, 10 years later, to his being appointed the auxiliary bishop of Cracow by Pope Pius XII. He was consecrated on 28 September 1958. On 13 January 1964 he was nominated Archbishop of Cracow by Pope Paul VI, who made him a cardinal on 26 June 1967. His was a truly remarkable rise. In 1978 he became the 263rd successor to St Peter and the first non-Italian pope since Hadrian VI in 1522.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">John Paul II has a special place in history. He made the worldâs business his business, especially in regard to human rights. Perhaps he will be best remembered for helping to deliver 400 million people from communist slavery. His profound effect on Eastern Europe was summarised by graffiti scrawled on one of the banners of the Polish communist state. The banner read, âThe party is for the people.â A courageous Pole had added to this banner, âBut the people are for the pope.â With his support of the free union movement Solidarity he not only created a new way of life for the working people of Poland and eventually all the people of Poland but also, through his influenceâprobably more than that of any other person in the 20th centuryâcontributed to the breaking down of communism in other countries. It was not long after communism fell in Poland that other communist states fell like dominoes across Eastern Europe, with East Germany and eventually Russia itself abandoning communism as a way of life.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As a young Pole, John Paul II saw the Holocaust up close, and he grasped its radical significance for the church. He went on to make it his goal to heal the rift with Judaism, and this became a key element of his 26-year papacy. He apologised, as one of the previous speakers said, for the sins the church had committed against the Jewish people. His outreach involved ridding Christian education material of any anti-Semitic themes, visiting synagogues, pointing to the Holocaust as a permanent point of moral reckoning and reaffirming the rights of Jews to be at home in Israelâwhich the Vatican formally recognised as a state in 1994.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">No other pope travelled so widely and encountered so many individuals as John Paul II. He was estimated to have effectively circled the globe 27 times to deliver his message during his pontificate, including two visits to Australia. I can remember being in the grandstands of the QEII stadium in Brisbane, not long after the Olympic Games, and the tremendous atmosphere there. There was an Anglican or Lutheran pastor in front of meâI could not quite tell. I could see that he and his wife were tremendously moved by the fact that the Pope had come to Brisbane.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">During his 1986 visit, the Pope visited every state and territory and attended 38 functions in just 6Â½ days. One of the major events during that visit was a mass at Flemington Racecourse. John Paul II spoke directly to the young people of Australia, saying:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Young people of Australia, I ask you: does your God have a part in your hopes and ambitions for the Australia of tomorrow? Do you dream of an Australia in which the poor and the downtrodden, the disadvantaged and the lonely, the spiritually blind and those struggling to make sense of their lives, will be sustained by the hands of a loving God? Do you realise that God has no other hands but yours to stretch out to those in need?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">What strong and lovely words to a young nation and to the young people of a young nation.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I remember his second visit to Australia, in 1995, when he came here to beatify Mother Mary MacKillop. I remember a parliamentary debate not unlike this one. One of the members opposite would probably remember it, as would you, Mr Deputy Speaker McMullan. I think it was the longest debate on a private memberâs business motion that we had ever had. Just about everyone in the parliament wanted to speak on it. It was about the beatification of Mary MacKillop. That was largely inspired and brought to its climax by the Popeâs visit to Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">While most of his predecessors rarely ventured beyond the walls of the Holy See, John Paul II took the Catholic Church on the road, ministering to millions of the faithful, who were quite ecstatic in his presence. Interestingly, I met him quite by chance at the Vatican. I was there at the end of a parliamentary delegation trip and was on a private visit on the way home. Australiaâs Deputy Ambassador to the Holy See was going to the Vatican that day and invited me to join him. The visit was very fulsome. The deputy ambassador took me through various parts of the Vatican. He showed me where the next consistory was going to be heldâthat new motel type facilityâand took me up to meet some of the staff of the secretariat of state. There were no official tickets. I just happened to be behind the official enclosure.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">When the Pope had finished blessing the sick and saying the prayers he delivered that day, he went along the steps of St Peter and was photographed with the various official groups that were there. I think there was a band from Austria, and the University of Rome were there. When he had finished, he was right at the edge of the steps of St Peter and he walked back down to a group of seminarians and across the enclosure where I was standing. I saw him look at his watch when I was about as far away as I am now from the opposition members. I said to my wife, âI think weâve missed out.â All of a sudden, he seemed to get another spurt of life and came down along the next row. That is how I met him.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">He certainly had an ecstatic presence; there is no doubt about that. In his travels around the world, he went to the church in Africa, Latin America and Asia, where the church was struggling in a different way from the West, where the church was struggling to maintain its flock and to maintain its focus on Christian values. He seemed to be able to stimulate each group in a different way.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Around 18 million pilgrims participated in his general audiences, and this figure does not take into account the other, special audiences and religious ceremonies which he held. John Paul II met numerous government personalities during his 38 official visits, 738 audiences and meetings with heads of state, and 246 audiences and meetings with prime ministersâan extraordinary record. His desire for closeness with people almost led to his death, as is well recorded. In 1981 he was shot and seriously wounded by a Turkish fanatic in St Peterâs Square, but, more to the point, he forgave this man and frequently visited him in prison.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The longevity of the Pope allowed him to appoint all but three of the 117 cardinals who were to choose his successor. The clarity that he left the church was, I think, an important feature in the quick decision of the cardinals to appoint Joseph Ratzinger as Benedict XVI. I, along with other members, extend my congratulations to Pope Benedict XVI.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Probably the greatest legacy of Pope John Paul IIâfrom my perspective, not from an international perspectiveâwas the fact that he was a champion for the light, for decency and for high moral values, particularly in the great moral dilemmas of our time. He certainly copped a lot of criticism for his view on contraception, yet it was not based so much on an ideological, Catholic Church position as a consistency of view regarding the preservation of life. It did not extend just to contraception; it was equally forceful in the case of abortion, euthanasia and, more recently, stem cell research. The Pope spoke with a clarity that sometimes not all Catholics liked to agree with, but I think that, grudgingly, they knew he was right. I think that is one of the reasons why he had such a profound effect: he never varied from the truth. The religions of the world get into trouble when they start to play with the truth, when they alter things at the margins. We have seen that happen with a number of Christian churches in recent times.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Pope John Paul II was the greatest pontiff of modern times. He was a warrior for freedom and human dignity and was a contemporary Catholic philosopher without peer. He was a pilgrim, a thinker and a man of peace. We were all diminished by his passing on 2 April but are the richer for his spirituality and his vision.</para>
